0,BK,"The Q1 earnings season is just around the corner and investors are eagerly awaiting the major bank results, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This somewhat reversed the rally experienced by bank stocks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports affected the stock market rally in the quarter.After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, as seen in both February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues, primarily for big banks.Notably, the first-quarter earnings are expected to report decent numbers as compared with the last quarter (impacted by huge one-time charges related to the tax law reform), with a rising interest-rate environment aiding net interest margins — the backbone for banks’ top-line growth.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending will likely energize interest income for banks. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans are predicted to improve slightly on a sequential basis in the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.Therefore, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance Sector'stotal earnings) are projected to witness 11.1% year-over-year jump in earnings in the quarter to be reported. This comes in higher than 2.7% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article.)The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could deal a blow to the banks.However, strong equity issuances globally might have got boosted from IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are projected to increase. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s in certain sectors will likely help banks garner advisory fees.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Expense reduction, which has helped banks to remain profitable, is not expected to be a major support, as banks have already slashed the majority of unnecessary expenses. While the absence of considerable legal expenses since the last few quarters is encouraging, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately.Selecting the WinnersWith the upcoming results likely to be impressive, there are a few major banks that are expected to stand out this earnings season. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist.

1,BK,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to loan growth. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank.Moreover, PNC Financial’s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues. Also, improved M&A and equity underwriting activities during the quarter are likely to drive fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.15 billion indicates a 6.8% year-over-year improvement.Before we discuss the factors that might impact PNC Financial’s first-quarter results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s fourth-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.1%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 32.7%, outperforming the 21.8% growth recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: PNC Financial might report higher interest income as the quarter continued to witness rise in interest rates and improvement in lending scenario. The U.S. consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2004 during the quarter along with the unemployment rate remaining at record low levels. Such factors are likely to have led to upbeat lending activities.Also, the company’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to expand with support from two rate hikes since December 2017. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, NIM is expected to expand 15 basis points to 2.92%, year over year.Notably, the consensus estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.34 billion, up 8.4% year over year.Controlled Expenses: The company has a cost-saving program in place for the year to keep expenses under control. Also, management expects non-interest expenses to be down by low-single digits on a sequential basis.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates. Per the consensus estimate, residential mortgage revenues are likely to decline 9.7% to $102 million in the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis.Non-Interest Income Might Rise: As the first quarter was decent in terms of investment banking and equity underwriting business due to higher volumes of M&As, the related fees are expected to increase marginally.However, debt underwriting activities during the quarter were not encouraging, so the related fees are likely to remain muted.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that PNC Financial will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Nevertheless, with earnings estimates for the first quarter been revised slightly upward over the last 30 days, the company is expected to witness 23.5% year-over-year earnings growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

2,BK,"After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, volatility is back in the market. This is expected to result in improvement in Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading revenues in first-quarter 2018. As trading revenues constitute an important part of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lead the company to report improved results on Apr 16.In the last two months of the first quarter, the markets experienced considerable volatility. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse. The trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility during the quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $4.64 billion reflects a jump of 36.8% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s Q1 results:Steady improvement in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in an increase in net interest income (NII).Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.96 trillion for the first quarter indicates a marginal sequential improvement. This, along with decent lending activities and higher interest rates, is projected to further boost BofA’s NII in the quarter.Management expects NII, in the first quarter, to benefit from the rate hike in December 2017. This is expected to be partially offset by two less days in the quarter (lowering NII by $175 million) and seasonal decline in card loans. On an FTE basis, NII is anticipated to decline nearly $120 million owing to the tax act.Investment banking performance to be muted: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees account for a major portion of total investment banking fees for BofA, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for BofA. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely lead to a slight rise in advisory revenues for the company.For BofA, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $5 billion reflects a marginal decline on a sequential basis.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this operation. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter as mortgage rates continued to move upward. As BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $8.91 billion shows a slight fall from the prior quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support in the to-be reported quarter. Further, as BofA continues to digitize banking operations and upgrade technology, related costs are expected to rise.But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall operating expenses are likely to remain relatively stable.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -0.31%.Zacks Rank: BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 59 cents reflects 43.9% growth on a year-over-year basis. Also, the consensus estimate for sales of $22.9 billion shows 3% rise from the prior-year quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few major bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements for an earnings beat this time around:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

5,BK,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 19, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, SunTrust’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. A stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. However, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) were the headwinds.SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.7%.However, the company’s activities in the fourth quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.05 witnessed a decline of approximately 1% over the last 7 days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 16.7%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.31 billion reflects an improvement of 7% from the prior-year quarter.The company’s price performance has also been impressive. Its shares have gained 22.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company manages to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high.

Price and EPS Surprise SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Remain Stable: The fourth quarter witnessed modest loan growth. However, the company projects NII to be relatively stable year over year because balance sheet growth will most likely be offset by pressure on net interest margin (NIM). The company expects the fourth quarter NIM to decline in the range of 1-3 basis points.Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: Refinancing activities increased during the quarter on the expectation of a higher interest rate environment. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Nonetheless, despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. Thus, the related fees are projected to increase for SunTrust. Along with this, a rise in investment banking activities in the quarter should provide some support to the overall fee income growth.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives of consolidating its branch networks are likely to translate into marginal expense reduction. Further, management expects overall expenses in 2017 to decline, given the low-cost employee benefits, along with the benefits of the company’s efficiency initiatives.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

6,BK,"After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, volatility seems to be back in the market. The expected rise in JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenues in first-quarter 2018 indicates the same. As trading revenues constitute a major part of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lead the company to report improved results on Apr 13.In the last two months of the first quarter, the markets experienced significant volatility. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse. The trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility during the quarter.At the annual Investors’ Day conference in late February, management projected first-quarter market revenues to rise mid to high single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis.Similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to render support to the total trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.85 billion reflects an increase of 15% from the year-ago quarter and 60.9% jump sequentially. Notably, per the consensus estimate, fixed income trading revenues will remain flat year over year but surge a whopping 91% from the prior quarter to $4.22 billion.Apart from this, here are the other factors that are anticipated to influence JPMorgan’s Q1 results:Steady increase in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in higher net interest income (NII).Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $2.21 trillion for the first quarter indicates an increase of 2.3% year over year and 1% sequentially. This, along with decent lending activities and higher interest rates, is further projected to boost the company’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.On a sequential basis, management expects NII to be slightly lower due to the impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and lower day count, partially offset by the benefits of higher rates and growth.Muted investment banking performance: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for JPMorgan. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely support the company in partially offsetting the lost revenues.Notably, the company expects investment banking income to remain stable or increase marginally year over year.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter. As JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact JPMorgan’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:JPMorgan does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.80%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

This is because, it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.07%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsBlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market, given its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company expects to witness positive active equity flows during the quarter as well. Thus, driven by steady inflows, AUM is likely to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.49 trillion, which reflects rise of 3.3%, sequentially.While higher AUM is expected to have a positive impact on investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, this effect is likely to be slightly offset by the muted market performance that was witnessed during the quarter. Thus, the investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 80% of the company’s total revenues, are likely to witness only a marginal improvement in the quarter.However, performance fees, which is another major revenue component is not expected to improve during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees for the first quarter is $65 million, which represents decline of 77.2% from the prior quarter.Notably, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, the restructuring of the traditional actively managed equities business, along with its plans for improving product offerings, is expected to lead to a further rise in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

9,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 18, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and assets under management (AUM) growth were offset by an increase in expenses.BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched once in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.4%.However, activities of the company in the fourth quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents has remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year growth of 18.2%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.98 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting an improvement of 5.1% year over year.Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteBNY Mellon’s shares have gained 13.7% in 2017, underperforming the 18.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Will the share price performance improve post Q4 earnings? To a great extent it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.16%.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsModest Improvement in Fee Revenues: The equity markets have performed decently in the fourth quarter. As a result, performance fee is expected to improve. Moreover, seasonally higher securities lending revenues during the quarter are likely to boost fee income growth.However, management projects Depositary Receipts revenues to decline nearly $80 million sequentially due to seasonality. While, lower DR revenues and expectation of a fall in foreign exchange trading revenues due to lower volumes might be offsetting factors, overall fee income is expected to improve during the quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of $3.10 billion reflects 5.4% year-over-year improvement.Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenues (NIR): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $290.3 billion reflects a marginal improvement from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, overall loan balances witnessed modest improvement in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances along with the effect of rising interest rates, BNY Mellon should register an increase in NIR.Moreover, management believes any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin. Hence, improving margins due to the increase in rates is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter. Notably, management expects NIR to be at the higher end of the 4-6% range in 2017.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Management expects legal and professional expenses to decline by nearly $10 million in fourth-quarter 2017. Despite the impact of investment-related expenses, overall costs are expected to decline.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corp. (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter results on Jan 18. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Associated Banc-Corp. (ASB  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Jan 25. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.64% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.T.

10,BK,"Of the two major pre-election promises made by President Donald Trump, his supporters are on a roll to ease some provisions of an important financial regulation — the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This follows the achievement of a major milestone in late 2017 in the form of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.The Senate passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 67 to 32, promising it to be beneficial for smaller banks. It would now be presented to the House for its requisite approval.Recapitulation of the Dodd-Frank ActAs a response to the 2008 financial crisis, caused partly by improper lending activities and investments by big banks, strict regulations were imposed on them through this law. Banks with assets of more than $50 billion were placed under stricter regulatory scrutiny, which included an annual stress test to prove that they could survive another financial meltdown.Further, a new regulatory board, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was established in order to safeguard consumers against predatory practices by companies offering mortgages, credit cards, student loans and payday loans.Such heightened regulations have kept compliance costs elevated for the banks so far. Also, higher capital requirements might have dampened investment to some extent. Moreover, some large institutions moved operations overseas to less regulated jurisdictions in order to avoid high regulatory costs.How Custody Banks Stand to Benefit From the Proposed Bill?The Dodd-Frank Act contained a provision that required banks to calculate supplementary leverage ratio, considering cash or customer deposits held with the Federal Reserve at the same level of risk as assets like subprime mortgages or junk bonds. It was aimed at keeping banks from taking big risks without proper plans to handle any downturn.However, this rule had a major adverse impact on the custody banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report). Custody banks safeguard assets and securities of large asset managers, hedge funds and other banks rather than conducting traditional banking activities. Despite sending these deposits to the Fed for safekeeping, these financial institutions had to factor them in while calculating the amount capital it requires to hold.The bill proposed by Senate makes an exception to this rule. It allows the custodian banks to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately sent to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, it would lead to a comparable reduction in the amount of capital they would require to hold.On the other hand, major banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) that perform custodial functions as part of their business have put forth objections. They want the exception to include all those banks that accept custodial deposits. However, this demand has some lawmakers worrying that these tweaks might be used by banks for their own purposes.Other Key Points in the Bank Deregulation BillThe most controversial change is uplifting of the SIFI threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion. This would result in a reduction in the number of banks considered “too big to fail” that are closely looked after by the Fed, to 12 from 38. Further, it frees banks with less than $10 billion in total assets from the Volcker rule. This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money.While some Democrats regard the bill to be compatible with the tax act, some consider it to be “extraordinarily dangerous”. Further, the bill along with the changes made so far have to be approved by the House and Senate once again, before being presented to the President.ConclusionWith this exemption, the custody banks will be able to utilize the excess capital toward expanding their businesses and diversify the product offerings. Also, shareholders of these banks might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.Of the above-mentioned companies, Citigroup and Northern Trust hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while JPMorgan, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

11,BK,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.6% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BK due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.BNY Mellon’s Q4 Earnings In Line, Expenses IncreaseBNY Mellon’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 91 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure reflects improvement of 18.2% from the prior-year quarter tally.The quarter witnessed improvement in net interest revenues along with provision benefits. Also, assets under management reflected growth. However, rise in expenses and lower fee income acted as headwinds.After taking into consideration net benefit of 41 cents per share related to the Tax Act and severance, litigation and other charges of 24 cents per share, net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter came in at $1.13 billion or $1.08 per share.For 2017, the company reported net income applicable to common shareholders of $3.92 billion or $3.72 per share, up from $3.43 billion or $3.15 per share registered in 2016. Revenues Decrease, Costs RiseTotal revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter decreased 2% year over year to $3.73 billion. The figure includes certain non-recurring items. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was $3.98 billion.Total revenues for 2017 were $15.54 billion, up from $15.24 billion registered in 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was $15.79 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, were $862 million for the quarter, up 2% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates, partly offset by a fall in average deposits and loans.However, net interest margin decreased 1 basis points year over year to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues decreased nearly 3% from the prior-year quarter to $2.86 billion. The fall was primarily due to lower distribution and servicing fees. Also, the company witnessed investment and other losses of $198 million in the quarter.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) came in at $2.87 billion, increasing 12% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, AUM was $1.9 trillion, up 15% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $33.3 trillion were up 11% year over year. Higher market values, favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business largely drove the increase.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Dec 31, 2017, non-performing assets came in at $90 million, down from $107 million registered in the prior-year quarter end. Also, allowance for loan losses decreased 5.9% year over year to $159 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million compared with provision of $7 million in the year-ago quarter.Capital PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.5% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.6%, in line with the Dec 31, 2016 figure.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 12 million shares for $651 million.OutlookManagement is of the opinion that a rising rate scenario along with the repositioning of the small securities portfolio will positively impact margins as well as NIR. As a result, higher NIM and NIR will more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet (if non-interest bearing deposits contract as expected).The company expects to continue to deliver positive operating leverage in 2018.The company expects investment and other income to be in the range of $40-$60 million in the quarters ahead in 2018. In the first-quarter, however, it is expected to tend towards the higher end of this range as a result of the gain on the sale of CenterSquare.Similar to the fourth-quarter of 2017, the company expects to incur some additional severance, real estate and other charges in 2018.Considering the company’s revenue growth model along with its expectation that all other non-technology expenses would grow at a very low rate, EPS is expected to grow in the low to mid-double digits range in 2018.The company expects to spend $250 million as investment-related expense in 2018. This is over and above the $2 billion base amount.Moreover, the effective tax rate is anticipated to be around 21% for 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and Consensus Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and Consensus | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, BK has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with an F.

12,BK,"No one person’s commentary about the stock market commands quite as much attention as that of Warren Buffett. Of course, the “Oracle of Omaha” has certainly earned that level of respect, amassing billions of dollars over decades of meticulous investing. But this also means that when Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) reports its latest holdings, investors often move quickly to copy its recent moves.Berkshire filed its 13F for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, providing the would-be Buffetts of the world with an update on the conglomerate’s latest adjustments and giving Wall Street the closest thing to a look inside the mind of the billionaire investor that it could possibly have.Berkshire Hathaway’s U.S. long stock portfolio holds positions in 45 individual stocks, with the five-largest of those positions accounting for roughly 62% of its total value. Some of the company’s larger stakes include Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of American (BAC  -  Free Report), and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).During the fourth quarter, the portfolio’s value increased about 8%, reaching a whopping $191 billion on the back of one major new addition and several position increases. Should you be following in Buffett’s footsteps by buying the same stocks? Let’s take a closer look.Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Apple by about 23% during the quarter. The technology behemoth is now the portfolio’s largest holding at 14.63% of its total value. Berkshire first purchased AAPL in Jan. 2016, and when asked to explain the move at the time, Buffet responded by simply saying, “Because I liked it.”Apple is currently holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has been hammered by the recent market sell-off, which occurred just days after the company reported disappointing iPhone sales during the holiday quarter. Nevertheless, the stock is sporting a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and the fact that it presents such a rare value opportunity in the tech sector probably explains Buffett’s position.Shares of Apple are trading at just 15x forward earnings, coming in slightly below the market-wide average. Meanwhile, the stock has a PEG of 1.26, so investors are getting a decent price for its growth aspirations as well. Apple’s P/S of 3.55 is a bit stretched, but the company remains a cash cow and is generating more than $11.30 in cash per share right now, significantly outpacing its industry peers.Apple remains a strong buy-and-hold option for investors focusing on financial security and value. The firm’s dominant grip on the consumer tech industry might be slipping a bit, but Apple should remain a titan for years to come.Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report)Buffett and Berkshire took the bulk of their position in BNY Mellon during the second quarter of 2012. Since then, the size of the holding has fluctuated a bit, including several small decreases in 2015 and two 50% increases in 2017. The conglomerate also upped its stake in BK by about 20% during the fourth quarter, buying a number of shares between $51 and $55.BNY Mellon has performed basically in line with the market over the past year, moving a respectable 18% higher over that time. The stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has an overall VGM grade of “D.”Investors should not expect explosive earnings growth or consistent market-beating returns from BNY Mellon. But the stock is probably a decent option for investors looking to diversify their financial holdings with a sound asset servicing company.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA  -  Free Report)Berkshire surprised many investors with the revelation that it had taken a new stake in this struggling drugmaker during the fourth quarter. Its position is relatively small and accounts for just 0.9% of the portfolio’s value, but it led many on Wall Street to question whether Buffett could see something in the stock that others were missing.The generic drug giant has faced significant headwinds lately, due in large part to lower U.S. generic drug prices and increased competition—causing management to take out massive loans to protect from its shrinking profit margins.Berkshire could be well positioned to benefit from the company’s planned turnaround, but investors should note that Teva is currently holding a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Nevertheless, the Zacks Rank is only a one-to-three month indicator, and we know that Buffett likes to buy and hold his stocks well beyond that. Teva might be risky right now, but if the company can solve its debt crisis, it could bounce back over the next few years.Want more analysis from this author?

14,BK,"We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected. Underwriting fees jumped 42% in the quarter, somewhat offset by a lower fixed income segment. For full-year 2017, earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60 beat the Zacks consensus by 2 cents. For more on MS’s earnings, click here.KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, just met expectations of 36 cents per share on the bottom line while surpassing estimates for quarterly revenues to $1.61 billion from the $1.58 billion anticipated.

15,BK,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected improve from the year-ago quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.M&T Bank’s third-quarter 2017 results were hurt by lower trading and mortgage revenues along with higher expenses. The company also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors. However, a decline in provision for loan losses and strong capital position were the tailwinds.The bank has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Over the past year, shares of M&T Bank have gained 16.9%, underperforming 27% growth recorded by the industry.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M&T Bank’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Why a Positive Surprise Is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.45%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Notably, per the consensus estimate, M&T Bank’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 19.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.40.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer front. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost the company’s NII.Relatively Stable Fee Income: The investment banking business witnessed improvement in the quarter and trust income is expected to rise, thereby providing some support to overall fee income growth. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line.However, the overall volume of M&A has remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to decline slightly. Also, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment and hence revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last seven days.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

16,BK,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for KeyCorp. Rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on KeyCorp’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017. Further, the quarter witnessed growth in its consumer loan portfolio as a result of a rise in consumer confidence.Moreover, President Trump’s success with the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter and is likely to support KeyCorp’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.58 billion indicates a 1.9% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were among the positives. However, higher operating expenses were on the downside.Activities of KeyCorp during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 36 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 16.1%.Notably, KeyCorp’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17.8% in the past three months, outperforming the 13.8% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are dim. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.33%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly on the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $966 million, up 1.9% year over year. For 2017, management expects net interest income in the range of $3.8-$3.9 billion.Modest non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s fourth-quarter non-interest income will benefit from increasing investment banking income, primarily driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. Also, as the equity markets performed fairly well during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a rise.Nevertheless, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees is likely to be rather muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been constantly diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. As a result of this, we expect the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) to be manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally.Asset quality to worsen: As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $570 million and non-performing loans of $530 million, reflect a rise of 2.5% each from the last quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

17,BK,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) is likely to recognize a pre-tax gain of approximately $1 billion (around $650 million after-tax) in third-quarter 2017, from the partial sale of its stake in Vantiv Inc. .Notably, Fifth Third will be exercising its right to exchange 19.79 million of its Class B Units in Vantiv Holding, for 19.79 million shares of Vantiv’s Class A common stock. Further, Vantiv will buy back newly issued shares of Vantiv Class A common stock from Fifth Third at $64.04 per share.Notably, the share repurchase agreement will be executed on Vantiv, Inc., coming with the offer of acquiring Worldpay Group plc. However, the repurchase agreement will be terminated on non occurrence of such offer by Aug 31, 2017.Therefore, following these transactions, Fifth Third would hold around 8.6% of Vantiv’s equity through its ownership of about 15.25 million Class B units of Vantiv Holding, LLC. Moreover, on closing of the Worldpay acquisition, if it is at all executed, Fifth Third is expected to own about 4.9% of Vantiv’s equity.Exercise of warrants and sale of Vantiv stock highlights Fifth Third’s target of monetizing its remaining stake in Vantiv. In addition, this move will help Fifth Third in reducing volatility in earnings as it eradicates fair value adjustments associated with the warrants.On completion of the transactions, no director can be appointed by Fifth Third to Vantiv’s board of directors. Therefore, the remaining director of Fifth Third will resign.The Back StoryU.S.-based Vantiv – formerly known as Fifth Third Processing Solutions (FTPS) – is a payment processing company, dealing with more than 12.9 billion payment transactions, valued at $426 billion annually.Fifth Third had spun-off FTPS in 2009, following a joint venture which was initiated between Advent International and Fifth Third Bank, a subsidiary of Fifth Third. The company was named Vantiv in Jun 2011. Notably, Vantiv Inc. had opted for an initial public offering of Class A shares of the company. The offering was completed on Mar 21, 2012.Our ViewpointAny measures that would aid in optimizing the balance sheet and share buybacks are encouraging, and represent an efficient use of funds. Such initiatives would help create value for shareholders.Going forward, with a diversified traditional banking platform, Fifth Third remains well poised to benefit from a recovery in the economy of regions where it has a footprint. Additionally, the company’s efforts in reducing its non-performing assets and operating expenses will serve as growth catalysts. Further, we believe that its capital deployment activities will boost shareholders’ confidence. However, competitive pressures remain headwinds. Fifth Third currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s stock gained 3.6% over the past six months, underperforming 5.4% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Stocks to ConsiderWintrust Financial Corporation (WTFC  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 30 days.

18,BK,"Recently, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) announced that it entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to pay $108 million for a lawsuit settlement.Filed in 2006, the lawsuit claimed that some Veterans Administration (VA) Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loans (IRRRLs) originated by Wells Fargo should not have been eligible for VA guarantees on account of the fees charged to the borrowers. However, the bank had denied all allegations.In 2011, the bank had provided compensation to all veterans who received a VA IRRRL from Wells Fargo between Jan 20, 2004 and Oct 7, 2010.Per Tim Sloan, CEO of Wells Fargo, this settlement would allow the bank to look ahead and rebuild trust of shareholders. However, the bank’s troubles are unlikely to end soon.Wells Fargo’s structure, composition and practices are all under review and is expected to be completed in the third quarter.The bank is reviewing whether fees charged to extend the interest rate lock periods on residential mortgages and its practice of freezing deposit accounts for suspected fraud caused undue harm to customers.Last week, the bank disclosed that it charged about 570,000 auto borrowers for insurance they did not want. This resulted inabout 274,000 of them defaulting on loans. Further, it led to nearly 20,000 unjustified repossessions.The bank’s involvement in such legal proceedings are likely to keep hurting its reputation and lower investor confidence. Further, the legal costs are expected to remain on the higher side.Wells Fargo’s shares have lost 4.1% year to date, underperforming the 7.3% rally for the industry.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the financial space include Washington Federal, Inc.

19,BK,"People's United Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report), announced the completion of the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, Inc. The transaction is likely to be immediately accretive to the company’s earnings.The acquisition was announced in Jul 2017 under the terms that People's United would acquire about $730 million of net investment in leases and loans and retain almost $250 million of securitizations.On completion of the deal, total assets of People's United amount to about $4 billion, making it the 16th largest bank-owned equipment finance entity.Since 2002, the Philadelphia, PA based LEAF Commercial Capital has provided finance of about $5.8 billion to more than 243,000 customers. Also, it provides expertise and equipment finance solutions to a large number of vendors and end users. Further, LEAF Commercial Capital employs about 250 people with offices in Orange County, CA and Moberly, MO.Lately, People's United has been taking initiatives to expand its business and bolster fee income. In Apr 2017, the company acquired Suffolk Bancorp in a $391 million all-stock deal, with a view to fortify its footprint in the New York Metro region. Earlier, in Nov 2016, People's United had acquired Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion investment management firm.The company’s progress on the acquisition front reflects its capital and liquidity strength. Further, People’s United’s organic growth remains impressive. However, persistent pressure on margins despite rising rates and escalating expenses might restrict its bottom-line growth in the near term.Shares of People’s United have gained 17.5% over the last one year, underperforming the 25.3% rally of the industry.Currently, People’s United carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the financial space include The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) and Trustmark Corporation (TRMK  -  Free Report).

20,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. The figure also came 17% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Better-than-expected results were driven by higher revenues and benefit from provisions. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a slight rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $926 million, up 12% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenue (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $3.95 billion. Further, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was $838 million, up 7% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and lower premium amortization, partly offset by a fall in average interest-earning assets and higher average long-term debt.Additionally, net interest margin grew 18 basis points to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased 4% from the prior-year quarter to $3.12 billion. The rise was mainly driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) amounted to $2.59 billion, up 1% year over year. This reflects a rise in expenses in nearly all categories, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, sub-custodian costs and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, AUM was $1.77 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values and net inflows, partly offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $31.1 trillion were up 5% year over year. Higher market values largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing assets declined 6.5% year over year to $100 million. Further, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $7 million compared with benefit of $9 million in the year-ago quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 4% year over year to $164 million.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Jun 30, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.4% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.7%, up from 6.6% in the prior-quarter level.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 11 million shares for $506 million.Dividend HikeConcurrently, BNY Mellon announced quarterly dividend of 24 cents per share, representing 26% increase from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Aug 11 to shareholders on record as of Aug 1.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line. Further, its efficient expense management, strong global reach and gradually easing margin pressure are expected to support profitability in the long run.However, concentration risks arising from significant dependence on fee-based income along with regulatory restrictions remain matters of concern for the company in the near term.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

21,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, BNY Mellon’s adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A rise in revenues and provision benefits were offset by an increase in expenses and, lower foreign exchange and other trading revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents has remained stable over the last seven days in the absence of any estimate revisions.Also, BNY Mellon does not have a very impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered positive surprises in only two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.8%.Nevertheless, shares of the company has gained 12.6% year to date, outperforming the Zacks categorized Banks - Major Regional industry’s growth of 6%.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersBefore delving deeper into the factors that are likely to influence the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict if BNY Mellon will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for this to happen.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 84 cents is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsWe believe that the Mar 2017 rate hike should have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s margin in the second quarter. Moreover, management was of the opinion that any future rate hikes will lead to further improvement in margin. Based on this expectation, we believe the June rate hike to have a slight positive impact on margin in the quarter.The company believes that improving margins will more than offset the impact of reduced size of balance sheet, thus a modest increase in net interest revenue is expected in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company expects NIR to increase nearly 2–4% on a sequential basis.On the expense front, management expects legal and professional expenses to be slightly higher in the quarter due to ongoing compliance costs. However, total costs are expected to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

22,BK,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the market opens. The company’s tax equivalent net interest income (NII), one of the main sources of revenues, is expected to remain more or less stable sequentially.Even though, the fourth quarter witnessed an overall modest improvement in lending, per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loan growth has declined sequentially. Also, BB&T expects total loans, on an annualized basis, to decline sequentially, while core loan growth is anticipated to be in the range of only 2-4%.Moreover, despite a higher rate environment, the company projects core and GAAP NIM to be down 3-5 bps sequentially in the quarter on expectations of higher funding cost and asset mix change.Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for tax-equivalent NII of $1.68 billion for the fourth quarter shows marginal decline on a sequential basis. Also, management expects NII to remain stable from the prior quarter.Now, let’s check out other factors that might influence BB&T’s Q4 performance:Slightly Higher Non-Interest Income: Refinancing boom is nearing its end and higher interest rates are leading to reduced mortgage originations. This time seasonality also hurt mortgage banking revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $102 million reflects a decline of 10.5% sequentially.Also, despite rising deposit balances, the company is not expected to register a significant increase in service charge on deposits. The consensus estimate for service charge on deposits is $179 million, stable from the prior quarter.However, BB&T is expected to register higher insurance income in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance fees is $422 million, rising 6.3% from the prior quarter.Thus, overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a slight sequential rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.17 billion.Stable Expenses: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses in the fourth quarter to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality to support results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Also, management expects NCOs rates to remain in the range of 0.40-0.50%, up sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BB&T is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 79 cents, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 8.2%.

23,BK,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter and 2017 results, scheduled for Jan 18, are likely to witness a fall in trading income — one of the major revenue components. While this might majorly affect its earnings, an expected improvement in revenues from other segments, will likely offset the adverse impact to some extent.The decline in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results. But trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter.Several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.Also, similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be largely responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.12 billion reflects a decline of 3.9% sequentially and 23.6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.92 billion indicates a rise of 1.5% from the prior quarter. But the same is expected to fall 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, fourth-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $2.86 billion, down 1.8% from the last quarter and 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley’s fourth-quarter results:Underwriting fees to rise: Despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the world might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for Morgan Stanley. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $312 million reflects a surge of 38.7% from the prior-year quarter.Further, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley’s total underwriting fees, this will lead to strong gains. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $440 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.5%.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 14.4% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $752 million.Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. But overall loan demand remained weak — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. Therefore, NII is anticipated to witness slight growth.Advisory fees to show weakness: Slowdown in M&A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M&As announced in the fourth quarter will have an adverse effect on advisory fees. Thus, Morgan Stanley is not likely to be untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $573 million, down 8.8% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low. Notably, the company expects to lower its expenses by $1 billion in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: Following the passage of the tax act in December 2017, Morgan Stanley announced expectation of one-time charge of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter related to write-down of certain net deferred tax assets. However, this will partially be offset by nearly $160 million net discrete tax benefit, mainly related to “the remeasurement of reserves and related interest relating to the status of multi-year Internal Revenue Service tax examinations.”Therefore, the company is anticipated to record a net one-time charge of $1.25 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 77 cents reflects a 4.9% decline on a year-over-year basis. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $9.1 billion indicates 1.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

25,BK,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind. All these are expected to hurt banks’ revenue growth to some extent. With expense reduction not likely to be a major support, there is less chance of impressive growth in the banks’ bottom line.Nonetheless, the last five trading sessions witnessed streamlining efforts. Banks are continuing with such initiatives with an aim to focus on core operations and enhance profitability, going forward.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 7, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

26,BK,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BK due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.BNY Mellon's Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Expenses UpBNY Mellon’s first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.10 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Also, the figure reflects an improvement of 32.5% from the prior-year quarter.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues along with provision benefits. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter was $1.14 billion, up from $880 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter increased 9.9% year over year to $4.19 billion. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.05 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, were $925 million, up 15% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and deposits, partly offset by rise in average long-term debt.Also, net interest margin increased 9 basis points (bps) year over year to 1.23%.Total fee and other revenues increased 8.3% from the prior-year quarter to $3.27 billion. The rise was driven by an increase in investment services fees, investment management and performance fees, foreign exchange and other trading revenues, and investment and other income.Total non-interest expenses were $2.74 billion, increasing 3.7% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except professional, legal and other purchased services costs, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, AUM was $1.9 trillion, up nearly 8% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound), partly offset by the sale of CenterSquare Investment Management and some other changes.Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $33.5 trillion were up 9% year over year. Higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business largely drove the increase.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Mar 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $85 million, down from $107 million registered in the prior-year quarter end. Also, allowance for loan losses decreased 4.9% year over year to $156 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $5 million, unchanged year over year.Capital PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, common equity Tier 1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) was 11.7% compared with 11.5% as of Mar 31, 2017. Tier 1 Leverage ratio (Advanced approach) was 6.5%, up from 6.4% registered as of Mar 31, 2017.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 11 million shares for $644 million.OutlookManagement is of the opinion that a rising rate scenario along with the repositioning of the small securities portfolio will positively impact NIM as well as NIR. As a result, higher NIM and NIR will more than offset the reduced size of the balance sheet (if non-interest bearing deposits contract as expected).The company expects investment and other income to be in the range of $40-$60 million in the quarters ahead in 2018.The company expects to continue to deliver positive operating leverage in 2018.Similar to fourth quarter 2017, the company expects to incur some additional severance, real estate and other charges in 2018.The company expects to spend $250 million as investment-related expenses in 2018. This is over and above the $2 billion base amount.Considering the company’s revenue growth model along with its expectation that all other non-technology expenses would grow at a very low rate, management expects earnings to grow in the low to mid-double-digits range in 2018.Moreover, the effective tax rate is anticipated to be around 21% for 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and Consensus The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and Consensus | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, BK has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C.

27,BK,"Already grappling with legal issues, the Wall Street giant — Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) — has been slapped with another federal lawsuit. A federal lawsuit has been filed against the bank by San Antonio-based USAA, the big insurance company, for infringement on the latter’s patented technology.The lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court in Marshall, TX. USAA has accused the bank for violating four of its mobile remote deposit capture patents through which users were permitted to deposit checks using mobile devices.USAA demands fine for infringement damages, including interest and attorneys' fees.Story So FarFor the past year, USAA has been asking hundreds of financial institutions for licensing its RDC technology. Finally, it took the first legal action by filing the lawsuit against Wells Fargo. Per this suit, in August 2007, USAA had requested Wells Fargo to negotiate a licensing deal, which was ignored by the bank. Therefore, USAA demanded reinforcing of its patents, along with damages. Notably, the company holds about 50 patents associated with its mobile deposit of checks.“Wells Fargo is one of the biggest adopters of remote deposit capture,” said Nathan McKinley, USAA’s head of Corporate Development, which includes commercialization of the company’s intellectual property. “We believe they are leveraging the technology to improve their bottom line, and they failed to take a license,” McKinley noted.Per the lawsuit, 21 million active mobile-banking customers of Wells Fargo are accessing this technology, as of February.Spokesperson for Wells Fargo refrained from comments on the pending litigation.The lawsuit states its “improper for Wells Fargo to use, without permission, patented technologies that USAA has spent immense resources to invent, develop, implement and perfect.”The aforementioned mobile-deposit technology was initiated by USAA in 2009. “We developed mobile check deposit technology using our members’ money to help military families because their lifestyle often made getting to the bank difficult,” McKinley said. “We believe the industry has been able to save billions using our mobile check deposit technology. We also believe the industry is aware USAA developed it,” he further added.Bottom LineCurrently, Wells Fargo is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. It is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s performance over the past six months underlines investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 5.4%, significantly underperforming the industry’s marginal increase of 0.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days. Additionally, the stock gained nearly 5%, in six months’ time. It currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

28,BK,"Thursday, January 18, 2018We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected.

The company’s projected sales growth rate of 8.4% and 2.9% for 2018 and 2019, respectively, ensures continuation of the upward revenue trend.Earnings growth: BNY Mellon witnessed 11.6% rise in earnings per share in the last three to five years, significantly above the industry average of 5.3%. This earnings momentum will likely continue in the near term, as reflected by the company’s projected earnings growth of 18.6% for 2018 and 7.4% for 2019.Also, the company’s long-term (three to five years) estimated EPS growth rate of 7.8% promises rewards for investors.Further, BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history.

30,BK,"With a view to cut costs, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with Flagstar Bancorp (FBC  -  Free Report) to divest all of its branches in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. While the financial details were not disclosed, the deal is expected to close in the last quarter of 2018.The 52 branches in consideration, including four branches of Wisconsin, comprise about $2.3 billion in deposits. Also, 490 employees working across the branches will continue to work with Flagstar.Post this deal, Wells Fargo will cease to have retail banking presence in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. However, the bank will continue providing commercial banking, wealth management and retail brokerage services across the region.The transaction is in line with the Wall Street biggie’s target to reduce branches by about 800 by the end of 2020 to combat high legal expenses. Also, shift in preferences of consumers to online and mobile banking marks as another key reason behind the closures.Troubles for Wells Fargo had begun from its retail banking segment in September 2016, when its employees had opened unauthorized accounts on behalf of its clients to fulfil sales targets. Following this, scandals in different areas of business had come to light, which put Wells Fargo under strict supervision of regulators.In May 2018, Wells Fargo had disclosed an impressive cost-control plan to help it deal with persistent legal expenses. Also, the bank’s efforts to revamp its financial position supported by lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 8.2% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 1.3%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderNorthern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) current-year earnings estimates have been revised 4.7% upward over the last 60 days.

31,BK,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 17, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the consumer banking segment are anticipated to offset the slowdown in trading. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected to be $5.6 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the fourth quarter. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for a possible earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.13%. This is a significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank of 3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.23%. Notably, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.1% from the prior-year quarter to 87 cents.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsRise in net interest income (NII): Improvement in loan demand, particularly consumer loans, and rising interest rates during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII. Also, income from interest earning assets (average balance) are projected to rise nearly 1% to $421.3 billion.Non-Interest Income Likely to Improve:  Higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to have supported U.S. Bancorp’s fee income. Per the consensus estimate, trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 1.3% to $385 million on a sequential basis. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues by 6.2% sequentially to $327 million.Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $199 billion, down 6.6% sequentially.Expenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately. Also, there will be impact of the one-time charge that comes with the tax overhaul.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained unchanged at 87 cents over the last seven days.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Though the banks were able to surpass earnings estimates, the overall financial performance remained muted.Weakness in trading and investment banking as well as rise in credit costs hindered significant earnings improvement.

33,BK,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 16, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers and no provisions were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decline in trading revenues remained headwinds.The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.1%.However, activities of Schwab during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 41 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 19.6%.Additionally, the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter are projected to be $2.19 billion. The figure is expected to witness growth of 14.2% year over year.Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 40.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the 38.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteWill the stock’s rally continue post third-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +0.20%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently carries a Zacks Rank 3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsGrowth in Trading Revenue to Remain Muted: Owing to an unchanged monetary policy standpoint of the Fed, most part of the third quarter did not witness much volatility. Moreover, overall trading activities remained sluggish in the quarter in the absence of any tangible development on the reforms proposed by the Trump administration. However, Schwab opened 107,000 and 123,000 new brokerage accounts in July and August 2017, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Moreover, the company’s efforts to lower trading fees should have also helped add more brokerage accounts. Thus, the overall slump in trading revenues should not have affected Schwab much. Its trading revenues are expected to remain more or less stable.Asset Growth Should Boost Net Interest Revenue: Schwab witnessed a rise in average interest-earning assets in July and August on a year-over-year basis. This should get reflected in the company’s results for the quarter as well. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Decline in Fee Waivers: Following the rate hikes in December 2016 and March 2017, Schwab witnessed a 98% year-over-year decline in its fee waivers in the second quarter, which helped the company, earn more. Moreover, we believe that following the latest rate hike in June, the company should have been able to waive off all of its fees. This should further boost its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

34,BK,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 17, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers, no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds.Moreover, the company has a decent earnings surprise history as its earnings have not lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 2%.However, activities of Schwab during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 41 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13.9%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteNotably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 30.1% in 2017, outperforming the 19.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low.

However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAlthough, market volatility did not improve much in the fourth quarter when compared with the prior-year quarter, overall trading activities remained relatively decent. Moreover, Schwab opened 117,000 and 122,000 new brokerage accounts in October and November 2017, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the fourth quarter is 10,696, which is projected to witness year-over-year improvement of 5.3%.Thus, with the growth in brokerage accounts, trading revenues might have witnessed modest improvement in the quarter.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in October and November on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the quarter as well.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is $3.3 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18.2%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $220 billion, which is expected to grow 6.3% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is projected to be $2.23 billion. The figure is expected to witness growth of 12.9% year over year.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated since the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits cost, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the fourth quarter as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

35,BK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues and rise in assets under management (AUM).Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 3%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteBlackRock’s business activities and prospects have encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.99 has increased 1% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 16.5%.Strong fundamentals have helped shares of the company gain 40.2% in the past year, outperforming the 32.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the rally in share price continue post Q4 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on if the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q4 results, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.42%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Q4 ResultsWith its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs, BlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the quarter. Driven by steady inflows, the company’s AUM is likely to witness further improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.15 trillion, which reflects a rise of 19.5% year over year.As a result of higher AUM in the quarter, the company’s investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 85% of the total revenues, is also expected to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.04 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 5.2%.Moreover, since the New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically, the average fee rate is likely to rise on the back of higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions. Higher fee rate, coupled with growth in AUM will likely support performance fees growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fee for the fourth quarter is $149 million, which is expected to witness growth of 15.5% year over year.Improvement in two of the major revenue components will likely give a boost to total revenues as well. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is $3.32 billion, which reflects growth of 14.8% year over year.However, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, its plans of restructuring the traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings are expected to lead to a further increase in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

The top five U.S. hoarders are from the tech sector - Apple AAPL, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) - that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s. Drug makers like Amgen Inc. AMGN, Gilead Sciences GILD, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) also stash huge cash offshore and are likely to gain from tax repatriation policy. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Banking stocks could be the fairy lights on the tree that will light up on the dual tailwinds of rising rates and tax cuts. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, tax cuts will add 16% to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18% in 2019 while AB Bernstein sees earnings per share jumping 12-20% at large banks and 15-25% at mid-caps banks in 2018. While there are several choices, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and Industry Rank in the top 34%. The company is expected to generate double-digit earnings growth next year.Small cap stocks that pay the highest effective tax rate could be the sweet treats, as these will be the biggest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut. According to Thompson Reuters data, companies in the Russell 2000 pay a median effective tax rate of 31.9%, while larger multinationals in the S&P 500 pay 28% and 30 mega-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average pay 23.8%. Additionally, these tend to outperform in a rising rate environment. Given this, a spread of top-ranked stocks with 2018 double-digit earnings growth potential include Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD  -  Free Report), Farmers & Merchants Bancorp Inc. (FMAO  -  Free Report), Geopark Ltd GPRK and PetMed Express Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). All these stocks doubled this year.And voila, the tree is up!

39,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.10 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Also, the figure reflects an improvement of 32.5% from the prior-year quarter.Shares of the company have gained more than 3% in pre-market trading. It appears that investors are encouraged with growth in its net interest revenues as well as fee revenues. Nonetheless, the stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues along with provision benefits. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders for the quarter was $1.14 billion, up from $880 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (GAAP basis) for the quarter increased 9.9% year over year to $4.19 billion. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.05 billion.Net interest revenues, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, were $925 million, up 15% year over year.

The rise was driven by an increase in investment services fees, investment management and performance fees, foreign exchange and other trading revenues, and investment and other income.Total non-interest expenses were $2.74 billion, increasing 3.7% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except professional, legal and other purchased services costs, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, AUM was $1.9 trillion, up nearly 8% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound), partly offset by the sale of CenterSquare Investment Management and some other changes.Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $33.5 trillion were up 9% year over year. Higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business largely drove the increase.Credit Quality ImprovesAs of Mar 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $85 million, down from $107 million registered in the prior-year quarter end.

41,BK,"State Street (STT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 20. Its quarterly earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, a decline in trading servicing fees was on the downside.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.4%.Also, activities of the company during the first quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter moved nearly 1% upward to $1.58 over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents a year-over-year jump of 30.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.01 billion for the quarter, reflecting 8.3% year-over-year growth.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayHigher fee revenues to lend support: Driven by the benefits of the acquired GE Asset Management business, State Street’s management fees are likely to improve. Further, management fees as well as servicing fees are anticipated to witness modest increase, driven by decent equity markets performance, new business wins and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar during the first quarter.Also, significant market volatility is expected support trading revenues. Specifically, foreign exchange trading revenues are likely to improve, given the higher foreign exchange trading volumes and increased volatility.Additionally, with the expansion in the spread between three-month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate, along with an increase in trading volumes, securities lending revenues are expected to trend higher during the quarter. Thus, State Street’s fee revenues are expected to rise in the to-be-reported quarter.Stable net interest income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $190.3 billion for the quarter represents a decline of 13.2% year over year. Nonetheless, overall lending activities were decent during the first quarter. This, along with higher interest rates will likely boost State Street’s NII. However, lower interest earning assets are likely to offset this gain to some extent.Modest rise in operating expenses: State Street expects operating expenses to rise slightly as compensation benefit expenses will be seasonally higher in the quarter owing to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement eligible employees as well as payroll taxes.Moreover, the expense level will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients. Nonetheless, State Street Beacon expense savings will offset the rise to some extent during the first quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:State Street does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -0.37%.Zacks Rank: State Street has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

42,BK,"Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) can be a solid bet now, backed by sturdy wealth-management operations with diversified products and services. The company’s focus on initiating new business to tackle macroeconomic headwinds, and continued addition of institutional clients and assets is anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.Further, the recent interest rate hikes are likely to bring stability to top-line generation, which creates a buying opportunity for long-term horses. Though costs escalated on ongoing investments in technology, driving compensation and equipment and software expenses for Northern Trust, management is taking steps to tackle expense growth and reinstate operating leverage. This, in turn, is anticipated to make the growth path smoother.Therefore, it’s a good idea to add stocks with robust fundamentals and long-term growth opportunities to your portfolio, at the current level.With $129.7 billion in assets as of Mar 31, 2018, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s strengths include strong top-line growth, consistent earnings growth and steady capital-deployment activities.6 Reasons Why Northern Trust is a Must Buy  Revenue Growth: Northern Trust’s revenues reflected compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 7.1%, over the last five years (2013-2017), with the increasing trend continuing in the first quarter of 2018. This solid top-line growth was backed by the continued addition of new business, and institutional clients and assets, along with rising net interest income.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 11.82% (as against the industry average of about 4.62%) indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Earnings Per Share Strength: Northern Trust’s earnings per share witnessed a CAGR of 13.3%, over the last five years (2013-2017).The company’s earnings are expected to display an upswing in the near term as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 34.46%.

Notably, ROE is within the company’s target between 10% and 15%.Steady Capital Deployment: Northern Trust displayed its capital strength as it successfully cleared the 2017 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST).

43,BK,"Rising interest rates and modest growth in loans and deposits should drive further momentum in U.S. bank stocks, which have been grossly outperforming the broader market over the past two years. Particularly, the prospects for major regional banks look bright in the near term as their scale will help them benefit more from a steadily improving domestic economy and the impending easing of regulations.Moreover, continued efforts to restructure operations and improving asset quality and capital position should keep aiding profitability growth.However, the rising rate environment, which should continue driving interest income growth, will keep corporates away from debt and equity issuance and consequently result in dismal investment banking performance. Also, higher rates will make mortgage loans less affordable for borrowers, which will put some pressure on mortgage banking revenues.  Nevertheless, uncertainty-induced volatility might continue for some time, which will keep supporting trading business.Further, digitization of banking operations will result in more cross-selling opportunities. This, along with focus on core operations, should lead to improvement in operating efficiency and lend support to banks’ efforts to manage expenses. Also, easing of regulations and lower tax rates should aid bottom-line growth.Attractive Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past two years, it appears that the border economic recovery was in favor of the industry. Gradual improvement in operating environment and policy changes were the other factors encouraging investors to bet on major regional bank stocks.The Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry, which is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past two years.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 55.3%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector have rallied 33.8% and 29.8%, respectively.Two-Year Price Performance Major Regional Bank Stocks Trading at Slight DiscountDespite the outperformance of the industry in the past two years, the valuation doesn’t look too expensive. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.     This ratio essentially measures a bank's current market value relative to what it would be worth if all assets were sold, debt was paid and intangible assets were written off.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.40, which is slightly above the median level of 2.17, over the past two years. When compared with the highest level of 2.68 in that period, there is apparently some upside left.However, the space looks pretty cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 10.12 and the median level is 9.18.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance Sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 2.96 and the median level of 3.49 for the same period are above the Zacks Major Regional Banks Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)Outperformance May Continue Given the Improving Earnings OutlookExpectations of improving profitability with rising interest rates, a decent demand for loans and other strategic initiatives should help major regional bank stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to continue outperforming the broader market in the quarters ahead. Investors may consider the current price levels as good entry points, as there are convincing reasons to predict a decent upside in the near term.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the near-term performance of its stock.One can get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry of $4.55 per share implies a decent year-over-year improvement. Also, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has been favorable.Price and Consensus: Zacks Major Regional Banks industry Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are becoming more confident in this group’s earnings potential. The consensus EPS estimates for the current year have been revised 1.1% upward since Mar 31, 2018. Current Year EPS Estimate RevisionsZacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it at the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has remained in the top half of the rank list over the past eight weeks. Major Regional Banks Long-Term Growth Not Too ImpressiveWhile the near-term prospects look bright, long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimates for the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry doesn’t seem much impressive. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has increased modestly since beginning of 2018 and has remained stable for quite some time at current level of 8.45%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth RateSince the beginning of 2016, revenues have been improving, mainly driven by rising interest rates and economic improvement. The effect of higher interest rates on the bottom-line numbers is expected to gradually reduce.   Bottom LineThe effect of rising rates is expected to lessen in the long run and the operating backdrop may turn into a bit challenging one with easing of regulatory supervision. Also, the support banks receive from manageable expense levels at present might not continue as investments in technology and efforts to find new avenues will gradually increase expenses.However, major regional banks will likely continue benefiting from higher interest rates, favorable operating environment and improving economy in the near term. So, betting on this space could be rewarding. One should particularly consider betting on the major regional bank stocks that depict an improving earnings outlook.3 Regional Bank Stocks to Bet OnFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report): The stock of this Cincinnati, OH-based bank has gained 20% over the past year.

44,BK,"Merrill Lynch, the brokerage unit of Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), is reviewing its ban on commission on individual retirement accounts (IRAs) that was imposed in 2016. The decision follows the U.S. courts dismissing the Department of Labor’s (“DOL”) retirement savings rule.The announcement of re-evaluation, expected to be completed within 60 days, was made by Merrill Lynch’s top executive, Andy Sieg to the unit’s more than 14,000 financial advisers. The probable changes include relaxing limitations on stock and bond transactions, and private equity investments in IRAs.Further, the unit spokesman Matthew Card in a statement said, “Now that the regulatory environment has shifted, we’re taking a look at our policies, especially as they might affect policies and procedures for individual retirement accounts, to ensure we keep our clients’ best interest front and center.”The DOL’s fiduciary rule was intended to protect retirement savers from conflicted financial advice from brokers seeking commission income. However, it was overturned by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2018.Notably, Merrill Lynch had decided to ban commission on IRAs shortly after the DOL’s rule was passed. As part of its preparation, the unit launched a limited-purpose, commission-based IRA on its advisory platform for those investors who don’t require ongoing, annual management.Thus, for retirement clients with traditional brokerage accounts, this meant either moving to BofA’s less-expensive online brokerage service — Merrill Edge — converting to a fee-based accounts or leaving the unit.   With the unit being the lone brokerage firm to do so at that time, the ban resulted in many clients leaving. Now that Merrill Lynch is planning to re-evaluate its strategy, it may result in the return of some of those clients.Nonetheless, at present, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is in the middle of its own rulemaking process for financial advisors with an aim to keep the best interest of customers in mind while making investment recommendations for any type of accounts. The SEC is currently in the process of collecting public comments on the proposal.So, BofA is expected to keep this in mind while reviewing its decision on ban on commission-based IRAs.Shares of BofA have rallied 22.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.5%.BofA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked banks worth a look are Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.

46,BK,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 11, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.The company’s second-quarter earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were hurt by higher expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees. However, growth in assets under management (AUM) acted as a tailwind.Nevertheless, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Moreover, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates recently. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.58 for the just-concluded quarter has increased 1.1% over the last 30 days.Shares of the company have gained 21.7% so far this year, underperforming the 24.6% growth for the industry it belongs to. However, we believe the positive trend in estimate revisions will translate into a better price performance in the near term.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteBefore we discuss the driving factors in detail, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.40%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsBlackRock continues to dominate the ETF market with its continued investments in its U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs rather than alternative investments with an aim to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the quarter. This will likely further boost its AUM, which witnessed 16% year-over-year growth last quarter.The New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically. As a result, the average fee rate is likely to rise on the back of higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions.However, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, its plans of restructuring the traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings are expected to lead to a further increase in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 17.

47,BK,"The projected decline in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenue will likely deal a major blow to its third-quarter earnings given significant dependence of its top line on this source. But this might not lead the company to report dismal results on Oct 12. Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — particularly investment banking — may overshadow the trading gloom.The stock, which recently showed strength on investors’ optimism over potential tax reforms as well as the Fed’s plans to unwind its giant balance sheet and keep increasing interest rates, may not take a hit due to the damage caused by the slump in trading revenue. This is because the bad news has already been factored out.Moreover, though market volatility has not improved much since last quarter, the huge year-over-year decline in trading revenue — highest since 2011 — will primarily be attributable to comparison with a quarter, which had witnessed higher-than-usual volatility due to the Brexit aftermath and the impending U.S. presidential election.While the momentum in investment banking business is likely to continue, growth in commercial and industrial loans as well as consumer lending should lend support to revenues.However, we do not expect major support from lower expenses to the bottom line this time around, as JPMorgan doesn’t have enough scope to reduce expenses further. If fact, there were some legal expenses in the quarter.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has not been revised over the last seven days, the trend over the last 30 days depict pessimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 1.2% downward over the last 30 days to $1.67, with four out of eight estimates moving lower and one moving higher. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 5.6%.Decreasing earnings estimates increase the chance of a beat. However, our quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:JPMorgan doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.53%. Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, but this alone isn’t enough to increase the chance of an earnings beat.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and Consensus JPMorgan Chase & Co. Price and Consensus | JPMorgan Chase & Co. QuoteHere is what should be at play:Major slump in trading revenue: Third quarter appears to be more disappointing for JPMorgan in terms of trading business than the past several quarters, as indicated by CEO Jamie Dimon with his projection of about a 20% year-over-year decline in trading revenue. Similar to last quarter, a slump in fixed-income revenue is primarily responsible for this decline.While this decline is primarily attributable to higher-than-usual volatility in the year-ago quarter, trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter in the absence of any tangible development on the reforms proposed by the Trump administration and lesser geopolitical tensions. Also, an unchanged monetary policy standpoint of the Fed did not contribute to volatility for the major part of the quarter.Likely continuation of investment banking strength: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back of higher debt origination. As the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees, this has been leading to strong gains for JPMorgan and the other largest U.S. investment banks.On the other hand, with overall low volumes of M&A and equity issuance during the quarter, the related fees are expected to be lower for the largest U.S. investment banks. However, JPMorgan’s top ranking in this space is expected to be a saving grace.Some improvement in mortgage banking: Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment.Overall mortgage revenue might see some improvement, as fresh origination of loans was expected to increase during the quarter.However, unlike Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession. So, the contribution of mortgage revenue gains to total revenues will not be extraordinary.Betterment in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer — might perk up interest income.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction may not be a major support. JPMorgan was supposed to pay $4.6 million to the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) civil penalty fund, as it failed to provide accurate screening reports. However, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements that might impact the firm’s earnings unusually in the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements for an earnings beat this time around:Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), scheduled to report results on Oct 17, has an Earnings ESP of +1.16% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

48,BK,"UBS Group AG’s (UBS  -  Free Report) chief executive officer, Sergio Ermotti, in an interview with Bloomberg Magazine, said that the company could lay off close to 30,000 workers in the years to come. The workforce reduction would be primarily attributable to its technological advancement.According to Ermotti, the effect of technology will be a gradual process, and not a “Big Bang.” Regulations have witnessed a huge change in the last decade and technology is likely to impact the banking industry in a similar way over the next 10 years. While technological advancement will help in reducing costs, reinvestment of savings is mandatory to keep abreast with updated technology.Currently, this Swiss bank has 95,000 employees, including contractors. With the development of technology, 30% of the workforce is expected to reduce. However, the nature of work in which “human content” is critical, will be as valued as is now.Consultancy firm Accenture believes that Artificial Intelligence (AI), the technology behind driverless cars, drones and voice-recognition software, will become the primary way in which banks will interact with clients in the next three years. Blockchain is another innovation that is expected to revolutionize the industry in the coming years.UBS Group has always supported technological advancement. It is already working with nine other major banks including Deutsche Bank AG (DB  -  Free Report), Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) and Banco Santander, S.A.

49,BK,"With a view to bolster its operations, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) has expanded its asset management unit’s product offerings to include private credit for middle-market companies. The news was reported by Bloomberg.Brian Van Elslander, who previously was part of securities division at Wells Fargo, has been appointed to lead the business. Per Kristi Mitchem, CEO of Wells Fargo Asset Management (“WFAM”), debt offering to middle level corporate clients is a key strength for the bank. Through this expansion, Wells Fargo will able to better exploit its advantage and tap a larger share of middle-market corporate clients.With $497 billion assets under management as of Mar 31, 2018, WFAM remains focused on reinforcing its position as a diversified asset manager and drive solid growth. On its 2018 investor day, Wells Fargo mentioned plans to broaden its reach in multi-asset solutions, systematic along with alternatives and private markets.Since the outbreak of the fake account scandal in September 2016, several divisions of Wells Fargo have been closely scrutinized by regulators. Per the latest quarterly filing, the bank’s investment management segment is undergoing a review to assess whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers.Recently, Wells Fargo received the final approval for $142 million settlement to compensate customers harmed by the bank’s unauthorized account opening scandal. However, it still has to face a number pending legal proceedings, which might affect its financials.Nevertheless, Wells Fargo have been taking remedial measures and initiatives to stay afloat.

50,BK,"On Tuesday, U.S. banking regulators — the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (“FDIC”) — passed eight largest domestic banking organizations on their ""living wills"" after completing the evaluation of the resolution plans. These banks include Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report).However, both regulatory agencies have found some shortcomings in the plans of four banks out of the eight firms, which can be improved in the next resolution plan. These four globally important banks include BofA, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.""While significant progress has been made... there are inherent challenges and uncertainties associated with the resolution of a systemically important financial institution,"" the regulators noted.Notably, regulators demand improvement in four particular areas, including the management of derivatives, payment, clearing and settlement activities.Previously, in April 2016, resolution plans of five banks out of these eight were deficient, per the agencies.The plan, better known as “living will,” lays out the strategy for a company’s fast resolution under bankruptcy in the event of failure of the company or severe financial stress. Under provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the banks (with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more) are required to submit living wills. The main objective behind the submission of living will is to avoid re-run of the 2008 financial crisis and reduce risks of further bailouts.A systemic resolution, maximizing the sale value of a failed bank and minimizing creditor losses would help in efficient handling of bank failures. Moreover, the FDIC will have the power to liquidate a bank if its collapse knocks down the country’s financial stability.Notably, all eight firms require their next resolution plans to be submitted by July 1, 2019.Among these banks, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The regulators are working to improvise the resolution planning process. Therefore, it is expected that the submissions of annual resolution plan can be modified to once in two years in order to extend the time to prepare and review the plans.Bottom LineHypothetically, it is easy to say that resolution plans should be made in a way such that these do not adversely affect the overall financial system. However, in practice, it is difficult to mitigate the harm, as banks depend considerably on mutual businesses.Nevertheless, we believe ""Living Wills"" will help the regulators wind up banks, in case of failures, to some extent. Most importantly, the advance precautions will surely entail into lesser involvement of taxpayers’ money for bailing out troubled financial institutions.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

51,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is well poised for bottom-line growth based on its efficient cost-saving initiatives. However, significant dependence on fee-based income as a revenue source remains a concern.Recently, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points, which is likely to ease its margin pressure further and aid top-line growth. Notably, management expects net interest revenues to be up 4-6% in 2017.BNY Mellon’s non-interest expenses have declined over the last three years. The downward trend continued in the first three quarters of 2017 as well. Declining expenses are expected to keep supporting bottom-line growth in the near term.Moreover, given a solid capital position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, BNY Mellon’s high dependence on fee-based revenues (more than 79% as of Sep 30, 2017) makes us apprehensive. Such high reliability on fee income could alter the company’s financial position if there is any change in individual investment preferences or a slowdown in capital market activities.Currently, analysts maintain a neutral stance on BNY Mellon’s earnings growth potential. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has remained stable over the past 30 days.Shares of the company have gained 14.9% year to date, underperforming industry’s rally of 18.1%.BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Hancock Holding Company , Preferred Bank (PFBC  -  Free Report) and FS Bancorp (FSBW  -  Free Report).

52,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s (BK  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 94 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. The figure also came in 4.4% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Results benefitted from an improvement in both net interest revenues and fee revenues. Also, assets under management (AUM) reflected growth. However, a marginal rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $983 million, increasing nearly 1% year over year. Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenues (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 2.1% year over year to $4.01 billion. The figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $851 million, up 8% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates, partly offset by a fall in average deposits and loans.Additionally, net interest margin grew 10 basis points year over year to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter to $3.17 billion. The rise was primarily driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) came in at $2.60 billion, increasing 1% year over year. This reflects an increase in all expense components, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, bank assessment charges and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Sep 30, 2017, AUM was $1.82 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values, net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $32.2 trillion were up 6% year over year. Higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Sep 30, 2017, non-performing assets came in at $94 million, down from $109 million registered in the prior-year quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 8.8% year over year to $161 million. Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $6 million compared with $19 million in the year-ago quarter.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Sep 30, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.9% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.8%, up from 6.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 12 million shares for $650 million.Our ViewpointBNY Mellon’s restructuring initiatives and inorganic growth strategy will go a long way in supporting its bottom line.

54,BK,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the market opens. Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to improve year over year.Before we discuss the factors that could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 11.1% in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses was the undermining factor.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 4.87%. People's United Financial, Inc.

QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company declined slightly for the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018. Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United stock? This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the first quarter. Notably, our quantitative model does not conclusively predict likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that People's United does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is -0.27%.Zacks Rank: People's United carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to move up 36.4% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $394 million, up 18.2% year over year.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the quarter to be reported. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2018 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 4-6%, while deposits are projected to be up 3-5%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2018 NII’s growth in the range of 10-12% is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well. This is based on the expectation of net interest margin (NIM) in the range of 3.05-3.15%, on assumption of a 25-basis-point rate hike during the year.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. Additionally, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 3-5% in 2018, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the first quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to curb bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is +0.21% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

55,BK,"Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. Both revenues and earnings are estimated to rise year over year, with a likely earnings beat in the cards.Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last reported quarter.    This Birmingham, AL-based company’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings as well. Easing margin pressure and higher revenues were the positive factors. Moreover, credit quality recorded significant improvement. However, lower loans and deposits balance were the undermining factors. In addition, expenses escalated.Notably, post earnings, an appreciation in the company’s share price were recorded. For the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018, the stock gained around 7.5%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 31 cents over the last 60 days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of nearly 34.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.44 billion indicates around 5% growth from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Regions is expected to record marginal rise, on a sequential basis, in average interest-earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $109.5 billion.Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below: Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock? This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the first quarter. Notably, our quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that chances of Regions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is currently pegged at +1.21%.Zacks Rank: The combination of Regions’ Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the quarter to be reported. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2018 will likely be reflected in this quarter. The bank projects average loans to be up in low-single digits on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions is expected to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of the 2018 NII and other financing income to rise in the range of 3-5% are likely to show impact in the first quarter.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. Moreover, seasonally lower fee income might be experienced during the quarter. Nevertheless, adjusted non-interest income is estimated to improve 3-6% in 2018.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to decline 23.7% sequentially to $42.7 million, while commercial credit fee income is projected to increase slightly to $18.3 million.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Notably, the company is on track for a $400-million expense reduction by 2019. While investing in revenue-generating areas, the company intends to keep expenses stable. Notably, in the first quarter, seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is +0.21% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

56,BK,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Benefits of higher rates, improved lending scenario and rebound in trading activities are anticipated to offset muted investment banking performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $5.5 billion reflects a rise of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s fourth-quarter 2017 results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Also, a strong capital position and increasing loans were the positives. However, higher expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues were the key headwinds.Notably, the company displays a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 1.2%. U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the first quarter. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for a possible earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Bancorp is +0.96%.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 94 cents reflects growth of 14.6% year over year.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsRise in net interest income (NII): Improvement in loan demand, particularly in commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer areas, along with and rising interest rates during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII. Also, income from interest earning assets (average balance) are projected to rise 4.5% to $417.2 billion.Non-Interest Income Likely to Improve:  Strong equity issuances along with a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s are likely to have supported U.S. Bancorp’s fee income. Per the consensus estimate, trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 8.1% to $398 million on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues by 4.8% from year-ago quarter to $306 million.Nevertheless, with the slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $197 billion, down 4.8% year over year.Expenses Might Trend Higher: Increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings and seasonally higher compensation expenses might escalate costs moderately.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

57,BK,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), slated to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, is expected to show improvement in net interest income (NII), driven by higher interest rates. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans recorded solid growth year over year, even though the quarter witnessed a modest improvement in lending activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average total loans of $87.2 billion for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.3%. Driven by loan growth, earning assets are also likely to rise. The consensus estimate for average interest earning assets of $123.4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter indicates an increase of 3.1%.Thus, KeyCorp’s NII, one of the main revenue sources, is expected to support earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (tax equivalent basis) of $948 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Let’s check out other factors that are expected to influence KeyCorp’s Q1 performance:Muted non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s first-quarter non-interest income will benefit from rise in service charge on deposits as deposit balance is expected to improve in the quarter.However, given lower debt placement activities, investment banking fees are expected to fall. Also, as equity market performance was dismal during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a decline.Further, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees will likely be muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income growth is expected to be disappointing.Notably, management expects fee income to decline sequentially, given the seasonality in loan fees and corporate-owned life insurance as well as normalized levels of investment banking and debt placement fees.Fall in expenses to lend support: KeyCorp has been diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. Thus, the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) are expected to be manageable.Also, management will be realizing the majority of remaining $50 million cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal in the first quarter. In fact, KeyCorp anticipates operating expenses to decline sequentially.Asset quality to aid results: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $402 million indicates a plunge of 35.5% year over year. Likewise, the consensus estimate for non-performing loans of $339 million, reflects a decrease of 40.8% from the year-ago quarter.As KeyCorp is likely to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. But overall, this is expected to be manageable.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.95%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 38 cents, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 18.8%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.56 billion indicates 4.3% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few major bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

58,BK,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the market opens. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans recorded solid growth on a sequential basis, though the quarter witnessed an overall modest improvement in lending activities.In fact, BB&T expects total average loans, on an annualized basis, to grow 1-3% sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. Driven by loan growth, earning assets are likely to rise too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.96 trillion for the first quarter indicates an increase of 1.5% sequentially.Nonetheless, despite a higher rate environment, management expects GAAP net interest margin (NIM) to be down 1-3 basis points (bps) on a sequential basis. Notably, core NIM is expected to be stable, attributable to the adjustment on tax exempt assets from the new corporate tax rate change.Thus, BB&T’s net interest income (NII), one of the primary sources of revenues, is not likely to aid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.62 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 1.6% decline on a sequential basis.Now, let’s check out other factors that are likely to influence BB&T’s Q1 performance:Dismal fee income performance: Refinancing boom is nearing its end and higher interest rates are leading to a decline in mortgage originations. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $94 million reflects a fall of 9.6% sequentially.Also, despite rising deposit balances, the company is not expected to register an increase in service charge on deposits. Notably, the consensus estimate for service charge on deposits is $173 million, down 5.5% from the prior quarter.However, BB&T is expected to register higher insurance income in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for insurance fees of $462 million reflects 10.5% increase from the prior quarter.Overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a 2.4% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.20 billion.Stable expenses: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses in the first quarter to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality is not of much support: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Further, management expects NCOs rates to increase sequentially and be in the range of 35-45 bps on the assumption of no deterioration in the economy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing assets of $634 million for the to-be-reported quarter shows 1.1% increase on a sequential basis.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high.

59,BK,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, slated for Wednesday, Apr 18, are likely to witness a rebound in trading income, one of the major revenue components. This will have a positive impact on its earnings, which is expected to be slightly hit by muted investment banking performance.After three consecutive quarters of muted activities, the markets witnessed significant volatility and revival of client activities in the last two months of the first quarter. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse.Last year, trading activities remained weak despite several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and absence of significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration. Subdued inflation in the United States and modest rise in long-term interest rates were concerns. These factors resulted in lower fixed income trading while equity trading didn’t fare better either.Nonetheless, concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility during the first quarter.Notably, equity trading revenues are expected to witness substantial growth in the to-be-reported quarter compared with fixed income trading revenues as Morgan Stanley had divested fixed income trading operations over the last few years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $2.14 billion reflects a rise of 6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.70 billion indicates a decline of nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter.Overall, first-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $3.78 billion, up 8.2% year over year.Here are the other factors that are expected to influence Morgan Stanley’s first-quarter results:Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. Also, overall loan demand was decent — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. So, NII is anticipated to witness a modest improvement.A slight fall in underwriting fees: Unlike prior quarters, growth in underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, is expected to be muted. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances. As debt origination fees account for more than 50% of total underwriting fees for Morgan Stanley, this will likely have an adverse impact on overall underwriting fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $520 million reflects a year-over-year fall of 2.1%.Further, high volatility in the equity markets across the globe is expected to have somewhat slowed down equity issuances. While fourth-quarter 2017 was an exception, IPOs and follow-on offerings in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to be modest. Thus, equity underwriting fees are anticipated to remain stable or improve marginally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $381 million reflects a decrease of 2.3% from the prior-year quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 2.1% year-over-year decline as the consensus estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $901 million.Advisory fees to show weakness: M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally witnessed a fall in the first quarter, though the overall deal value recorded a significant rise. Thus, as number of deals declined, advisory fees are expected to be adversely impacted to some extent. So, Morgan Stanley is not likely to remain untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $476 million, down 4% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Nevertheless, as revenues are expected to rise, compensation expenses will likely witness a slight increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:We cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Morgan Stanley this time. This is because the stock does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.28 cents reflects a 28% jump on a year-over-year basis. Also, the consensus estimate for sales of $10.5 billion indicates 7.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 17.

60,BK,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 19. While the company’s asset under management (AUM) growth is expected to remain strong in the quarter, its revenues and earnings are projected to decline on a year-over-year basis.Last quarter, the company’s economic net income surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and growth in AUM were partially offset by rise in expenses.Notably, Blackstone boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.2%.The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise  The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise | The Blackstone Group L.P. QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 76 cents remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects a year-over-year decline of 7.3%.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.69 billion for the quarter also reflects a decline of 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Also, the company’s price performance does not seem very impressive. Its shares have gained only 5% in the past year, underperforming the 14.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings release? Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Blackstone will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Blackstone is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Blackstone has a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsDriven by net inflows, the company’s fee-earning AUM and total AUM have been witnessing consistent growth since the past few years. In fact, with improvement in the overall economic scenario, Blackstone’s fund-raising ability is likely to continue aiding the uptrend in its fee-earning AUM and total AUM in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee-earning AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $341 billion, which reflects an improvement of 1.8% sequentially. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM of $450 billion depicts 3.7% growth from the prior quarter and 22.3% growth year over year.Given the growth in assets, the company’s performance fee is also expected to be positively impacted in the quarter.However, because of rise in compensation and benefit costs, the company’s overall expenses have remained elevated in the past few years. Moreover, as its well-performing funds require more headcount, expenses are likely to increase further during the quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

61,BK,"Considering how many game-changing headlines we’ve seen so far in 2018 — from inflation/interest rate fears to geopolitical hornets nests to Washington DC soap operas — this has been a welcome week for the stock markets. Just think if we’d have had some seasonably appropriate weather — we’d be on Cloud 9 right now! And this relative calm in a sea of turbulence continues ahead of the opening bell this morning, with Initial Jobless Claims and new Q1 earnings results hitting the tape.Initial Jobless Claims remained steady at 232K last week, 1000 claims fewer than the previous week and remaining solidly within the long-term range of 225K-250K which is illustrative of a very strong (and continually tightening) labor market. Aside from dips below even these very robust figures a month or so ago, and spikes into higher jobless claims territory for a short time following last summer’s massive hurricanes, we have enjoyed an historically strong and steady U.S. employment situation for several years now. Continuing claims reached 1.863 million in the week, another very healthy sign.Q1 earnings results continue strong and steady, as well.

62,BK,"Thursday, April 19, 2018Considering how many game-changing headlines we’ve seen so far in 2018 — from inflation/interest rate fears to geopolitical hornets nests to Washington DC soap operas — this has been a welcome week for the stock markets. Just think if we’d have had some seasonably appropriate weather — we’d be on Cloud 9 right now! And this relative calm in a sea of turbulence continues ahead of the opening bell this morning, with Initial Jobless Claims and new Q1 earnings results hitting the tape.Initial Jobless Claims remained steady at 232K last week, 1000 claims fewer than the previous week and remaining solidly within the long-term range of 225K-250K which is illustrative of a very strong (and continually tightening) labor market. Aside from dips below even these very robust figures a month or so ago, and spikes into higher jobless claims territory for a short time following last summer’s massive hurricanes, we have enjoyed an historically strong and steady U.S. employment situation for several years now. Continuing claims reached 1.863 million in the week, another very healthy sign.Q1 earnings results continue strong and steady, as well. While we’re not seeing any of the biggest companies on Wall Street reporting today, such as the FANG stocks (most of which start next week; Netflix posted positive surprises Monday), we do have a number of companies that have registered new figures, and almost all better than expected:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated W.W.

63,BK,"LendingTree (TREE  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has closed the deal to acquire Ovation Credit Services through its subsidiary, LendingTree, LLC. The companies had entered into agreement on May 11, 2018, for a total consideration of $20.75 million.Ovation Credit Services is a leading provider of credit repair process through its proprietary software application that is integrated directly with certain credit bureaus. Also, the company provides education to consumers on credit improvement.Upon successfully acquiring Ovation Credit Services, Doug Lebda, founder and CEO of LendingTree said, ""As a respected provider of credit services with strong industry relationships and unparalleled customer service, Ovation Credit Services will further expand our capabilities in helping consumers improve their financial health.""Backed by its strong capital position, LendingTree has been focused on diversifying its business and revenue sources through buyouts.

Moreover, in June 2017, the company acquired assets of DepositAccounts.com, a leading consumer-facing media property in the depository industry, for a purchase consideration of $33 million.With these acquisitions, LendingTree has been successful in expanding non-mortgage product offerings that have resulted in a solid boost to its revenues.

65,BK,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, SunTrust’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefitted from an improvement in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. Also, lower provision for credit losses was a positive.Moreover, SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.3%.However, the company’s activities in the third quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.06 remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 16.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.29 billion reflects an improvement of 4.2% from the prior-year quarter.The company’s price performance has not been that impressive. Its shares have gained 7.9% year to date, underperforming the industry’s growth of 9.6%.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteWill the price performance improve post Q3 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company manages to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are bleak. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is -0.18%.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The third quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates should boost the company’s NII in the quarter.Moreover, the company expects net interest margin in the quarter to range from 3.14-3.16%, up from 2.96% in the prior-year quarter. Thus, higher NIM should further boost the company’s NII.Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenue is not expected to witness much improvement.Nevertheless, given that the overall equity markets witnessed some improvement in the quarter, trust income is expected to rise. Along with this, a rise in investment banking activities in the quarter should provide some support to overall fee income growth.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives of consolidating its branch networks should translate into marginal expense reduction.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Oct 26. It has an earnings ESP of +0.65% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

66,BK,"Earnings season for banks has already begun and the results released so far by the big names reflect a decent performance. The results till now indicate higher revenues supported by improved loan balances, hike in interest rates and rebound in trading activities. However, lower mortgage income and dismal investment banking performance adversely impacted fee income to some extent.On the cost front, the chance of a significant rise in expenses is low, though a marginal increase in expenses is expected to occur owing to efforts to digitize operations and investment in franchise. Notably, lower tax rates are projected to boost earnings.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in the first quarter are projected to jump 19.2% year over year. This compares favorably with prior quarter’s earnings growth of 2.7%.Therefore, this seems to be the right time to add a few bank stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Let’s check the factors that are likely to influence the following major banks slated to report first-quarter results on Apr 19, before the opening bell.KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) earnings and revenues are expected to improve in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 38 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of 18.8%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.56 billion indicates 4.1% growth from the prior-year quarter.Driven by loan growth and higher interest rates, the bank’s interest income will likely increase. The consensus estimate for net interest income (NII) (tax equivalent basis) of $948 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 2% increase on a year-over-year basis.On the other hand, fee income growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is likely to be muted due to expectations of lower mortgage banking fees, trust and investment services income, and investment banking fees. (Read more: Will Loan Growth, Lower Costs Aid KeyCorp Q1 Earnings?)KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteAnother major bank, BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is expected to report a marginal decline in NII owing to lower net interest margin expectation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.62 billion for the to-be-reported quarter shows 1.6% decline on a sequential basis.Fee income performance is likely to be disappointing as well with rise in insurance fees providing some relief. Total non-interest income is projected to witness a 2.4% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is $1.20 billion. (Read more: Can Loan Growth & Insurance Fees Aid BB&T Q1 Earnings?)Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 92 cents, which reflects year-over-year rise of 24.3%.

67,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A rise in revenues and provision benefits were offset by an increase in expenses.BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched once in the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 4.8%.Moreover, activities of the company in the third quarter have encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents has increased 1.1% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year growth of 2.8%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting an improvement of 1.4% year over year.Also, BNY Mellon’s price performance seems impressive. Its shares have gained 15.5% so far this year, outperforming the 8.7% growth of the industry it belongs to.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteWill the rally in share price continue post Q3 earnings? To a large extent it depends on whether the company will be able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.08%.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsModest Improvement in Fee Revenue: The equity markets have performed decently in the third quarter. As a result, performance fee is expected to improve. Moreover, Depositary Receipts revenues witnessed a slight seasonal boost during the quarter. Although, a stronger U.S. dollar and seasonally lower securities lending revenues can be offsetting factors, overall fee revenues should improve during the quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of $3.13 billion reflects a marginal year-over-year improvement.Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenue (NIR): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $293 billion reflects a 1.2% decline from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances along with the effect of rising interest rates, BNY Mellon should record an increase in NIR.Moreover, management believes any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin. Hence, improving margins due to the June rate hike is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Management expects legal and professional expenses to decline by nearly $10 million in third-quarter 2017. Despite the impact of investment-related expenses, overall costs are expected to decline.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.SLM Corporation (SLM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

68,BK,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled on Oct 19, are expected to show a decline in net interest income (NII). While this could majorly affect its earnings, an improvement in revenues from other segments should offset the adverse impact on earnings.On a sequential basis, the quarter witnessed steady deceleration in home equity loan portfolio, while demand for commercial and industrial, and consumer loans rose. This is expected to lead to a rise in KeyCorp’s loan balance during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average loans of $87.3 billion reflects nearly 1% increase from the prior quarter.Further, KeyCorp is projected to record a 1.3% rise in average earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $121.3 billion.Despite these positive factors, KeyCorp is expected to witness a fall in NII owing to flatter yield curve for the major part of the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (tax equivalent basis) of $963 million shows a 2.4% decline on a sequential basis.Other Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsModest non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s third-quarter non-interest income will be positively impacted by increasing investment banking income, mainly driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. Also, trust and investment services income is anticipated to have risen as the performance of equity markets was relatively decent during the quarter.However, growth in mortgage banking fees is expected to be relatively muted during the quarter owing to lower mortgage originations. Therefore, non-interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been consistently streamlining operations, diversifying products and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. This is expected to keep overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally.Asset quality to worsen: As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $602 million shows 8.3% increase from the last quarter. Also, non-performing loans is projected to be $560 million, a rise of 10.5% sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict that KeyCorp will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it does not have right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.22%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has remained stable over the last 30 days at 35 cents, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 16.9%.

69,BK,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, slated on Thursday, Oct 19, are expected to witness a slight rise in tax equivalent net interest income (NII). This, in turn, will support the company’s revenues and bottom line.Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during quarter will support NII. On an annualized basis, BB&T expects total loans to grow 1-3% sequentially while core loan growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5-7%.Further, BB&T expects to record stable core net interest margin (NIM). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIM of 3.46% reflects 1 basis point fall from the prior quarter. This is likely to be attributable to higher interest rates, which will be more than offset by marginally lower average interest earning assets (the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets is $193.3 billion).Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.68 billion shows marginal growth on a sequential basis. On the other hand, management expects NII to remain stable from the prior quarter.Now, let’s check out a few other factors that might influence BB&T’s Q3 performance:Lower non-interest income: BB&T has been witnessing continuous fall in mortgage banking fees as higher interest rates are leading to lower mortgage originations. However, an expected higher rate environment might have led to rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping the company record some mortgage revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $106 million shows a jump of 12.8% sequentially.Further, as deposit balance rises, the company will record an increase in service charge on deposits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for service charge on deposits of $179 million reflects a rise of 1.7% from the last quarter.However, BB&T is expected to record lower insurance income as hurricanes hit the U.S coast during the latter half of the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance fees is $417 million, plunging 13.3% from the prior quarter.Overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a 3.4% sequential fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.18 billion while management projects the same to grow 1-3% year over year.Expenses might increase modestly: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses to remain flat or increase 2% on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality to support results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Also, management expects NCOs rates to remain in the range of 0.35-0.45%.Non-performing asset (NPAs) levels will likely remain stable with the prior quarter. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NPAs is $690 million, stable sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BB&T is +0.43%.Zacks Rank: BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 1.3% downward over the last 60 days to 78 cents, with four out of 12 estimates moving lower. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 2.2%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.84 billion indicates 2.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 18.

70,BK,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 18, are expected to reflect a rise in C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees — one of the major revenue components.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through its C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing fees of $493 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 9.3%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets were relatively decent in the second quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s Q3 performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earnings assets of $111.5 billion reflects a marginal decline from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust should record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Rise Modestly: Given the increase in overall foreign exchange (“FX”) trading volatility, as well as higher volumes in the third quarter, the company’s revenues from FX trading will likely increase for the quarter.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Despite some cost-saving initiatives, Northern Trust’s continued investments in new business activities may lead to a slight increase in expenses.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Northern Trust will be able to beat earnings estimates in the third quarter. This is because it does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Northern Trust is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Northern Trust carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Moreover, activities of the company during the third quarter were unable to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.12 remained stable in the last seven days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 3.6%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.35 billion reflects an improvement of 11.2% from the prior year quarter.Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

71,BK,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to show improvement from the year-ago quarter.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings. Results benefitted from an improvement in revenues. However, deteriorating credit quality was a major headwind.Also, M&T Bank has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.7%.However, activities of the company in the third quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.40 has remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 12.8%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.43 billion reflects an improvement of 5.7% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s strong fundamentals have helped its shares gain 43.2% in the past year, outperforming the 38.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill this price performance continue post Q3 earnings? Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients – positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The third quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly, in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates should boost the company’s NII in the quarter.Relatively Stable Fee Income: Since the overall volume of M&A and equity issuance has remained low during the quarter, the related fees are expected to decline slightly. Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenue is not expected to witness much improvement.Nevertheless, as the overall equity markets witnessed some improvement in the quarter, trust income is expected to rise, thereby providing some support to overall fee income growth.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

72,BK,"In order to compete with the startup lenders, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) is mulling over ideas to simplify the credit and debit card pricing method for small companies. The news was reported by Bloomberg.The changes to be made are related to small business that process nearly $100,000 per year and deal with a complex pricing policy that require them to enter lengthy contracts and go through confusing rate tables. Also, the prices charged vary from customer to customer.Pressure has been created on traditional banks by startups like Square and Stripe that are consistently capturing the market on the back of their simple pricing method and technology. Wells Fargo has planned to introduce digital modes of applying for payment-processing capabilities for its customers.Danny Peltz, head of treasury management and merchant services at Wells Fargo said, “This industry is going through some structural changes -- not withstanding anything that’s happening at the bank -- and that’s driving our decision-making more so than anything else.”Recently, the bank was charged with yet another lawsuit. A federal lawsuit was filed against the bank by San Antonio-based USAA, a big insurance company, for infringement of the latter’s patented technology.USAA has alleged Wells Fargo of violating four of its mobile remote deposit capture patents through which users were permitted to deposit checks using mobile devices.Since revelation of the bogus account openings scandal, Wells Fargo has been hit with a number of probes. These legal hassles are likely to keep its cost base elevated. However, the bank has diligently been taking remedial measures and initiatives to stay afloat. Also, lower tax rates and rising rate environment might help it overcome the negatives.Shares of Wells Fargo have lost 6.5% over the past six months versus the industry’s growth of nearly 1%.Wells Fargo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderFifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has witnessed 6.4% upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

73,BK,"The Federal Reserve is set to wrap up its two-day policy-setting meeting on Wednesday. As the result day approaches, speculation on the Fed’s action is growing.As the current inflation rate remains below the Fed’s target level, chances of an interest rate hike are low this time around. However, this time around, investors are waiting for another important decision that might significantly benefit banks.In the June meeting, the Fed had hinted that it would start unwinding its huge balance sheet by the end of 2017. And rumours suggest that the trimming might start in September itself and investors are expecting this meeting to specify how the process will be rolled out.The Fed’s quantitative easing policy during the recession to increase money supply in the economy and support the struggling banking industry made it purchase a large number of financial assets from banks.Of the assets purchased, most were treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed kept on reinvesting the proceeds of the maturing securities. As a result of this, its balance sheet now stands at a whopping $4.5 trillion.However, now, as the economy has more or less stabilized, the Fed wants to start unwinding its balance sheet.For this, it may either sell some of its securities or stop reinvesting the proceeds.If the Fed decides to buy back some or all the short-term duration securities, the yield curve will become steeper. This means that the yield on long-term bonds will increase.Since banks borrow at the short-term rates but lend at long-term rates, their net-interest margin spreads will widen.Major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) have already been witnessing a gradual improvement in their margins with the rate hikes so far. They will benefit further if the Fed’s balance-sheet action steepens the yield curve.   Although the balance sheet trimming is a long and gradual process, it will definitely help banks to improve their margins further.Each of the banks mentioned above currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

75,BK,"Holding shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  (BRK.B  -  Free Report) render dynamism to a shareholder’s portfolio.

Yet there are other attractive stocks in the property & casualty insurance industry that may not be as big a name as Berkshire Hathaway but promise greater returns.With the Federal Reserve already hiking rates twice this year (intended for one more), the property and casualty insurers stand to benefit from the improving rate environment. This is because investment income a major component of an insurer’s top line.Improving economy indicating more disposable income and better consumer sentiment should support more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher.Though increasing catastrophes will induce volatility in underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to counter the anticipated loss.Additionally, influx of capital, building of reserves and containment of underwriting expenses also pave the way for growth prospects.Choosing the StocksApart from Berkshire Hathaway, we have zeroed in on two other stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio.

Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The improving economic backdrop — reflecting lower commercial tax, rise in consumer spending and decent lending scenario — is likely to support Comerica’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $811.6 million for the first quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 9.5%.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Comerica’s fourth-quarter 2017 results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Also, strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in loan balance were the key headwinds.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8%.The positive earnings surprises along with fundamental strength helped Comerica’s shares gain 45.6% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 19.3% rally. Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteA Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Comerica is +0.95%.Zacks Rank: Comerica carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.49 reflects growth of 34.2% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter supported by expanding net interest margin and decent loan growth.Higher Fee Income: Trend of consumer spending was strong during the first quarter, which is likely to boost Comerica’s non-interest income. Also, investment banking and equity markets were decent due to higher volumes of M&As. Thus, the related fees are expected to increase marginally.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.Credit Quality Might Improve: The quarter continued to witness benign credit quality trends. Also, Moody’s Investors Service has projected a favorable credit environment for the banks in 2018.

77,BK,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was encouraging. The primary highlight was the release of the Fed minutes of the March FOMC meeting.The latest Fed minutes indicate that the officials are optimistic about the improving economic growth and rise in inflation. This is expected to support a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.The release of the minutes led to overall positivity in the markets and bank stocks didn’t remain untouched. Apart from this, easing U.S.-China trade war tension cheered investors to some extent.Banks’ first-quarter earnings were also in the spotlight over the past five trading sessions. This time, earnings are expected to be impressive driven by rebound in trading activities and higher interest rates. Also, modest loan growth will likely support results.Taking about company-specific headlines, as usual Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated for all the wrong reasons.

78,BK,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 20. The company has a woeful earnings history, with consecutive colossal earnings misses. Last quarter, the company missed estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter, recording a massive negative surprise of 450%. Ericsson witnessed an average negative surprise of 552.5% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Ericsson is set to witness yet another earnings miss.Factors to ConsiderThe information and communications technology solutions provider is grappling with shrinking markets and stiff competition from other established players in the market. Moreover, slowdown in spending by wireless carriers severely hurt the company’s financials over the past few quarters and is likely to affect the upcoming results.Most of the company’s troubles have stemmed from the drying up of investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world. The company’s revenues and margins in the Networks and IT & Cloud segments continue to take a beating from adverse industry trends.Further, Ericsson foresees sustained weakness in the market for radio access networks. Network equipment sales, particularly in North America and Europe, continue to contract. Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment in the quarters to come.Soft mobile broadband demand and slowdown in emerging markets will continue to put a significant dent in Ericsson’s performance. These factors will likely manifest in the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite these challenges, Ericsson remains the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology, with significant market share and a large number of LTE networks worldwide. The company envisions healthy traction in its 4G portfolio and 5G readinesses. At the same time, Ericsson is continuing with steady investment in R&D, technology leadership and gross margin improvement. The company is trimming its workforce to reduce operating costs and improve bottom line.Ericsson is seeking to seize business opportunities as operators shift toward 4G deployments and prepare ground for the forthcoming 5G revolution.

79,BK,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings were in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher net interest revenues and assets under management (AUM) growth were offset by lower fee income and rise in expenses.BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. The average positive surprise was 3.7%.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents has remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year growth of 21.3%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.05 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting an improvement of 6.4% year over year.BNY Mellon’s shares have gained 10.8% in the past year, underperforming the 17.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.21%.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsImprovement in Fee Revenues: Given that the equity markets have performed decently during the first quarter, BNY Mellon’s asset servicing fees, as well as investment management and performance fees, are expected to witness modest improvement. Moreover, with the expansion in the spread between three-month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate, along with an increase in trading volumes, securities lending revenues are also expected to improve during the quarter.Further, driven by higher foreign exchange trading volumes and increased volatility, foreign exchange trading revenues are also likely to witness improvement. Thus, with the expected rise in the above-mentioned components, overall fee revenues must improve during the quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of $3.16 billion reflects 5.1% year-over-year improvement.Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenues (NIR): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $296.8 billion reflects an improvement of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the quarter has witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario, primarily due to rise in consumer confidence and increase in loan demand to some extent, owing to the tax reform. Thus, given the improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, BNY Mellon should register an increase in NIR.Moreover, management believes, any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin. Hence, improving margins, due to the increase in rates, is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Supported by the cost-saving initiatives, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been declining for the past few years. Moreover, despite the impact of investment-related expenses, overall costs are expected to remain low in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Associated Banc-Corp (ASB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 19.

80,BK,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.9% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.BNY Mellon Beats on Q2 Earnings as Revenues ImproveBNY Mellon’s second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. The figure also came 17% higher than the prior-year quarter tally.Better-than-expected results were driven by higher revenues and benefit from provisions. Also, assets under management reflected growth. However, a slight rise in expenses acted as a headwind.Net income applicable to common shareholders came in at $926 million, up 12% year over year.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal revenue (non-GAAP) for the quarter increased 5% year over year to $3.95 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85 billion.Net interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was $838 million, up 7% year over year. The rise was driven by higher interest rates and lower premium amortization, partly offset by a fall in average interest-earning assets and higher average long-term debt.Additionally, net interest margin grew 18 basis points to 1.16%.Total fee and other revenues increased 4% from the prior-year quarter to $3.12 billion. The rise was primarily driven by higher total investment services fees, and investment management and performance fees.Total non-interest expenses (non-GAAP) amounted to $2.59 billion, up 1% year over year. This reflects a rise in expenses in nearly all categories, except net occupancy costs, business development expenses, sub-custodian costs and amortization of intangible assets.Strong Asset PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, AUM was $1.77 trillion, up 6% year over year. This reflected higher market values and net inflows, partly offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar (principally versus the British pound).Moreover, assets under custody and administration of $31.1 trillion were up 5% year over year. Higher market values largely drove the rise.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNon-performing assets declined 6.5% year over year to $100 million. Further, provision for credit losses was a benefit of $7 million compared with a benefit of $9 million in the year-ago quarter.However, allowance for loan losses increased 4% year over year to $164 million.Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Jun 30, 2017, common equity Tier-1 ratio (Standardized Basel 3 fully phased-in) came in at 11.4% compared with 11.3% as of Dec 31, 2016. Leverage capital ratio was 6.7%, up from 6.6% in the prior-quarter level.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, BNY Mellon bought back 11 million shares for $506 million.OutlookManagement is of the opinion that a rising rate scenario will positively impact margins. As a result, higher NIM will more than offset the reduced size of the balance sheet. Also, this will lead to a modest rise in NIR.NIR is expected to be in the high end of the 4%–6% range in 2017.As a result, it expects to generate positive operating leverage in 2017.On an average, the company expects investment in other income to tend towards the high end of the $60-$80 million range each quarter in 2017.Looking at expenses, management continues to expect legal and professional expenses to decline by nearly $10 million per quarter during the second half of 2017.Further, in 2017, total adjusted expenses will not be up more than 1%.Moreover, the effective tax rate is anticipated to be around 25–26% for 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and Consensus  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and Consensus | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, BNY Mellon's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated also a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

81,BK,"Per a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) merchant services division has been accused of charging small business with unacceptable fees for credit card transactions. Also, the bank has been alleged to have charged excessively high fees for early termination.The lawsuit claims that the bank used a 63-pages long contract written in ""deceptive language"" in order to confuse the small business owners.This time Wells Fargo Merchant Services has come under the limelight, which is a joint venture between Wells Fargo and First Data Corporation (FDC  -  Free Report).CNNMoney cited a former employee of the bank’s Merchant Services division, who claimed to have been instructed to target small business with no legal support. He disclosed that during his two-year tenure at the bank, it was impossible for the owners to exit the agreement.Among the plaintiffs, Queen City Tours claimed that the bank charged it monthly fees of $20 to $35 for not being able to conduct minimum number of transactions, when it was specified in the contract that there would be no such fees. Further, the tour company also accused the bank of levying an early termination fees of about $500.Another plaintiff, Patti's Pitas, a Pennsylvania-based restaurant, claimed that is was charged very high fees when it went out of business. Wells Fargo argued that Patti's Pitas could not break the three-year term of the contract. However, the restaurant owner was not aware of the term.Wells Fargo, however, denied all allegations. Further, the bank believes that the negotiated pricing terms were fair and had been administered well.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the same space worth considering are Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report).Carolina Financial witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 4.5% for the current year, over the last 30 days.

82,BK,"SVB Financial Group’s (SIVB  -  Free Report) strong capital position and consistent growth in loans and deposits position it well for future growth. Also, shares of the company have gained 62.7% in the past 12 months, outpacing the 28.6% growth for the industry it belongs to.However, mounting expenses and lack of geographic diversification remain major concerns.Nevertheless, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings have been revised nearly 3.1% upward in the last 30 days, reflecting analyst’s optimism about its earnings growth prospects.Looking at the fundamentals, the company has been witnessing consistent growth in deposits and net interest income (NII) over the past several years. It has seen its non-interest-bearing demand deposits increasing at a CAGR of 14% over the last three years (2014–2016). This change in deposit mix is expected to drive the company’s organic growth.Also, pressure on the company’s net-interest margin (NIM) seems to be easing gradually with improvement in the rate environment. Notably, driven by a consistent growth in loans, management projects NIM to rise further in 2017.Further, the company’s efforts toward improving non-interest income, which constituted nearly 27% of net revenue in the first half of 2017, should further support top-line growth.However, SVB Financial has been witnessing a consistent rise in operating expenses for the past few years, primarily due to rise in compensation and benefit costs. Expenses increased at a CAGR of 12.4% in the last five years (2012–2016).Thus, elevated expenses are expected to hurt the company’s profitability in the near term.Also, the company has minimal international exposure and derives less than 10% of its total revenue from foreign clients. Lack of geographic diversification might hamper the company’s financials in the quarters ahead.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the finance space worth considering are Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (FFKT  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report).Zions Bancorporation has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 8.9% for the current year over the past 30 days.

84,BK,"Following Old National Bancorp’s (ONB  -  Free Report) announcement of its decision to acquire Anchor Bancorp, Inc. in a stock and cash deal, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company’s outlook from stable to negative. However, Old National’s long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings were affirmed at A3.Although the acquisition will help Old National to expand its operations into the vibrant growth markets of Minnesota and add low-cost core deposits, Moody’s believes that it might hamper the company’s capital and liquidity position.Also, this out-of-market acquisition might increase the company’s credit and operational risks.Per Moody’s, Old National’s tangible common equity (TCE) to risk-weighted asset ratio has been declining for the last few years. Since the acquisition will expand the company’s risk-weighted assets and increase its goodwill, its capital ratios are likely to be pressurized further.Although, Old National’s capital and liquidity positions seem weak, the company boasts solid credit quality. It has a strong core deposit base and a solid earnings generation capacity, which helps it to maintain its sustainable market position in Indiana. Also, the company has been successful in managing credit risks in the past. It is on account of these positives that the company’s ratings were affirmed by Moody’s.According to Moody’s, a rating upgrade for Old National could happen only if the company is successful in improving its capital and liquidity position. On the other hand, the company’s ratings could be downgraded further if its capital or liquidity position does not bounce back to the prior levels and if its underwriting standards become more aggressive.Old National stock has gained nearly 22.1% in the last 12 months, underperforming the 24.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some top-ranked stocks in the finance space worth considering are Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) and T.

87,BK,"Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) guaranteed auto protection (GAP) insurance program is currently under investigation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Under the bank’s GAP insurance, a customer gets coverage on the difference between the amount he owes on a car loan and the value an insurance company will give him if the car is destroyed in an accident or stolen. The customers are entitled to a refund of some portion of the GAP insurance in case loans are paid off early.In its filing issued last week, the bank disclosed that it found some issues relating to its GAP insurance product. The borrowers were not returned the amount they were entitled to.Wells Fargo has now started issuing refunds to the eligible customers in several states.

89,BK,"Troubles are not yet over for Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). A federal lawsuit has been filed against the company’s joint venture with payment processor First Data Corp (FDC  -  Free Report), accusing it of misleading thousands of merchants by charging them unauthorized fees. The news was first reported by Reuters.The venture, known as Wells Fargo Merchant Services was formed to help small businesses and other merchants across the country to process their credit and debit card transactions. It had promised to provide a transparent pricing policy to the merchants.However, per the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn on Friday, on behalf of Patti's Pitas, a now closed restaurant in Pennsylvania, tour operator Queen City Tours in Charlotte, NC, and other merchants, the venture had not been living up to its promises.It was overbilling merchants for its services and had been charging them with unanticipated fees which they were claiming to be ""interchange charges."" The venture claimed that the fee was being charged by some credit card network, but actually it was they who were making profit out of the same.Also, Wells Fargo framed a 63-page contract which had to be signed by the merchants. The contract was quite complicated and beyond the capacity of merchants to understand. Upon signing, the merchants were hit by some unauthorized monthly charges.Sara Hassell, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said, ""We deny the claims and plan to defend against the misrepresentations outlined in the lawsuit."" On the contrary, Mark Murphy, the spokesman for First Data did not comment.This is not the first time Wells Fargo has faced legal action for misleading sales tactics. The company is already struggling with a nationwide lawsuit filed against its employees for unfair cross-selling practices by opening unauthorized accounts.Last year, it agreed to pay $185 million to the U.S. government to settle such claims.In the last one year, shares of the company have gained only 7.4%, underperforming the 35.6% rally for the industry it belongs to.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the finance space are Carolina Financial Corporation (CARO  -  Free Report) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report).Carolina Financial witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 4.5% for the current year, over the last 60 days.

90,BK,"Here’s a small cross-section of Q2 earnings reported ahead of the bell today:Bank of New York - Mellon (BK  -  Free Report) beat bottom-line estimates by 4 cents to 88 cents per share, representing 17.3% growth year over year. Revenues of $3.95 billion also surpassed expectations of $3.85 billion. The bank also bought back more than $500 million in share repurchases in the quarter, and the stock is up 1% in today’s pre-market following these results.Paints and coatings giant Sherwin-Williams (SHW  -  Free Report) reported a mixed Q2 this morning, missing on earnings by 2 cents to $4.52 per share, while sales far outpaced the Zacks consensus to $3.74 billion, representing growth of 16% year over year. The company also bumped up its Q3 estimate by 2 cents per share, even as the company’s purchase of competitor Valspar promises to weigh on earnings, near-term.Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) has missed Q2 estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning, reporting $1.14 per share ($1.23 was expected) on quarterly sales on $6.9 billion ($7.1 billion was expected). The tobacco products manufacturer lowered guidance for fiscal 2017, and shares are trading down in today’s pre-market.Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Both FallThursday morning Initial Jobless Claims fell by 15,000 week over week to 233K from a slightly adjusted 248K the previous week. This figure had been hovering at or near the top of the 225-250K range jobless claims have been in for most of the past 52 weeks, so this drop looks pretty notable. Continuing claims rose, however, from 1.95 million two weeks ago to 1.977 million last week. Still, continuing claims remain under the psychologically pleasing 2 million threshold, so these all point to further signs of a strong U.S. labor market.July’s Philly Fed survey was a disappointment this morning, however: its latest read of 19.5 was well below the 23.0 expected and the 25.6 in June. Because this tracks the economy of just one major U.S. city, however (Philadelphia), we tend to get highly volatile reads from month to month. So while this figure is not great, it has been lower — and may even bounce back next month, depending.CBO Slams ACA Repeal, White House Slams CBOThe Congressional Budget Office has released its study of the repeal in Congress of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) begun last year and projected out a full decade. The results aren’t pretty: 32 million people currently covered would be kicked off the rolls by 2026 and premiums would increase by 100%. Deficit reductions would fall short of the ideal $1 trillion to only $473 billion.The White House called the CBO’s methodology “flawed.” But the healthcare reform issue continues to be a thorn in the side of the Trump administration, not only in demonstrating the fundamental disconnect within Congress (of which the House, Senate and White House are all run by the same party) or in fulfilling promises of healthcare reform on the campaign trail, but because future tax reform is jeopardized without a healthcare package passing into law first. This is before discussing whether both houses of Congress might see a midterm upheaval in 2018, based on the government’s ineffectuality.

93,BK,"Earnings season for the banks has already begun and the results released so far by the big banks reflect a challenging second-quarter 2017. Despite hikes in interest rates by the Fed (twice this year), banks seem to be struggling to improve their net interest margin, owing to lower treasury yields.Other headwinds include soft capital market businesses and dismal performance of the investment banking business. Also, modest rise in mortgage origination is expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues.On the other hand, loan demand improved on a sequential basis. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are expected to increase, while growth in consumer loans remained soft. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.On the cost front, the chance of a significant rise in expenses is low, though a marginal increase in expenses could occur owing to digitization. As cost-saving efforts continue supporting the bottom-line performance, overall expenses are expected to remain manageable in the quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in second quarter are projected to grow 4.5% year over year.So, this is the right time to add a few banking stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, in order to be confident of an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.
