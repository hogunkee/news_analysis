7,EMN,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

13,EMN,"President Trump summoned some of America's most prominent corporate executives to the White House Thursday and told them he intends to put them to work restoring manufacturing jobs and U.S. dominance in trade.""They share our commitment to bring manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country,"" Trump said as he sat with the 24 business leaders, who included Dow Chemical (DOW) Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Caterpillar (CAT) Chairman Doug Oberhelman.Trump used the public portion of the meeting to reiterate some of his campaign themes, blasting what he called ""unbelievably bad"" trade deals and singling out trade deficits with Mexico and China. He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.

30,EMN,"What's not to like about Eastman Chemical (EMN)? It's up more than 50% this year, it's near a fresh buy point, and it offers an annual dividend yield of 1.7%. The former supplier of chemicals to now-defunct camera maker Eastman Kodak has branched out in recent years. It has acquired companies that make a broad range of higher-margin specialty chemicals…
"
31,EMN,"Specialty chemicals, additives and fibers provider Eastman Chemical (EMN) has repositioned its business in recent years.In 2011, the company acquired Dynaloy, a producer of solvents; Sterling Chemicals, a petrochemical producer; and Brazilian company Scandiflex, a manufacturer of plasticizers that expanded Eastman's footprint in Brazil.Also in 2011, Eastman entered into a joint venture to make acetate tow in China. The venture is expected to be operational in mid-2013.Acetate tow is used in making cigarette filters, ink reservoirs for pens, fiber tips for markers, medical testing devices, and oil and fuel filters.In July, Eastman Chemical completed the acquisition of Solutia, a specialty chemicals company that broadens Eastman's reach in the Asia Pacific region and increases Eastman's access to the automotive and architectural industries.Also in July, Eastman announced a second joint venture in China to build a resin plant in Nanjing. The facility is expected to begin operations at the end of 2014.""Given all of the portfolio work we have done over the last several years, including the Solutia acquisition, we now have a portfolio of businesses that we expect to produce solid, consistent earnings growth and cash generation for years to come,"" CEO James P. Rogers said at the earnings call Oct. 26.Q3 was the first quarter that included Solutia's contribution.Earnings rose 25% on a sales pop of 25%. The Street expects EPS to rise 66% in Q4 on a 30% sales gain.Apart from the acquisitions, the company is benefiting from customer substitution from phthalate plasticizers to Eastman's nonphthalate plasticizers.Nonphthalate plasticizers are used in sensitive areas such as toys and food-contact applications. Phthalate plasticizers raise health concerns because they can leach.Eastman pays a quarterly dividend of 26 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of 1.7%.The dividend was initiated in 1994 and underwent a 13-year period when it was not changed. The company raised the dividend in 2010 and 2011 and has never decreased the payout.

32,EMN,"Photo giant Eastman Kodak filed for bankruptcy in January. But Eastman Chemical, the stand-alone company that once produced chemicals for the film pioneer, survives. It has even been on a tear. Shares are up more than 50% so far this year. Chemicals these days come in two basic varieties. Commodity chemicals are widely made, often suffer from production overcapacity and…
"
33,EMN,"When it comes to developing a formula for growth, who better than Eastman Chemical  (EMN) to come up with the right mix of ingredients?
"
34,EMN,"Through a series of divestitures and acquisitions over the past several years, Eastman has reduced its exposure to cyclical commodity chemical markets and increased its emphasis on the faster-growing, more stable specialty chemicals businesses. The company has also expanded its reach geographically in the Asia Pacific region and other emerging markets.
"
35,EMN,"Its efforts have paid off. Eastman has sparked a favorable reaction on Wall Street as it's shown consistent earnings growth while transforming into more of a specialty chemicals producer.
"
36,EMN,"""Investors usually award a higher valuation to specialty chemicals producers than commodity chemicals producers,"" said S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Stuart Benway.
"
37,EMN,"The reason: There's more consistency in profits in specialty chemicals, while in a highly cyclical business like commodity chemicals there can be wide swings in profits, he says.
"
38,EMN,"Eastman boasts a strong portfolio of specialty businesses that hold leading positions and provide products that enhance performance in a variety of end markets such as transportation, building and construction, and consumables. They include specialty chemicals, such as an additive that reduces tire wear, materials that prevent auto glass from shattering and a fiber used in manufacturing cigarettes and yarn.
"
39,EMN,"Consistent Growth
"
40,EMN,"The big draw for investors is Eastman's earnings growth, which has been ""fairly strong and fairly consistent,"" says Benway.
"
41,EMN,"Sales and earnings have climbed by at least 25% for three straight quarters. In the most recent first quarter, earnings popped 33% to $1.62 a share. Sales shot up 27% to $2.3 billion.
"
42,EMN,"Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, Eastman's end markets, particularly the transportation and building and construction markets, benefited from continued economic growth in Asia and modest economic growth in the U.S., says a company filing with the SEC.
"
43,EMN,"Operating earnings rose to $393 million from $339 million the prior year. The increase came amid lower raw material and energy costs, which more than offset lower selling prices.
"
44,EMN,"A big lift came from the $4.8 billion acquisition of performance and specialty chemicals producer Solutia in July. Solutia supplies specialty films and additives into the automotive, building and construction, and renewable energy markets.
"
45,EMN,"Solutia brought a lot to the table. It added more than $2 billion in annual sales, says Benway, and expanded Eastman's presence in emerging markets.
"
46,EMN,"The buy accelerated Eastman's growth efforts in Asia Pacific. With Solutia in the mix, Eastman expects to have a compound annual growth rate in Asia Pacific approaching 10% for the next several years.
"
47,EMN,"At the time of the buy, Eastman identified annual cost synergies of roughly $100 million it expected to achieve by 2013.
"
48,EMN,"Eastman also expects to realize tax benefits from Solutia's historical net operating losses and other tax advantages that it expects to contribute to free cash flow of roughly $1.0 billion through 2013.
"
49,EMN,"On the product front, the buy added a handful of specialty businesses to Eastman Chemical's portfolio. Solutia's rubber chemicals used by the tire industry are the firm's most attractive asset, wrote Morningstar analyst Jeffrey Stafford in a report.
"
50,EMN,"""Rubber chemicals look to fit alongside acetate tow as Eastman's most profitable business lines going forward,"" he said. ""In acetate tow, a main component of cigarette filters, Eastman benefits from a low-cost production method using coal as a feedstock. In general, this business is relatively immune to cyclical downturns and should help stabilize earnings over time.""
"
51,EMN,"Among Solutia's products for the tire industry is Crystex insoluble sulfur, an additive that slows the wear on tires.
"
52,EMN,"Another Solutia product is Saflex, a material used in commercial glass and auto windshields that limits shattered glass damage.
"
53,EMN,"Eastman has made other acquisitions over the years, including the 2011 purchase of Scandiflex do Brasil S.A. Industrias Quimicas, a maker of plasticizers. Plasticizers are additives that increase the plasticity or fluidity of a material. The buy helped expand Eastman's presence in Latin America and expanded its product portfolio.
"
54,EMN,"It's also divested more than $3 billion in sales from underperforming business lines over the past several years, notes Stafford. That included the 2011 sale of its Performance Polymers PET business, related assets, and technology to DAK Americas.
"
55,EMN,"Eastman is the former supplier of chemicals to the now-defunct camera company Eastman Kodak.
"
56,EMN,"It generates roughly half of sales outside the U.S. and Canada. It's a top player in many of its markets. It's the second-largest acetate tow manufacturer in the world. Competitors in the fibers market for acetate tow include Celanese Corp. (CE)and Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd.
"
57,EMN,"The company forecasts global growth in demand for filter tow of 1% to 2% annually over the next several years with Asia accounting for more than 50% of the growth, wrote Benway in a report.
"
58,EMN,"Eastman is the world's largest non-phthalate plasticizer manufacturer and the second-largest resin manufacturer. Eastman's major competitors in this segment include large multinational companies such as BASF and Exxon Mobil (XOM).
"
59,EMN,"Coal Gasification
"
60,EMN,"Stafford says Eastman's coal gasification production technique provides a low-cost base for many of its products.
"
61,EMN,"""Competitors have been reluctant to replicate this process because of high upfront costs,"" he said.
"
62,EMN,"Meanwhile, Eastman's prospects are bright, despite head winds.
"
63,EMN,"""We expect our leadership positions in key end markets, the diversity of the end markets we serve, and our broad geographic footprint to continue to position us well for strong earnings growth,"" said CEO Jim Rogers when reporting first-quarter results April 25. ""However, global economic uncertainty continues with particular weakness in Europe, and raw material and energy costs remain volatile.""
"
64,EMN,"Still with the integration of the Solutia buy on track and continued momentum in its end markets, he maintained his 2013 full-year earnings per share guidance of between $6.30 and $6.40.
"
65,EMN,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see 2013 earnings rising 18% to $6.35 a share. They expect an 11% rise in 2014 and in 2015.

67,EMN,"Several biotechs pushed to new highs Tuesday.What else is new? The industry has shone this year, and its leaders are building on this month's breakouts.Celgene (CELG) rose 2.71 to 145.37 in flat volume, closing 10% above the 131.92 buy point of its breakout July 11. United Therapeutics (UTHR) closed 6% above its 69.75 buy point. Tuesday's gain was 1.12 to 73.75 in volume about 60% above average.Actavis (ACT) is still in buy range, up 2% from the 133.10 buy point of Friday's breakout. It edged up 0.90 to 135.38 in above-average volume. United Therapeutics and Actavis have been getting a bump since reporting earnings Thursday.As fresh breakouts go, Eastman Chemical (EMN) made a reaffirming move Tuesday after beating expectations. The stock started to clear a 21-week pattern several days ago but could not muster convincing price or volume.On Tuesday, however, it rushed 4.72, or 6%, to 79.75 in nearly three times its average volume. Eastman — a specialty chemicals company that has been expanding — reported operating earnings of $1.80 a share, up 29%. Revenue rose 32% to $2.44 billion.NQ Mobile (NQ) continued rocketing. The China-based computer security company has soared more than 50% since it cleared a low-priced base with a buy point at 10.The dramatic price surge resembles the ramp-up in a climax top. In this case, the stock is just out of a base. In fact, investors who bought at the breakout should hold at least eight weeks because the rapid climb suggests NQ could be a big winner. Keep in mind, though, the stock does not have a whole lot of institutional sponsorship.Lithia Motors (LAD) added 2.65 to 64.23 in active trading. The auto dealership operator found support in the latest of several pullbacks to its 50-day moving average. Thus, the stock is extended.Lithia's jump came as other car-related stocks made new highs, including Group 1 Automotive (GPI), which picked up 1.19 to 73.58.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) cleared the handle of an awkward pattern in heavy trade.

90,EMN,"With one trading session left in the week, the stock market today looks poised to snap a five-week winning streak. There's nothing wrong with the market taking a break.Leading stocks that have high share volume are cooling their heels. They do so by falling near or to their 10-week moving average (or 50-day line on a daily chart). Rebounds off the key support line suggest that the pullback is temporary.SodaStream International (SODA) is holding firm after making a solid bounce off the 10-week moving average. Last week's 6.7% plunge was without question painful, but the decline had been as large as 13.3%.The stock is also just above a 50.08 three-weeks-tight entry. Yet given that the maker of do-it-yourself soda machines is still 37% below its all-time high of 79.72, one can expect the stock to continue to build a base and supply new entry points.With an average daily volume of 1.2 million shares, SodaStream is one of the more-liquid stocks in this week's Your Weekly Review.3D Systems (DDD) is bucking the market's softness, up more than 12% for the week so far.Like SodaStream, the South Carolina-based three-dimensional printer leader staged a strong rebound off its 10-week moving average last week. That was the first test of the 10-week line since 3D successfully cleared a 44.90 cup-base buy point in late November.Tenet Healthcare (THC), meanwhile, is giving up almost nothing after it finished five up weeks in a row. Such winning streaks are a sign of market leadership. The hospital chain may be forming a three-weeks-tight pattern.Alaska Air Group (ALK) finished Thursday's trade just below a 47.93 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern with a 47.93 buy point. Volume is ample, at 680,000 shares a day.Eastman Chemical (EMN) is down mildly after rising 11 weeks in a row. This week's pullback is light and in below-average volume.

The specialist in point-to-point flights and travel packages to Las Vegas has a reasonable debt load (long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 35% in 2012) and double- to triple-digit top- and bottom-line growth in the past four quarters.Like Alaska Air Group (ALK) and  Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Allegiant is extended from a proper entry point. But if the group continues to show strength and makes just light pullbacks, new buy points may emerge.U.S. hospitals are thriving.HCA Holdings (HCA) is working on a fourth straight up week. The 10-week moving average has acted as a cradle of buying support. Since its rally past longtime resistance near 32, HCA has not fallen more than 3% in any given down week.Tenet Healthcare (THC), also in the seventh-ranked Medical-Hospitals industry group, is making new highs after rebounding off its fast-rising 10-week moving average three weeks ago.

Given its strong run-up since breaking out past 22.66 in September, however, a future correction and new base would not be surprising.A few stocks featured in last week's column are showing signs of forming new bases.  Eastman Chemical (EMN) has climbed 46% since its breakout above a 51.35 buy point in late July 2012.

But the RS lines remained at all-time highs.Home improvement chain Home Depot (HD) makes the Bolting RS Lines screen's cut. The handyman's hangout is expected to get a boost in the coming quarters by a long slow cleanup expected in the wake of the massive Superstorm Sandy, which slammed into the East Coast at the end of October.Home Depot shares were down slightly Monday to 64.98, but intraday climbed to a more-than-12-year high. The stock consolidated from early October to mid-November, but the RS line continued to march higher, showing Home Depot's outperformance while the market was in correction.Amgen (AMGN) shares rose initially, but closed down less than 0.5% Monday. The biotech's stock has been consolidating since hitting a high on Oct. 18, but its RS line has held steady, actually hitting a fresh high Monday.Rental car firm Avis Budget Group (CAR) and specialty chemical firm Eastman Chemical (EMN) also make the list, and are trading near new 52-week highs.

Here are the top five Big Caps in rank order.BlackRock (BLK), one of the largest diversified investment management companies in the U.S., leads the list. Investors have had to pick carefully to find winners in the slow-growth recovery after the Great Recession. BlackRock stepped up last year with a program it calls ""Investing in a New World"" that aims to help clients invest strategically to find those big returns.Shares of the investment adviser, which has a market capitalization of $40 billion, rose 50% from the end of July to last Thursday, Feb. 14, when it turned down in sync with the market.

188,EMN,"A few prominent chemical companies are scheduled to report their quarterly numbers on Apr 26. The chemical industry is riding high on an upturn in the world economy and continued strength across major end-use markets such as construction, automotive and electronics. Another positive for the industry is a recovery in demand in the energy space – a key chemical end-market that had been out of favor for a spell. The recovery is being driven by the rebound in crude oil prices from their historic lows.The U.S. Chemical Industry has recovered from the damaging effects of Hurricane Harvey and is well set to ride the growth wave this year. The European chemical industry is also back on track after a long detour, taking succour from an improving global economic sentiment and an upturn in the Eurozone economy.Despite a few challenges including raw material cost inflation, chemical companies are expected to continue the earnings momentum in the March quarter as the fundamental driving factors remain firmly in place.Strategic measures like productivity improvement, pricing actions, portfolio restructuring and earnings-accretive acquisitions are expected to continue to drive the performance of chemical makers in Q1. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s business-friendly tax reform is a positive for U.S. chemical stocks.Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector, which is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to score the strongest gains in Q1.

198,EMN,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. Companies that emphasize on sales management have a competitive advantage, as solid sales generally get converted into growth.Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Stagnant or declining sales indicate obstacles at the company and offer limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust sales growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering expenses, sustainable bottom-line improvement typically requires impressive sales growth.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future prospects. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily translate into profits.Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Kingsport, TN, Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) manufactures and sells materials, specialty additives, chemicals, and fibers.

201,EMN,"Ever since the shale boom began, U.S. companies have stepped up their investments on chemicals projects within the country. The shale revolution has given them abundant access to cheap ethane which provides them with a competitive edge over their foreign competitors who largely depend on naphtha derived from oil.Fears of a trade war between the United States and China had raised concerns that chemicals companies would reconsider their investments on new projects. However, such concerns have receded following President Trump’s decision to send a delegation to China in order to negotiate on tariffs.This development indicates that prospects of chemicals producers remain bright. Adding them to your portfolios would make for a profitable option at this point. Shale Boom Boost Chemicals InvestmentsAccording to Martha Gilchrist Moore of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the chemical industry has stepped up investments in the United States from 2010. This is primarily due to the availability of low-cost natural gas reserves discovered by shale drillers. Moore was speaking in Pittsburgh on Apr 20.Moore added that from 2010 up to February this year, various companies have said that they will set up 313 projects related to chemicals, together valued at $188 billion. Nearly 60% of this amount, around $113 billion, will come from foreign companies. Additionally, nearly 700 projects related to plastics as well as fresh constructions and expansions have been announced during this period.Mnuchin’s Visit Likely to Ease Trade-related WorriesHowever, the good fortunes of the chemicals industry have been clouded by prospects of a trade war between China and the United States. China’s proposal to levy 25% tariffs on nearly $50 billion of U.S. imports would harm a major market for a range of plastics and chemicals produced in the United States.According to the ACC, China imported $3.2 billion worth of plastic resins from the United States in 2017, which makes it one of most United States’ largest trading partners. Nearly 40% of the items mentioned on China’s tariffs list are chemicals, including polyethylene and polycarbonates.But President Trump’s decision to send a team to China in order to discuss tariff related issues have helped to calm fears that a trade war is likely to begin. Chinese President Xi Jinping has made several conciliatory statements in this connection earlier this month, promising to open up his economy further to investors.Subsequently, Xi’s government relaxed foreign ownership norms for auto JVs set up within China. Now, the U.S. team led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, which includes Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and U.S. Trade representative Robert Lighthizer could ease trade-related worries further. On Apr 25, Trump stated at the White House that “We’ve got a very good chance at making a deal.”Our ChoicesThe U.S. chemicals industry seems to be in good shape as we head into the second quarter. The ACC has revealed that U.S. specialty chemicals market volumes have increased significantly over the first quarter. Further, though the ACC’s Chemical Activity Barometer declined by 0.1% in April to 121.6%, it has experienced a 3.8% yearly increaseAnd now Mnuchin’s visit to China promises to ease out trade-related worries for the chemicals industry.

202,EMN,"The chemical industry continues its positive run this year on the back of healthy demand across automotive and construction end-markets, a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy market supported by a rebound in oil prices and an upturn in the world economy.Moreover, President Trump’s business-friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive earnings performance of the U.S. chemical companies in the first quarter. It is likely to remain a major tailwind as the reforms are expected to boost their bottom line, improve cash flow and incentivize capital investments.How Things Are Shaping Up in the Industry?Strong Demand in Major Markets: Chemical makers continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. The underlying trends in the housing space remain healthy, backed by strong economic growth, steady buyer demand, declining mortgage rates, high homebuilders’ confidence and strong job market scenario.The automotive sector also continues its good run amid certain challenges, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, favorable credit conditions, improved consumer confidence and impressive vehicle launches.A Rebound in Energy: Improving fundamentals in the energy space — a key market for chemicals — has been a major tailwind for the chemical industry. A recovery in crude oil prices has led to an increase in demand for chemicals in the energy market and a favorable pricing environment for chemical products. This is because chemical and oil prices move in tandem.Higher Production to Drive Growth in U.S. Chemical: The U.S. chemical industry is expected to witness strong gains in the production of agricultural chemicals, consumer products, coatings and bulk petrochemicals this year, per the industry trade group — American Chemistry Council (ACC). The trade group expects a strong growth in several chemical sectors in including fertilizers, petrochemicals, crop protection, coatings and consumer products. The ACC envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.4% in 2018.Moreover, the group expects continued expansion in production across the United States this year, with the Gulf Coast region witnessing strongest gains. Moreover, growth in output is expected to be driven by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets as well as upturn in U.S. manufacturing. While the automotive sector is expected to remain at high levels, steady recovery in housing is likely to continue in 2018.Favorable Shale Gas Economics: The United States continues to be an attractive destination for chemical investment. The American chemical industry has the competitive advantage of accessing abundant supplies of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and shale gas. Economics of shale gas is driving strong capital investment in new chemical projects, which is driving growth in the U.S. chemical space.Improving Export Markets: The ACC expects strong export markets to bolster the U.S. chemical industry in 2018. It expects two-way trade between the United States and foreign partners to expand 6.2% year over year and reach $241 billion this year on the back of strong demand from overseas markets and domestic manufacturers downstream.How Dividend Paying Stocks Can Enrich Your PortfolioStocks with solid dividend yield and attractive growth prospects offer excellent choices for investors seeking to create a portfolio that performs well in a growing market and offers downside protection.Consistent dividend payouts underscore a company’s financial strength and stability.  Given the positive developments in the chemical space, it would be a prudent move for investors to add some top-quality dividend stocks in their portfolio.We have employed the Zacks Stocks Screener to find four top chemical companies that offer a decent dividend yield and sport a favorable Zacks Rank.

203,EMN,"Investors looking for stocks in the Chemical - Diversified sector might want to consider either Eastman Chemical (EMN  -  Free Report) or PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system.

Investors should feel comfortable knowing that EMN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PPG has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.EMN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.61, while PPG has a forward P/E of 16.15. We also note that EMN has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PPG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.80.Another notable valuation metric for EMN is its P/B ratio of 2.52. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PPG has a P/B of 4.69.These metrics, and several others, help EMN earn a Value grade of B, while PPG has been given a Value grade of C.EMN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PPG, so it seems like value investors will conclude that EMN is the superior option right now.

205,EMN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Eastman Chemical has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Eastman Chemical’s current PE level puts it slightly above its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Eastman Chemical has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Eastman Chemical stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Eastman Chemical has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.EMN is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Eastman Chemical currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Eastman Chemical a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.8, which is better than the industry average of 9.9. Clearly, EMN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Eastman Chemical might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B. This gives EMN a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen by 2.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus  Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteThis somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineEastman Chemical is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a formidable industry rank (among the Top 18%) and strong Zacks Rank, Eastman Chemical looks like a strong value contender. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has marginally outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

206,EMN,"We issued an updated research report on Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) on Jun 5.Eastman Chemical’s shares have moved up 32.5% over a year, substantially outperforming 10.4% growth of the industry it belongs to.Eastman Chemical’s high margin products and its aggressive cost management actions are likely to boost its earnings. Eastman Chemical saw higher profits in the first quarter, aided by strong growth in its specialty businesses and cost-control actions.The company, in April, raised its earnings growth expectations for 2018 based on strong first-quarter results. It now expects adjusted earnings per share growth for 2018 to be 10-14% year over year, up from its prior view of 8-12%.The company is focused on cost-cutting and productivity actions and increasing selling prices of its products, which are helping it to offset raw material cost inflation and other cost headwinds. It expects to realize $100 million of cost savings in 2018 under its cost-reduction program.Eastman Chemical is also expected to gain from strategic acquisitions, especially of Taminco Corporation. The buyout has strengthened the company’s foothold in promising niche end-markets including food, feed and agriculture. The acquisition has also provided attractive cost- and revenue-synergy opportunities.Further, the company is committed to reduce debt and boost shareholder returns leveraging strong free cash flow. The company repaid $350 million of debt last year. Moreover, it returned more than $180 million to shareholders during the first quarter of 2018 leveraging healthy free cash flow. Eastman Chemical expects to deliver strong earnings growth and generate solid free cash flow of more than $1.1 billion in 2018.However, the company is exposed to volatility in ethylene prices which is weighing on its margins. Eastman Chemical is seeing a spike in raw material costs, which is anticipated to persist in the second quarter of 2018. The company expects raw material and energy prices, especially for olefins, to be volatile through 2018.The company also faces cost headwinds associated with maintenance turnaround and start-up of new production facilities in 2018. It expects higher schedule maintenance cost in 2018.Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderEastman Chemical currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked companies in the basic materials space are FMC Corp. (FMC  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Its shares have moved up around 30.7% over a year.Chemours has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 15.5%.

207,EMN,"United States Steel Corporation’s (X  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this steel giant an intriguing choice for investors right now.What’s Working in Favor of X?Solid Rank & VGM Score: U.S. Steel currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.An Outperformer: U.S. Steel has outperformed the industry over the last six months. The company’s shares have rallied around 38.1% over this period, compared with roughly 11.8% gain recorded by the industry. Forecast-topping earnings performance in the last two quarters, upbeat outlook for 2018 and the Trump administration’s trade actions on imported steel have contributed to the rally in the company’s shares. Strong Growth Prospects: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 for U.S. Steel is currently pegged at $4.67, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of 140.7%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register a 9.9% growth in 2019. The company also has an expected long-term earnings per share growth of 8%.Attractive Valuation: Going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value steel stocks, U.S. Steel is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.8, cheaper compared with the industry average of 8.8.Upbeat Outlook: U.S. Steel, last month, updated its full-year 2018 guidance. For the year, the company now expects EBITDA of roughly $1.7 billion (up from roughly $1.5 billion expected earlier), considering the potential market conditions resulting from the Section 232 actions and increased shipments from Granite City Works. It expects EBITDA to be roughly $250 million for the first quarter.U.S. Steel stated that the revised guidance considers two factors, namely, the market dynamics related to President Trump’s decision to impose 25% tariff on steel imports and the recently announced restarting of one of the two blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities at Granite City Works.Once the restarting process is completed, U.S. Steel expects roughly 100,000 tons of incremental shipments per month from Granite City Works. The company expects the benefits from these actions to be mainly reflected in its results in the second half of this year.U.S. Steel is actively engaged in improving its cost structure and operations on a sustainable basis through its “Carnegie Way” initiative that includes actions such as manufacturing process/logistics improvements and savings on SG&A costs. The company realized Carnegie Way benefits of $491 million for full-year 2017, mostly in its Flat-Rolled division. These actions are also expected to deliver meaningful benefits in 2018.United States Steel Corporation Price and Consensus  United States Steel Corporation Price and Consensus | United States Steel Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked companies in the basic materials space include Kronos Worldwide, Inc.

209,EMN,"The shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investments in plants and equipment in the country. And currently, the U.S. petrochemical industry is in the middle of a shale-induced investment boom leveraging access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks. However, the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing is expected to play spoilsport.President Donald Trump, who has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices, recently proposed sweeping tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China. The President’s decision to levy tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese goods came after a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports slapped by the Trump administration that went into effect on Mar 23.President Trump’s protectionist actions enraged the Red Dragon with Beijing retaliating with plans of imposing tariffs on more than 100 American products with shipment values worth as much as $50 billion, bringing the world’s two largest economies close toward a full-blown trade war.China on Wednesday declared that it would levy additional tariffs of 25% on an array of U.S. products including soybeans, cars, planes, beef, corn, whiskies and chemicals. Notably, chemicals comprise roughly 40% of the products targeted by the planned tariffs. China had earlier slapped tariffs on about $3 billion worth of U.S. imports.The Trump administration responded with a proposed $100 billion in additional tariffs on China yesterday, further intensifying the trade tussle between the two countries.China’s proposed countermeasures, if enforced, are likely to harm the U.S. chemical industry which is currently on an upswing.Shale Bounty Fueling U.S. Chemical InvestmentThe U.S. Chemical Industry has clawed its way back from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey and is set to ride the growth wave this year. According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a leading industry trade group, expects chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018 with capital investments on chemical projects are expected to play a key role in the growth.A recovery in manufacturing, rising business investment and a rebound in domestic oil and gas production has set the stage for significant expansion and capital investment, per the ACC.Major export markets such as Latin America and Asia are also expected to play a significant role in basic chemical production growth in 2018 and 2019. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are also driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing.The United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of cheap ethane feedstock extracted from shale. This is driving investment in chemical production projects. Petrochemical makers are significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas.New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane (derived from shale gas) in the process.The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost-effective way. Chemical makers including DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report), BASF SE (BASFY  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK  -  Free Report) are investing on shale gas-linked projects to take advantage of abundant natural gas supplies.LyondellBasell currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While both BASF and Eastman Chemical carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), DowDuPont, Celanese and Westlake Chemical each have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.According to the ACC, 320 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment. Such investments — many backed by Federal government support — are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.Chemical industry capital spending continues to go up, clocking $38 billion in 2017, per the ACC. This also accounts for one-half of overall construction spending by the manufacturing sector. The trade group expects capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.But Trade War Could Dampen U.S. Investments & ExportsThe Trump administration’s actions to impose heavy tariffs on steel imports and the threats of tariffs on U.S. chemical exports by China are detrimental to the U.S. chemical industry. These moves are expected to dampen new chemical investment in the United States, hurt U.S. chemical exports and harm the domestic chemical industry’s competitiveness. All these may eventually lead to a slowdown in growth in the American chemical industry.The steel tariffs would discourage chemical makers spending billions of dollars on new projects. These hefty tariffs will lead to a spurt in steel prices, which in turn, are likely to push up the costs of building petrochemical plants in the United States that use a significant amount of steel, thereby eroding the economic benefits of these projects. As steel costs constitute a significant portion of the costs of constructing these plants, this may discourage many companies from continuing their projects.    Notably, DowDuPont, which completed construction spending worth $6 billion in petrochemical projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast last year, had raised concerns that the tariffs on U.S. steel imports could add hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to its planned chemical project on the U.S. Gulf Coast.Chemical industry groups have also expressed their discontent about the brewing trade war. The ACC recently said that China is among the most important trading partners of the U.S. chemical industry, importing 11% (or $3.2 billion) of all U.S. plastic resins last year. The trade group is worried that 40% of the products to which Beijing has assigned new tariffs are chemicals including polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polycarbonates.The ACC said that “engaging in a trade war with one of our country’s most significant trading partners is not the answer. We strongly urge both the U.S. and Chinese governments to work together to come to a satisfactory and mutually beneficial decision before this situation escalates further.”According to the ACC, out of the announced investments by the chemical industry in new factories, expansions and restarts of plants across the United States, more than half of the projects are currently in the planning stage. The trade group is worried that the trade tariffs may force investors to consider doing business elsewhere.China is one of the biggest export markets for U.S. chemicals and thus, leaves the American chemical industry heavily exposed to Beijing’s planned retaliatory trade actions. The prospects of tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U.S. chemical products in this major market. This is worrisome as export markets are expected to significantly contribute to the growth of the U.S. chemical industry this year and the next.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                                                                                                            Here's another stock idea to consider.

211,EMN,"The First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (FXZ  -  Free Report) made its debut on 05/08/2007, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Materials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by First Trust Advisors. FXZ has been able to amass assets over $366.43 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Materials ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the StrataQuant Materials Index.The StrataQuant Materials Index is a modified equal-dollar weighted index designed by the AMEX to objectively identify and select stocks from the Russell 1000 Index that may generate positive alpha relative to traditional passive style indices through the use of the AlphaDEX screening methodology.Cost & Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.65%.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.93%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.FXZ's heaviest allocation is in the Materials sector, which is about 79.20% of the portfolio. Its Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) accounts for about 3.89% of the fund's total assets, followed by Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 34.06% of FXZ's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -5.00% so far this year and was up about 11.13% in the last one year (as of 04/09/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $36.96 and $46.42.FXZ has a beta of 1.22 and standard deviation of 16.82% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium choice in the space. With about 52 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFirst Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Materials ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB  -  Free Report) tracks Materials Select Sector Index and the FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index Fund (GUNR  -  Free Report) tracks Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index.

The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth of around 12%, just above the industry average of 11.8%.Let's take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. What’s Driving STLD?Forecast-topping earnings performance in the last reported quarter, upbeat outlook and the Trump administration’s trade actions on imported steel have contributed to the rally in Steel Dynamics' shares.Steel Dynamics topped earnings and revenue expectations in fourth-quarter 2017. Its adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share for the quarter trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents, translating into a 10.2% positive earnings surprise.Steel Dynamics, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects steel consumption in the automotive market in North America to be steady and the company continues to gain momentum in that space. It also sees sustained additional growth across the construction and energy sectors. The company also noted that it expects the recent tax reform to provide an impetus for additional domestic fixed asset investment and growth.Steel Dynamics, last month, provided earnings guidance for first-quarter 2018. The company expects earnings to be between 88 cents and 92 cents per share for the quarter.

Also, pricing of average quarterly steel products is expected to increase more than scrap costs. This is because prices of steel across the platform have been improving throughout the quarter aided by strong steel demand in domestic market.Moreover, Steel Dynamics expects this improving steel consumption and pricing momentum to continue during the year supported by strong steel demand fundamentals and customer optimism. The company also believes the recent steel trade actions taken by the U.S. Federal Administration are likely to reduce imports.The Trump administration has slapped a 25% tariff on steel imports aimed at protecting the U.S. steel industry which had long been struggling to cope with an influx of cheap imports. The tariffs are expected to lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel and drive profitability of U.S. steel makers. The tariffs would also provide a boost to steel prices and give American steel makers more pricing power.Steel Dynamics, Inc. Price and Consensus  Steel Dynamics, Inc.

217,EMN,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) won a contract from Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report). Per the contract, PPG Industries will produce heated pilot and co-pilot windshields for the Bell 525 Relentless commercial helicopter. The windshields will be made available for customer specification for helicopters operating in hilly regions and cold environments and for off-shore rescue operations. PPG Industries demonstrated the functioning of Aircon heating system and provided a cross-section sample of the same to Bell Helicopter. Bell Helicopter approved PPG Industries’ design for the composite windshields by completing the critical design review. The windshield will have an outboard ply of stretched acrylic with a scratch-resistant coating and an inboard polycarbonate ply which enhance the product’s strength. The windshields can withstand the impact of a 2.2-pound bird at 185 knots — Bell Helicopter’s bird-strike requirement. PPG Industries, which is among the prominent chemical companies along with Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), witnessed a roughly two-fold year-over-year jump in net earnings from continuing operations to $184 million or 72 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Net sales rose around 8% year over year to $3,682 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,605 million. The company gained from favorable currency translation in the quarter. For 2018, PPG Industries expects acquisitions to contribute to sales roughly $125 million. The company recently agreed to acquire Netherlands-based leading architectural paint and coatings wholesaler, ProCoatings. Through its network of 23 multi-brand stores, ProCoatings distributes a large portfolio of professional paint brands across the Netherlands. The transaction is expected to close in first-quarter 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. To improve its cost structure, PPG Industries is pursuing significant restructuring actions that are mainly focused on regions and end-use markets with the weakest business conditions. The restructuring activities are expected to deliver around $125 million in annual savings with roughly $50 million of savings already realized in 2017 and another $45-$50 million expected in 2018. During the fourth-quarter call, PPG Industries stated that it is committed toward deploying at least $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of its earlier communicated goal of deploying $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. However, the company is exposed to raw materials cost pressure. PPG Industries is seeing higher raw materials costs and implementing pricing strategies to offset the impact of inflation. The company anticipates raw material inflation to continue through first-half 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

The company’s shares have rallied around 23.6% over this period, compared with roughly 4.9% gain recorded by the industry. Estimates Northbound: Annual earnings estimates for CF Industries have moved north over the past month, reflecting analysts’ confidence on the stock. Over this period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has shot up 63.6% to 90 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has also increased 36.6% to $1.53 per share.Positive Earnings Surprise History: CF Industries has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 72.9%.Solid Growth Prospects: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 for CF Industries is currently pegged 90 cents, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of a staggering 460%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register a 69.8% growth in 2019.Growth Drivers in Place: CF Industries benefits from higher nitrogen demand driven by healthy corn plantations and cyclical recovery in the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The company expects India and Brazil to be major drivers for urea demand in 2018. Based on the company’s analysis and published reports, India is expected to require the import of 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons of urea prior to end of March to meet its fertilizer requirements for this year.Brazil also imported roughly 5.4 million metric tons of urea in 2017, up 15% year over year, and has emerged as a major importer of the nutrient. Import demand is also expected to be healthy in North America in 2018.Moreover, CF Industries should benefit from higher prices of nitrogen fertilizers. Higher selling prices drove the company’s sales in the last reported quarter. Tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance supported nitrogen prices in the quarter. The company expects higher energy costs in major producing regions, lower production in China, a weaker U.S. dollar, increased oil and freight costs and a steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during first-half 2018 at levels higher than the comparable period a year ago.CF Industries should also gain from its efforts to boost production capacity.

The facilities, located in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Appalachian Basins, comprise roughly 70,000 tons of storage capacity. These terminals serve as critical logistics hubs for the oil and gas industry.The deal is expected to consummate by the end of March 2018, pending financing. Under the agreement, U.S. Silica will continue to service customer requirements through the transloads that CIG Logistics will now own and operate.

The company expects to deliver $100 million of cost savings in 2018 under its cost-reduction program.

The Taminco acquisition has provided attractive cost and revenue synergy opportunities.However, the company faces challenges in fibers and ethylene pricing. Lower prices of acetate tow are hurting its Fibers unit. Weak tow pricing may continue to weigh on sales in this segment in the third quarter.Moreover, the company expects ethylene prices to be lower in second-half 2017 vis-à-vis the first half. As such, ethylene margins are expected to remain under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Eastman Chemical is also seeing a spike in raw materials costs, especially in its Chemical Intermediates segment. Raw materials costs headwind is expected to persist in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the company’s actions to increase selling prices of its products are expected to help it offset the impact of raw material cost inflation. Eastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eastman Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteEarnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Eastman Chemical is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

262,EMN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Eastman Chemical has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.4. This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.7.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts Eastman Chemical’s current PE above its median over the observed period (which stands at 11.6x). Hence, we could infer that the stock is overvalued in this respect, especially in light of its historical trend.Nevertheless, the stock’s PE compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Eastman Chemical has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 12.1 – lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Eastman Chemical stock in the near term.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Eastman Chemical has a P/S ratio of about 1.4. This is lower than the industry average, which comes in at 1.7x right now.EMN is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Eastman Chemical currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Eastman Chemical a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Eastman Chemical is just 1.4, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.3, which is far better than the industry average of 11.6. Clearly, EMN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Eastman Chemical might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D. This gives EMN a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>).Meanwhile, the company’s earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period.This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 0.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteThe somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineEastman Chemical is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front.It boasts a favorable industry rank – among the top 24% out of more than 250 industries. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Meanwhile, Eastman Chemical remains focused on cost-cutting and productivity actions amid a challenging operating environment. Further, the company should gain from its strategic acquisitions and capacity expansion actions. It also remains committed to reduce debt and boost shareholder returns leveraging healthy free cash flows.However, Eastman Chemical continues to face pricing pressure. The company is also exposed to weakness in its Fibers unit and raw material price volatility. A Zacks Rank #3 also dims the sparkle on the company as of now.So, value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

263,EMN,"Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) provided an update on its earnings expectations for full-year 2017, including preliminary expectations of the impact of an operational incident at the company’s Kingsport manufacturing plant.            The fundamental state of business in the third quarter was strong across the company, which is also expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company expects the financial impact of recent hurricanes in the United States to be neutral, with impacts varying by segment. Due to aforementioned factors, Eastman Chemical expects adjusted earnings per share growth in 2017 to be toward the top end of the earlier projected range of 10-12% year over year, excluding the financial impact of the Kingsport operational incident.On Oct 4, the company’s Kingsport coal gasification area suffered an operational incident. However, there were no reports of any adverse impact on the environment or on human health. The company noted that all areas of the manufacturing facility are reinstating normalcy with the exception of coal gasification operations.Eastman Chemical is using alternative processes to continue operations of all downstream derivative facilities of coal gasification with repairing works being on track. Though the company is still assessing the financial impact of the incident, it is expected to affect operating earnings in the range of $50-100 million, mostly in fourth-quarter 2017.Eastman Chemical’s shares have moved up 5.5% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 10.6% growth.  Eastman Chemical expects to drive growth on the back of innovation and high-margin products amid an uncertain global business environment. Eastman Chemical believes that disciplined capital allocation and aggressive cost-management policies might contribute to earnings and offset challenges faced by the company in Fibers and ethylene pricing. The company also expects to deliver an additional $100 million of cost savings in 2017. Its cost reduction actions are expected to contribute around 50 cents to earnings per share in 2017.However, Eastman Chemical continues to witness pricing pressure in some businesses. Lower prices of acetate tow are hurting its Fibers unit. Moreover, the company expects ethylene prices to be lower in second-half 2017 vis-à-vis the first half.

264,EMN,"Global chemical production continues its uptrend with August seeing a rise in production amid the impact of the devastating Hurricane Harvey, according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council (ACC). However, the pace of growth eased in the reported month on a monthly comparison basis due to disruptions from Harvey.Growth Moderates in AugustThe chemical industry trade group said that the Global Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) rose 0.4% in August on a monthly comparison basis, down from a 0.5% gain in July. Hurricane Harvey weighed on production in the reported month.The Global CPRI, which is measured using a three-month moving average, measures chemical production volumes for 33 major nations, sub-regions and regions. It is comparable to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) production indices.The ACC also noted that the Global CPRI went up 3.1% year over year on a three-month moving average basis. Capacity utilization for the global chemical industry moved up 0.1 percentage points to 80.7% in August.The results were favorable on a product basis in August. Gains were witnessed in pharmaceuticals, organic chemicals, plastic resins, manufactured fibers, coatings and other specialty chemicals.By regions, gains in production were seen across Western Europe (up 0.5%), Africa & the Middle East (up 0.2%) and the Asia-Pacific (up 0.7%) in the reported month.

267,EMN,"A few major chemical companies are scheduled to report their quarterly numbers on Jul 27. The chemical industry is back on track after bearing the brunt of the global economic crisis. Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on attractive, growth markets in an effort to whittle down their exposure to other businesses that are grappling with weak demand. The industry is also seeing a pick-up in consolidation activities -- exhibited by a wide swath of deals in the recent past -- as chemical makers are increasingly looking to diversify their business and enhance operational scale.While the industry remains saddled by several challenges including concerns over China’s economy and weak demand in the energy space, its momentum is expected to continue through 2017, supported by continued strength across key end-use markets, an upswing in the world economy and significant shale-linked capital investment.Strategic initiatives including continued focus on cost and productivity, operational efficiency improvement and expansion of scale through acquisitions should help chemical makers weather macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds.As per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. Overall Q2 earnings for the sector are projected to rise 1.5% while revenues are expected to increase 2.8%, based on the latest Earnings Outlook.We take a sneak peek at four chemical companies that are gearing up to report second-quarter results on Jul 27.The Dow Chemical Company  will report its results ahead of the bell.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The U.S. chemical kingpin has an impressive surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters at an average beat of 10.77%. Dow faces feedstock cost pressure which may continue to hurt its downstream margins. Moreover, higher maintenance costs may affect margins in its plastics business. Dow is also facing challenges in its agriculture business. Nevertheless, the company is gaining from cost-cutting and productivity actions and continued focus on consumer-driven markets, which should continue to support its results in the second quarter.

270,EMN,"I'm sure a lot of you have experienced the pleasure of waking up and seeing that a covering broker upgraded their rating on one of your stocks.  
"
271,EMN,"I'm also guessing that you probably experienced the opposite, and saw one of the brokers downgrade your stock as well.  
"
272,EMN,"While nobody can perfectly guard against downgrades (or forecast all upgrades), it's important to know how the market reacts so you can stay in your upgraded winners (or buy if youre on the fence). It's also important so you can consider getting out if a downgrade comes your way.  
"
273,EMN,"When I'm screening for new stocks, I like to look for companies that have recently seen a broker rating upgrade. Tests have proven that stocks with broker rating upgrades outperform those that don't get upgraded, and outperform even more dramatically those stocks that get downgraded.  
"
274,EMN,"By how much?  
"
275,EMN,"I created three screens and ran some tests. Each screen used a price and volume qualifier of >= $5 and >= 50,000 shares traded daily (avg. 20 day volume). I then added the Average Broker Rating Change over the last 4 weeks filter. Screen 1: had no upgrades or downgrades - the ABR remained the same, i.e., no change.Screen 2: looked for only those companies that received upgrades (positive changes in their average broker rating).Screen 3: screened for only those stocks that have been downgraded, i.e., negative change in their average broker rating.
"
276,EMN,"The tests confirmed what I had already suspected, though the magnitude was a lot larger. With the Research Wizard's Advanced Backtester, I ran 3 separate tests on each of the 3 different test screens using a 1-week rebalancing period over the last (nearly) 10 years (2000 thru Oct. 2009) to see just how different the results would be with these different filters. Results
"
277,EMN,"The screen with no upgrades or downgrades (their rating, whatever it was, stayed the same) produced an average compounded annual growth rate of 4.7%.
"
278,EMN,"The screen with only positive broker rating upgrades produced a compounded annual growth rate of 9.3%.
"
279,EMN,"The screen with only downgrades, however, performed significantly worse, with an average annual return of -1.3%.  
"
280,EMN,"For the sake of illustration: using a hypothetical $100,000 investment, the screen with the positive broker rating changes would have gained an average of $9,300 a year, while the screen with the downgrades would have lost over -$1,300. That's more than a $10,000 annual difference in fortune, and literally the difference between a gain and a loss.  
"
281,EMN,"After running the upgrades screen, I added the Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) and it increased the returns by more than 2½ times, taking it from a 9.3% average annual return to an 23.6% average annual return.

"
309,EMN,"Overview - Neutral
"
310,EMN,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
311,EMN,"The industry is divided into commodity chemicals (45%) and specialty chemicals (55%). The commodity segment tends to be more concentrated. In the commodity segment, cost reductions, improving yield from better technology and economies of scale are important. In the specialty segment, margins are higher due to better pricing and more efficient operations.
"
312,EMN,"Demand for fertilizers is driven by crop prices that are high levels. At these levels, fertilizer demand should be steady at worst, and with reduced capacity prices should stay firm. The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, natural gas and energy. However, oil and gas prices are falling, and this is providing a windfall.
"
313,EMN,"Many chemical and fertilizer companies have excellent balance sheets. This bodes well for the industry in these times of tightened credit and financial instability.
"
314,EMN,"WEAKNESSES
"
315,EMN,"Demand growth is slightly negative currently. Demand for chemicals tracks global industrial production and global GDP very closely. Housing and auto markets could continue to weaken. Nearly 10% of chemical demand is directly tied to the housing sector, and an additional 10% is tied to the auto sector.
"
316,EMN,"The global slowdown in economic growth will directly affect the chemical industry. Prices may fall in this industry. Pricing power is a function of three variables: inflation, capacity utilization and raw material price changes. Inflation is low (but could increase with aggressive monetary policy), capacity utilization levels are weakening, and oil prices are falling. This suggests a high probability of falling prices.
"
317,EMN,"There is the chance of accelerating capacity growth in 2009-2011, assuming that projects do not get cancelled. This is at a time when demand is slowing and operating rates are falling.
"
318,EMN,"BUY/SELL RATINGS
"
319,EMN,"Celanese (CE  -  Free Report) is rated a Sell due to weak demand growth. Eastman (EMN  -  Free Report) is rated a Sell due to weak demand, overcapacity in the PET market and a decline in free cash flow.
"

In an announcement, Trump and his aides unveiled new reforms in tax policies which effectively lower taxes on businesses and individuals. The proposal seeks to decrease the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Moreover, the pass-through business taxes — currently categorized under the individual tax code — would be slashed to 25%. Subsequently, the plan also revealed that the current seven personal tax slabs would be reduced to only three at 12%, 25% and 35%, respectively.
