Earnings beats weren't enough for JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), while Wells Fargo (WFC) gapped down sharply on an earnings miss. Most financials have been stuck in downtrends, partly due to a flattening yield curve.In related news, California-based First Republic (FRC) jumped 3.8% early after the company reported its fifth straight quarter of 20%-plus revenue growth.

The probability of no change is pegged at almost 93%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe major indexes have been encountering resistance at their 50-day moving averages over the past six to seven sessions. If the stock market is to shake off the negative pressure, retaking the 50-day line is an important first step.Among market watchers, the recent worry is the narrowing of the spread between the 10-year yield vs. the 2-year yield. But the problem with using the yield curve for market guidance is that ""recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the curve inverts,"" as IBD Weekly's cover story ""The Big Squeeze"" pointed out.And not every economist agrees that yields should be the top focus right now. Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke argues that the broad money supply as measured by Divisia M4 is a better guide to the economy. So far this year, Divisia M4 grew 4.8% in January, and 5% each in February and March.Hanke calls that kind of growth ""not bad"" and points to an economy where ""everything is running pretty smoothly.""Then why is the stock market struggling? It's much more useful to focus on what's happening than to search for causation. Individual investors should closely follow the charts for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.What are they showing? The choppiness that began in early February is still in place.On Monday. leaders advancing included Mastercard (MA), up 1.3%, and retailer Canada Goose (GOOS), up 1.4%.Mastercard will report Q1 results Wednesday before the market's open.Several items stand ready to break for either good or bad.First, banks are now expected to win at least a partial battle against some Dodd-Frank regulations. The Hill reported that Congress is near passage of a bipartisan package.Second, a decision on steel tariffs is near. Temporary exemptions for the European Union are about to expire. President Trump reportedly hasn't made a decision. Also, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to leave for China soon for trade talks.Third, IBD's industry group lineup has taken definition. Going into Monday's session, only 10 sectors are outperforming the Nasdaq. New leaders could emerge from the outperforming sectors.The 10 sectors are software, up 13% year to date; consumer, up 8.2%; medical, up 6.9%; leisure, 6.3%; business services, up 6%; retail, up 5.8%; savings and loan, up 5.5%; apparel, up 4.6%; energy, 4.2%; and banks, 4%.Fourth, Trump implied that he can save the market. Speaking in Michigan recently, Trump admitted he is doing something that ""bothers the market."" He said the stock market ""would've been up 60%, but I have to do things. I can't let other countries take advantage of us, so we're doing trade deals.""The implication is that the market will recover once Trump finishes doing things that bother the market.McDonald's rose almost 6%, hoisting the stock over its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines after a strong quarterly report. Earnings increased 22% vs. the year-ago quarter.The Street expected earnings growth of 14%. Q1 revenue dropped 9%, but analysts expected a 12% decline.McDonald's is basing in a 18%-deep consolidation. The stock is 7% under a high marked in late January.The Federal Reserve's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday isn't expected to create big waves. The Street expects the Fed to stand pat on rates for now.

Watch to see if the stock can keep muscling higher, slashing through a very visible overhead supply of willing sellers at the 350 to 360 price range.Tesla's sales jumped 68% last year to $11.76 billion, breaking the $10 billion barrier. But the Palo Alto, Calif., company also lost $8.66 a share. The Street sees Tesla bleeding more red ink this year (an estimated net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018), but then earn $2.37 a share in 2019.The company has a $54 billion market cap and 170 million shares outstanding.In contrast, Toyota Motor (TM) has a $201 billion market cap (share price times total shares outstanding) and 1.47 billion shares outstanding. The global car and truck titan had $265 billion in sales in 2017, up 4%.Toyota shares are forming a saucer with a droopy-looking handle. In a bull market, the handle should show a maximum decline of 8% to 12% from high to low. In Toyota's case, the correction within its three-week handle is an acceptable 9%. The provisional buy point is 138.68.McDonald's (MCD) surged more than 3% to 168.48 in active turnover.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.95%.Chevron (CVX) posted a bullish gap up, rising 3.75, or nearly 3%, to 127.13.

Those invitations come via email or the Starbucks app.So far, the results have been encouraging. The company tried out its new  approach during the quarter and reported ""strong incremental profit"" that ""appealed disproportionately"" to customers that were not yet signed up for its Starbucks Rewards program, said executives on the call Thursday.""We are optimistic about what we saw in response to happy hours and we are seeing greater response from happy hours from our non-(rewards customers) versus (rewards) customers, so everything is very early, but it's very promising,"" said Starbucks Global Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan.The company said it also plans on introducing a new Frappuccino next week.Shares are sliding late after closing up 2.9% to 59.38 in the stock market today, gapping up above their 50-day average, as the stock builds the handle in a cup-with-handle base with 60.80 entry point.After the closing bell Thursday, Starbucks met Q2 earnings views and just squeaked by revenue forecasts, following Dunkin' Brands' (DNKN) solid earnings beat in the morning.Starbucks posted EPS of 53 cents on sales of $6.03 billion. Same-store sales rose 2% globally and in the U.S., said the company.Zacks Investment Research analysts expected an 18% rise in profit to 53 cents a share on 11% revenue growth to $5.899 billion, per Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales at company-owned locations were seen growing 1.9%, including 1.8% comps in the key Americas market, according to Consensus Metrix estimates.""While we continue to be pleased with the sustained growth from espresso, tea, and improvements in throughput during peak hours, we still worry that SBUX does not have the meaningful initiatives to improve its sales trajectory to support valuation expansion,"" wrote Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh late Thursday, before the call started.For the year, Starbucks reaffirmed fiscal 2018 guidance for $2.48-$2.53 EPS and high-single-digit revenue growth, but noted that the current outlook doesn't account for its planned store closings on May 29.Management remained bullish on its plans for China, an area of growth for the company.Starbucks only has a Relative Strength rating of 46, meaning that it is outperforming 46% of other publicly traded companies. But the RS line is spiking higher and near a recent high. Shares have largely been trading sideways since late 2015, hitting an all-time high of 64.68 in June of last year.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

13,MCD,"In a move to further trim fat from its management layers, McDonald's (MCD) announced at a town hall meeting on Tuesday that it will eliminate its regional structure and reduce corporate headcount.XThe new plan -- part of Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook's multiyear push to streamline operations at the world's largest restaurant chain -- will reduce its field offices, a move the company says will result in faster decision making and more support for franchisees. Levels of management will be reduced to six from eight, according to an internal company memo.Investors have applauded the company's move to transform itself into a leaner operation, with shares rising about 70% since Easterbrook took over. But some franchisees may be skeptical of the move, since McDonald's will ultimately be counting on fewer workers to cover more ground, according to Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG.""I could see how this would be good for shareholders because you're taking costs out of the business,"" Saleh said. ""But how is it good for franchisees? I'm not sure.""Franchisees operate about 90% of McDonald's 14,000 U.S. locations. Some owners and workers have been at odds with the company recently due to more complicated menu items and different kitchen procedures, making it tough for employees to keep up with changes.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMcDonald's downplayed on Tuesday any difficulties the changes might cause. Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald's in the U.S., said the shift means that franchisees will get closer to the company and new items will get on the menu faster.Restaurant owners will get a substantial boost in support for new technology, and more time with corporate representatives, according to the company's internal announcement.McDonald's didn't disclose how many jobs it will cut or how many offices it would close. The company will report a charge of $80 million to $90 million in the second quarter related to severance pay and the closing of field offices, according to a statement on its website.Saleh said the moves are part of the company's broader push to improve efficiency.""Is it really all that material? Not really,"" he said. ""It's something, but it's kind of more refinement and trimming around the edges versus a major shift for them.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

14,MCD,"Americans' long-running joke about a Starbucks (SBUX) on every corner may be nearing its end.The coffee behemoth is retrenching in its home market as it contends with sales growth that Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson acknowledges isn't fast enough. The cafe chain said Tuesday it expects comparable sales to rise just 1% globally for the current quarter—the worst performance in about nine years. That's well below the 2.9% analysts were expecting, according to Consensus Metrix.Starbucks also plans to close about 150 company-operated stores in densely penetrated U.S. markets next fiscal year, three times the number it historically shuts down annually.""Our growth has slowed a bit,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""I expect better, I think our shareholders deserve better, and we're committed to address that.""At the same time, the company appears headed for a tough quarter in China, with comparable sales flat or slightly negative in the current period, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said in a presentation. China remains a key market for Starbucks, with the chain betting that revenue there will triple over the next five years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlthough business abroad has been booming and the chain has been opening more and more cafes, U.S. sales growth has stalled for the company that brought espresso to the masses. With about 14,000 stores domestically, Starbucks is now pumping the brakes on licensed and company-operated locations, with a renewed focus on rural and suburban areas—not over-caffeinated urban neighborhoods where locals already joke that the next Starbucks will open inside an existing store.The closing stores are often in ""major metro areas where increases in wage and occupancy and other regulatory requirements"" are making them unprofitable, Johnson said. ""Now, in a lot of ways, it's middle America and the South that presents an opportunity.""For the ubiquitous chain, moving slower and shutting unprofitable stores may trigger some deja vu. In 2008, longtime leader Howard Schultz returned to the company that was struggling after expanding too quickly across the U.S., giving competitors like McDonald's (MCD) a chance to elbow back into breakfast. Investors cheered as Schultz retook the helm and closed some underperforming stores, and share prices at the chain have been up eight of the last 10 years. So far this year through Tuesday's close, shares have been essentially flat.But now, with Schultz stepping back from his beloved company, the task of the righting the ship will fall to Johnson, who took over as a CEO just over a year ago. Schultz, who had already transitioned away from running the coffee chain's day-to-day operations, announced earlier this month he'd be leaving the company, fueling speculation he could be gearing up for a political career. Veteran retailing executive Myron Ullman is taking over as the new head of the board as Schultz departs.While Schultz had been trying to expand the Seattle company's premium business, dubbed Reserve, along with Italian bakery Princi, analysts have speculated that these may be put on the back burner under the new leadership. The company is also facing a resurgent McDonald's, which has been advertising $2 cold-brew coffees, along with other steep discounts from fast-food rivals.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S. and a lot of that is the fast-food chains really improving the quality and breadth of their offerings in terms of hot beverages and breakfast,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. Americans can ""get that same flavor profile at a much lower price somewhere else. That becomes an area of concern for Starbucks.""Starbucks has also faced backlash this spring after two black men were arrested at one of its stores in Philadelphia while waiting for a meeting to begin. The company and Johnson apologized, calling the arrests ""reprehensible."" Last month, Starbucks closed about 8,000 cafes so its employees could undergo racial-bias training, which did hurt sales in the quarter, Johnson said. After stores reopened following the May 29 training, sales have started to rebound at U.S. locations, with the chain expecting domestic same-store sales growth of around 3% in June, according to the company.The company now expects to report adjusted earnings of between $2.39 and $2.43 per share this fiscal year, down from an earlier forecast of $2.48 to $2.53, according to an investor presentation.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S.""Starbucks says it can attract more diners in the U.S. with new menu items and will focus on its expanding tea business, as well as capitalizing on health and wellness trends. Starbucks just added a new mango-dragon fruit iced drink to its permanent menu in the U.S. and Canada. And it's focused on improving its food lineup with sous vide egg bites, plus a new line of lunch salads and sandwiches that it's expanding across the nation.""We're putting more of our energy into that afternoon day part and the portfolio of beverages that are offsetting some of the declines we're seeing in Frappuccino beverages,"" Johnson said, citing a consumer shift away from sugary drinks. The company is also preparing to ""lean into more plant-based beverages,"" he said, noting that a new plant-based protein cold-brew drink will be introduced this summer.The chain is also relying on its digital initiatives to contribute between 1 and 2% to comparable sales next fiscal year. There's going to be a new way for non-rewards customers to earn stars and rewards starting next spring, allowing visitors to cash in on loyalty without fully signing up.On Tuesday, Starbucks said that it will return more cash to shareholders—about $25 billion in buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020, representing a $10 billion increase from the previous guidance. Additionally, it plans to cut general and administrative costs, and has hired a consultant to help in this area. It's also exploring options to license some company-operated stores ""in other appropriate markets,"" it said.The company earlier this year said the cash it got from a licensing deal with Nestle SA would go to support the company's growth in the U.S. and China, where its expansion has been explosive. Starbucks plans to more than triple revenue in China in the next five years and open a new store every 15 hours through 2022 in that market. Johnson confirmed Tuesday that China may one day be a larger market for Starbucks than the U.S.""The China market still offers a lot of potential,"" Bartashus said. ""But the current political environment with trade wars looming or the governments picking at each other—it definitely casts a shadow over the long-term prospects for large western brands that are in China.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

McDonald's wants to lower administrative costs by $500 million by the end of next year.McDonald's over the past year has expanded delivery and mobile ordering, and packed more self-service kiosks into its restaurants. Earlier this week, Easterbrook said the company will install kiosk and mobile order technology in 1,000 locations every quarter for the next eight to nine quarters. Wendy's (WEN) has also installed self-order kiosks in an effort to curb labor costs.Those moves follow an upending of the way customers order fast food — a change hastened by the likes of Grubhub (GRUB) and Uber Eats.Shares of McDonald's jumped 4.4% to a four-month high of 169.48 in the stock market today.

It also got a boost from its gourmet burgers as well as its new value menu, which franchisees had worried would hurt receipts.One way to play McDonald's and other blue chips is by investing in exchange traded funds that own the stock. For instance, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) tracks the 30-stock index. Shares have been consolidating mostly below the 50-day moving average since a sharp pullback from a late January peak.If the fund builds the right side of a base, it could offer a buy point at 266.03. It may also set up earlier buy opportunities along the way as it climbs past previous points of resistance. Keep in mind that all purchases are riskier than usual when the market uptrend is under pressure.The $21.1 billion fund turned 20 years old in January. The Dow Jones industrial average, one of the oldest U.S. market indexes, was launched in 1896 with 12 stocks. Today, the 30 components are much more diversified.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDIA's performance has been largely in line with the broader S&P 500 index. The ETF was down 1.3% through Friday, according to Morningstar Inc., trailing the S&P 500's 0.4% gain in the same period. Average annual returns over the past three years came in at 13.1% vs. 10.5% for the S&P 500, and nearly in step with the S&P 500 over the past five, 10 and 15 years.The Dow stocks tend to be your so-called Steady Eddies — big companies with a proven earnings history. So, the stock prices typically don't move up or down as much as say, smaller growth stocks.There are options for those who prefer a more high-octane play, in the form of leveraged funds. Leveraged ETFs aim to provide double or triple the performance (or inverse performance) of an index. Of course, that means investors could also lose that much more money. These plays tend to come with a higher expense ratio than plain-vanilla funds.

Items among the 128 include fruits, ginseng, nuts, wine, pork and some steel products. The value matches that of the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.Beijing has more ammunition if the trade dispute intensified. China has not yet included a large range of major U.S. agriculture products, such as soybeans.A week ago, China called for talks with the U.S., but the Trump administration did not respond.Another concern for the stock market is President Trump's attacks on Amazon.com (AMZN). Trump recently tweeted that Amazon does not pay enough in taxes, is a burden to the U.S. Postal Service and is putting ""thousands of retailers out of business!""If that sounds like a Latin American populist, therein lies the problem.For populists, attitude means more than facts.

But Grubhub, the only publicly traded name among the three, has been rapidly consolidating smaller regional delivery plays since its launch in 2014.And it has some deep-pocket backing of its own.

40,MCD,"Starbucks (SBUX) Chairman Howard Schultz will leave the coffee chain later this month, bringing to a close a nearly four-decade run at the company that ushered coffeehouse culture into mainstream American life and carved out a global restaurant empire to rival McDonald's (MCD).XSchultz, 64, who helped grow Starbucks from 11 stores to more than 28,000 in 77 countries, will become chairman emeritus on June 26. Myron Ullman will take over as the new head of the board, the company said in a statement.His exit will likely fuel speculation he could be gearing up for a presidential bid. In a letter to employees announcing his exit, he said that he is ""thinking about a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service, but I'm a long way from knowing what the future holds.""Schultz's announcement was calculated to make a big splash. He gave an extended interview to the New York Times in advance, with an interview on CNBC scheduled for Tuesday morning. If Schultz decides to make a bid for the presidency, he could lean on the experience of one of a longtime board member, the former presidential candidate and ex-Senator Bill Bradley.Schultz is leaving a Starbucks that is still growing in the U.S. -- but not at the spectacular rates of the past. The company, now one of the world's largest restaurant chains, is betting big on China, where it plans to more than triple revenue in the next five years. But investors have been underwhelmed by the company's new outlook, with the shares falling about 11% in the last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The chain closed about 8,000 company-owned stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training last week, a decision that some shareholders questioned for the expense.Last April, Schultz transitioned from chief executive officer to executive chairman, where he oversaw the company's social impact initiatives. He also was working on growing the chain's premium Reserve brand that includes flagship roastery locations, as well as the partnership with Italian bakery Princi. His top lieutenant Kevin Johnson took over the CEO role last year.New chairman Ullman is a retail executive, who left the helm of J.C. Penney (JCP) in 2015 after stints at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA and what's now Macy's (M).Schultz will be spending more time with his family this summer, as well as working on a book about the chain's social impact, the company said.Shares fell as much as 2.8% in late trading after the announcement.

47,MCD,"The Dow Jones industrial average stood head and shoulders above other key indexes at midday on Thursday, even after a mild pullback in early-afternoon trade.At 1:15 p.m. ET, the Dow gained 0.7% after rising more than 1% thanks to early two-point gains from at least 10 of the Dow's 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and McDonald's (MCD).Home Depot and McDonald's are in base-building phase, and a well-built base could give investors a chance to buy at a key moment of market strength.Low weekly jobless claims helped sustain confidence in the U.S. economy, and comments by White House economic advisor Peter Navarro, broadcast on CNBC, apparently helped relieve anxiety over the potential for a major trade war.Bullishness among market pundits polled each week by Investors Intelligence, meanwhile, jumped this week to 54.9%, but optimism is not excessive. In mid-January, ahead of the early-February market sell-off, the bulls ratio reached as high as 66.7%.The Nasdaq composite erased an early-morning loss of 0.3% to turn more than 0.2% higher before slumping to the breakeven point. Overall, the intraday swing is light, though. The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1%. Discount and variety retail, hospital, mining equipment, ethical drug and truck transport firms paced the upside. Volume is running slightly lower vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.The Dow transports is now up just 0.4% after being up as much as 0.7%.Despite the indexes' gains, breadth was slightly dour. Falling stocks beat gainers by more than 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by fewer than 200 issues on the Nasdaq.Home Depot is trying to bottom out after falling more than 15% below a 207.60 all-time high. The do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me home improvement products chain had rallied 28% following a September breakout from a solid flat base with a 160.96 buy point.Home Depot sports a decent 87 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, boosted by a strong 92 EPS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99.McDonald's, which has dropped 18% from its all-time peak of 178.70, rallied nearly 2% and is trying to regain its critical 200-day moving average. The fast-food chain's 50-day line has been sloping lower for more than five weeks, a negative sign.When high-quality stocks rally 20% to 25% from a proper buy point, it's an excellent idea in terms of portfolio management rules to take at least partial profits. IBD research has found that many leading stocks will top out and begin a serious correction after rising 20% to 40% past a breakout point.Software remains an important growth theme in the stock market today. While Palo Alto Networks (PANW), a big stock market winner in 2015-16 and former Leaderboard stock, has shown renewed strength, its group peer VeriSign (VRSN) is also acting well.The former is aiming for a 14th gain in 15 sessions; at 189.30, the large-cap network security leader has risen nearly 21% from a base breakout at 156.95. The latter rose nearly 2% to 125.35 in volume running double its usual levels and has climbed nearly 6% past a 118.38 entry in an 11-week flat base.Four highly dynamic and fast-growing companies in the business software space maintain a position currently within Leaderboard.The Dow transports rallied 0.3% as Covenant Transport (CVTI) launched a breakout, gapping up at the open and rising nearly 18% to 32 in huge turnover. That move catapulted the trucking services firm past a 30.71 proper buy point in a five-month base.The 5% buy zone extends up to 32.24. Buying more than 5% past a proper buy point can hand a new investor the added risk of being shuffled out of the stock with a fast loss of 7%-8% during a normal pullback to or even slightly below the breakout price.The golden rule of investing is to cut losses short, even if a stock has a history of outperforming. You don't want to get caught with a stock that has finally topped after a huge price run.IBD's research on big stock market winners over the past century has found that when a true market leader breaks out, it rarely falls 7% to 8% below the correct buy point. But after a 10% or 15% move up or more, it's not uncommon for the stock to dip back and test holders' resolve. So if an investorThe base built by Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant doesn't have the look of a well-formed cup-with-handle or a double-bottom, but the months long base was built on top of an even longer, deeper consolidation. The chart has elements of base on base patterns, which can be very bullish.The company has notched earnings gains of 56% and 52% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters as revenue rose 9% and 6%.

The Dow Jones component has rolled out delivery and mobile order and pay, plans to spend a bunch of money on creating more digitized restaurants, and tried to muscle in on Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and Starbucks (SBUX) through cheap coffee promotions.X But a key part of its value game — its $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu, which launched in January — might not be connecting with customers.RBC, in a research note dated Friday, says the $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu is off to a ""tough start."" And analysts there slashed their first-quarter U.S. same-store sales estimates for McDonald's to a 1% gain, down from expectations for 3.5% growth, citing ""a disappointing early sales impact from the $1, $2, $3 menu"" and broader disappointment in the fast-food industry overall.RBC also cut its price target on McDonald's stock to 170 from 190 and cut its earnings-per-share estimates for this year to $7.43 from $7.60.

New products, including the addition of  fresh-cooked hamburger patties to more restaurants, could also help.""We believe fiscal stimulus from tax reform, improving wage growth, low unemployment, and food-at-home inflation should drive more traffic to discretionary occasions in the remaining three quarters of 2018,"" he said, adding that McDonald's business internationally should also remain strong.Wendy's rose 1%, while Jack in the Box edged up 0.9%.

Monster has begun working with the English Premier Soccer League and tried to have more of a presence in esports — both of which are popular in the nation, Cowen analysts have noted.And as McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX) and convenience stores battle over customers' caffeine dependency, Monster has also bulked up on its own coffee drinks: Caffe Monster — which the company is in the process of launching in the U.S. — Java Monster, Espresso Monster and others.Shares of McDonald's rose 0.2% after-hours, while Starbucks edged up .01%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How McDonald's Will Invest $6 Billion In The U.S. Through 2020Cashless Stores And Cryptocurrency: What Is Starbucks Up To?Monster Beverage Tumbles Below Buy Point On Low-Energy Earnings

Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) advanced on the Dow Jones industrial average, though McDonald's (MCD) and Boeing (BA) weighed heavily.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.5%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) was up 0.3% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) fell 0.5% in the stock market today. Small caps rallied with iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) up 1.6% each. QQQ is showing relative strength by finding support at its 50-day moving average.Biotech, oil explorers and semiconductors were among the biggest sector fund gainers. Health care stocks including Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) advanced on the Dow Jones industrials. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) exchange-traded fund reversed sharply higher to a 2.5% gain.Also among blue chips, Apple (AAPL) reversed from an early loss to a slight gain, and was near the flat line. It continues to hold above its 50-day line and is 3% below a new record intraday high from earlier this week.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) were up 0.5% each, as gold prices rose 1.4% to $1,323.20 an ounce.

An early-December bounce off the 50-day yielded an 11% gain to its Jan. 26 high. It was featured in this ETF column on Dec. 6.That said, all buys are riskier when the market uptrend is under pressure. So it's crucial to keep a close eye on how XLK and the broader market are faring before making any purchases. The ETF suffered a steep drop from the late-January high to its Feb. 9 low, so conditions haven't been exactly ideal.The $20.5 billion fund, which tracks the Technology Select Sector Index, marked its 20th anniversary in December. Software accounted for the biggest chunk of assets as of Feb. 28, at just over 21%, while internet software and services weighed in at 18% and tech hardware storage and peripherals at 17%. IT services and semiconductors or chip equipment were next at about 16% each.XLK's top five holdings were Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and class A and C shares of Alphabet (GOOGL). Those five represented 43% of the 71-stock portfolio. Apple has seen bullish news this week. Warren Buffett said on Monday he bought more shares of the iPhone maker than any other stock in the past year.

RBC analysts said they believe that sales trends have slowed for the company despite its 4 for $4 discount deal, which RBC said has helped draw customers since it debuted in 2015.RBC analysts said they would be interested to see how the company might move forward, as rivals turn to cheap-food deals that appear to be picking up market share.""Wendy's has recently emphasized its fresh beef — directly contrasting that to McDonald's,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote in a research note last week. ""Our guess is that Wendy's is attempting to position itself as the 'original' fresh beef player, and McDonald's as a copycat when it introduces fresh beef quarter-pounder later this year.""He also wondered whether Wendy's might use any benefits from President Trump's tax cuts toward a makeover of its stores.

69,MCD,"At Taco Bell, Brian Niccol was seen as a turnaround artist of sorts. He was an early believer in mobile ordering. Nacho fries, Doritos Locos Tacos, Quesalupas and breakfast? All of them appeared on Taco Bell's menu on his watch.X But as he prepares to take the helm at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) in March, leaving the Yum Brands (YUM) unit, a similar approach — possibly resulting in a more mobile Chipotle with more food choices and a better loyalty program — would raise new questions about the assembly-line format, pared-down menu and higher ingredient standards that once won it praise from Wall Street.Niccol's appointment, announced late Tuesday, has generally made analysts happy and taken a massive weight off its stock. Shares sprinted 15.4% higher to close at 289.91 in the stock market today. Chipotle stock has fallen for more than two years, hitting a five-year closing low Tuesday, following food-safety concerns and continuing disappointing sales.But restaurants' efforts to allow people to order via smartphone have occasionally chafed with the actual locations themselves. Starbucks (SBUX) has been trying to untie the knots of customer traffic that have formed at its locations due to the popularity of its mobile order and pay service. As delivery proliferates, others, like McDonald's (MCD), have had to tweak how they manage the flow of cars through their parking lots as they roll out mobile ordering and delivery.Ivan Feinseth, research director at Tigress Financial, said moving food-prep duties like cutting vegetables off-site could help Chipotle move customers through lines more quickly as digital orders grow. A new loyalty program, paired with a mobile app, could mean fewer cash payments — which slows down lines — from consumers willing to pay more, he said.""They don't reward their loyal customer base,"" he said. ""Taco Bell has a very robust loyalty and mobile ordering app.""Chipotle Mexican Grill has already introduced second-make lines, or lines that sit behind the main ordering stations, to handle digital orders. During its Q4 call, Chipotle said wait times have fallen on those lines. It plans to have second-make lines in at least 30% of its restaurants by the end of this year.Feinseth also called for the company to expand delivery and open for breakfast — something McDonald's doubled down on in 2015 to turn its sales around. He said Chipotle could easily do a breakfast burritos and bowls menu. Mexican-blend coffee, he said, along with plain coffee, wouldn't hurt either.Those changes would be possible, he said, without deviating from Chipotle's core menu. And he remains upbeat that people will respond to new additions.""While people do like simplicity and consistency, the quick-casual industry also drives traffic by change,"" he said.The fast-casual Mexican chain's new products, so far, have had mixed reception. People said the queso was too gritty. Others said its brand of chorizo, a combination of pork and chicken, was not chorizo-y enough.What's more, Chipotle is not Taco Bell. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, in a research note, said that Chipotle's sales trends are in far worse shape than Taco Bell's were when Niccol joined that chain in 2011.""The guys at Chipotle tried a lot of things,"" said John Zolidis, president at Quo Vadis Capital. ""They didn't just sit there waiting for the customer to come back.""Zolidis said Chipotle's higher food standards — ""Food with Integrity"" and the like — may have also made it more difficult to bring in new menu items.""I don't think Taco Bell was holding itself to that same standard,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How McDonald's Will Invest $6 Billion In The U.S. Through 2020Restaurant Brands Doubles Payout: Dividend Yield Now Tops McDonald's, Wendy's

70,MCD,"Can food delivery specialist DoorDash go beyond delivering hot food to your door to dropping off stuff like diapers and electronics? Not at the moment, but that's ultimately where the tech unicorn's ambitions lie.""If you can deliver a burrito hot or you can deliver ice cream that does not melt, you can deliver anything,"" DoorDash CEO Tony Xu told Investor's Business Daily at retail industry conference Shoptalk on March 20.The San Francisco-based food delivery service serves over 100,000 businesses across 600 cities in the U.S. and Canada. DoorDash recently announced plans to nearly triple that to 1,600 cities, thanks to a SoftBank-led $535 million round of funding. Food courier rivals include Grubhub (GRUB)-Seamless, Postmates and Eat24, which Grubhub bought from Yelp (YELP) last year. UberEats, another player, is the main delivery partner for McDonald's (MCD).But whether DoorDash and its peers find success beyond hot food delivery is a question mark. Hot food is a high-margin arena, McKinsey analysts say, and players who aren't in a clear lead will have to find new growth markets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For the many runners up, a new hunting ground is needed, but it will be hard to come by,"" they wrote in a July 2017 report. ""Markets such as groceries or nonfood retail do not offer the same rare combination of high gross margins and high urgency as hot food does.""Even Amazon (AMZN) is in the mix. The online sales giant partnered with food delivery firm Olo in September, offering the Olo's restaurant database on Amazon Restaurants, including Chipotle (CMG), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Wingstop (WING). (The announcement pinched Grubhub stock for a session.)And Facebook (FB) rolled out a new food ordering feature in October, with DoorDash as one of its third-party couriers.""One of the hardest things about restaurant delivery is knowing where all the offline assets are,"" said Xu. ""Where are the parking spaces? Which line should we enter to pick up the food? Do we enter through the front door or the back door? All of these things are things we first must digitize, then study, then build into the product itself.""As it looks to expand to 1,000 more cities, maintaining quality is tough, he said. But Xu intends for DoorDash to become a ""last-mile logistics layer"" in which ""you'll be able to see us deliver any type of good.""Still, McKinsey analysts asserted in July that profitability will be ""out of reach"" for startups trying to expand beyond hot food.

On Friday, shares tumbled intraday to their worst levels since late April.Restaurant Brands in recent years has grown through acquisitions, most recently by snapping up Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen last year.""We believe these trends/sales momentum likely continue as compares remain easy and BK continues to leverage its scale and innovative pipeline to compete on value,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note released shortly after the company's earnings.He said he was also pleased to see Tim Hortons same-store sales stay in positive territory and would be looking for more detail, during Restaurant Brands' earnings call, on how the company might turn things around at Popeyes. Palmer also said he'd be looking for more commentary about restaurant competition in Canada.Restaurant Brands' results follow those of McDonald's late last month, when the company said it would invest roughly $6 billion over the next few years, in part to bring more technology to its restaurants.McDonald's stock rose 1.9%.

73,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on Tuesday clocked a fourth-quarter same-store sales increase that just beat estimates, but the fast-casual Mexican chain sees 2018 comps decelerating from last year.X The forecast comes as analysts wait for new leadership to step in and offer clarity on how the company plans to rebound following a handful of food-safety scares over the past two-or-so years.Chipotle on Tuesday said was making ""good progress"" on its attempts to find a new CEO. The company said in November that it was looking for a new chief executive with ""demonstrated turnaround expertise"" to replace Steve Ells, who founded the company in 1993. Ells, Chipotle said, would become executive chairman once the search concluded.How that progress might sit with Wall Street remains unclear. Cowen analysts said in a research note this month that survey data indicate that Chipotle's ""quality as well as value perceptions are near trough levels both among the general population as well as the brand's core 18-34 year old consumer base.""""Upcoming efforts to improve these measures and in turn drive sales are unclear until a new CEO is hired,"" they added.The company on Tuesday forecast same-store sales gains in the ""low single digits"" this year, compared to a 6.4% boost seen in 2017.In a statement, Ells said that ""while there is still work to be done, we are starting to see some success,"" in the turnaround efforts.For the fourth quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.9%, above Consensus Metric forecasts for a 0.7% gain. Revenue rose 7.3% to $1.1 billion, missing estimates for $1.117 billion.Chipotle earned $1.34 per share during the quarter, when factoring out a 21-cent per-share bump it got due to the GOP's tax legislation. That was better than views for $1.33.Shares rose 1.2% after hours in the stock market today, after rising in the minutes following the earnings' release.Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM), which reports Thursday, was unchanged after hours. El Pollo Loco (LOCO) picked up 0.5%. McDonald's (MCD), which reported earnings last week, rose 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The company said it planned to invest more than a third of the savings resulting from the Trump tax cuts into its employees. CFO Jack Hartung said Chipotle would make its managers and crew eligible for one-time cash and stock bonuses, and improve other benefits.In the days leading up to Tuesday's earnings, some analysts wondered whether Chipotle would use the occasion to announce a new chief executive.Chipotle's stumbles have resulted in Monty Moran's departure from the role of co-CEO in 2016. The company has also shaken up its board and spent more to strengthen its safety standards. It has focused on new menu products and ways to improve traffic and the experience of dining there overall.The launch of Queso didn't do as much for sales as expected, although the company changed the recipe after customers complained that it had an off-putting, grainy texture. Chipotle also faces more competition from smaller rivals that have used the Chipotle formula — serving food marketed as higher quality on an assembly-line format — for their own success, Cowen said.Already, as Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote last month, two ""dream candidates"" for the CEO job at Chipotle had apparently been ruled out.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) CEO Patrick Doyle, who will step down from that position in June, had been seen as one potential candidate. But at the company's investor day in January, Doyle suggested the speculation about what he'll do post-Domino's wasn't close to accurate.""There are all sorts of conspiracy theories out there on what I'm going to do and every single one of them is incorrect,"" he said.Ron Shaich, the former CEO of Panera Bread who was also a rumored candidate, was perhaps bit more direct, tweeting: ""why in the world would I ever leave Panera to go try to solve Chipotle's problems?""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Options Play Helped Control Earnings Risk With Restaurant BrandsJack In The Box Sells Qdoba In Hot Year For Restaurant MergersDomino's Pizza Shows Improved Relative Strength; Still Shy Of Benchmark

74,MCD,"Stocks rose early on Tuesday but the Nasdaq surrendered moderate gains to fall mildly. The Nasdaq composite, up more than 0.6% during the first hour of trading, slumped 0.5% right before lunchtime in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 0.7% after the open, edged slightly lower.Alphabet (GOOGL) helped lead the pullback, falling more than 1% to 1,153. The Google site operator and pioneer in self-driving technology is forming a new base after selling off hard in early February. The megacap internet content firm limited its decline to 17% from a 1,197 peak as shares found support at the 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, semiconductor shares also cooled but still show high relative strength.ASML (ASML) was off around 0.2% but at 210.95 the Dutch chip equipment giant still held above a 208.68 buy point in a three-month base on base, one of the most powerful chart patterns that top growth stocks form before breaking out to new highs and strong price advances.ASML has grown its earnings per share by 25%, 74%, 115%, 34%, 46% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters on revenue gains of 17% to 53%. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the megacap member of IBD's semiconductor equipment firm gets a solid but not great EPS Rating of 88. Q1 profit is seen rising just 1% to $1.13 a share, burdened by a very big gain (115%) in the year-ago quarter.At the market get-go, investors applauded the arrival of tamer U.S. consumer price increases in the U.S. and looked past the sudden termination of President Trump's Secretary Of State, Rex Tillerson.The CPI index and the core index both showed a 0.2% rise in February, down from much bigger month-to-month gains in January.Within the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, just three names rose 1 point or more, including UnitedHealth (UNH), McDonald's (MCD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).General Electric (GE) marked the Dow industrials' index's low end, down more than 3%. JPMorgan Chase reportedly cast doubt on the viability of GE's already reduced cash dividend. The industrial powerhouse is slated to pay shareholders 12 cents a share on April 25 to holders of record Feb. 26. That gives GE an annualized yield of 3.3%, vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500.GE holds a 3 Relative Price Strength Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, meaning it's outperformed just 3% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The large-cap S&P 500 let gains of 0.4% slip to a 0.1% loss near lunchtime on Wall Street after finishing 0.1% lower on Monday. Yet the 500 continues to create a solid cushion above its 50-day moving average, a healthy sign for stocks. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% on Monday, hit new highs again with another 0.4% jump. The Nasdaq is aiming for an eighth straight advance.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, on Friday the Nasdaq spurted into new high ground, ending a six-session phase in which the market uptrend was under pressure. The current outlook is now back to ""Confirmed uptrend,"" which means that investors can actively search out breakouts in big volume by companies with high-quality fundamentals.The S&P SmallCap 600 edged 0.3% higher early before sliding to a 0.1% loss. At 972, the index is up 3.8% year to date.Among small caps, Canada Goose (GOOS) flew back above its key 50-day moving average as shares jumped more than 2% to as high as 33.87, then settled back. It's the second rebound back above the 50-day moving average, offering a new secondary buy point following an early-November breakout at 22.10.The seller of ultra-premium outerwear and cold weather apparel has been a stunning stock within the apparel and retail group, tripling in price since its March 16, 2017, IPO at 12.75 a share.Canada Goose cleared a first-stage cup with handle at 22.10 on Nov. 8, catapulting higher the next session on solid quarterly results (earnings up 32% to 29 cents a share, sales up 35% to $172.3 million). Last month, Canada Goose posted another solid quarter of growth with EPS up 38% and sales up 27%.The Street sees the small cap firm posting a net loss of 6 cents a share in fiscal Q4 ending in March vs. a net profit of 17 cents in the year-ago period. In the quarter ended June 2017, Canada Goose lost 13 cents a share.Despite the checkered bottom-line results over the past two years, influenced by the seasonality of its merchandise mix, Canada Goose gets a 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Lumentum (LITE) held on to Monday's strong gains and then some, rising 0.6% to 72.35. The expert in 3D sensors for smartphones and other optical communications components has cleared a 66.80 early entry point in a deep seven-month base and is 8% past that buy point.In February, the company reported a big turnaround in earnings, up 193% in the December-ended fiscal second quarter to $1.67 a share, ending a two-quarter slump in profits. Sales leapt 53% to $404.6 million.In a Feb. 6 IBD technology story, industry analyst and Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster noted that Lumentum management indicated 3D sensor revenue should more than double in the second half of 2018 over 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, top industry groups, breakouts and financial markets.)RELATED:Do You Know The Golden Rule Of Investing?Finding Great New IPO Leaders: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Cisco, Google?The Latest In Investor's CornerWant To Sharpen Your Market Timing In Buying Stocks?

75,MCD,"The major market indexes held modest gains Monday ahead of a federal tax reform vote later this week, as General Electric (GE) weighed on blue chips.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.2%, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) were up 0.1% each. Foreign stocks lagged with iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) fell 0.5%.General Electric weighed on the Dow with an 8% drop after the diversified giant offered weak profit guidance and slashed its dividend by half. But Procter & Gamble (PG), McDonald's (MCD) and Home Depot (HD) added about 1% each.Banks, utilities and metals miners led the upside among sector funds in the stock market today. SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) rose more than 1% apiece as they traded near their 50-day moving average lines.SPDR Utilities (XLU) added 1%, clearing a 56 flat-base buy point. Shares advanced 2% from a mid-August breakout from a flat base to the start of the most recent pattern.SPDR Consumer Staples (XLP), which holds P&G and Wal-Mart, gained 0.5%. It retook its 50-day line on Friday and is 4% below its 52-week high as it works on the right side of a five-month flat base.Energy, retail and biotech underperformed.If you like dividends, here are several funds to check out, including one that owns big yielders like AT&T (T) and IBM (IBM).The top two dividend exchange traded fund performers this year are focused outside the U.S. WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend (DFE) led with a 28.9% year-to-date gain through Nov. 8, followed by WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend's (DFJ) 28.1% return. Both funds have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.The rest of the list is predominantly composed of U.S. ETFs. Two other foreign plays made the 13-fund cut: SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) and SPDR S&P International Dividend (DWX), with respective YTD returns of 18.1% and 15.8%.The No. 3 spot was claimed by WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW), which was up 21% through Nov. 8. IShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO) was fifth with a 17.7% gain.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.Most of these dividend funds are extended from a buy point. But SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), the last name on the list, is pulling back toward its 50-day moving average. If it finds support there and stages a solid rebound off the line, that would set up a potential buy area.Shares advanced 3% from a late September breakout to its Oct. 24 intraday high. Or, taken from its last touch of the 50-day line in early September, SDY rose more than 5%.While the fund's 9.8% YTD gain lags the S&P 500 index, its three-year average annual return of 10.2% is in line with the broader index's 10.8%. SDY offers a higher annualized yield of 2.4% vs. the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout.Consumer staples accounted for SDY's biggest sector weighting as of Nov. 8 at nearly 16% of assets. Industrials made up 15%, financials 14%, and utilities and consumer discretionary, 11% each. Top holdings included Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT), AT&T and IBM. Those three stocks yield annualized dividends of 6%, 5.9% and 4%, respectively.The 12-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, has amassed $16 billion in assets. Its expense ratio is 0.35%. The index is designed to measure the performance of companies in the S&P 1500 that have consistently increased dividends every year for at least 20 years.Thursday's pick, ProShares Ultra Russell 2000 (UWM), is still testing support at its 50-day line.RELATED:These 3 Sectors Buck Sell-Off; High-Octane Play Near Buy Point?

The Berkeley, Calif.-based company said it plans to launch the drug in the first quarter of 2018.  The premarket move implied the stock would open at a new high, but its current chart pattern is too deep and short to offer a valid buy point.IBD 50 stock Nvidia (NVDA) climbed 5% on quarterly results, reported late Thursday, that cleared analysts' targets by wide margins.

78,MCD,"Stocks got hammered in afternoon trading Thursday as investors appeared to feel discouragement over the Senate plan to go slow in cutting U.S. corporate taxes.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq cut some of its early losses, yet still paced the broad decline, falling 0.9%. At one point the composite index lost more than 1.4%. The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) mirrored the 1.4% decline.At least 13 of the 30 components in the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1 point or more, pushing the popular average down nearly 1%. They included Goldman Sachs (GS) (still above its 50-day moving average, a good sign), McDonald's (MCD) (a gap down, but still well above its 50-day line, also good), and Caterpillar (CAT) (in a strong uptrend, no defense-type sell signals for now).The S&P 500, down almost 1.1% early, cut its decline to less than 0.6%.Breadth is negative across the board; at one point, losing issues outmatched winners by a nearly 5-2 margin on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.The S&P SmallCap 600 was off 0.5%, nearly cutting early losses in half, yet extending its weekly loss to nearly 1%. The 600 was also briefely back below its critical 50-day moving average.Chip equipment firms led the downside among tech stocks, falling nearly 4% as a group. Lam Research (LRCX), a member of IBD Big Cap 20, currently ranked No. 2, dropped more than 3% to 204.32 in mildly above average turnover. The specialist in wafer etching systems still trades well above its fast-rising 50-day moving average. Lam's most recent breakout was at 170.10.Elsewhere in the market, other leading industry groups were not immune to the decline. Among the top 20 ranking within IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, truck transport, residential building, educational software, automation and material handling machinery all fell at least 1%. Industries bucking the decline included mail order retailing, department store chains, apparel and shoe retailing and long term medical care, each up more than 1%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, is holding up quite well, despite at one point falling as much as 1.7% to an intraday low of 173.14. While the stock is on course to snap a five-day win streak, the iPhone giant has a nice cushion of gains since surging past a 160.97 entry in a brand-new cup with handle.Volume is running around 10% above usual levels.Apple is still up more than 46% since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 back on Jan. 6-9.There are at least five reasons why longer-term holders can sit and watch to see if Apple can rally another 20% from its latest entry. One is the fact that despite a temporary pullback in late September, the stock did not trigger any IBD sell rules.For instance, it did not fall 7%-8% below a prior flat-base buy point of 156.75. This is the golden rule of investing.Four more reasons to keep holding:One, growth is accelerating, and CFO Luca Maestri made it 100% clear in last week's news release: ""Apple's year-over-year revenue growth rate accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter and drove EPS growth of 24% in the September quarter,"" he said.IBD's Stock Market Today columns, since November of last year, have frequently noted that the prospects of a re-acceleration in top- and bottom-line growth in the consumer electronics and digital services giant was very good.Apple's revenue jumped 12% to $52.58 billion, up from gains of 3%, 5% and 7% in the prior three quarters. After-tax margin boosted 120 basis points higher to 20.4%.Two, some highly rated mutual funds are establishing new positions in Apple, including at least four funds with an A or A+ for 36-month performance by IBD, as of the second quarter of this year. Strong institutional buying is critical to a stock's long-term rise.Three, Apple's Composite Rating continues to improve on Stock Checkup, recently jumping to a very respectable 93 on a scale of 1 to 99. On Jan. 1, the Composite was 57.Four, Apple's relative strength line has jumped into new high ground. See the RS line, painted in blue, on any IBD chart or on MarketSmith. A rising RS line means a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.Microsoft (MSFT) is down around 0.5% to 84.09 in nearly flat turnover. Watch to see if the big player in Big Data, cloud computing services and business software can hold its recent bullish gap up in price.The stock is still 15% above a 72.99 entry in a solid flat base.That flat base began during a decline in the week ended June 9 and lasted five weeks, the minimum length required for this sideways-moving chart pattern. The flattish action indicates that big investors are reluctant to dump massive quantities of shares back into the market.In Microsoft's flat base, the correction from head to toe was a very mild 6.6%.Snapchat site operator Snap (SNAP), noted in a Sept. 20 Stock Market Today article regarding the prospects of its shares falling below 10 a share, lopped off another 4% to 12.38 in volume running double its 50-day average. The social media network got slammed Wednesday after reporting its smallest year-over-year revenue increase since going public March 2.Revenue rose 62% to $207.9 million, but that's a far slower gain vs. the increases of 406%, 286% and 153% in the prior three quarters.The company lost 14 cents a share in Q3, bigger than the 9-cent loss a year ago.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

79,MCD,"Domino's Pizza (DPZ) on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, though the bottom line was aided by an accounting change.XEstimates: Earnings per share of $1.22, a 27% jump, on 11% revenue growth to $631 million. System-wide same-store sales were expected to rise 6.5%, while international franchise comps were seen up 3.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: EPS of $1.27 on revenue of $643.6 million. The adoption of new accounting guidance earlier this year shrank Q3's provision for income taxes and boosted EPS by 7 cents.Domestic same-store sales jumped 8.4%, though that's down from 9.5% growth in Q2, and international comp sales grew 5.1%.Stock: Shares closed down 3.9% at 201.03 on the stock market today, after falling more than 6% in premarket trading. On Wednesday, Domino's shares had crept closer to a 221.68 buy point in a cup-shaped base. Rival Papa John's (PZZA) fell 1%, and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands (YUM) dipped 0.3%.The earnings come shortly after Domino's Pizza Group, a large franchisee for the pizza chain in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe, reported Q3 same-store sales growth of 8.1% in the U.K., topping estimates, according to a Nomura-Instinet research note.Weaker international results, particularly in parts of Europe, weighed on Domino's second-quarter results, which were reported in July.CEO Patrick Doyle, during the company's earnings call at that time, cited weaker consumer confidence in U.K. and issues around ""making sure we're getting value right"" in the nation. But he said that even as food-delivery options grow in the U.K. and the U.S., business hadn't been affected. And he said at the time that the problems in Europe were ""known and fixable.""Shares at that time also sank in part on weaker operating margins, the sense that the company's tax rate accounted for much of its EPS, and that no accelerated payouts were announced after a recapitalization.IBD'S TAKE: While delivery has largely been pizza's domain, more options, from chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Jack in the Box (JACK), have become available.Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, in a research note on Wednesday, said that worries over Domino's international difficulties were likely to be ""short-lived."" While he said that the company was heading into more difficult comparisons in the U.S., he liked the company's prospects, citing ""explicit value"" in the company's $5.99 Mix and Match offering and a ""growing technology and delivery moat.""Still, Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said that with more companies trying to compete on food delivery, there was little room for error, and that any dent in same-store sales could further worry Wall Street.""When companies such as McDonald's (MCD) and Amazon (AMZN) are entering your core business ... we get concerned,"" he said in a research note.RELATED:Ford, Domino's Carpool On Pizza DeliveriesStocks Generating Improved Relative Strength: Domino's Pizza

80,MCD,"Key U.S. indexes were mixed Thursday afternoon with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the declines as Facebook (FB) weighed. But  Apple (AAPL) reversed higher.XPowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) slid 0.5% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gave up 0.1%, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) turned 0.1% higher in the stock market today.Facebook stumbled more than 2% despite reporting positive Q3 results late Wednesday. Apple reversed to a 0.5% gain ahead of its earnings report due out after the close. Both stocks remain in a buy zone from their recent respective breakouts. Amazon (AMZN) pulled back 0.7% but is in buy range from a 1083.10 entry it blasted past last week following its earnings.Among sector plays, homebuilders, telecom and energy led the downside. SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XBH) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) gave up 2% and 1.5%, respectively.But gold miners, retail and real estate plays advanced. Gold futures were slightly higher, as were West Texas intermediate crude prices.When is an ideal time to buy shares of an exchange traded fund?Much like an individual stock, a breakout from a proper base or a solid rebound off the 50-day moving average line are two opportunities.SPDR Consumer Discretionary (XLY) is getting close to the former. It's trading just below a 92.65 buy point of a flat base. The fund rose 9% from a late-January flat-base breakout to the start of the current pattern. It also offered several opportunities to get in at bounces off the 50-day line along the way.Like the broader market, the $11.6 billion fund is trading near all-time highs.

Late Wednesday night, House GOP leaders shifted to making a 20% corporate tax cut permanent, but Home Depot (HD) and other housing stocks fell on plans to cap the mortgage interest deduction.XAfter the close, investors will turn their attention to market leader Apple (AAPL) and its quarterly earnings release. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.1% and the S&P 500 lost 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was just below break-even.Among the Dow Jones Industrial components, the iPhone maker edged 0.2% lower, and remains in buy range from a 160.97 cup-with-handle entry.

Meanwhile, investors will look for more details on iPhone X demand, which will go on sale Friday.Elsewhere on the Dow, McDonald's (MCD) set the pace, rising 1%. Shares are at the top of a 5% buy range from a 160.08 flat-base entry.On the downside, Home Depot (HD) gave up 2%. The stock is approaching its 50-day line, but remains above a 160.96 buy point. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) tumbled 6%, while Lennar (LEN) tested a recent buy point.Among companies reporting earnings in the stock market today, FANG stock Facebook (FB) declined 2.1%, despite crushing the Street's Q3 earnings and sales targets late Wednesday. Shares remain in buy range from a 175.59 flat-base entry.Electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) skidded 7%, as shares plunged through their long-term 200-day moving average line to levels not seen in almost six months.

82,MCD,"Large and megacap stocks mostly continued to hold firm amid another whirlwind day of quarterly results. Tesla (TSLA) led the downside among companies reporting as the innovative electric vehicle maker likely posted its biggest quarterly net loss on a per-share basis since it came public in June 2010.XTesla gapped down at the open and slid more than 7% to 297.85. Volume is running nearly four times the usual pace; the big cap trades on average 5.42 million shares each day.Meanwhile, all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) as it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close.The stock is behaving well since clearing a new buy point in a decent cup with handle. The classic chart pattern shows a 160.87 buy point. Apple's cup with handle formed next to a flat base created from May to July. The buy point from that base was 156.75, and Apple, currently at 168.43, has lifted 7% above that correct entry. It is less than 5% from the 160.87 entry.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.4%, despite a nearly 2% sell-off in Home Depot (HD). The stock is getting buying support, however, at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement chains fell on reports that President Trump and the GOP are mulling the idea of reducing the mortgage interest deduction from taxes.Eight of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rose 1 point or more, including industrial plays 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) as well as consumer spending bellwethers such as McDonald's (MCD).At 3:45pm ET, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 edged slightly up. The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.3%.Going back to Tesla, the stock posted a critical sell signal when it fell 7% below a recent breakout past a 370.10 entry in a cup with handle of its own. That base began forming when Tesla peaked at 386.99 on June 23.While that base had a normal-sized decline of 22% from head to toe, one problem with the base was that it revealed numerous sharp declines, including gap downs, in heavy or increasing volume. That's a no-no; you'd prefer a stock to show quiet, smooth price action on a day to day and week to week basis.Those who bought at Tesla's breakout in the spring of 2013 near 50 still hold a very large profit cushion and can afford to hold patiently. The stock is 23% off its 52-week peak of 389.61, and that is not severe.However, two more reasons for newer shareholders to sell include the following:One, the stock is now on the verge of forming a deeper, longer base. It's going to take a while before Tesla will set up again. Keeping shares means that you lose the opportunity to invest in a stock that currently shows more horsepower.Two, Tesla failed to deliver on its promise to rapidly ramp up production and deliveries of its Model 3, its most affordable e-vehicle yet. Now, the company must deliberately slow down production in its highly successful Model S to meet already huge demand for the Model 3. Continued failure to manage institutional investors' expectations and beat them may result in heavier selling among fund managers.Tesla's third-quarter revenue rose 30% to $2.98 billion, which is a quarterly record. However, that gain also represents a deceleration in the top-line growth rate. Sales grew 27%, 22%, 33%, 145%, 88%, 135% and 120% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Elsewhere, Sony (SNE) jacked up more than 3% to 44.91 in heavy turnover, extending its breakout out of a three-month flat base with a 41.75 entry. The base also has elements of a double bottom. From that perspective, the buy point was 40.59, 10 cents above the middle peak within the shallow base.Despite the breakaway gap on Tuesday, one could try to buy as close as possible to that session's opening price of 43.21 because that price was within the proper buy range, up to 5% past the 41.75 flat-base entry.Sony, one of Japan's most famous manufacturers and innovator in the video game space, reported a huge increase in adjusted Q3 profit (90 cents a share vs. 4 cents a year ago) as revenue climbed 10% to $18.3 billion, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least four years.Sony has helped Japan's Nikkei 225 enjoy strong gains in 2017. The Japanese equities benchmark finished 0.5% to 22,539 overnight, extending its year-to-date gain to 17.9%.At 2579, the S&P 500 is up 15.2% since Jan. 1.Returning to Apple, watch to see if the company can not only post another quarter of respectable double-digit earnings growth but also give hints as to whether business can accelerate during the holiday quarter and beyond.Earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.Apple, featured in Stock Market Today columns frequently as it formed a bottoming base in the last quarter of 2016, has risen more than 43% since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.In other financial markets, traders bought U.S. government bonds, pushing yields a touch lower following news that the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is at 2.35%. President Trump, meanwhile, formally announced he's picked Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve.RELATED:Finding Superb Market Outperformers: Inside IBD 50Still The Golden Rule Of SellingWhat Does A Great Cup With Handle Look Like, And Why Does It Make Money For Traders?How To Invest: Use A Stock Checklist, Boost Your Portfolio ReturnHow To Find Excellent Stocks With Investors.com: Start Here

89,MCD,"Citing the expected benefits from the GOP's tax cuts, McDonald's (MCD) said the company and franchisees would invest some $6 billion over the next few years to accelerate the overhaul of its U.S. business and the digitization of its restaurants.X Those plans came on top of fourth-quarter results that mostly topped forecasts. But U.S. same-store sales growth merely met what were high expectations for the burger chain.McDonald's said it will invest about $2.4 billion this year and a similar amount next year, with the balance of the $6 billion coming in 2020.The company plans to bring touchscreen self-ordering kiosks and table service — part of a restaurant makeover the company calls ""Experience of the Future"" – to more than 4,000 of its U.S. restaurants this year and open roughly 1,000 new locations. The company also plans more spending on technology. The ""Experience of the Future"" layout is already in about one-third of McDonald's restaurants.Meanwhile, the company's mobile app has grown to some 20 million registered users. McDonald's said it would continue to expand delivery service, but not at the rate seen last year.CEO Steve Easterbrook, during a conference call with analysts, said the company had made a transition from ""turnaround"" to growth last year. But as McDonald's tries to keep apace in a world habitually reaching for its smartphone, questions in the future could become more pointed over whether its spending — on technology and training staff to use it — is paying off.McDonald's said it would launch a marketing campaign in the coming months to promote delivery and mobile ordering. While Easterbrook said that delivery was a ""meaningful contributor"" to sales in big markets, he also said the U.S. was ""a little behind"" other established markets in guest counts.McDonald's shares closed down 3% at 172.48 in the stock market today, dipping below their 50-day line for the first time in four months. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) eased 0.5%, Jack in the Box (JACK) fell 2.2%, and Wendy's (WEN) lost 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But McDonald's new restaurant overhaul and the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu introduced this month have irked some franchisees, according to a Nomura-Instinet survey released last week.Some in the survey said the discount menu would make it more difficult to be profitable. One franchisee said the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu ""may not last the entire year."" In another remark from the survey, a franchisee lamented the absence of a ""biscuit product on the lineup"" of the dollar menu.On the conference call Tuesday, one analyst also questioned whether franchisees were chafing at the enlarged menu and McDonald's plans to expand. Easterbrook said franchisees were optimistic but also had their share of ""anxiety"" over the workload.Management during the call said it was too early to tell specifically how the new discount offering was doing, and that it could take three to six months for consumers to recognize and get used to it.For the fourth quarter, McDonald's EPS rose 19% to $1.71, above expectations for $1.59. Revenue fell 11% to $5.34 billion amid efforts to franchise more locations, but came in better than forecasts for $5.26 billion.Global same-store sales rose 5.5%, beating views for a 5% move higher, while U.S. comps advanced 4.5%, in line with Consensus Metrix estimates.The results follow another disappointing quarterly showing from Starbucks (SBUX), whose iced-coffee and espresso shots have faced stiffer competition from McDonald's own coffee promotions and McCafe drinks, along with competition from Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and convenience stores.And as fast-food chains compete with independent restaurants and try to entice customers with cheap deals, McDonald's in October warned that its investments could pinch margins.Separately, Chili's parent Brinker (EAT) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings early Tuesday but revenue and same-store sales below views.

95,MCD,"Wages: On Monday, CaliBurger started its newest ""employee,"" a learning robot that can cook 150 hamburgers an hour. Flippy doesn't just flip hamburgers, he exposes why raising the minimum-wage hurts workers.X Flippy, built my Miso Robotics, uses thermal imaging to tell it precisely when to flip each patty, allowing for more or less perfect consistency. And it supposedly will get smarter the more burgers it flips, and various attachments will eventually let it handle other aspects of the burger-making process.The fact that CaliBurger decided to use its Pasadena, Calif., restaurant to launch Flippy is instructive.In less than three months, Pasadena's minimum wage will climb to $12 an hour for those with 25 or fewer employees, and $13.25 for those with 26 or more. Those are higher than California's current state minimum wage, which is also climbing and will hit $15 by 2022.In some respects, automation like Flippy is an inevitability, as computers and robotics get increasingly sophisticated. Replacing workers with robots has been going on for decades.But raising the minimum wage will accelerate this trend by making even costly robots a better deal than increasingly expensive, minimally skilled workers.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

96,MCD,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowCaliBurger, for example, reportedly spent at least $60,000 for its Flippy, plus a reported 20% annual fee for maintenance. But with Pasadena's minimum wage set to climb to $13.25 by midyear, replacing workers with a robot looks like money well spent.McDonald's (MCD) and other fast-food chains have been replacing thousands of workers with ordering kiosks in its stores.Of course, plunking down $60,000 for a robot is an option for a successful restaurant like CaliBurger, which has outlets in California, Canada, Mexico, China and elsewhere.But that level of automation is typically not an option for smaller companies, many of whom will simply end up closing shop when they can't afford to give their entry-level workers a big raise. Others will cut the hours of their minimum-wage employees to offset the added cost, or hire fewer workers.Any way you slice it, this means fewer jobs for those who need them most, jobs that let them gain workplace skills and habits that will help them move up the income ladder.This isn't even controversial. Economic studies consistently show that higher minimum wages reduce employment.As we noted in this space recently, a study from the American Action Forum projects 261,000 jobs will be lost because of state and city minimum-wage hikes going into effect this year.A study released last summer by the University of Washington found that Seattle's minimum wage hike to $13 actually caused weekly earnings to drop because the wage increase was more than offset by a reduction in hours worked.As a result, low-wage workers ended up seeing earnings decline an average of $125 a month.A 2014 study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and indexing it to inflation would kill 1 million jobs.A review of 100 academic studies going back 20 years noted that the vast majority of them ""found consistent evidence of job loss effects on low-skilled workers.""Heck, we'd go so far as to say that the adverse impact of minimum-wage increases is settled science. If you're still not convinced, take a trip to the Pasadena CaliBurger and see what the minimum wage of the future looks like.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Don't Cheer Minimum-Wage Hikes — They're Killing Millions Of JobsThe Bitter Lesson From Seattle's Minimum Wage HikeA Minimum Of SanityClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry and we're going to learn as quickly as possible. We also believe that it does provide an opportunity to get more people access to the financial system,"" he said, according to the Seeking Alpha transcript.During the fourth quarter, however, Bitcoin ""was really immaterial,"" said Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar, according to a transcript provided at website Seeking Alpha.""We were just beginning with the product,"" Friar said. She called the bigger January rollout ""a really exciting milestone.""As for Square's balance sheet, Friar added: ""We've kept a very small amount of Bitcoin that's held by Square. That allows us to just add a little bit more liquidity as we are growing, but our intent is not to hold a lot of Bitcoin on the balance sheet.""For regular purposes, Square Cash is being used at locations such as McDonalds (MCD), Walmart (WMT), and ride-hailing service Uber, Square says.San Francisco-based Square in November began testing a Bitcoin exchange so that users of its Square Cash app could buy and sell the digital cryptocurrency.

Despite the charge, the aerospace giant raised full year cash flow outlook and its full-year core EPS to $9.90-$10.10 from a prior view of $9.80-$10.00. But the EPS midpoint is still under analyst views. Boeing's Q3 EPS fell 22.5% to $2.72, but topped forecasts for $2.65, while revenue rose 1.7% to $24.31 billion, above estimates.

Intel topped Wall Street's targets for third-quarter sales and earnings and guided analysts higher for the current quarter. Rival AMD delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results, but disappointed with its guidance for a flat gross profit margin in the current quarter. The biggest loser was Ultra Clean, which plummeted 21% on Thursday after mixed third-quarter results.RELATED:Intel Beats Third-Quarter Goals, Guides HigherGeneral Motors' (GM) Q3 EPS fell 23% to $1.32 as revenue shrank 21% to $33.62 billion, amid a broad slowdown in U.S. car sales, a planned reduction in fleet sales, and a retreat from certain European, African and Asian markets.

T-Mobile added 595,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the September quarter, while Sprint added 279,000.  AT&T (T) lost 97,000 as it reported flat profit and a 3% revenue drop. AT&T says it expects the $85 billion purchase of Time Warner (TWX) to close by year end. Some analysts say the sell-off in AT&T was related to equity dilution expected from the TWX deal. AT&T is issuing stock to finance half of the deal. On the plus side, analysts say all four carriers, including No. 1 Verizon (VZ), have been restrained in promotions for the soon-to-be released high-end Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which could improve margins for the December quarter.Cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter (CHTR) reported higher video subscriber losses and lower broadband customer additions. Comcast had lowered guidance in early September, sending its stock down 10% ahead of Q3 earnings. Charter stock fell after it disclosed similar trends.

Before Tuesday's report, analysts were expecting fiscal year EPS of $5.29 on revenue of $42.94 billion.Stock: Caterpillar shares jumped 5% to 138.24, hitting a new all-time high intraday. Caterpillar is second-best performing Dow industrials stock in 2017, up 49%. Boeing (BA), which reports earnings Wednesday, has soared 71% year to date.Caterpillar's strong results drove the Dow industrials, with United Technologies (UTX), McDonald's (MCD) and 3M (MMM) also lifting the blue-chip index early Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Caterpillar shares cleared a buy point of 99.46 when the company blew past Q1 earnings estimates. A buy point is the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for near-term gains, and Caterpillar has been a case in point, gaining more than 30% over the past six months. Here is a good place to start to look for other quality stocks that may be nearing buy points and poised for gains.On Monday, Caterpillar reported that global retail sales accelerated in each of its three main business lines over the past three months, with sales of machinery for resource industries up 8% vs. the year-ago period, construction machinery sales up 15%, and energy and transportation equipment sales up 5%.Commodities have rebounded, lifting demand among miners for heavy equipment, while housing markets in the U.S. and China remain robust.

Several leading biotech stocks tested key levels as Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are all on tap with earnings this week.S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value.

The Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 1.1%, its ninth straight decline after hitting a 22-month high on Oct. 11. Even so, it's still rated No. 1 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.Biogen reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday morning. Amgen and Vertex follow on Wednesday, while Celgene, Alexion and Gilead Sciences report Thursday.In addition to Biogen, a slew of big earnings report Tuesday, including McDonald's (MCD), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Motors (GM) before the open.Biogen earnings rose nearly 21% to $6.31 a share as sales climbed 4% to $3.08 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $5.70 and revenue of $3.04 billion. Biogen is a leader in multiple sclerosis drugs and it has a new hit with Spinraza, the only spinal muscular atrophy drug on the market. But investors are also bullish on the prospects for aducanumab, which has indicated in early testing that it can reduce cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients.Biogen shares rose 1% before the market open on Tuesday. On Monday, the stock fell 2.8% to 328.55 in Monday's stock market trading, their third straight decline, and closed just above the 5% buy zone from a 312.50 entry initially cleared at the end of August.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Amgen, Vertex and Gilead Sciences fell below their 50-day moving averages on Monday. Amgen closed below an old 182.70 buy point for the first time since its Sept. 11 breakout. Amgen, Vertex and Gilead are in new flat bases.Vertex busted out in July on promising data on a new cystic fibrosis drug. Gilead Sciences is best known for its HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C drugs, but last week won FDA approval for its CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug, Yescarta, comes from Gilead's recent acquisition of Kite Pharma.Gilead earnings are expected to fall 24% to $2.08, as hepatitis C drug sales tumble. Amgen EPS is seen up 2% to $3.09. Vertex earnings are expected to go vertical, surging 131% to 37 cents.Celgene shares rose 0.9% on Monday, but that's after tumbling 10.8% on Friday.

112,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) is on track to report consensus-beating U.S. same-store sales growth for the third quarter, helped by cheaper drinks and fancier sandwiches, an analyst said Thursday, after earlier research indicated the burger chain could fall short of expectations.XLongbow Research analyst Alton Stump said McDonald's was on pace to put up 4%-4.5% comp growth for the quarter, easily topping the 3.4% consensus, Benzinga reported.Stump, who upgraded McDonald's to buy from neutral, cited a beverage promotion and Signature Crafted sandwiches, with the expansion of delivery service possibly also contributing to a lesser degree.That forecast would follow a more bearish one from the analytics firm M Science, which said earlier this month that McDonald's domestic same-store sales and revenue were on track to miss expectations. Shares suffered their biggest drop for the year following M Science's estimates.Shares of McDonald's jumped 2.2% to 157.49 in the stock market today, reclaiming support at their 50-day line and heading back toward their 160.08 buy point after breaking out from a flat base on Sept. 11.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) edged up 1 cent to 63.88, still in buy range. Wendy's (WEN) dipped 0.1% and Jack in the Box (JACK) added 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: The restaurant sector has struggled amid competition and discounts. Even onetime standouts like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have fallen off recently. How can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The forecasts come as analysts also try to parse how hurricanes Harvey and Irma will affect the restaurant industry's finances. McDonald's has 6% of its total stores in Florida, Cowen & Co. estimated this month.However, Credit Suisse analyst Jason West, in a note last week, said he did ""not believe the recent hurricanes and rising gas prices have had a material impact on results"" for McDonald's. And the firm remained optimistic about McDonald's, saying ""business momentum remains intact, despite weaker industry trends of late.""West said he liked the prospects of McDonald's delivery services, which he said could be a ""meaningful contributor"" to same-store sales next year as more customers become aware of the service. The company's value additions to the menu and the rollout of fresh-beef patties next year should help too, as should store remodeling efforts.RELATED:Here's Why McDonald's Stock Is Reversing A Day After Breaking OutYY Breaks Out; Why Apple's Rally Isn't Over; McDonald's Triggers Sell SignalStocks With Rising Relative Strength: Wendy's

113,MCD,"Stocks showed a tad of oomph on Tuesday after Monday's technology sell-off, but small caps and transportation-related issues continued to gain more traction in late-afternoon trading.XMeanwhile, Apple (AAPL) defied the listless action of the Nasdaq composite, which nevertheless rebounded a little more than 0.3% at 3 p.m. ET and is still holding the fort in its defense of the 50-day moving average. The former gained nearly 2% to 153.48 in heavy trading and is trying to snap a sharp four-day sell-off.The Nasdaq 100, a gauge of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic Nasdaq exchange, is up more than 0.4%. But the Nasdaq 100-tracking Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF remains a tad below its 50-day moving average. QQQ is up an impressive 20.9% since Jan. 1.Watch to see how turnover in Apple, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap, finishes today; Apple's average volume over the past 50 sessions is 29.2 million shares. A significant rise in above-average turnover would be bullish for Apple shareholders.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were up no more than 0.1% to 0.2%. Dairy, medical services, and select retail stocks rebounded, while gold mining, biotech, ethical drug, medical research and equipment, and fertilizer stocks lagged with losses of 0.7% or more.Truck, airline and other stocks helped push the Dow Jones transportation average up 0.7%, matching the S&P SmallCap 600's gain. Volume was running lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time on Monday.Since its Aug. 24 recent low, the Dow transports have rallied 8.5%, broadly outperforming the S&P 500's 2.4% rise over the same time frame. The Nasdaq composite is up just 2% over the four-week period.Despite growing fears, as seen in news headlines, that the market is getting frighteningly close to a major peak, the market's technicals continue to refute such thinking. On the NYSE, winning stocks were beating losers by more than a 3-to-2 margin, and ditto for the Nasdaq.As seen in the ""What's The Market Trend?"" page, a daily PDF link at the bottom of IBD's Big Picture column, the NYSE advance-decline line continues to mark new highs. A rising NYSE A-D line is one sign of a healthy uptrend.No doubt the huge advance since the March 2009 bottom certainly makes the market vulnerable to a correction, especially if a geopolitical event such as military conflict in North Korea takes hold, or the Federal Reserve suddenly accelerates its intention to raise the cost of money. However, for now, an improving U.S. economy, prospects for economic recovery in Europe, increasing global trade and low interest rates around the world could set the stage for further gains in global equity markets.The last time the S&P 500 fell more than 5% from its 52-week high was during a 12-week spell from Aug. 15, 2016, at 2193 to Nov. 4, 2016, at 2083, right before the historic Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Going back to Apple, even though the stock has recently pierced its 50-day moving average (as seen in red on a daily chart at Investors.com) and dipped below the 156.75 proper entry in a flat base, the recent action is not unusual. Many great stocks, both big cap and small cap, will test a breakout level and shake out uncommitted holders before resuming their runs.Consider that in the end of 2016, Apple spent nearly seven weeks trading below its 50-day line, then hopped back above it in December. That action ultimately produced an excellent cup-with-handle base that yielded a breakout on Jan. 6-9 this year at 118.12.In the most recent correction, the iPhone giant spent no more than five weeks below its 50-day line. Again, normal action.At this point, watch to see if Apple can rebound in decent volume and return back above the 156.75 entry (10 cents above the flat base's left-side high). If it does not immediately do so, then you can expect the stock to potentially form a new base.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is currently at a decent 78, which is not great compared with the turbo-charged high growth names seen in IBD 50, but is still higher than the 59 it scored on a scale of 1 to 99 at the start of the year.The 85 EPS Rating reflects the positive turnaround in profits in Apple, which has seen earnings turn from a 15% year-over-year drop in the fiscal fourth quarter of last year (ended in September 2016) to gains of 2%, 11% and 18% in the past three quarters.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising another 13% to $1.88 a share in the soon-ending fiscal fourth quarter on a 9% jump in revenue to $50.93 billion.In the Chinese social media sphere, YY (YY) roared into new high ground, rising more than 8% to 84.36 in brisk turnover and clearing an 83.10 entry in a six-week cup base.Volume is on track to almost double YY's average turnover over the past 50 sessions, a telltale sign that large institutions are anxiously grabbing shares.Notice how the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in IBD's charts, has moved into new high ground, a good sign. A rising RS line means that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.The buy zone in YY goes up to 87.26, 5% above the proper 83.10 buy point.YY had earlier flashed a follow-on buy signal when it bounced nicely off its rising 10-week moving average (please see a weekly chart) near 69 in the week ended Sept. 1 in solid turnover. That came after YY's breakout from a cup with handle at 56.31; that cup base was part of a long bottoming base pattern.As this Investor's Corner notes, some stocks can post excellent gains even after bolting out of a cup base that features no handle.YY scores a 99 Composite Rating, the maximum possible, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, due to its stunning combination of excellent fundamentals, relative price strength, and rising fund sponsorship. According to William O'Neil + Co. data, mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the mid-cap Nasdaq stock ($5.2 billion market value; $1.22 billion in sales in 2016) jumped from 214 funds at the end of the second quarter of 2016 to 346 funds in Q2 this year.Meanwhile, among other large-cap firms, McDonald's (MCD) is issuing a sell signal for recent new buyers as shares continued to fall deeper below the 50-day moving average. The restaurant chain was the worst performer within the Dow Jones industrials, tanking 2.47 or more than 3% to 153.79. Volume is running nearly 50% above its usual pace.McDonald's first showed weakness as it dived below its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover two weeks ago. At its recent peak of 161.72, the consumer play rallied as much as 24% past a saucer-with-handle buy point at 130.10.Those with giant gains in McDonald's can be more patient in holding the profit turnaround, as the stock still maintains a big air pocket of gains above its rising 200-day moving average. Large and megacap leaders tend to find solid buying support near or at this long-term moving average during significant pullbacks in price.The 50-day line is drawn in red on all IBD charts as well as on Leaderboard and MarketSmith charts.Any stock that rises 20% to 25% triggers a sell signal, based on IBD rules. That is, such gains are in fact hard to come by in many stocks, and it's a good time to sell on the way up. Many times, a stock will correct in price after rising that much following a solid breakout.IBD's TAKE: One of the keys to strong long-term results in stock investing is to take many gains when your stocks go up 20% to 25% or more from a proper buy point. Read more about this important sell rule in this Investor's Corner column.McDonald's earnings have been on solid footing after a 13% decline in 2014 to $4.82 a share. Since then, earnings rose 4% to $5.01 a share in 2015, 14.8% to $5.75 a share in 2016, and are seen rising another 14% to $6.55 this year.However, the global restaurant chain, despite launching an interesting ""NEXT"" eatery concept in Hong Kong that includes fresh vegetables, quinoa and other superfood items, has not been able to get out of its sales rut. The top line has fallen vs. year-ago levels for 12 quarters in a row.RELATED:Income Investing: Why You Should Watch This Major Utility Stock NowHow To Make Money In Stocks: How Do You Grow $2,500 Into Something Substantial?Tech News: The Latest In Artificial Intelligence And ChinaThe Key To Making Big Money In the Long Term: Sell On The Way Up This Way

114,MCD,"The stock market closed mixed Tuesday, as a rebound faded in afternoon trading.XThe Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% and held up at the 50-day moving average, a test of support that will help determine whether the index can bounce back or sink deeper.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were nearly flat as indexes could not rebound much at all from Monday's losses.Dow component McDonald's (MCD) fell nearly 2% as it burrowed deeper below its 50-day moving average. The stock's break below the 50-day line this week is troubling because it is the first significant drop below the line since the stock began a run to new highs in early April. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is the wost-possible E, adding to its weak profile, and a weak restaurants industry group is not doing McDonald's any favors.Small caps, however, continued to outperform. The Russell 2000 added 0.5% and made a new high for the second day in a row.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) broke out above the 15.09 buy point of a flat base in heavy trading, though shares closed slightly below the entry. The company's fundamentals need repair. Hewlett-Packard has a lowly Composite Rating of 50 while the company's EPS have fallen six of the past seven quarters.YY Inc. (YY) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, closing above the 83.10 buy point. Volume was about double the average, which gave the breakout more emphasis. The breakout was all the more impressive because of the way that Chinese internet stocks sold off Monday.YY, a social media platform, was the best-performing stock in the IBD 50. Without the 9% gain, the IBD 50 might not have closed higher Tuesday, judging from the mixed performance on that screen.Among other breakouts, Select Medical Holdings (SEM) cleared the 18.90 buy point of a base-on-base pattern, but the stock closed a few cents below the entry. Volume was about average. H&E Equipment Services (HEES) climbed above the 27.64 buy point of a cup without handle. Volume was about 40% more than normal.RELATED:What Caused Facebook Stock To Drop The Most In 10 Months?FCC Says Competition Lives In Wireless For First Time Since '09

115,MCD,"Key U.S. stock indexes were narrowly mixed in the stock market today as the Dow outperformed, thanks to big gains by UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).XIn early afternoon trading, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) held a 0.1% gain, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) was down 0.1% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was barely negative. Foreign markets lagged as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) fell 0.5% and iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) slipped 0.3%.Among sector plays, health care, retail and utilities advanced. But oil, financials and gold miners declined. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) gained more than 1% as it remains in a buy zone from an 81.31 flat-base entry. Component stocks UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson leapt 7% and 3%, respectively, after reporting quarterly results.Gold funds dipped along with gold futures, which gave up 1.2% to $1,287 an ounce. Most oil ETFs were also lower as West Texas intermediate crude prices slid 0.4% to $51.66 a barrel.If you missed buying an ETF at its last breakout, it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on it. You might get another chance.We featured iShares Select Dividend (DVY) in this June 27 column as the fund headed toward a potential test of its 50-day moving average. However, the ETF instead consolidated to form a flat base. DVY climbed past a 94.79 buy point of the new flat base on Oct. 11, and remains in buy range from the entry. Shares advanced 3% from a mid-February breakout from a previous flat base to a March 31 high.The $17.3 billion fund, which marks its 14th anniversary next month, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index. It aims to provide exposure to 100 U.S. companies with five-year records of paying dividends. Utilities made up the biggest chunk of assets, at just over 29%. Consumer discretionary weighed in at nearly 15%, financials 14% and industrials 11.5%.Top holdings as of Oct. 13 included Lockheed Martin (LMT), CME Group (CME), McDonald's (MCD) and Chevron (CVX). DVY's annual dividend yield is 3.05%, well above the S&P 500's 1.9%.The fund's 9.8% year-to-date return through Oct. 13 lags the S&P 500's 15.9% gain, according to Morningstar Direct. Its average annual returns of 13.2% and 14.2% over the past three and five years, respectively, are roughly in line with the benchmark index. DVY carries a 0.39% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: On the hunt for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility Portfolio (XMLV) is still in buy range from a 44.33 entry of a flat base cleared Oct. 3. It was highlighted in this June 14 column as it neared a buy point. The ETF formed a series of four flat bases since late February. A January breakout from a previous flat base produced a 4.5% advance to the start of the series of bases in late February.The $1.2 billion fund, which tracks the S&P MidCap 400 Low Volatility Index, will turn five in February. The index is comprised of 80 stocks from the S&P MidCap 400 with the lowest realized volatility over the past 12 months.Utilities and financials each accounted for nearly 19% of assets as of Oct. 13, followed by 17% in real estate. Industrials and materials made up 11% and 10%, respectively. Top holdings included Brown & Brown (BRO), Westar Energy (WR) and Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY).XMLV is up 10.9% YTD and has a three-year average annual return of 17.3% vs. 13.2% for the S&P 500. Its expense ratio is 0.25%.Of Monday's picks, iShares MSCI South Africa (EZA) is still just shy of a 63.55 cup-base buy point. First Trust Emerging Markets SC AlphaDEX (FEMS) remains in buy range from a recent bounce off its 50-day line.RELATED:Apple Sends Dow To New High; Emerging Market Plays Near Buy?SSGA Launches Ultra-Low-Cost ETFs; Ameritrade Takes On SchwabSmart-Beta Funds Outsmart Stock Market With Big YTD ReturnsUnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings Beat

116,MCD,"U.S. stock indexes lingered just under the break-even line midday Thursday, as the Dow Jones utility average advanced modestly.The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 were flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 trimmed 0.1% each.XThe Dow Jones utility average, a defensive play, rose 0.5% early but then the gain faded to 0.2%.Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges compared with the same time Wednesday.The session at midday had a lackluster tone. Besides utilities, another caution instrument rising was food and dairy stocks. Going into Thursday's session, dairy ranked last among 197 industry groups. But dairy was up 1% in midday action.Blue chips in the Dow Jones industrial average were about evenly split between advancing and declining issues. Microsoft (MSFT) rose almost 1%, pegging a new high. McDonald's (MCD) also marked a new high as it popped 0.4%. On the negative side, Walt Disney (DIS) gapped down about 1.5%. Guggenheim lowered its price target on Disney from 122 to 105. The stock was trading above 97 midday Thursday.In the Nasdaq 100, construction supply store chain Fastenal (FAST) led with a 3% thrust. The stock is consolidating and is about 13% off its high. Fastenal reported that Q3 earnings rose 14%, matching the Street's consensus estimate. Full-year earnings growth is expected to roll in at 11%, which would be the best growth in five years.Meanwhile, the IBD 50 was mixed. Gainers included chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX), payment processor PayPal (PYPL) and flat-panel-display provider Universal Display (OLED).

117,MCD,"Shares of McDonald's (MCD) sank on Tuesday, a day after breaking out into buying territory, reportedly on concerns over third-quarter same-store sales.XThe news comes as analysts try to parse out which restaurants are likeliest to suffer most in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which have sheared through islands, clogged streets with water and debris, caused widespread power outages and driven gas prices higher.Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the analytics firm M Science said that McDonald's domestic same-store sales and revenue were on pace to come up short of expectations. When reached via phone, M Science declined to provide any information about those trends, saying its research was for clients only.McDonald's shares fell 3.2% to 156.33 in the stock market today, marking the biggest drop in a year and dipping below their 50-day average. The stock cleared a 160.08 buy point Monday and touched a record high. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) lost 2.4% to 63.30, holding just above a 63.04 entry surpassed on Sept. 7.The potentially weaker trends at McDonald's would follow a strong first half of the year for the company, marked by optimism over its efforts to expand delivery and mobile ordering and roll out more connected restaurants.McDonald's has 6.4% of its total stores in Florida, according to a Cowen & Co. research note dated Monday.However, the highest exposure in the state goes to Dunkin' Brands' (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts, with 9.7% of its stores in Florida, followed by Restaurant Brands International's Burger King, with 9%, and Zoe's Kitchen, with 8.8%.IBD'S TAKE: The restaurant sector has struggled amid competition and discounts. Even onetime standouts like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have fallen off recently. How can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.When restaurants reopen after a natural disaster, they typically bring in above-average sales volumes due to pent-up ""cabin fever,"" analyst Andrew Charles said in that note. Insurance could also pad against the financial fallout, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a research note on Thursday.""More broadly, we are concerned about the impact that the recent spike in fuel prices may have on consumers' disposable income and willingness to spend,"" Saleh wrote.""While there is little evidence that gas prices and restaurant industry sales are related,"" the note continued, ""we believe short-term spikes or a breach of the $3.00-per-gallon psychological threshold could have a short-term impact on restaurant visitation and spending habits.""Dunkin' Brands dipped 0.2% Tuesday.

But don't forget about fellow Dow and S&P 500 stocks Microsoft (MSFT), McDonald's (MCD) and Coca-Cola (KO), which all moved into buy zones on Monday.All three Dow buys have notable dividends. Microsoft has a dividend yield of 2.1% and a 15% dividend growth rate. McDonald's has a 2.4% yield and a 6% growth rate. Coca-Cola boasts a 3.2% yield and an 8% growth rate. Apple lags with a 1.6% dividend yield but its growth rate is a robust 24%.Apple will unveil its latest iPhone handsets on Tuesday at an event starting at 10 a.m. PT. The tech titan reportedly will release an iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and an iPhone X. That top-of-the-line iPhone X reportedly will have an OLED screen, facial recognition and other new features.One key question is when the iPhone will actually go on the market and if supplies will be extremely low for an extended period, especially for the iPhone X. Production problems for the newest iPhones have been widespread. Another issue is whether Apple can revive sales in China after several quarters of declining demand in the world's largest smartphone market as people there favor lower-priced domestic handsets.Apple shares rose 1.8% to 161.50 in Monday stock market trading after falling 3.3% last week. The stock is still in buy range from a 156.75 flat-base buy point.

Microsoft has gradually but steadily advanced over the past year, mildly outperforming the S&P 500 index.  Microsoft is benefiting from big gains in cloud computing.McDonald's rose 1.1% to 161.53, closing above a 160.08 entry from a short flat base and notching a new record high.

124,MCD,"Stock fell out of the starting gates Tuesday, as global markets suffered another day of losses and a new partnership announced by Amazon.com (AMZN) rattled stocks across the U.S. health care fields.XThe Nasdaq Composite opened down 0.7% as Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and ExpressScripts (ESRX) put up heavy losses.The S&P 500 traded down 0.6%. and the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped nearly 0.8%, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) down hard and Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) and Chevron (CVX) among the half-dozen other Dow Jones names clocking early losses of greater than 1%.International markets were also posting losses, as bond markets remained under pressure and the dollar continued its slide. Leading benchmarks in Tokyo and Hong Kong fell more than 1% on Tuesday. Stocks in Europe also showed deepening losses in afternoon trade, with London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's DAX diving furthest, each down 0.8%.The Federal Open Market Committee swings into its two-day meeting in Washington Tuesday morning — the last FOMC gathering over which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will preside. A policy announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, though no rate hike is expected this time around.Other economic news for the day is thin, with the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index for November rising 0.7%. That was unchanged from October's reading, and just above consensus views for a 0.6% gain. The January consumer confidence survey from the Conference Board expected at 10 a.m. ET.Health-care stocks were reacting briskly to news that Amazon would partner with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to chart out new ways to provide health care for their U.S. employees, ""through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""The deal suggested that the ""Amazon effect"" — the impact of deep pockets and massive online scale the company brings to its efforts — could begin to assert an impact on health care and insurance industries, the way it has on retail, shipping and other markets.Amazon dropped 1.3%, JPMorgan slipped 0.9% and Berkshire Hathaway was flat. Amazon shares are extended, almost 17% above a 1213.10 buy point following a breakout in early January.On the Dow, UnitedHealth Group dove nearly 5% in opening action.  Other managed care providers responded similarly, with Anthem (ANTM) down 5%, Cigna (CI) sliding 5%, while Aetna (AET) slipped 3% and Humana (HUM) subtracted more than 2%.Shares also dived among pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacy chains, with Express Scripts careening 9% lower to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100.

Some reports said this was on weaker-than-expected demand, others said the move was seasonal and occurred around this time each year. Apple spent a third session below its 10-week moving average on Monday, and starts Tuesday in a test of its prior low, from early December — just ahead of its fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday.Early earnings reports were also a factor in early trade, with McDonald's (MCD) down 1.1% after its fourth-quarter report.

Commodity plays helped pace the downside as agricultural chemical, oil and gas exploration, oil drilling, metal ores and steel shares fell hard.X Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell for the fourth time in five sessions.

Gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 have now been squeezed to 3.4%, and shares are down more than 5% from the 176.34 buy point.Apple's 1.2% slide weighed on all three major indexes, with the Nasdaq composite down 0.9%, the S&P 500 off 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average sinking 1.3%.At least eight of the 30 components within the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 points or more, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM) and McDonald's (MCD). Yet even with Tuesday's decline, at 26,198 the Dow stands 8.3% higher since Jan. 1.McDonald's posted a 19% jump in adjusted fourth-quarter profit to $1.71 a share. But sales dropped 11% to $5.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year drop since the first quarter of 2015.Nevertheless, shares of the fast-food icon have performed well since clearing a long saucer with handle at 130.10 in late March, rolling up more than 38% from that breakout point. As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis. When the current outlook for the market changes, you'll have a good strategy and motivation to take action to either sell stocks and reduce exposure, or hold on to your positions.At this point, a new investor in Apple shares has to decide where to draw the line in the sand. When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. By Jan. 18 of this year, shares rose as much as 52.5%. Over the same period, the Nasdaq composite rallied 32%. The S&P 500 also trailed, rising 22.9%. The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software. Workday (WDAY) rose more than 3% to 120.75 in volume running nearly double its usual levels. The stock is now slightly extended after breaking out of an eight-week cup with handle at 114.98.Find the correct buy point in this pattern by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, which is 114.88.Paycom Software (PAYC), which also excels in the HR and payroll automation and outsourcing markets, erased mild early losses to edge slightly higher. At 92.69, the Oklahoma City-based firm has gained 7.5% after a Jan. 12 breakout past an 86.20 entry in a good flat base.Defensive industries including hospital, nonalcoholic beverages, soap and meat rallied.Back to the downside, Pulte Group (PHM) gapped down and dropped more than 3% to 32.18 in active turnover. The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition. However, the sector is also down more than 2% since Jan. 1, so it's actually severely lagging the broader market. See the entire sector rankings via the stock research tables inside IBD Weekly (beginning on page B5) as well as by going to IBD Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com, then clicking on IBD Smart NYSE + Nasdaq Tables.Key earnings reports after the close on Tuesday include Illumina (ILMN), Align Technology (ALGN) and Electronic Arts (EA).Illumina, the expert in genetic data analysis equipment, is expected to post a 44% jump in Q4 profit to $1.22 a share. That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

126,MCD,"William O'Neil, founder and chairman of Investor's Business Daily, conceived and wrote the column ""How To Find And Own America's Greatest Opportunities"" as part of a series to help readers learn the correct purchase points and sell signals in some of the best market winners in U.S. stock history. This inaugural column ran in the May 2, 2012, edition of IBD.Do you like to see movies? Do kids like movies? Sure. A few years ago, I did a study of themes in the market that occurred in nearly every cycle. One of the five recurring themes was the leisure and entertainment industry.For example, in the 1950s, Diners Club created America's first credit card, Brunswick's new automatic pin-spotter set off a bowling boom, and Polaroid's new ""picture-in-a-minute"" cameras gave people instant photos.Then in the '60s came all the color TV stocks, Disney (DIS), Winnebago's (WGO) motor homes, and McDonald's (MCD) fast food in the '70s. This Can't Be Yogurt and International Game Technology's (IGT) computerized casino gaming were new innovations of the '80s and '90s for consumers.More recently we've seen Apple's (AAPL) iPods, iTunes, iPhones and iPads, Priceline's (PCLN) ""name your own price"" for vacation travels, and Hansen Natural (now Monster Beverage (MNST)).These new, innovative leisure companies all had stock available that soared from 300% to as high, in some cases, as a mind-boggling 10,000%.People old enough to have lived during some of these periods will remember many of these companies and will have used many of their products — and yet they never stopped to think and buy these stocks that increased in price by 3, 10, 50 or 100 times.And this was just one industry sector in America! There are dozens of other sectors. They too had exciting new leaders pop up in new market cycles.I'll cover in detail how you can learn to recognize the many future outstanding big leaders that in the past may have been right under your nose, but you never capitalized on them.We'll use fundamental rules, charts and historical precedents to guide you to, perhaps in time, financial independence — if you work at it and not let yourself become discouraged.The more you learn the facts of past innovative leaders, the more you'll be able to recognize the next crop of winners. They will be there, so never give up — if you want to succeed.

128,MCD,"Wingstop (WING) saw a welcome improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Monday, with an upgrade from 70 to 74. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating measures market leadership by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks matched up against all other stocks. Decades of market research reveals that the best stocks tend to have an RS Rating of at least 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if Wingstop can continue to show renewed price strength and clear that threshold. Wingstop broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 33.35 entry from a cup with handle. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to take shape. Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. Wingstop showed 20% earnings growth last quarter. Sales rose 9%. Wingstop holds the No. 7 rank among its peers in the Retail-Restaurants industry group. Restaurant Brands International (QSR), Bob Evans Farms (BOBE) and McDonalds (MCD) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Retail Industry News And Stocks To WatchStocks With Rising Relative Strength RatingsWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

129,MCD,"Stocks were higher in afternoon trading Tuesday, while Apple (AAPL) shares were in flux as the company announced details on its new iPhone 8 and updates on other products.XThe Nasdaq composite added 0.1% and the S&P 500 0.2% after both trimmed gains. Small caps led, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.5%. The Russell is in an unusual spot as a market leader after persistently lagging the major indexes for much of this year.Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Monday. Winners led losers by a 7-4 ratio on the NYSE and by 8-to-5 on the Nasdaq in today's trading.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.3% as two Dow components made significant moves. McDonald's (MCD) zipped up more than 3% in triple its average volume, falling slightly below its 50-day moving average and below the 160.08 buy point it cleared Monday. Bloomberg reported that analytics firm M Science found McDonald's domestic same-store sales and revenue on pace to miss expectations. McDonald's drop shaved about 35 points off the industrials, Dow Jones Newswires said.But DowDuPont (DWDP) broke out of a flat base, gapping above the 67.60 buy point in heavy volume. The newly merged company announced changes in its planned split into agriculture, materials science and specialty products companies. It now plans to move $8 billion in businesses from the materials science division to the specialty products division.Apple provided limited gains for the major indexes. Apple shares rose more than 1% in heavy volume as its new-product event got underway at 10 a.m. PT. But the stock reversed lower after CEO Tim Cook explained new features in the iPhone 8 and introduced the next generation of smartphones, which Apple calls the iPhone X. The stock is holding in a buy area from a 156.75 buy point.The iPhone 8 — with better graphics, wireless charging and other improvements — has a starting price of $699.Symantec (SYMC) broke out of an irregular pattern, clearing a 33.32 buy point. Volume wasn't quite its 50-day average.Two homebuilders topped buy points, but both breakouts were unimpressive. D.R. Horton (DHI) barely topped the 37.54 buy point of a base-on-base formation. William Lyon Homes (WLH) rose above the 24.61 buy point, but volume was one-third less than normal.RELATED:DowDuPont Breaks Out To Buy On New Breakup PlanHere's Why McDonald's Stock Is Reversing A Day After Breaking OutApple Not The Only Stock Play In Augmented Reality: Morgan Stanley

130,MCD,"Restaurant Brands International (QSR) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 78 to 85 Friday.

131,MCD,"The Nasdaq composite looked poised to stage a strong weekly reversal — typical action for a market in a confirmed uptrend — with less than an hour left in Friday's session. With big-cap techs including Apple (AAPL) (still in a long-term uptrend), Nvidia (NVDA) (benefiting from fresh bullish analyst comments) and Alphabet (GOOGL) (forming a new, better base), the tech-rich composite rallied more than 0.6% in Friday afternoon trading.XThat well surpasses the S&P 500's less than 0.3% advance as of 3 p.m. ET. At 6494, the Nasdaq composite held a 1% gain for the week, vs. a 0.6% advance by the 500.The Dow Jones industrial average, weighed down in part by losses in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and McDonald's (MCD), was still virtually flat. At 22,379, the 30-component Dow industrials still held on to a thin 0.1% weekly gain. The Dow transports looked headed for an eighth straight gain, rising 0.2%.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Thursday on both main exchanges. Winners are beating losers on both exchanges by more than a 3-to-2 ratio. That's bullish for equities.Earlier this week, McDonald's triggered a sell signal for those who bought at the stock's early-April breakout at 130.10 because the stock fell sharply below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume. Watch to see if the biggest restaurant chain by stores and revenue can regain that medium-term support level and set up in a new base.Back to Apple, the juggernaut in smartphones, personal computers, tablets and digital services has shown disappointing volume in its rebound after getting knocked by sellers hard following its debut of its next-generation phones. You'd prefer to see the stock rise in heavy volume, not in thin trading as seen Wednesday.While Apple rose 0.7% that session, volume was 14% below average. Contrast that with Apple's sell-offs on Sept. 20, 21 and 22, in which shares traded hands at paces of 88%, 32% and 62% above the 50-day average, respectively.With the pullback in Apple extending into Week 5 on Monday, chances are growing that Apple could set up a new base next to its second-stage flat base that featured a 156.75 buy point. The first base finished up in early January, and Apple broke out of a beautiful cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9.A new base forming would still keep the base count at two. Stocks tend to succeed in breakouts from first-, second- or third-stage bases vs. fourth-, fifth- or even sixth-stage ones.Google operator Alphabet is working on a new cup-shaped base after its attempt to clear a 994.09 entry in a flawed double-bottom base lasted just days.Notice how Alphabet's double bottom was formed in less than seven weeks before the breakout, a flaw. However, its latest chart action is more sound. The new base is more rounded, and the stock has held above the lows of the prior flawed double bottom.Despite getting tagged by the EU with a stiff fine for alleged monopolistic behavior related to its online shopping pages, Alphabet is likely to continue its streak of respectable double-digit growth. Earnings in Q3 are seen rising 15% to $8.32 a share on a 21% jump in revenue to $27.16 billion.In each of the past five quarters, Alphabet's top line grew 20% to 22% vs. year-ago levels.Nvidia, back above a second-stage flat-base entry of 174.66, is helping keep chip-related shares on top of the market heap in terms of five-day performance.The chipmaker for hot growth markets — including data centers, video games, self-driving vehicles, artificial intelligence and deep learning — is still on track to post significant profit and sales gains despite already delivering mind-blowing increases over the past year and a half.In March 2016, Nvidia broke out of an early-stage cup with handle at 33.16, ahead of adjusted EPS increases of 46% (in Q1 of fiscal 2017, which ended in April 2016), 720%, 89%, 183%, 126% and 124%. In the October-ending fiscal third quarter, analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to rise 13% to 94 cents a share and revenue to go up 18% to $2.36 billion.Cypress Semiconductor (CY), part of IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, gained 1.7% and moved past a nearly nine-week cup-with-handle buy point of 14.89. However, volume is running around 9% below normal pace. You'd like to see volume surge a minimum 40% to 50% above the 50-day average, and much more for small and midcap stocks.However, in a few cases, a leading stock can show a big pickup in turnover several days, or even weeks, after breakout day.Cypress, which specializes in touch-screen microcontrollers and system-on-a-chip circuits, has marked earnings acceleration in three of the past four quarters. Earnings dropped 12% to 15 cents a share in the third quarter of 2016, then jumped 15%, 86% and 75% in the past three quarters.Revenue rose 13%, 18%, 27% and 32% over the same time frame.Cypress' IBD ratings are not as good as many of its peers in the chip sector, partly because it is a turnaround play. However, a B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is positive.The profit forecasts for Cypress, based in San Jose, Calif., look sunny. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 63% to 80 cents a share this year and another 41% to $1.13 in 2018. That would send Cypress' bottom line to its highest level since it earned $1.25 a share in 2011.Applied Materials (AMAT), is No. 9 in the IBD 50. The chip-equipment giant stormed higher for a third straight session, rising more than 2% to 52.01 in huge volume and is now extended from a 47.69 early entry in a cup-type consolidation. It announced a big share buyback plan earlier in the week.Wait to see if the stock pulls back within the 5% buy zone, or up to 50.07.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Can These 5 Chip Stocks Catch Nvidia?Hot Dividend Stocks: Can This Leading Utility Stock Rise Another 10%?Smart Growth Investing: Do You Know How To Count Bases In A Leading Stock?Keys To Short Selling With Success, The IBD Way: Read Articles Here

133,MCD,"U.S. stock indexes again appeared to be working from different playbooks midday Tuesday, following up on two recent sessions of divergence. The Nasdaq surged as much as 0.9% before giving back a bit of that rebound, and is up 0.6%. The S&P 500 crawled nearly 0.2% higher.X Meanwhile, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average shuffled lower by less than 0.1%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 stepped back 0.3%.The prior four sessions through Monday involved two days of distribution in the Nasdaq, while the other indexes stayed calm.Distribution, as noted and tracked in IBD's The Big Picture column, involves a sizable loss in rising volume in a major index. Distribution points to institutional selling.Volume in the stock market today was down emphatically on both major exchanges midday Tuesday.Chip stocks were rebounding after recent weakness, which helped the Nasdaq.In the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, three stocks were up more than 2%. The three were chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), computer networking stock Arista Networks (ANET) and chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT). Volume was up sharply for all three stocks.Blue chip stocks were mostly down, but the bigger moves came on the upside.In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, McDonald's (MCD) advanced 1.5% while Microsoft (MSFT) gained 1%.Jefferies upgraded McDonald's from hold to buy and raised the price target from 150 to 200. McDonald's closed at 170.65 Monday, so Jefferies is expecting a 17% upside. McDonald's partnership with Uber on deliveries is expected to help sales. Currently, Uber delivers Mac's food only in select urban areas.IBD's TAKE: McDonald's stock is extended from a September breakout. Microsoft is shaping a base with an 86.30 buy point.

134,MCD,"Glen W. Bell Jr. wasn't one to move with the rest of the pack in the nascent days of the fast-food industry.While burgers were the standard fare at stands like McDonald's Drive-In in the early 1950s, Bell opted to introduce the American consumer to Mexican food.""An innovative product will set you apart,"" said Bell (1923-2010), the founder of Taco Bell and pioneer of the Mexican chain fast-food segment, in ""Taco Titan: The Glen Bell Story,"" a 1999 biography by Debra Lee Baldwin.That was his goal when in 1951 he added homemade crisp-shelled tacos to the menu of his Bell's Burgers stand (it also served hot dogs) located in a Hispanic neighborhood in San Bernardino, Calif. — at 19 cents a pop.Bell recalled the response of his first taco customer: "" 'That was good. Gimme another.' Right then I knew we had a winner.""From those humble beginnings, Bell laid the groundwork for Taco Bell, which he started in 1962, serving what his customers called 'Tay-Kohs.'Armed with determination, resourcefulness and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, Bell not only transformed Taco Bell into a restaurant dynamo, he also revolutionized the chain restaurant business by pioneering and popularizing a new category — the Mexican quick-service restaurant — which Taco Bell continues to dominate.Today, Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum Brands (YUM) and the No. 1 Mexican-inspired quick-service restaurant brand. Taco Bell represents approximately 30% of Yum's operating profit, according to Yum. Last year, system sales (includes results of company-owned and franchise restaurants) rose 6% to $9.66 billion, including the 53rd week.""The Mexican chain fast-food market was Bell's creation,"" Darren Tristano, food service trend expert and advisor to Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm, told IBD. ""He looked at the niche of tacos, which at the time wasn't a big mass food opportunity, and really built that business. He brought tacos (and Mexican fare) to the American consumer in the chain restaurant (venue).""Taco Bell remains a giant in its field. The size of Taco Bell ""dwarfs"" every other Mexican fast-food chain in the category, which also includes Taco John's and Del Taco Restaurants, Tristano says.Taco Bell's menu today includes various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and other related items.Bell began formulating his recipe for success as a leader as he ventured on the path to overcome financial woes as a youth and as he pursued his goal to start a restaurant business.At every juncture, with every experiment, setback and win, Bell learned what he called his ""recipes for success"" — 60 lessons outlined in his biography.His first two recipes were key ingredients for running his restaurant chains and important to his success:""You build a business one customer at a time. In the early days, I never closed when there was a customer waiting even though I had put in 12 hours and was eager to go home. … One happy customer is worth his weight in gold.""Find the right product, then find a way to mass-produce it. When I had my hamburger stand, similar takeout stands were spreading all over San Bernardino. If my business was to survive and grow, I would have to apply what I knew about quick service to a different product.""That's where the taco came in. Key to Bell's success was the way he ran Taco Bell's operations, says Dan Jones, who owns four Taco Bell franchises in California — two in Long Beach, one in Azusa and one in Montebello. Jones started at Taco Bell in 1965, running its original restaurant in Downey, Calif.""He was really concerned about the quality of the food, the customer service and cleanliness of the restaurants,"" Jones told IBD. He was very strict on operations. (The franchisees) were motivated by that. We knew the standards by which Taco Bell was supposed to run.""Franchisees knew how to run a restaurant profitably by allocating certain food, payroll and other costs according to certain percentages set by these standards, Jones says.If a franchisee was not following the standards, Bell would send troubleshooters to help them with their operational problems.Jones, who worked in various posts at the Taco Bell corporate level for 11 years and has been a franchisee since 1976, describes Bell as a ""mild-mannered and gentle man"" who never raised his voice.Bell created a culture where he motivated by setting a good example.""You wanted to work for him to grow the company,"" Jones said. ""He was the most honorable person I ever met and an awesome guy to work for.""The franchisees put in 60 hours a week because they ""loved being part of a dynamic company,"" Jones says.In the early years, he was active in helping franchisees. For example, if someone had a low-volume store, Bell would do something like lower the rent or reduced the royalty.Bell also hired people to whom he could delegate responsibility.""Find people who know things you don't,"" he said in his biography. ""I'm an entrepreneur, not an administrator. Taco Bell prospered because I recognized my limitations, hired professional managers to make up for them, and knew when to let go.""Another recipe for success: ""Respect your competitors and learn from them. At first, no one, not even the McDonald brothers, fully recognized the potential of fast food. But we did know, because of the customers' response, we were onto something. We experimented and continually made changes. Our 'market research' was to observe our competitors and to borrow their best ideas.""Bell learned a lot eyeing other entrepreneurs and competitors, especially the McDonald brothers.""One thing I learned from the McDonald brothers is don't sell everything your customers ask for,"" Bell said. ""Decide what you're going to sell, then make it the best it can be.""When Bell came up with the idea to sell tacos at his Bell's Burgers in 1951, he needed to develop the recipe for the best taco — one that could be made and served quickly and was good to eat. At the time, tacos served in Mexican restaurants were made with soft tortillas. Bell wanted tortillas that were ""delicately crisp"" and ready to be filled. After weeks of experimentation, Bell developed a crisp-shelled taco that was quick to assemble and tasty.Tristano calls Bell a visionary. ""The biggest trend he recognized was that Mexicans were immigrating to this country, and there was an opportunity to feed them,"" he said. ""More importantly, he Americanized Mexican food in a way he was able to create demand for his product from the American consumer.""Before Taco Bell started expanding throughout the country, no one knew what Mexican food was, says Jones, who was a franchisee consultant at the time the first Taco Bell in Florida opened.At the time, people didn't know what they were eating or even how to pronounce the names of the food on the menu, Jones says. But that didn't stop the Florida eatery from being a success.""The food was great,' Jones said. ""We couldn't make tacos fast enough.""After Florida, Bell pushed Taco Bell's expansion across the country.Bell was also a visionary in identifying the void in the market for more exotic multicultural fast food.Bell developed Taco Bell during a time when the burger market was taking off with McDonald's (MCD) and Burger King.Bell focused on franchising. ""This was his way of building an empire in a very short time span,"" Tristano said. ""Franchising has proven to be a strong growth vehicle, especially in fast food. Access to capital wasn't as common back then. He was able to build stores without having to operate them or finance them.""The first Taco Bell franchise opened in Torrance, Calif., in 1965. Bell's first venture in the restaurant business was in 1948, when he opened Bell's Drive-In, in San Bernardino. The idea to build a restaurant came to him after he studied the success of the McDonald brothers and their namesake burger drive-ins first founded in San Bernardino.Between 1954 and 1955, Bell and a business partner built three drive-thru taco stands in Southern California called Taco Tia. Bell's partner wasn't in favor of expanding Taco Tia into Los Angeles. Bell sold his interests in the taco stands. Later in the 1950s Bell and a new group of partners opened a chain called El Taco, which Bell also sold his interests in.Taco Bell went public in 1970.In 1978, Bell sold 868 Taco Bell restaurants to PepsiCo (PEP). PepsiCo spun out Taco Bell and its other restaurant chains in late 1997 to Tricon Global Restaurants. With the purchase of two other chains, Tricon Global restaurants changed its name to Yum Brands in 2002.Bell was born in Lynwood, Calif. At 16, with his family struggling financially, Bell ""rode the rails"" across America looking for work, according to his biography. Bell joined the Marine Corps in 1943, and served in the Pacific. While in Guadalcanal, his job was to serve meals to high-ranking officers.That's where he gleaned one of his key recipes for success:""Any job is an opportunity to learn. You would think that serving food to generals in Guadalcanal wouldn't have much relevance later on. But it taught me how to estimate how much food was needed based on the number of people served. That knowledge gave me confidence to start a restaurant.""Pioneered and popularized Mexican quick-service restaurantOvercame: The competition from the burger-chain giants to convince American consumers to eat Mexican fast foodLesson: Learn from your wins, setbacks and experiments.""An innovative product will set you apart.""

Here are some big-cap stocks to study before the opening bell: Dow components Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), Wal-Mart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD) and Home Depot (HD) are all near buy points.XBoeing and McDonald's have new flat bases, Microsoft and Wal-Mart are trying to regain entries while Home Depot is benefiting from powerful hurricane-fueled purchases. They have a combined market capitalization of $1.258 trillion, with Microsoft accounting for $565 billion.The major averages etched out slim gains during Wednesday's stock market trading, regaining some of Tuesday's losses. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite moved further above their 50-day moving averages. But volume was light and growth stocks didn't make a lot of progress. It's still a choppy market.Boeing has been the year's top-performing Dow stock, up 51% in 2017. Boeing is benefiting from strong demand for civilian aircraft. Boeing raised its 20-year China commercial aircraft forecast to $1.1 trillion on Wednesday.Boeing ran up from a May breakout before peaking at 246.49 on July 31.

142,MCD,"Semiconductor, software, fiber-optic telecom gear and other tech issues helped boost the Nasdaq composite to its highest levels of the session in afternoon trading Wednesday. Apple (AAPL), up 0.6% to 154.04, also helped push the Nasdaq and other key indexes higher.XApple, which has joined a pilot program that is meant to get health-related apps on a fast track for potential FDA approvals, remains a touch below a new breakout point at 156.75, 10 cents above the left-side high in a 10-week flat-base pattern, one of the most bullish chart patterns seen in leading growth stocks.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite back off session highs but was still up 1.2% as it gained further distance above its critical 50-day moving average. At 6472, the tech-rich index at one point looked poised to post an all-time closing high.Meanwhile, small-cap indexes were faring especially well as banking shares of virtually all stripes also rallied ahead of details from President Trump's tax cut proposal, expected later today during a speech in Indianapolis.Late on Tuesday, some of the tax cut plans were previewed among members of Congress and included a slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, a cut of the top individual income tax rate of 39.6%, a doubling of standard deductions for filing tax returns, and higher child tax credits.The S&P 500 rose 0.4% and notched a new all-time high before easing a bit. The large-cap benchmark is getting weighed down a bit by losses in utility, food, drugstore chain, gold mining and other defensive-oriented industry groups.The Dow Jones industrial average edged up nearly 0.3%, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least seven of the 30 components in the index, including Goldman Sachs (GS) (still forming a saucer-type base), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (trying to overcome upside resistance near 94) and McDonald's (MCD) (which triggered a sell signal with a sharp break of the 50-day moving average near 157).The small-cap S&P 600 surged 2.2%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 1.9%. Strength in the auto, airline, trucking and shipping sectors held up, as the Dow Jones transportation average rallied more than 0.6%.The Dow utilities are off 1.2% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond soared to 2.30%, the highest in weeks.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday, a bullish sign for the market. All of the major indexes are also trading near all-time highs.Going back to Apple, if the megacap tech cannot quickly rebound back above its latest buy point of 156.75, expect the stock to take more time in forming a potential new base. Also, watch to see if its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which has fallen to a poor grade of E on a scale of A (superior accumulation) to E (heavy selling), can improve.Apple is seeing a slow-yet-steady pickup in the top line, a critical factor in its future stock potential. Revenue rose 3% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in December 2016, ending a three-quarter slump, then grew 5% and 7% in the next two quarters.The Street sees Apple's revenue climbing at a faster rate again, up 9% to $50.93 billion in Q4 of this current fiscal year, then 11% in Q1 of fiscal 2018 to $86.71 billion.Within the semiconductor sector, Nvidia (NVDA) expanded its gains, rising more than 2% to 175.89 in above-average turnover. Shares of the expert in graphics processors and chips for artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles backtracked after surpassing a new flat-base buy point at 174.66 a few weeks ago, but are now back above that proper entry.Sometimes a high-quality stock such as Nvidia, a member of the IBD 50, needs more than one attempt to break out successfully. And keep in mind that the big-cap tech play has already boomed more than 420% from a 33.16 cup-with-handle breakout back in March 2016, before the latest base formed.Another concern is how Wall Street will react to the inevitable slowdown in earnings and revenue growth in the next few quarters. From Q3 (ended in October) of fiscal 2017 to Q2 (ended in July) in the current fiscal year, Nvidia's EPS growth has been astonishing, rising 720%, 89%, 183%, 126% and 124% on an adjusted basis, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.When earnings grow that fast, it's very hard to keep up such a hot pace.Revenue at Nvidia, which also makes semiconductors for data centers, jumped 24%, 54%, 55%, 48% and 56% vs. year-ago levels over the same five-quarter span.Nvidia benefits from being in a strong chip sector, which through Tuesday's close ranked No. 2 among 33 sectors as seen in IBD's stock research tables. The 33 sectors are ranked every day in terms of a blend of mid- to long-term price performance.IBD's chip sector is up 26.8% since Jan. 1, slamming the 11.5% gain of the S&P 500.Other notable chip companies with excellent fundamentals and strong price action include Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT), ASML (ASML) (98 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup) of the Netherlands, wafer fabrication titan Applied Materials (AMAT) and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX).Applied Materials stretched its gain to more than 7% to 49.16, quickly getting back above a 47.69 early buy point within a cuplike base. Shares remain in buy range up to 50.07.Watch to see if Applied Materials' volume runs well above the 50-day average by day's end. With less than a half hour to go in the session, turnover is running nicely at a pace 76% above its 50-day average. Among big-cap names, it's preferable to see volume bulge at least 40% higher than normal at the breakout or soon after. Applied has 1.07 billion shares outstanding and a $51.9 billion market value.Applied's base is later stage; the rally got going with a breakout from a bottoming-base pattern at 21.77 in May 2016, and that base was first stage. Keep in mind, though, that a select number of companies with truly outstanding fundamentals, the best products and services, and top management are capable of staging nice gains from third-, fourth- and even fifth-stage bases.Applied is expected to grow fiscal 2017 earnings 83% to $3.20 a share, extending three years of increases. In fiscal 2018, which ends in October next year, EPS growth is seen slowing sharply, up 12% at $3.60 a share. However, analysts' estimates for a full year out are often conservative.Ultra Clean of Hayward, Calif., rallied more than 9% to 29.41 in fast turnover. Shares in the small-cap name are extended past a new cup buy point at 26.30. The proper buy zone extends up to 27.62. It's especially important to buy chip stocks within the right price zone, no more than 5% above a proper entry, because they tend to swing more quickly and more violently than the average company on Wall Street.Buying a stock that's too far extended in price can force a new investor to exit a stock with a sharp loss during a normal price pullback.Lithography systems expert ASML rose 2.9% to 167.61 in brisk trading, and has now rallied 21% following a July breakout past a 137.37 buy point in an eight-week flat base.In a good flat base, the correction from head to toe should not exceed 15%. In ASML's case, the stock dipped from 137.27 on May 16 to 126.03 on June 12, a mere 8.2%. Notice, too, how the megacap tech firm had a solid prior uptrend before sculpting the new base.IBD's TAKE: One of the keys to a breakout from a solid base, including the cup with handle, is to see a prior uptrend of 30% or more before a stock forms its next base. Read this Investor's Corner column to become more acquainted with using charts to get an edge on Wall Street and improve your market timing in both stocks and the major indexes.Microchip Technology (MCHP), currently in IBD's Big Cap 20 screen, rose 1.2% to 88.68 and is in buy range from an 86.04 handle entry in a shallow cup.The Chandler, Ariz., expert in flash memory and microcontrollers for multiple markets has shown steady profit growth since fiscal 2014 (ended in March that year). Earnings have jumped from $2.45 a share in FY 2014 to $3.99 in FY 2017. In the current fiscal 2018, analysts see earnings rising another 32% to $5.27 a share.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Why Apple's Rally Isn't Over YetThe Big Picture: Will The Nasdaq's Lead Diminish?How To Trade Stocks: Why A Flat Base And Square Box Represent Bullish MovementHow To Spot Major Market Tops: Here Is The Easy Way

148,MCD,"Wall Street wasn't surprised by Starbucks' (SBUX) decision to trim its long-term financial targets, given what a tough space retail has become, but at least one expert is wondering aloud if the plan to open more Starbucks locations is the answer.XAttributing the cut in the earnings growth target to ""persistent traffic declines,"" menu price hikes and increased competition, Quo Vadis Capital's John Zolidis wrote in a Friday report that ""we're not so sure"" that cannibalization isn't an issue, given Starbucks' plan to open thousands more stores.Starbucks executives are ""clearly spending a lot of time considering which markets to own, which to refranchise, what concepts to shut down, which to sell off,"" he said. ""These may all be the right strategic moves (although we confess our disappointment with the value destruction from the Teavana transaction), but none of them are driving more customers into the stores. In a way, slower unit growth might be preferable to all this action.""Same-store sales both globally and in the Americas disappointed slightly when Starbucks reported late Thursday, although it wasn't necessarily uncharacteristic for the restaurant industry, domestically speaking.""While the +2% same-store sales number for the U.S. in fiscal Q4 (calendar Q3) is below Street expectations, it is helpful to remember that this particular quarter was by some measures the second-worst same-store sales quarter for U.S. chain restaurants as a whole in the last five years,"" wrote Nomura's Mark Kalinowski. ""Starbucks is not as immune to this type of issue as it was years ago, as Starbucks is the second-largest restaurant chain in the country.""As competition has increased, Starbucks faces not just other coffee shop chains like Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) but also fast-food heavyweights such as McDonald's (MCD), which recently called McCafe a ""significant growth platform.""IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.A point of curiosity, then, is where the coffee giant's digital efforts will lead, now that it is flinging the doors open for non-loyalty program members to use its order-ahead mobile payment system. The service, which allows customers to order their drinks via the Starbucks mobile app and pick them up in-store, was initially so popular that it created congestion issues at pickup counters. Management quickly vowed to smooth out its problems. As of the end of the quarter, Mobile Order & Pay accounted for a tenth of all Starbucks' U.S. transactions, said executives on the call.While Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson called the Mobile Order & Pay expansion ""another powerful driver of confidence"" toward positive same-store sales growth, Kalinowski believes that Starbucks still has some kinks to work out.The company ""may be struggling with in-store customer flow more than the Street believes, as mobile-order-and-pay functionality continues to ramp up in popularity,"" he wrote, trimming his price target to 63 from 67 but keeping his buy rating.Regardless, as growth in China remains a bright spot, consensus largely seems to be that Starbucks is still a solid brand, and the stock continues to be adorned with a number of outperform, overweight and buy ratings from analysts, despite recent performance.Starbucks shares, which had fallen sharply overnight, rose 2.1% to 56.02 in the stock market today, hitting their best level  in three months.Dunkin' Brands climbed 1.1% to 58.96, close to a 59.80 buy point.

149,MCD,"Starbucks (SBUX) announced late Thursday that it is selling off its Tazo tea brand — including all of Tazo's recipes, intellectual property and inventory — to consumer goods giant Unilever (UL) for $384 million, as it focuses on its Teavana property.Separately, the coffee-shop giant cut its long-term financial goals and missed revenue and same-store sales forecasts for the quarter, sending shares lower after hours.X Estimates: A near-2% EPS drop to 55 cents a share — in what would be the first such decline since 2009 — on a 0.4% revenue uptick to $5.73 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Consensus Metrix expects same-store sales to rise 3.2% globally, and 3.3% in the key Americas segment.Results: EPS of 55 cents, meeting views, but falling short of sales expectations with a surprise 0.2% revenue slip to $5.698 billion. Global comps rose 2%, including an Americas comp gain of 3%, also missing. U.S. same-store sales grew 2%.The company also lowered long-term financial targets, cutting annual earnings growth to 12%, vs. prior guidance for 15%-20%. Global comps of 3%-5% and high-single-digit net revenue growth is expected.Cold drinks are performing well for Starbucks, and management also sounded bullish on its non-drink menu items, reiterating its hopes that food sales will account for 25% of revenue by 2021.Well over a third — 36% — of tender now comes from Starbucks Rewards, its loyalty program, said CEO Kevin Johnson on the call. And as the java titan continues to push its mobile order-ahead service, the company is throwing open the doors to everyone to use Mobile Order & Pay, regardless of whether they are loyalty members.""In quarters ahead, all customers will be able to download our app, set up a digital relationship with Starbucks, select the payment vehicle of their choice – and use Mobile Order and Pay,"" he said. ""This is the first of many initiatives that will combine direct, digital relationships with new value propositions in order to expand the total universe of customers with whom we engage and communicate.""And as more Starbucks locations pop up all over Asia and its China Asia-Pacific segment continues to lead growth, execs said they'll focus more on the China segment in future earnings calls.""Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive roughly half of our global new store growth in fiscal 2018 - with 1,100 net new stores - nearly 600 in China,"" said CFO Scott Maw.Stock: Starbucks shares fell 3.4% to 53 in late trading, which would be below their 50-day line and right around a 52-week low. Starbucks closed down 0.5% on the stock market today.While Starbucks has been targeting food sales recently with some success, fast-food giant McDonald's (MCD) has been eyeing coffee as a source of growth and may be drawing some customers from Starbucks with its new McCafe promotions.Elsewhere in the coffee space, rumors floated earlier in the week that Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins parent Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) might be an acquisition target for JAB Holding, the mega-coffee corporation that already owns Caribou Coffee, Peet's Coffee & Tea, Intelligentsia and Keurig Green Mountain.Dunkin' shares closed down 0.7% to 58.33 Thursday after surging nearly 8% on news of the potential JAB deal.

150,MCD,"When Starbucks (SBUX) reports fourth-quarter results after the close Thursday, Wall Street will be looking for solid same-store sales growth, improved mobile-order-and-pay usage and continued expansion in China.XAnalysts expect a near-2% drop in earnings to 55 cents a share, in what would be the first such decline since 2009, on a 0.4% revenue uptick to $5.73 billion.Shares closed up 0.5% at 55.13 on the stock market today. Starbucks is in a sluggish spot, trading choppily around its 50-day moving average and breaching its longer-term 200-day line in late July.But as Howard Schultz's successor, Kevin Johnson, continues to get settled into the role of chief executive, Piper Jaffray analysts believe there's upside to Starbucks' current share price as the coffee giant continues to develop its digital efforts, expand its menu offerings, roll out premium locations and open more stores in China, among other things.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy expects a 3% same-store gain for the key Americas segment, which she notes is below consensus for 3.5% growth, amid concerns of market saturation.Either way, that would represent a deceleration. In fiscal Q3, comps rose 5% in the Americas and 4% globally.""Our domestic checks (including conversations with a relatively balanced geographic group of operators representing (about) 10% of the domestic system) suggest sales and traffic trends were positive in July, August and September, (with increasing momentum) driven in part by ongoing food (protein boxes) and beverage innovation (cold brew and tea infusions),"" she wrote on Oct. 8.The firm has an overweight rating and 70 price target on the stock.IBD'S TAKE: To prep for the week's major earnings reports, take a look at this week's Investing Action Plan for everything you need to know. Streamlining the process by which customers place their orders online and pick them up in the store hasn't been entirely smooth, but management has promised to work out the kinks, and coffee drinkers appear to like the system. As of July, mobile-order-and-pay made up 9% of all U.S. transactions, and payments from the Starbucks smartphone app accounted for 30% of all domestic orders.But Starbucks noted in its most recent earnings call in July that a ""challenging"" retail landscape had given it cause for caution headed into Q4.""While the chain did deliver a superior 5% (same-store sales) growth result in (the third quarter), the outperformance was short-lived and trends soon returned to the low- to mid-single-digit range,"" noted RBC Capital analyst David Palmer in mid-September, holding an outperform rating and 63 price target on Starbucks shares.""This 'new normal' for the company's growth rate seems to be a function of both a new reality in retail and diminishing incrementality of Starbucks' growth enablers of food/beverage innovation, digital initiatives (mobile order & pay), and rewards membership growth.""Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), which owns Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, shot up 7.8% to 59.090 Monday, rebounding from its 200-day moving average, on takeover buzz from JAB Holding, which owns Keurig, Panera Bread, Peet's Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and Caribou Coffee.Dunkin' Brands turned in mixed results last week that fell short of earnings forecasts.McDonald's (MCD) reported better-than-expected Q3 earnings last week. McDonald's pointed to menu changes and drinks promotions, including for its McCafe line of coffee beverages.

The Energy Information Administration provides its weekly view into oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET.HP Inc. opened down 5%, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise sliced 6% lower at the starting bell, the worst early declines among S&P 500 stocks, after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday.

153,MCD,"With the Nasdaq composite rising 1.1% on Wednesday and the S&P 500 index climbing for a fourth straight session and retaking its 50-day moving average, more stocks are breaking out or moving into position. Here are five top-rated stocks that are within 1% of buy points: McDonald's (MCD), Yelp (YELP), Constellation Brands (STZ), ASML Holding (ASML) and Microchip Technology (MCHP).XMcDonald's has a solid, but not great Composite Rating of 85, though the Dow component is seen as an ongoing turnaround play and it's a solid dividend player. Constellation Brands has a 94 Composite Rating. ASML and Microchip have 97 CRs and Yelp has a best-possible 99. Why should you care? All-time winning stocks often have Composite Ratings of 95 or above near the start of their big price moves.McDonald's, one of the Dow's top performers in 2017, rose 0.1% to 159.53 in Wednesday's stock market trading. The fast-food giant has formed a short flat base with a 160.08 buy point following a strong run-up from an April breakout.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's stock has risen 31% in 2017, while also offering a solid dividend. McDonald's is one of four Dow stocks that are outperforming the S&P 500 index while boasting solid dividends and robust dividend growth.The local search and reviews site climbed 1.4% to 42.90, pennies below a 43.07 entry in a cup-with-handle base going back to early February.

160,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales late Tuesday, sending shares lower.Check back for updates.Estimates: Earnings per share to essentially double to $1.56, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue is seen climbing 9% to $1.134 billion. Same-store sales are expected to rise 1.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.The fast-casual chain's reputation and financials last year and in 2015 were devastated by a series of foodborne-illness scares, which led to investments in more rigorous food-safety measures and attempts win back customers via discounts and promotions.Results: Earnings were 69 cents, including a 64-cent estimated charge related to a data security breach and 13 cents for hurricane-related impact. If one excludes the data breach, Chipotle earned $1.33, still below views. Revenue rose 8.8% to $1.128 billion. Same-store sales rose 1%.Outlook: Chipotle sees full-year same-store sales growth of 6.5%.

Shares closed up 1.2% to 324.30 in the stock market today. Chipotle recently reclaimed its 50-day moving average but was well off its May peak of 499 or its all-time high of 758.61 set in August 2015.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.After what Chipotle described in July as ""early operational success,"" the once-trendy burrito chain launched the dip nationwide last month. Depending on who you ask, the queso launch was seen as a pathway to recovery or an act of desperation, and much of the attention surrounding the dip has related to customers who have complained about its gritty texture.But Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott last month said in a research note that the concerns about queso could take the focus off concerns about food safety, which the company has faced for some two years after E. coli and norovirus outbreaks.Scott said customers' reaction to the new dip weren't ideal but that ""we view a shift in consumer and media focus towards product, and away from earlier food safety events, as a positive."" He said queso might work better as a ""flavor and texture enhancement"" in other menu items.Higher labor costs and avocado prices have also raised concerns among analysts.McDonald's (MCD), which reported third-quarter earnings earlier in the day, rose 0.3%.Jack in the Box (JACK) edged down 0.1%.

161,MCD,"When McDonald's (MCD) starts to bring more fresh hamburger patties to more U.S. restaurants next year, the operators and staff of those restaurants will undergo a six-week training program both on-site and off.Big training efforts like that — as McDonald's deepens its focus on training staff to handle mobile curbside-and-delivery orders and customer service in its new, digitized restaurants — will mean thinner margins for the next six to 12 months, management said Tuesday during the company's third-quarter earnings call.Worldwide, McDonald's is on pace to offer delivery in 10,000 restaurants by the end of the year, up from more than 5,000 now.Other big moves, like the company's refranchising efforts — notably in China and Hong Kong — will also take a few cents off earnings per share until the third quarter of next year, with revenue growth returning after that.Still, nobody on Wall Street appears to be complaining.""Sales Growth That Doesn't Make Us Grimace,"" read the headline of a Nomura-Instinet research note.U.S. same-store sales during the third quarter rose 4.1%, beating the Consensus Metrix estimate for 3.4%. Global same-store sales climbed 6%, above expectations for a 4.5% gain.Analysts and executives pointed all over the menu to items that boosted sales: $1 drinks; the McPick 2 value promotion; espresso and other drinks that came from last month's relaunch of McCafe drinks; Sriracha chicken sandwiches; and more recently introduced higher-margin Signature Crafted sandwiches which prompted customers to pay a bit more.Management said McCafe seems likely to be a ""significant growth platform"" for the company in the years to come, but also pointed to some basic truisms about food and people's desire to eat it.""As we've seen with both Signaure Crafted and McCafe, when we improve the taste and quality of our products to meet rising customer expectations, they reward us with more business,"" Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald's USA, said during the call.Also boosting sales are delivery efforts in the U.S., via a partnership with UberEats. McDelivery has been popular in the evening with younger people in big cities like Miami, Boston and Los Angeles, drawing more group orders and bigger checks.Shares rose 0.2% to 163.88 on the stock market today after rising to 166.49 intraday. The stock was still within buy range of a flat base with a 160.08 buy point. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which reports on Thursday, climbed 0.6% Tuesday, remaining above buy range.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.McDonald's earned $1.76 a share in Q3, beating the Zacks estimate by a penny but just missing some other consensus views. Revenue of $5.755 billion narrowly missed Zacks' forecast but edged past some estimates.SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett, in a research note published after McDonald's earnings were released, said that the middling EPS figure was ""likely due to the difficulty of modeling the impact of selling the China/Hong Kong business (impact on revenue, restaurant margins, franchise margins and G&A).""In that sale, McDonald's during the quarter handed off most of that business to the Asian conglomerate Citic, along with Citic Capital and The Carlyle Group. Those companies will form a new operation that will be the primary franchisee of the business for the next 20 years.This month, customers have also hoovered up the company's new McDonald's Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Tenders, which are meatier and are thawed before cooking, and tend to be juicier than previous iterations, RBC analyst David Palmer said before the earnings were released.Next year could also be a banner year for the burger chain's rollout of fresh-beef Quarter Pounders. Palmer said he's heard that tests of the conversion to fresh patties have been ""All-Day-Breakfast big.""Further out, McDonald's delivery partnership with UberEats could drive up to roughly a full percentage point of same-store sales growth between 2018 and 2019, Credit Suisse analysts said last week.RELATED:Domino's Q3 Earnings, Helped By Accounting Change, Flop On Wall St.McDonald's Stock Is Near Buy Zone Again As Sales Fears EaseFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru Window

Same-store sales were seen up 3.1%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Adjusted EPS rose 50% to 15 cents. Sales were $320.3 million. North American same-store sales rose 3.2%.Outlook: Wendy's sees full-year EPS of 45-47 cents. The Zacks consensus is for 47 cents, and that was before Wendy's 2-cent beat in Q2. Wendy's expects 2017 North American same-store to rise 2%-3% with labor costs up 4%. The burger chain still sees $12 billion in sales in 2020.Stock: Shares rose 3.8% to 15.80 in the stock market today. The stock closed Tuesday in a flat base with a 16.76 buy point.Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski suggested in a research note that some mozzarella-related selections — its Fresh Mozzarella Chicken Sandwich or Fresh Mozzarella Chicken Salad — were among Wendy's popular items during the second quarter. As for the third quarter, promotions for Bacon Queso items seem likely to help, he said.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is testing queso, climbed 0.3% to 334.59.Estimates: Fiscal third-quarter EPS down 2% to $1.05, as revenue dips 2% to $361 million.Results: EPS was 99 cents on sales of $357.8 million.

Comps at Qdoba, its Mexican chain, rose 0.5%, above views for a 0.5% drop.Qdoba's comps gain came as ""as guests responded favorably to menu innovation,"" the restaurant operator said.Outlook: The company sees fiscal fourth-quarter same-store sales flat to down 2% at Jack in the Box systemwide, with company-owned Qdoba comps also flat to down 2%.Shares: Jack in the Box shares rose 2% in after-hours trading. The stock closed down 0.2% to 94.68.Jack in the Box also said that its evaluation of whether Qdoba fits in with the broader company was still ongoing.""Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC continues to assist the company's Board of Directors in its evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to Qdoba, as well as other ways to enhance shareholder value,"" the company said in its earnings release.The company added that there was no guarantee that the evaluation would lead to a transaction. Jack in the Box also said it had set no timeline.When Jack in the Box reported first-quarter results in May, it said it was looking at ""potential alternatives"" regarding Qdoba.""It has become more apparent since then that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models,"" the company said then.The restaurant operator at that time it ""lost ground"" to some rivals during the first quarter, amid an industrywide value-meal war that took some attention away from Jack in the Box's new menu items. Delayed tax refunds and extended rainfall in California also likely kept diners away, the company said then.IBD'S TAKE: To make up for flagging sales, more quick-service chains are turning to mobile ordering and delivery. McDonald's (MCD) closed flat at 154.92.

175,MCD,"The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, as the jobless rate dipped, revisiting a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.XWhile average hourly wages rose a tame 2.5% from a year ago, and the data are unlikely to change near-term policy, the underlying details show strong labor market momentum and suggest that Wall Street may be underestimating the extent of Federal Reserve tightening in 2018.An inkling of realization crept into markets on Friday, with the 10-year Treasury yield scooting up 4 basis points to 2.26%. Meanwhile, the dollar clawed back a bit of lost ground after sinking to a 2-year low in recent days, and bank stocks, which can shine when the Fed is raising rates, moved higher.One prominent take on the huge lines of people that showed up at the nationwide Amazon.com (AMZN) hiring blitz this week was that there are droves of people who need jobs, so the economy must not be anywhere near full employment.Yet data from Friday's report, new hiring bonuses at Disney (DIS), discussions of labor-market tightness on earnings calls and the difficulty small firms are having in filling jobs all suggest that what slack there is in the job market is disappearing pretty quickly.Here are a few data points that show the job market has a serious head of steam:Not only has the monthly average job gain accelerated to 195,000 over the past three months, but that's happened as the workweek has lengthened. For the first time since late 2015, aggregate hours worked rose 2% from a year ago in consecutive months.Even with tame wage growth, more hiring and longer hours are boosting incomes, and that should gradually yield more pricing power for business. Aggregate pay rose 4.5% from a year ago in July, after increasing 4.6% in June. Again, that's the best two-month trend since late 2015.On a positive note, 349,000 workers joined the labor force in July, meaning they're working or looking for a job. But that figure is from the survey of households that can yield unreliable shifts in any month, both up and down. The trend is less impressive: Over the past four months, a total of 293,000 people have joined the labor force, but that's been swamped by the cumulative 513,000 increase in employed workers.The jobs data don't change the outlook for the Fed waiting until December for its next rate hike. The Fed is widely expected to announce that it will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the conclusion of its Sept. 19-20 meeting. However some Fed policymakers have expressed concern that inflation will bubble up if the jobless rate keeps falling.The battered retail sector added 900 jobs in July. The data include non-store retailers, which added 1,400 jobs. Amazon had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event. Amazon also announced in April that it's hiring 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.Employment in food service and drinking places surged 53,100. McDonald's (MCD) said in mid-June that the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than the Golden Arches hired a year ago. McDonald's was recruiting through a partnership with Snap (SNAP), which will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad on its Snapchat social media site.While such creative strategies might help connect employers with hard-to-find workers, Disney is trying to attract cooks, bus drivers and housekeepers by publicizing hiring bonuses that start at $500 and rise as high as $1,500 for culinary employees. Disney reports fiscal third-quarter earnings after the close on Tuesday.A National Federation of Independent Business survey out Thursday indicated that 35% of small firms reported job openings they couldn't fill in July, the highest percentage since 2001.IBD'S TAKE: For an analysis of why Amazon's stock chart is now signaling greater risk, read IBD Leaderboard, where IBD's top market writers help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits. With its post-earnings sell-off, Amazon has fallen to No. 10 in IBD's Internet-Retail group, based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see which companies are setting the pace. Before the jobs data, Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons characterized subdued wage gains as ""unprecedented"" at this advanced stage of the business cycle, but said they see ""a more sustained cyclical acceleration going forward.""Their view is that the labor market is approaching full employment for both skilled and unskilled labor, noting ""the increased inclination of workers to change jobs for higher wages.""The long lines at Amazon's job fairs do raise a lot of questions about how much those people reflect labor-market slack (the jobless looking for work or people looking to add a second job) or people looking for greener pastures. There are, after all, millions of retail workers who may be worried that their store is about to be ""Amazoned"" out of business, and Amazon's wages starting at $12 an hour, plus benefits, are surely a draw.On earnings calls within the past several weeks, numerous companies have talked about wage pressures and tight labor market conditions.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) and railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) both said they are seeing 5% wage inflation.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is seeing 6% wage growth and an even-greater increase in compensation costs when non-wage benefits are included.On the other hand, staffing company Robert Half International (RHI), which serves accounting, health care and other professions, has seen temp bill rates decelerate to 2.5%.""What we're seeing is that our clients — they're just unwilling to pay more, because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients,"" Robert Half CEO Harold Messmer said on a July 26 conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.""So, it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines,"" Messmer said.Yet NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said that the tight labor market is raising costs for small employers. ""More than a quarter of all owners reported raising wages in July, and the pressure was especially high in the construction industry,"" he said.Meanwhile, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams is on edge about the falling jobless rate, which he expects to sink to 4.1% by year end.""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Despite muted inflation readings in recent months, Williams still envisions four rate hikes between now and the end of 2018, while financial markets see slim odds of more than one through next August, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.RELATED:The Fed Just Gave A Green Light To Wall StreetAmazon The Inflation Killer Will Lower Grocery Prices With Whole FoodsAmazon Still Prime With Analysts; Intel, EA Touted; Starbucks Cut

176,MCD,"The number that keeps Federal Reserve policymakers up at night isn't the monthly job gain. It's the jobless rate.Though unemployment ticked up to 4.4% in June from May's 16-year low of 4.3%, San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Wednesday that he sees the jobless rate falling to 4.1% by year end.X""I just think we don't want to let this go too long because eventually inflation pressures will emerge at some point,"" Williams said.Wall Street expects Friday's jobs report to show that the unemployment rate returned to 4.3% in July as the economy added 178,000 jobs.Although the massive 50,000-job hiring spree by Amazon.com (AMZN) this week won't begin to show up until the next job report, the company had already been holding job fairs to staff various facilities around the country even before the nationwide event.

177,MCD,"Yum Brands (YUM) on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped forecasts early Thursday.XEstimates: Wall Street expects the company, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, to report earnings per share of 61 cents, down 19%, with revenue dropping by more than half to $1.412 billion. Same-store sales are seen up 2.2%.The EPS and revenue estimates reflect the spinoff of its China business, now called Yum China (YUMC), late last year.Results: Yum earned 68 cents a share. Revenue was $1.45 billion. Same-store sales rose 2% worldwide. Pizza Hut's global same-store sales fell 1% in Q2 vs. Taco Bell's 4% gain and KFC's 3% advance.Stock: Shares sank 2.4% to 74.78 on the stock market today. Yum hit a record high on Wednesday.Before the results, Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski raised his full-year EPS forecast on the company. Taco Bell, he said, continued to stand out by virtue of ""not being a burger brand,"" and efforts to keep its menu fresh.Among those efforts? Naked Chicken Chips — that is, seasoned white-meat chicken, in chip form, with nacho cheese sauce. Kalinowski said the promotional push for those chips during the quarter appeared to pay off.Meanwhile, he said, results out of Pizza Hut will likely be uninspiring through the rest of the year, as rivals Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) pull ahead of the industry with delivery technology.But he appreciated some of the company's recent efforts: Pizza Hut last month said it had developed a ""proprietary delivery network algorithm"" that can predict delivery times while factoring in weather, traffic, construction and other things that might affect a pizza's journey to a customer's doorstep. Kalinowski also said he expected Pizza Hut to launch a loyalty program sometime this year.Papa John's (PZZA) last month announced that customers could order food via Facebook (FB). Papa John's shares jumped Tuesday after the company a day earlier announced a $500 million hike in its buyback plan and said it would raise its leverage ratio, even though it reported second-quarter North American same-store sales that missed expectations.RELATED:McDonald's Touts Digital Progress; Domino's Falls HardBurger King Parent Restaurant Brands Earnings Top, Sales MissChipotle, Wynn Resorts, U.S. Steel, Hawaiian Earnings Top

180,MCD,"With continued congestion at mobile-order pickup lines and slowing growth stateside, is Starbucks (SBUX) a lumbering giant with little room to run?XThese are the main worries ahead of the coffee shop behemoth's third-quarter earnings report, due after the close Thursday.Analysts are expecting 12% profit growth to 55 cents a share, on 10% sales gains to $5.74 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Whether Starbucks can revive its same-store sales growth in the U.S. is key because the domestic segment accounts for about two-thirds of revenue. U.S. comps grew 3%-4% in the prior four quarters, down from 7% in fiscal Q2 2016 and 9% in Q1 2016.Management signaled during its last earnings call that comps had been accelerating, and current consensus is for 5.3% Americas comps, according to Piper Jaffray, which rates Starbucks overweight with a 70 price target.""Growth is more difficult due to weak retail trends, relatively high wage growth (especially in Starbucks' highest density states), and slowing growth in breakfast food,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer on July 12.He sees same-store sales growth returning to mid-single digits, led by digital efforts, customer engagement, better throughput execution and premium drink offerings, like the Nitro Cold Brew and its signature Frappuccinos.A wild card affecting comp sales is how much Starbucks has alleviated its too-much-of-a-good-thing issue — i.e. its mobile-order-and-pay feature is so popular that the pickup lines were bottlenecking in store.In New York City, mobile orders made up almost a quarter of rush-hour transactions at Mizuho's recent morning channel checks. While there are measures in place to soothe pain points, analyst Jeremy Scott noted on July 6 that ""congestion at the hand-off plane is still an issue and turnaway rates have picked up.""""We are encouraged by the pace of conversion in 2017, however we anticipate core beverage comps will remain challenged in the short run as we expect incremental friction during the transition period,"" he wrote.Translation: Expect to be a little annoyed at the coffee pickup station at your local Starbucks, but probably only for a little while.Stifel's Mark Astrachan, who estimates that mobile orders make up closer to 30% of transactions, said Starbucks management sees ""three waves of measures continuing through at least (fiscal) 2018 to more fully remedy issues.""Shares fell 1% to 57.94 on the stock market today, at the low end of a flat base with a 64.97 buy point, and have been trading below their 50-day line since mid-June.Rival Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), which reports early Thursday, slid 1.3% to 52.52. EPS is seen growing 9% to 62 cents on 2% sales growth to $220 million.Shares of McDonald's (MCD), which has ramped up competition in coffee, slipped 1.6% after surging 4.8% to a record high Tuesday on strong quarterly results.RELATED:Where Does Starbucks Go From Here?

181,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) on Tuesday said it was seeing higher average checks at restaurants that had mobile order and pay, and that delivery was helping the burger chain in the later portions of the evening that were typically slow.XBut as the burger chain's second-quarter results lifted shares higher, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed on weak international same-store sales and an array of other investor concerns.As McDonald's management did in its first-quarter earnings call, management spent much of its time discussing its efforts to become a more digital company via mobile ordering, delivery and a new restaurant format featuring self-ordering kiosks and table service.CEO Steve Easterbrook said it ""will take time to build awareness"" of that evolution. But the company said it was seeing higher average checks, so far, from restaurants that have mobile ordering.As for delivery, the company also appeared to be getting an early read on what was working. Sixty percent of orders were being placed late at night. Restaurants near colleges and in downtown and lower-income areas also tended to get more delivery activity than others.Management said it was on track to make mobile order and pay available in 20,000 restaurants worldwide by the end of the year, with more than 5,000 restaurants currently using it around the world. McDonald's also said that the new restaurant format, called ""Experience of the Future,"" would roll out at a faster pace next year.As for the second quarter, the company said it grew sales and guest counts in all of their top nine markets for the first time since 2008, regaining customers along the way.""Our gain will result in pain being felt elsewhere,"" Easterbrook said.In the U.S., $1 sodas and other cheap drink promotions — for smoothies, shakes and blended coffee — helped, as did its ""premium"" offerings, such as sandwiches that included toppings like pico guacamole and sweet barbecue bacon.Margins, however, fell during the quarter, due to higher labor costs and investments to prepare for digitization and the broader introduction of fresh-patty Quarter Pounders next year.Earnings per share jumped 36% to $1.70, beating estimates for $1.62. Revenue fell 3% to $6.05 billion, compared to views for $6 billion. U.S. same-store sales grew 3.9%, beating forecasts for a 3.2% increase.Shares rocketed 4.75% to close at 159.07 in the stock market today, rebounding to a new all-time high. The stock fell 1.3% to 151.85 on Monday, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since early November.Meanwhile, Domino's plunged 10% to 192.40, stabbing through the 50-day line at that key test of investor support, despite reporting earnings per share, revenue and same-store sales that topped estimates.But the pizza chain's strong EPS was largely driven by the tax rate, Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note. He also said that domestic company-owned operating margins were lower, and that there was ""some disappointment"" that no accelerated payouts were announced after a recent recapitalization.And all of that, he said, was ""occurring in the context of a stock with higher valuation multiples than most other restaurant stocks.""While Domino's mobile ordering platform has helped it stand out in a restaurant industry that has been trapped in a discounting frenzy, and its rewards program and international prospects have been seen as key accelerants for sales. But more analysts have sounded the alarm as the company's shares have marched higher over the past year.Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, in a research note on Monday, said ""we believe most of these positives are priced into the stock.""The pizza chain's earnings per share jumped 35% to $1.32, beating estimates for $1.22. Revenue popped 15% to $628.6 million, above views for $613 million. Domestic same-store sales jumped 9.5%, above forecasts for 7.7%.However, international comps rose just 2.6%, ""slightly under our expectations,"" the company said in a release.Once-trendy Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reported Q2 earnings after the close that beat forecasts while revenue missed. Chipotle, still struggling to recover from food-borne illness outbreaks that started in 2015, has been hit again by reports this month of customers getting sick.Shares closed up 2.5% at 348.62 after hitting a four-year low on Monday, and rallied another 2.5% late.RELATED:Fast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru WindowFor Earnings Trades, These 4 Names Look The Most Actionable

184,MCD,"A busy day of headlines Tuesday resulted in a nice day of outperformance for the Dow Jones industrial average and a new high for the S&P 500 but a sluggish day overall for tech stocks.Alphabet (GOOGL) cast a pall on the tech sector after the company reported earnings late Monday. Shares fell 3%.At the close, the Dow rose almost 0.5%; the S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%. Small caps fared the best with the Russell 2000 up 0.8%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq both coming in higher than Monday's levels.X Inside the Dow, Caterpillar (CAT) soared 6% on a nice earnings beat and second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. McDonald's (MCD), meanwhile, jumped 5% as Wall Street cheered solid earnings as well as a 3.9% increase in U.S. same-store sales, nicely above expectations.Financials also outperformed as bond yields rose. Dow components JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) ended with gains of nearly 2%. JPMorgan is back near highs but just below a 94.08 buy point. Goldman has been a laggard in the financial sector for a while now as it trades near  its recently converged 50- and 200-day moving averages.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up 7 basis points  to 2.32% as the two-day Fed meeting got underway. A decision on interest rates is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.The market is not expecting a rate hike tomorrow, and one more before the end of the year is still in question, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Futures traders think there's a 47% chance the Fed will hike rates one more time before the end of the year.Some oil and gas-related groups outperformed as oil prices jumped. September WTI crude oil jumped $1.55, or 3.3%, to settle at $47.89 a barrel.Heavy-volume gainers included Rio Tinto (RIO). Shares jumped 5% to 45.93. It's still in buy range after gapping up over a 45.81 cup-with-handle buy point. Mining firms outperformed on the heels of strong results from Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which soared nearly 15%.On the downside, shares of Seagate (STX) crashed more than 16% on a big earnings miss. It's been a laggard since gapping below the 50-day moving in late April. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) was another big loser, down 10%, despite another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth.

The S&P 500 gained 0.3% to touch another record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq edged slightly lower.XAmong the Dow industrials, McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) were the day's best performers, advancing about 4% each. The Golden Arches beat earnings and sales estimates as its new line of premium sandwiches helped boost same-store sales in the U.S. by 3.9%. Global same-stores sales increase 6.6% in Q2. Shares of the restaurant chain operator offered a brief buy opportunity on a rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Meanwhile, Caterpillar beat the Street's Q2 forecasts, while boosting its full-year revenue and profit outlook. Shares found support at their 50-day line last Friday and are now 13% above a 99.56 flat-base entry.On the downside, MMM (MMM) plunged nearly 6% to break through its 50-day line in heavy volume after Q2 revenues came in lower than expected.Energy names were some of the top performing stocks in the stock market today as the price of crude oil increased over 2%. Transocean (RIG) and Murphy Oil (MUR) jumped over 3% apiece, but remain stuck in long-term downtrends under their 200-day lines.FANG member Alphabet (GOOGL) declined almost 3% despite beating its Q2 earnings estimates late Monday. Investors were concerned about the company's traffic acquisition costs, which rose 28% in Q2. Shares approached their 1008.72 flat-base entry on Monday, but never broke out. The stock will need to set up to try again after today's decline.Among leading stocks, data storage leaders Western Digital (WDC) and Micron Technology (MU) declined 1.3% and 4.3%, respectively, after Seagate Technology (STX) missed Q4 earnings targets early Tuesday. Shares of Seagate plunged 15% and the stock was trading at a new 2017 low.Meanwhile, Western Digital and Micron found themselves back near their 50-day lines. Western Digital is still holding well-above its 79.25 double-bottom buy point. Micron is just above its 29.97 flat-base entry.Within the IBD 50, Centene Corp (CNC) jumped 1% and is approaching the 20% profit-taking level from a 73.33 cup-with-handle entry.On the downside, China-based New Oriental Education (EDU) declined 3% as it builds the right side of a potential base.

Lumentum management said it has $200 million in orders for 3D devices in calendar 2017 and manufacturing yields have been solid. One question, though is how much Apple business Lumentum will potentially share with Germany's AMS, Finisar (FNSR) and II-VI (IIVI).

191,MCD,"Are there any mutual funds that hold Dow Jones Industrial stocks like Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) and also beat the broad stock market in both total return and yield?For many investors — especially people interested in retirement income — finding a mutual fund whose total return and yield top the stock market is the holy grail of investing.You can find such stock mutual funds. One place to look is among top-performing dividend-oriented stock funds. Several hold leading stocks that are approaching buy points or are within buy ranges.But be wary of dividend stock mutual funds that have only outperformed over relatively short recent periods.For example, the broad market measured by the S&P 500 scored a total return — share-price gain plus income — of 11.56% this year through July 24. The $93.1 billion American Capital World Growth & Income Fund (CWGIX), just to name one, did much better, galloping ahead 16.26%, according to Morningstar Inc. It holds Boeing along with many other stocks with attractive yield.But how risky would it be to bet on that fund going forward? World Growth & Income's longer-term performance is not as impressive as its year-to-date performance. Its five-year and 10-year average annual gains of 12.35% and 4.62% both lag the S&P 500's 15.47% and 7.33%.So, rather than looking for a fund that outperformed over a short recent period, look for long-term, consistent outperformers.Check out dividend-oriented stock mutual funds that have existed for at least 10 years. And consider confining your search to funds that have at least $100 million in shareholder assets. Those funds have survived long enough and satisfied enough shareholders to show that they are not unproven flash-in-the-pan portfolios.There are 544 such funds. And 61 of them average an annual total return higher than the S&P 500's in the past 10 years.That group's average 12-month yield is 1.59%. That lags the bogey's 1.91%, measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Still, some individual stock mutual funds among those 61 outperformers do have 12-month yield that tops the S&P 500's.The three with the best 10-year average annual returns, whose yields also top the S&P 500's, are $1.1 billion Pimco StocksPlus Small (PSCSX), up an average of 12.07% a year; $1.4 billion Hennessy Gas Utility (GASFX), up 9.09% on average; and $13.9 billion AIG Focused Dividend Strategy (FDSAX), with a 9.07% average yearly gain. Their yields range from 2.36% by Hennessy to 4.33% for Pimco.The AIG fund, whose yield is 2.93%, holds stocks such as Boeing (BA), which is up 53% this year through Aug. 2. The aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor sports a 93 Composite Rating from IBD. Composite Ratings range from 1-99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.And Boeing is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.In addition, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.4%. It has boosted dividends five years in a row, according to dividend.com.AIG Focused Dividend also owns McDonald's, which is up 30% this year and yielding 2.4% and Caterpillar, up 24% and yielding 2.8%.Caterpiller is looking for a rebound in earnings, with analysts expecting growth of 51% and 24% this year and next following an average decline of 21% the past three years.The $522 million Nicholas Equity Income (NSEIX) is yet another one of the 61 funds whose 10-year average annual return and its current 12-month yield are better than the S&P 500's. The fund's yearly return over the decade is 8.54%. Its 12-month yield is 3.32%.One of the stocks helping Equity Income is PNC Financial Services (PNC). The bank holding company stock has a 2.3% dividend yield. Up 11% this year, shares are trading around 130 and are approaching a 131.93 entry point.Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another holding. Brian Demain, manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise Fund (JANEX) — which also holds Microchip Technology but is not a dividend-focused fund — recently told IBD that the company gets most of its revenue from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that are used in a wide variety of products. That diversification gives the company sustainable growth.Evidence of that is the company's earnings per share growth, which has accelerated for six quarters in a row.The stock has a dividend yield of 1.8%. Shares are up 24% this year. The stock, which has a 98 Comp Rating and an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD, is up 24% this year. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return on equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Trading around 80, the stock is below an 87.59 entry.The $32.2 billion Vanguard Dividend Growth (VDIGX) has gained at a yearly average of 8.07% over the past decade. Its current 12-month yield is 2%.Microsoft (MSFT) is one holding. The software giant, which has a 95 Comp Rating, is up 16% this year. Its dividend yield is 2.2%. After pulling back for the past week, the stock is slightly below its 72.99 buy point in a flat base.  RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHot Stocks Owned By Top-Performing Stock Mutual Funds

Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also raised their full-year earnings outlooks after reporting Q2 earnings results above estimates. Northrop said its aerospace-system sales climbed on higher manned-aircraft demand, including work on its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. Raytheon saw higher air-defense missile and smart bomb sales and General Dynamics' revenue got support from strong Gulfstream and defense-product demand.Boeing shares soared 14% for the week.

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion.

Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped; results from Melco and U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) were mixed.Shares in AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) soared after the telecoms reported better-than-expected wireless results amid stiff competition.

Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks.

194,MCD,"When an UberEats driver heads to Paul Tulaphorn's McDonald's (MCD) on Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, Calif., a loudspeaker pings sharply, loud enough to be heard over the frappe machine, to let the staff know.Behind the counter, employees manage those orders via an iPad next to a dedicated register. A designated tech worker helps install that technology, and stands ready to fix a register when it goes down, change over the store's data-processing systems, or upgrade the ""smart clock"" that changes the restaurant's digital menu displays.Restaurants often lag other industries in adopting new technology, lacking the time or budget for massive digital overhauls. But as industry sales have slowed recently, smartphone conveniences have found their way into the world of burgers and fries. Many in the industry are betting that its future lies in that technology — in large part through mobile orders, payments and delivery.""We have to be ready,"" Tulaphorn, a four-decade McDonald's veteran who owns nine McDonald's locations in Southern California, said of the coming technological wave. ""And I think we'll be ready.""Mobile ordering and delivery from the likes of McDonald's, Jack in the Box (JACK), Wendy's (WEN) and Burger King mark the biggest change in the way people order fast food since the drive-thru. As that change ripples through the industry, restaurants are facing down questions like how to preserve margins, avoid parking-lot traffic jams, and keep French fries crispy once they enter the balmy ecosphere of the delivery bag.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's is one of the best performers on the Dow Jones industrial average this year. But it's only the 8th in IBD's Retail-Restaurant group. To see which eateries are the true leaders, and how they stack up vs. rivals, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Just as the drive-thru accommodated generations shaped by mass-market car culture, the new digital efforts cater to a new cohort of fast-food customers shaped by e-commerce, social media, smartphones, streaming video and, in one way or another, a lack of time.Restaurants' trial runs and partnerships with delivery services could give chains a head start in capturing today's tech-savvy diners. Cowen & Co. estimated last year that U.S. restaurant delivery alone could become a $35 billion market by 2025.""We're currently very optimistic that we're tapping into a new customer base and serving them in a new way,"" Bill Garrett, corporate vice president of delivery at McDonald's, said in an interview. ""It's a customer that otherwise would likely have not gone out to eat.""The company is still trying to glean precise details about core delivery customers, Garrett says. He sees ""a lot of research"" ahead.Some restaurants have been on the delivery and digital path for a while. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) are old pros. Starbucks (SBUX) began offering mobile order and pay in 2014.The Golden Arches already offered delivery internationally and has dabbled with it in the U.S. This year it has expanded its partnership with UberEats, the ride-hailing service's food-delivery segment, to major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. McDonald's said that as of the end of June at least 3,500 of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants offered UberEats delivery. The burger chain also plans to offer mobile ordering via an app in thousands more locations this year.Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King is also testing mobile order and payments. Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts and Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell and KFC have partnered with the delivery service DoorDash. Panera Bread (PNRA), which is being taken private, also has jumped into delivery and plans to hire 10,000 drivers.So far, McDonald's delivery customers tend to skew younger, Garrett says. Delivery demand has been spread evenly across the day, though the end-of-dinner, late-night period appears to draw a slightly higher share of business compared to the company's traditional business. Dunkin' Donuts, in an email, said its delivery service is popular with millennials and ""a younger generation who live in an on-demand world.""As fast-food chains figure out who these new consumers are, they also have to solve the logistical puzzle that digital ordering can bring to restaurants, which face space limitations in their kitchens and parking lots.No massive problems have been reported by the delivery newcomers. McDonald's says its kitchens, drive-thrus and parking lots are able to handle more orders. At the same time, McDonald's shares are reaching new highs, rising to a record intraday peak of 156.56 on Friday.But digital orders can come with a learning curve.Starbucks has said the customer flow at some locations slowed as customers who ordered ahead on its popular mobile order and pay app crowded into restaurants. Management said in April that Starbucks would add staff to its busiest stores at peak times and consider new equipment and layouts to speed throughput. The company was introducing a digital order management system to help baristas track orders with a tablet and notify customers via mobile app when drinks were ready.Even a few seconds can make a big difference in processing orders and deliveries. The fast-food business, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said, is ""maniacal about drive-thru speeds."" Years ago, then-McDonald's CEO Jack Greenberg said unit sales got a 1% bump for every six seconds shaved off the drive-thru time.Tulaphorn says French fries take three minutes to cook and have a seven-minute holding time. When an UberEats driver arrives, the restaurant aims to have orders in the car and on the road within five minutes.DoorDash aims to deliver within around 20 minutes. That means different things in different areas.""Manhattan, on a bike, could be 20 blocks or 30 blocks,"" said Eitan Bencuya, DoorDash's head of communications. ""In Dallas, Texas, 20 minutes could be five miles away.""Early on, UberEats drivers sometimes got address numbers wrong, Tulaphorn says. And as with any other change, the new technology requires training for employees and older customers.McDonald's initially thought sending drivers through the drive-thru would be best, Garrett says. The company later found it was better to let drivers choose whether to take the drive-thru or go inside the restaurant. In Southern California, McDonald's restaurant operators can decide whether they want to allocate parking spaces just for UberEats drivers.DoorDash, meanwhile, found that the drive-thru wasn't the way to go. ""Just by looking at the number of deliveries that we bring to a restaurant, we found that it would actually overload the drive-thru to have Dashers lining up through their cars,"" Bencuya said.Some foods hold up better than others inside a delivery container. Pizza works, and ideally is still cooking when it's being delivered, Normura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski says. Chinese food, tacos, soups, sandwiches, pasta and salads also hold up fine. French fries, however, are a delicate situation.At Tulaphorn's McDonald's, fries go into a sleeve, then into their own separate bag, then into a bigger delivery bag that's sticker-sealed to verify that it hasn't been opened on its way. The UberEats driver also has a thermal bag to carry this delivery bag.Garrett says the company is looking at packaging changes that might help keep drinks and desserts from spilling, but wouldn't get into specifics.Restaurants that work with DoorDash get access to the deliverer's own packaging. DoorDash drivers can wrap the takeout container in a thin, metallic ""space blanket"" and put that inside an insulated bag.Similarly, some companies are more naturally suited to delivery, analysts say.In general, digital ordering benefits bigger brands with deep pockets for technology, Kalinowski says.McDonald's cites its massive geographic reach as an advantage. By its own estimates, nearly three-quarters of the population in its top five markets — the U.S., France, U.K., Germany and Canada — lives within three miles of one of its restaurants.Charles says a place like Wingstop (WING), which has limited seating and already does a lot of to-go business via digital, could be well-positioned for delivery.Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier says Panera's food — soup, sandwiches, salads — travels well. She notes that Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden has been strong in to-go orders; Italian food also tends to withstand delivery better than French fries.""I think that's McDonald's biggest challenge,"" she said.Wall Street likely will focus more on the profit impact when the novelty of digital ordering wears off and restaurants gain more sense of who their digital customers are. Commissions paid to third-party delivery services risk degrading margins, so restaurants need to watch their delivery sales trends to justify the hit, Charles says.Delivery fees also raise costs for consumers. A McDonald's Quarter Pounder with cheese meal, with a medium Coke and fries, delivered via UberEats to IBD's Los Angeles office from the Marina del Rey area takes an estimated 20 to 30 minutes. A $4.99 ""booking fee"" is tacked on to the food charge of $6.89 and 60 cents in taxes, bringing the total cost to $12.48.Independent restaurants' sales growth has outpaced that of restaurant chains, a pattern that could continue for the rest of the decade, food-industry consulting firm Pentallect estimated in April. Customers, it said, felt independent restaurants were more community oriented, with better quality, value and service. The trend comes on top of the day-to-day difficulties of competition, discounting and higher labor costs.""I think that simply put, you've got a pretty mature industry out there that's experiencing periods of weakness,"" Charles said. ""So essentially operators are looking for: 'What's the shiny object out there? What's the lever I can pull to really get my sales going?' It increasingly seems like it's delivery.""RELATED:These Are The Dow's Top 5 Stocks In 2017 — And Apple Isn't No. 1McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's Pizza Eyes Delivery Wars As McDonald's Expands ServiceJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdob

195,MCD,"Amazon (AMZN) grocery takeover target Whole Foods Market (WFM) reported better-than-expected earnings Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the expected after-hours release. Las Vegas Sands (LVS), and Nutrisystem (NTRI) reported better-than-expected earnings late Wednesday.
"
196,MCD,"XEstimates: Second-quarter earnings per share of 61 cents, up 17%, on revenue up 14% to $3.019 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS rose 38% to 73 cents. Revenue climbed nearly 19% to $3.14 billion.Stock: Sands stock initially rose modestly in late trade but reversed lower for a 1.3% drop to 60.85. Shares dipped 1.55% to 61.65 in the stock market today, closing just below their rising 50-day line. Shares are making their way through a flat base above a cup-with-handle pattern. The new buy point is 66.32.Las Vegas Sands' results come as gaming revenue rebounds in Macau, the world's biggest gambling hot spot and the only place in China where it is legal, after restrictions in recent years raised concerns that high-rolling VIPs would be scared away.Barclays believes Las Vegas Sands is poised for long-term growth as mass-market gaming gets bigger in Macau. The company also has the most hotel rooms and Macau and solid potential to do more nongaming business, the investment firm said.Wynn Resorts (WYNN), whose second-quarter results topped estimates late Tuesday, fell 5% to 132, closing just below its 50-day moving average. Wynn sank as low as 128.44 intraday. The opening of Wynn Palace in Macau last year led to a surge in revenue, but concerns about mass-market gaming in the region weighed on the stock.Macau's smoking ban in casinos hurt mass-market results, Wynn management said on its earnings call, adding that the segment seemed likely to improve following the completion of construction projects that have hindered people's access to Wynn Palace.MGM Resorts International (MGM) fell 1.2%. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) slid 1.7% while U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) was flat. MGM, Melco and Boyd all report earnings on Thursday.MGM is extended from a breakout while Melco is in a flat base but below its 50-day. Boyd Gaming has been flirting with a buy point.Estimates: Wall Street expects Nutrisystem, which offers meal plans and other services to help people lose weight, to report second-quarter EPS of 61 cents, up 13%, as sales jump 21% to $181 million.Results: EPS was 80 cents, up 48%. Revenue rose 30% to $194.9 million.Outlook: Nutrisystem sees Q3 revenue of $153 million to $158 million vs. the consensus for $143 million. It sees Q3 EPS of 42 cents, in line with views. Nutrisystem raised its full-year revenue target $684 million to $694 million vs. analysts' estimate of $661 million. It raised its full-year EPS target by a dime to $1.94.  Analysts had expected $1.69.Stock: Nutrisystem shot up 7% to 67.50 in late trade after a brief halt. Shares rose 2.1% to 62.95. The stock is extended after clearing a 55.10 buy point in late trade.Estimates: Fiscal third-quarter earnings per share down 8% to 34 cents, as revenue ticks up 0.5% to $3.721 billion.Results: EPS of 36 cents, down 3%, as sales edged up 0.6% to $3.725 billion. Same-store sales fell 1.9%, a smaller decline than forecast.Stock: Shares rose 0.1% to 41.81, little changed after the earnings report and just below the 42 takeover price from Amazon. Whole Foods traded above 42 for a few weeks on speculation that there might be another bid.Whole Foods will not hold a post-earnings conference call, citing the Amazon deal.Amazon said last month said it would buy the upscale grocery chain for $13.7 billion. The deal upended retail and grocery stocks and raised questions about what the e-commerce giant, with its huge data-gathering arsenal and broad fulfillment infrastructure, might do with Whole Foods.""The possible scenarios range from the very disruptive — Amazon running Whole Foods at margin neutral, offering one hour delivery, and focusing more on prepared offerings,"" Jefferies said in a research note this month, ""to the more incremental — testing price elasticity, optimizing data, selling Amazon devices and offering the ability to pick up online orders at the stores.""McDonald's (MCD) CEO Steve Easterbrook, during the burger chain's second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, would not comment on that deal or its implications for home-meal kits.But he did say that McDonald's efforts in delivery were ""a great example of how we're responding to the rapidly-changing tastes and expectations of consumers.""More broadly, Whole Foods, known for its lush expanses of produce and long aisles of Belgian-influenced beer, has struggled to compete with more traditional grocery-store companies that have begun stocking their shelves with more organic fare.RELATED:McDonald's Touts Digital Progress; Domino's Falls HardThese 3 Casino Stocks Are Near Buy Zones Ahead Of Earnings

197,MCD,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point. Edwards Lifesciences has fallen back below a buy point in a big cup-with-handle base, undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), D.R. Horton (DHI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Fortinet (FTNT) are among the many other top-rated stocks set to report earnings Wednesday.RELATED:Texas Instruments, AMD Beat Q2 Targets, Guide HigherAT&T Q2 Adjusted Profit Beats, Pay-TV Video Subscribers FallWill Facebook Earnings Support Its Strong Stock Growth?The Big Picture: Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials LeadHow To Win With Growth Stocks Like Netflix, Nvidia During Earnings

The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.6% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges, on track to end two days of declining volume.The Street isn't expecting any pop from the Fed meeting when it concludes Wednesday afternoon. CME Group's FedWatch Tool sees a 96.9% chance that interest rates will stay the same — a range of 1% to 1.25%. Odds are put at even for a hike in December.Perhaps a more closely watched item will be Friday's release of the second-quarter GDP number. The Street expects 2.6% growth.Laggard groups were posting the day's best gains midday Tuesday. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, department stores rose 4%. Oil stocks, specialty steel and metal ores also advanced confidently.The big money-center banks were scoring respectable gains. Morgan Stanley (MS) spurred 1.9% higher, posting a new high. Citigroup (C)  gapped up 3.1%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) advanced 1.8%.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top stocks, chipmaker Macom (MTSI) surged 2.1% in below-average volume as it pegged a new high. The stock is on track for its fifth up session in a row. Macom will report quarterly results Aug. 1 after the close. The Street's consensus estimate pegs earnings at 69 cents a share, which would be a 47% increase vs. the year-ago quarter.Blue chips were mostly up. Caterpillar (CAT) gapped up nearly 6%, while McDonald's (MCD) added 4.4% following earnings reports this morning. On the downside, Dow component 3M (MMM) dropped nearly 5% after missing the Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines.In the S&P 500, Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) gapped up 15% in torrid volume. Freeport turned in a profit of 17 cents a share vs. a loss of 2 cents a share in the year-ago quarter, according to data from IBD sister company William O'Neil + Co.In the Nasdaq 100, beaten-down Tractor Supply (TSCO) rumbled 3.4% higher in heavy volume. The retailer is about 45% off its April 2016 high, and below both its 200-day and 50-day moving average lines.RELATED:This Chip Stock Is Forming A New BaseThe Sell Signal Investors Should Know In This Market

199,MCD,"S&P 500 index futures rose early Tuesday morning, but Nasdaq 100 futures fell after Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported higher-than-expected traffic acquisition costs to partner sites, with some blaming Apple (AAPL). Meanwhile, four notable stocks that are near buy points report early Tuesday: General Motors (GM), Eli Lilly (LLY), 3M (MMM) and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU).XThe Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% on Monday, hitting another all-time high. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.3%.Nasdaq 100 futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. But S&P 500 index futures rose nearly 0.2% while Dow futures climbed 0.3%.Alphabet reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue, factoring in a $2.7 billion charge for a European Union regulatory fine. But traffic acquisition costs (TAC), what it pays partners to carry its ads, shot up 28% to $5.09 billion. That could be tied to a revised search deal with Apple, analysts said.Alphabet had closed up 0.45% to 998.31, rising as high as 1,006.10 intraday, just below a 1,008.71 buy point from a flat base. But Google's parent fell nearly 3% in early trading Tuesday.While overnight action doesn't always translate into regular-session stock performance, Alphabet shows that being near a buy point is not the same as actually rising above it. Still, stocks approaching sound entries from bullish patterns are often worth watching. Here are four stocks near buy points that are reporting quarterly results early Tuesday.General Motors cleared a 36.10 cup-with-handle buy point on July 14, and continued to edge higher in below-average volume for a few days. But GM shares have retreated for the past three sessions, losing 0.7% to 35.84, dropping below the still-valid entry.Analysts expect GM's per-share profit to fall 7.5% to $1.72 as revenue drops 5% to $40.25 billion, according to consensus estimates from Zacks Investment Research.For the past three sessions Eli Lilly shares have risen intraday above an 84.86 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, only to close just below that level. Lilly ended Monday at 84.74.Eli Lilly is expected to report EPS of $1.04 up 21% vs. 86 cents a year earlier. Revenue should climb 3% to $5.589 billion vs. $5.405 billion.The industrial conglomerate and Dow Jones industrial average component has formed a short flat base with a potential entry of 214.67. 3M closed Monday at 210.Analysts expect 3M to deliver a 24.5% EPS jump to $2.59, with revenue up nearly 3% to $7.879 billion.Fellow Dow components McDonald's (MCD), United Technologies (UTX), DuPont (DD) and Caterpillar (CAT) also report Tuesday.The Chinese operator of for-profit schools is a member of the IBD 50.

200,MCD,"A stronger-than-expected June jobs report Friday fueled a low-volume rally on Wall Street. Tech stocks were back in favor, at least for a day, as the Nasdaq composite was up 1.1% in afternoon trading.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average also did well, up 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq's tidy gain wasn't enough to lift the tech index back above the 50-day moving average, but it's getting close. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking about 5% to 10% lower than Thursday's levels.McDonald's (MCD) and Microsoft (MSFT) outperformed in the Dow with gains of more than 1.5%. Nasdaq 100 leaders included semiconductor names Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX). Both jumped nearly 4%.The IBD 50 served up plenty of strong movers as nearly half the names in the index rose 2% or more. Lumentum (LITE) was a top percentage gainer, up about 5%. It's been getting support at the 50-day moving average, albeit in light volume. Coherent (COHR), meanwhile, was trying to reclaim its 50-day moving average after a pullback. Shares jumped 5% in average volume.In economic news, nonfarm payrolls increased 220,000 in June, well above the consensus estimate of 170,000. The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.4%. Bond investors were unfazed by the report as the 10-year Treasury yield edged higher by 1 basis point to 2.38%.Benchmark crude oil tumbled 2.5% to $44.35 barrel as excess supply remains a focal point in the oil market.In the stock market today, RV maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) gained 2.5% after Stifel Nicolaus initiated coverage with a buy rating and 40 price target, citing new products, a strong management team and a reasonable valuation.

202,MCD,"The U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs in June, as the jobless rate ticked up to 4.4%, the Labor Department reported on Friday, the latest sign of renewed economic momentum.XAlong with an upward revision of 47,000 to April and May payrolls, it now looks like the apparent slowdown in hiring never happened. The average monthly job gain over the past three months is 194,000, after preliminary data last month showed payroll growth had slowed to a near five-year low of 121,000.Headline wage figures were tame, but key details suggest solid income gains.Although the jobless rate edged higher from June's 16-year low, as more people joined the workforce, the labor market momentum could add pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise rates again at its September meeting. The jobs data follow strong reports on manufacturing and the service sector from the Institute for Supply Management""The rebound in payrolls strongly supports (the Fed) view that the soft-looking spring data were 'transitory,'"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.""If payroll gains are sustained at anything like their June pace,"" Shepherdson says, the Fed has every reason to expect that the jobless rate will keep moving lower and wage pressures will finally pick up. He thinks the Fed may be forced to hike in September.For now, markets aren't buying it, with just 14% odds of a September hike, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Treasury yields, which have rallied strongly over the past week, oscillated up and down slightly after the jobs report. The sudden surge in recent days has had less to do with the Fed than the European Central Bank's readiness to begin scaling back its bond-buying program.The major averages recovered some lost ground on the stock market today, with the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index up 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite 0.5%. The S&P 500 is just above its 50-day moving average after closing below that key level on Thursday.The Labor Department said that the hard-hit retail sector added 8,100 jobs in June, after a string of monthly losses. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) continues to hire apace, recently holding job fairs in Tacoma, Wash., Las Vegas, and Kansas City, Kan. Amazon also announced in April that it will hire 5,000 part-time customer-service reps to work out of their homes.McDonald's (MCD) recently said the fast-food chain and its franchisees will add 250,000 workers this summer — more than a year ago. McDonald's announced a partnership with Snap (SNAP) to recruit via its Snapchat social media site. Snap will connect users to an online application if they click on a McDonald's recruitment ad.The Institute for Supply Management service-sector and manufacturing surveys both pointed to strong employment gains in June. It's a different story for the auto industry, which has seen slumping car sales lately from Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and others. Ford and General Motors have both announced layoffs recently.Overall, the manufacturing sector added 1,000 jobs last month.IBD'S TAKE: IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Tuesday, June 27, a signal to investors to exercise extra caution in buying stocks and to take some money off the table to deploy when the turbulence subsides. Make sure to read IBD's The Big Picture each day to get the latest on the market trend and what it means for your investments.The one notable weak spot in the report was wage growth. Hourly average wages rose 0.2% on the month, below the 0.3% expected, putting the annual gain at a tepid 2.5%.Yet despite that dreary news on hourly pay, the report contained pretty good overall news about income growth. Factoring in hours worked and wage levels, average weekly pay rose 2.8% in June, matching the best total since July 2011. Aggregate pay, which also factors in employment growth, rose 4.5% from a year ago, tied for the best result since January 2016.One oddity from the report was a 35,000 rise in local government employment. That may have partly largely related to seasonal issues tied to the school calendar.The Fed still has two more jobs reports to sift through before the September 19-20 meeting. Small business hiring will be important to watch between now and then.  The Paychex/IHS Small Business Employment watch showed that hiring by small firms is now growing at the slowest pace since 2011 after a four-month deceleration. Meanwhile, the National Federation of Independent Business said its survey showed that the percentage of firms reducing employment overtook the share increasing payrolls in June.""Small business owners seem to be in a holding pattern while they wait to see what Congress will do with taxes and health care,"" said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan.Of those looking to hire, 85% said they had trouble finding qualified workers.Over time, that tightness — full employment, as the Fed sees it — is expected to feed through to higher wage inflation, justifying less accommodative monetary policy.RELATED:Draghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market SupportFed Hikes Rates, But Hawkish Tone Unnerves MarketsAmazon Announces Part-Time Hires As Retailers Shutter Stores

203,MCD,"Yum China (YUMC) — the restaurant operator spun off late last year from Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell owner Yum Brands (YUM) — reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped some estimates, but sales fell short.X Estimates: Earnings per share of 24 cents on revenue of $1.632 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Yum China began trading publicly in November.Results: EPS rose 29% to 27 cents. Revenue was $1.594 billion. Same-store sales climbed 0.3%.Mobile payments surpassed 40% of sales during the quarter, with delivery comprising 13% of sales. Yum China also said it had acquired a controlling interest in the holding company for the online delivery service Daojia, which operates in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.Shares: Yum China shares fell 4.8% to 38.22 in after-hours action after initially plunging nearly 10%. The stock closed down 0.2% to 40.19 on the stock market today after falling to 39.40 intraday. The stock has been consolidating for the past three weeks after hitting a record 42.12 on June 8.Yum Brands spun off Yum China in November following the influence of an activist investor and food-safety issues at the China segment. In announcing the spinoff, Yum Brands said the separation would create two more focused companies that could better reward shareholders.In a research note last month, RBC analyst David Palmer said Yum China was on solid ground with CEO Micky Pant at the helm. The company, Palmer noted, believes it could eventually increase its store count to at least 20,000 in the nation, up from around 7,600 today.That expansion, Palmer said, would come from ""entering new markets with established or planned infrastructure investments that include high-speed railways, roads, schools and hospitals.""Palmer also said KFC China had ""turned the corner,"" citing in part the launch of a loyalty program, the introduction of mobile payments and the simplification of its menu. But he said Pizza Hut China's sales could be uneven this year and that Taco Bell's prospects, while good, might take several years to pay off as it grows in the country. Taco Bell opened its first restaurant in China at the end of last year.Yum Brands closed down 0.3% to 73.12.

205,MCD,"Hopes of a better economy helped big banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) close out 2016 at the top of the Dow Jones industrial average. Six months later, stocks like Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and McDonald's (MCD) are the top blue chips helped by a mix of strong earnings reports and the companies' adaptation to an ever-digitizing world.XHere's a look at the Dow industrials' five best performers so far this year, which also include Visa (V) and 3M (MMM).Meanwhile, here are the Dow's five biggest dogs of 2017.The biggest gainer is aerospace giant Boeing, up 27% so far this year. Solid earnings reports have lifted the aerospace company's stock, and orders at last week's Paris Air Show came in ahead of those of rival Airbus (EADSY).The stock has pulled back slightly from last week's record high but are still slightly extended from a May breakout.At the end of last year, President Trump's complaints about the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program may have signaled a new age of strong-arming out of the White House. But the president later softened his stance, concluding an event at a South Carolina Boeing facility by saying: ""God bless Boeing.""Second in line is McDonald's, whose stock price has jumped 26% on a combination of strong earnings and strong prospects. The burger chain is expanding its delivery services and mobile ordering, and rolling out a new, more digitized restaurant format to its locations.""We believe McDonald's rapid implementation of mobile order and pay and in-restaurant kiosks will help drive meaningful sustained sales lifts in addition to reduced front of house labor,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a research note Thursday, in which the firm raised its price target on the stock to 175 from 156.Following up McDonald's is Apple. Shares of the iPhone maker are up 24% this year, boosted by excitement surrounding the iPhone 8 and hikes in dividends and buybacks in its last quarterly report. Apple had been up more than 30%, leading the Dow, until selling off in June.Shares are in a flat base but has a lot of work to do.Like other tech stocks, shares of Apple sank on June 9 on concerns that the long run-up in the sector had gone a little too far. But unlike many other big techs, Apple fell below its 50-day moving average the following day and has been stuck below that level.More recently, Pacific Crest Securities said that Apple's services business — which includes the App Store, iTunes and Apple Music — could slow down.Other analysts have worried that the company was too slow to put out a smart-home assistant that could compete with Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). But Apple could up the stakes in the battle for a more sophisticated device with smart glasses.Visa, up 20%, is the Dow's fourth best performer. Zacks analysts say that acquisitions, in particular that of Visa Europe, stand to help Visa expand, as do its prospects internationally and in electronic and mobile payments.3M, the diversified manufacturer best known to consumers for products like Post-it notes and Scotch tape, rounds out the Dow' s top 5. Shares have gained 16.6% in 2017.""Since 2012, the company has significantly pruned its businesses, thereby improving customer relevance, productivity and speed through a leaner operating structure,"" Zacks analysts said in a research note. ""3M has also maintained a steady investment in R&D to develop innovative products.""RELATED:The Dow's 5 Worst Stocks In 2017: Who's The Biggest Dog?McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresWhy Boeing's Paris Air Show Orders Are 'Staggering'As iPhone Turns 10, Apple Is Preparing To Replace ItVisa Invests In Hot Tech Unicorn With This Unique Twist On Payments

206,MCD,"Analyst actions on Thursday included price target hikes for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), McDonald's (MCD), American Express (AXP), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV).Credit Suisse raised its price target for the Dow Jones industrial average component to 102 from 99, keeping an outperform rating, after JPMorgan passed its stress test and got Federal Reserve approval for a 12% dividend hike to 56 cents and a $19.4 billion buyback.Analyst Susan Roth Katzk said the share repurchase authorization was 15% higher than she expected. As a result, she raised her EPS estimate for fiscal 2018 by a nickel to $7.65.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.5% to 91.16 on the stock market today after rising to 92.65 intraday. The stock cleared an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: These four bank stocks are on breakout watch as futures pointed higher after JPMorgan and other banks got Federal Reserve approval for dividend hikes and bigger-than-expected share buybacks.BTIG hiked its price target for the fast-food giant to 175 from 156, keeping a buy rating. Analyst Peter Saleh expects mobile order and pay and its Experience of the Future restaurant investments to produce sustainable sales gains. He bumped up his fiscal 2018 EPS estimate by 22 cents to $7.01, vs. a current consensus of $6.85.McDonald's shares fell 0.8% to 153.13.Instinet raised its price target on the high-end credit card company to 80 from 78, keeping a neutral rating. The research firm bumped up its EPS estimates to $5.64 for 2017 and $5.97 for 2018, but that's below the consensus estimates of $5.69 and $6.30.Shares of the Dow component broke above an 82 buy point on June 20, though on middling volume, and have continued to push higher this week as financial stocks have led the market. But Instinet isn't going along for the ride, with its new target about 5% below Wednesday's closing price.Shares of AmEx fell 0.4% to 83.66 after rising to 85.39 in morning action.BofAMerrill Lynch raised price targets on a number of U.S. airlines, singling out Delta Air Lines and Southwest as the best positioned.Analyst Andrew Didora hiked his price targets for Delta to 71 from 64 and Southwest to 75 from 62, keeping a buy rating on both.Shares of Delta rose 0.1% to 53.89, while Southwest fell 0.3% to 61.83.RELATED:JPMorgan, BofA, Citi, Wells Fargo Hike Payouts, OK Massive BuybacksCheap Eats, Mobile Ordering Seen Giving McDonald's EdgeCredit Card Giant Heads For Buy Point, Rivals Near Sell: Investing Action PlanThese 5 Warren Buffett Stocks Are In Buy Range

207,MCD,"Wall Street was underwhelmed on Wednesday by the release of President Trump's plan for the biggest tax cuts ever and a stock-market fantasy 15% corporate tax rate.JPMorgan Chase analysts called the plan ""virtually impossible to pass,"" and some analysts said it might be a step backward for tax cuts because of the White House's insistence that an economic acceleration to 3% GDP growth would largely cover the cost.That reaction may explain why the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all turned slight gains into modest losses after the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, both Goldman Sachs alums, released a rudimentary outline of their tax plan.But Goldman Sachs political economist Alec Phillips sees ""a good chance that tax legislation becomes law"" by the end of the year. ""In fact, market sentiment regarding fiscal policy might have become too negative,"" Phillips writes.Goldman's analysis, in other words, assumes that the Dow and S&P have climbed back near record territory and the Nasdaq has surged to a new high because of good earnings and a market-friendly French election result, rather than hopes for Trump's fiscal policies.The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite rose fractionally Thursday morning, in part on generally positive earnings.McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) have led the Dow's renewed advance toward 21,000 this week on the strength of an improving earnings and sales outlook. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have helped pad the gains as the 10-year Treasury yield and Federal Reserve rate-hiking expectations continued to firm up after a stretch of weakness. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) rose to a buy zone, hitting a nearly two-year high, as the White House backed away from the tax on imports proposed by House Speaker Paul Ryan as a way to pay for a corporate tax cut.Clearly, markets aren't just reacting to Trump. It's unclear, though, whether the jump in businesses confidence sparked by Trump's promises will be sustained if doubts grow about the White House's ability to deliver.The Trump plan calls for cuts in individual tax rates, with the top rate lowered to 35% from 39.6% and a doubling of the standard deduction to $24,000 for couples, to be offset by getting rid of all deductions except those for mortgage interest and charitable giving. That means no more state and local tax deduction, a big deal for high-tax ""blue"" states such as California and New York.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market has bounced back near all-time highs, but Treasury yields are still range-bound. Investors seem to have forgotten that the Federal Reserve has begun worrying about asset values and planning to scale back its balance sheet.In addition to the 35% personal income tax bracket, there would be 25% and 10% brackets, vs. a seven-bracket system now. The plan also would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.The long-term capital gains tax rate would back to 20%, eliminating the 3.8% ObamaCare/Medicare surcharge.Mnuchin said the plan would adopt a territorial tax system, with companies paying the local tax rate where the profits are earned. The result would be companies repatriating trillions over dollars to boost U.S. economic growth.Prospects for deficit-increasing tax cuts will ultimately depend on the Senate Republicans who will have to decide whether they are willing to throw caution to the wind when it comes to the nation's outlook for large and growing deficits and debt.JPMorgan analysts agree that investors have already reined in their expectations. ""At this point investors would be happy to see the corporate rate brought down to ~27%"" by the first quarter of 2018. ""Expectations for changes to the individual tax code are near zero.""Goldman's Phillips suggests that the corporate tax rate might be cut to 25% from 35%.Mnuchin may be right that faster economic growth can help pay for the tax cuts — but only to a point.Even the conservative Tax Foundation judged that the Trump campaign's plan to cut individual and corporate tax rates would raise deficits by at least $2.6 trillion over a decade. However, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation might provide a somewhat tougher evaluation.The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center says that Trump's plan for a 15% corporate tax rate and a 15% rate on pass-through businesses (such as sole proprietorships and partnerships whose income passes through to the owners) would cut federal revenue by about $3.3 trillion over 10 years. The left-leaning analysts don't think a deficit-funded tax hike will do much of anything to recoup that revenue via faster economic growth.Meanwhile, the CBO already has provided an analysis of what an additional $2 trillion in debt over 10 years would mean for the budget outlook. As it stands, CBO sees publicly held federal debt rising from 77% of GDP to an unprecedented 150% by 2047. Assuming Trump's deficit-increasing fiscal policies stay in place, debt would hit 202% of GDP in 30 years.Here's the harsh conclusion offered last week by Wells Fargo Chief Economist John Silvia and colleagues Michael Brown and Michael Pugliese: ""In our view, the long-run costs of nondeficit neutral tax cuts at the projected levels of federal debt would outweigh the short-run benefits provided by the tax cuts. This is particularly true in the current economic environment, where the economy is close to full employment and near potential GDP growth, which historically has the net effect of increasing inflation pressures more than real GDP growth.""The Wells Fargo economists add: ""Finding a path to deficit neutral cuts would require reforms to entitlement programs, which many policymakers have a desire to avoid.""There's not much question why Trump has chosen this path that avoids such hard choices. After all, House Speaker Paul Ryan's ObamaCare replacement to slash Medicaid and cut the ranks of the insured by 24 million crashed and burned in the House. Ryan's plan for a 20% tax on imports to pay for corporate tax reform appears just as unpopular. Mnuchin said Wednesday that a border adjustment tax would be ""impossible"" to pass.Trump wants a policy that is huge and that has corporate America lined up behind it — rather than taking potshots at it, as Wal-Mart and other opponents of the border tax have been doing.But it remains to be seen whether there's any such thing as an easy-to-sell policy in the current fiscal climate. Sen. John McCain was the lone Republican to vote against President George W. Bush's tax cuts in 2001, but that was at a time the federal government was running a surplus. It would only take two additional GOP senators to block an unfunded Trump tax plan now. How this all plays out is far from the clear.RELATED:Trump Surprises Sink Fed Expectations And Bank StocksForget About 'Spirits,' Trump Is Making Companies Even Less Willing To Invest

211,MCD,"XMcDonald's (MCD) on Tuesday said it would expand its delivery service with UberEats from Florida into a number of U.S. cities this quarter, and the burger giant said its new digitized store setup prompted some restaurants to shift employees toward more ""hospitality""-focused roles to help consumers navigate self-order kiosks and other departures from fast-food traditions.That comment, made during McDonald's conference call, followed first-quarter financials that Wall Street cheered. Earnings per share rose 18% to $1.47, beating analyst estimates for $1.33. Revenue fell 4% to $5.676 billion, above forecasts for $5.53 billion.

Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) rose 1.5% to 58.48, peeking out past a flat base with a 58.08 buy point.Management admitted there was some degree of ""nervousness"" among franchisees to plow money into adopting the new store layout, which the company calls Experience of the Future. Those restaurants will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.But the restaurant and retail sectors are trying to meet more sophisticated consumer tastes and adapt to the mobile devices that have reshaped the way people shop and get around.IBD'S TAKE: Despite McDonald's efforts at reform, many people still believe they're serving straight-up garbage. However, the company has remained in good standing among teenagers, according to a recent Piper Jaffray survey. For more about what companies resonate with teenagers, read this story.CEO Steve Easterbrook said the company had a detailed training plan for the shift to that new format, and said ""I think the excitement exceeds the nervousness by quite some way.""As more people turn to the internet for takeout, McDonald's said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in thousands of restaurants by the end of this year. And by the middle of next year, the company will also serve fresh-beef, cooked-when-ordered Quarter Pounders in most of its restaurants, an attempt to keep up with the growing popularity of fresher ingredients.Along those lines, McDonald's on Tuesday said it would also bring Signature Crafted Sandwiches to U.S. restaurants next week.McDonald's noted that in early trials of fresh Quarter Pounders, drive-thru service slowed slightly. But Easterbrook said the company had found ways around that issue, along with ways to simplify the handling, packaging and storing of the food. He said he anticipates minimal cost increases from the rollout.""We have worked through a lot of the kinks in this,"" Easterbrook said.Management credited the Q1 U.S. sales boost to expanded All-Day Breakfast offerings as well as Big Mac and beverage promotions, and attributed international strength to the start of All-Day Breakfast in Canada.""Our efforts to build a better McDonald's are yielding meaningful results with continued positive momentum and a strong start to 2017 that includes positive comparable sales across all segments, higher global guest counts and enhanced profitability,"" said Easterbrook in a statement earlier.The results arrive as the restaurant industry's sales have suffered from discount battles, harsh or erratic weather, and cheaper groceries, which have given diners more of a reason to eat in.But McDonald's nationwide $1 coffee promotion and new Big Mac sizes — the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. — cushioned results during Q1. And the management during the call said the price gap between food at home and food away from home was narrowing.Year-over-year comparisons for the fast-food giant could also become more favorable in the second half, analysts say, after the breakfast expansion's boost leveled off in late 2016. McDonald's $1 soda promotion and a $2 promotion for some McCafe drinks could also help in the current quarter.""We attribute the top-line success to high-impact, traffic-driving product news (Mac Jr., dollar coffee) and expect MCD to continue focusing on the value guest to recapture lost traffic to ... peers,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.Wendy's (WEN) and Starbucks (SBUX) could be at some risk as McDonald's tries to balance better quality with value.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reports quarterly results after the close Tuesday. Starbucks reports Thursday with its stock in a buy zone.Internationally, McDonald's said that the U.K. ""has not missed a beat since Brexit,"" but said diners in France had become more cautious following a string of terrorist attacks and an election characterized by rising populism on the left and right.The company's decision to sell much of its China and Hong Kong assets could contribute to ""choppiness"" in operating margins over the next few quarters, management said.RELATED:Chipotle Leads 5 Big Earnings Reports Tonight: What To ExpectStarbucks Reports Q2 Earnings Thursday: Watch This Key MetricStarbucks Breaks Out To 1-Year High As 'Unicorn' Tastes Like Victory

212,MCD,"XStrong gains continued in the stock market for a second consecutive day. The Dow Jones industrial average paved the way with a 1.1% gain at lunchtime in New York on Tuesday, driven by a number of bullish earnings releases among its components. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 followed up with milder 0.6% rises as the tech composite claimed the 6000 mark. Among the Dow industrials, heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) surged more than 6.6% out of a flat base after reporting Q1 earnings that handily surpassed the Street's estimates. This morning's gap-up put shares well above the flat base's 99.56 buy point, but shares remain within buy range.Other Dow earnings reporters McDonald's (MCD) and DuPont (DD) provided more fuel to the Dow's fire early Tuesday. Both beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates.

214,MCD,"If any publicly traded restaurant chain other than Shake Shack (SHAK) had seen a key sales metric tumble 8% in a single month, as it did in March, it would likely spark an investor panic.But there's little about Shake Shack that fits into the typical cookie-cutter, fast-casual restaurant chain mold. While Shake Shack's stock has come down from its post-initial public offering moonshot two years ago — as Wall Street debates whether its early formula for success can be repeated again and again — investors seem to be concluding that its outsized per-restaurant profits are too tasty to lose faith.Even after that stumble in same-store sales, which measure year-ago revenue from outlets that have been open at least two years, shares of the New York-based chain that sprang from famed restaurateur Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group are up slightly on the year. They're also near the top of a seven-month consolidation zone.""While we expect the company to produce current- and long-term positive same-store sales, we at the same time expect a certain level of volatility for these results. However, at the end of the day absolute dollar profits are increasing at a double-digit pace,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Regan wrote in a recent note to clients.Although a multitude of factors contributed to its March sales slump, the simplest explanation is that, despite all the hype surrounding its increasingly well-known brand, Shake Shack is still a relatively small corporation. It has only 72 company-owned outlets and less than $300 million in annual revenue.Still, Shake Shack restaurants create so much buzz when they open that sales tend to fall off by roughly 5% in the second year, notes Regan. For that reason, the company only adds restaurants to the comparable same-store base after 24 months, while many others add to their base after 16 to 18 months.Shake Shack reported 32 outlets for the first quarter of 2015, and so it has more than doubled its store count in the last two years. It's one reason the same-store-sales metric so beloved by Wall Street can obscure the important drivers that set Shake Shack apart, particularly at this stage of its growth.Analysts and management think investors should focus on a number of other metrics. For one, the average check of about $16 at Shake Shack is about 50% larger than it is with other chains, according to Regan. Meanwhile, the company's restaurant unit growth rate is about triple that of its peer group.""Shake Shack's new units are profitable within a quarter of opening, in contrast to most growth peers,"" wrote Wedbush analysts Nick Setyan and Colin Radke in a May 18 report.""This is a company with 72 company-owned restaurants, and we've barely scratched the surface on the 450 that's highly achievable for us,"" Shake Shack Chief Executive Randy Garutti said on a May 7 earnings call, according to transcripts.""So that is our focus,"" Garutti said. ""When you look at what — let's just take this quarter. We added $24 million to sales vs. last year (up 42%). Yes, that was offset by a negative comp.""Shake Shack sprung from a single hot-dog cart and later a kiosk-style restaurant that opened at Manhattan's Madison Square Park in 2004. In addition to its 72 company-operated restaurants, there are another 58 franchises, mostly in international locations, that are operated by partners. These partners pay license fees to Shake Shack that generated $2.6 million in revenue in the first quarter, up 28.9% from a year ago.In the first quarter, Shake Shack opened seven company-operated restaurants and seven international licensed Shacks, including two in London and five in the Middle East. For the year, management said it expects to open 23 or 24 company-operated units, up from 22 or 23. They're expected to have average sales volumes of $3.3 million, up from prior guidance of $3.2 million.Wedbush turned bullish on Shake Shack last month, upgrading the stock to outperform from neutral on May 18, while hiking its price target to 43 from 33. Setyan told Investor's Business Daily that expectations and valuation ""have come down to earth.""IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's has outperformed every other Dow Jones industrial average stock this year except Apple. But it's nowhere near the top performer in the IBD Retail-Restaurants industry group. Check out the leaders based on stock price, earnings, sales and margins at IBD Stock Checkup""This is not a comp (comparable-store sales) story. It's a unit growth story,"" Setyan said. Even as same-store-sales growth took a hit, the company has been exceeding expectations for sales volumes at new stores, and that bodes well for Shake Shack being able to meet, if not exceed, its long-term expansion goals. Investors also have, by now, ""fully digested"" the reality that labor costs will be a headwind for margins as states raise their minimum wage as high as $15 an hour.Regan explains that the economics of Shake Shack restaurants ""remain best-in-class."" Only McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle (CMG) are even close to the same ballpark of the $3.3 million average revenue per new restaurant expected by Shake Shack, she notes. Shake Shack, she says, has a stellar return on an investment of 30%-plus, meaning it takes just three years to offset the average $2 million development cost.""Unit-level economics are so strong,"" Regan told IBD, that she expects the number of Shake Shack restaurants will double over the coming five years. Piper Jaffray initiated coverage on Shake Shack with an overweight rating and 44 target on May 24.Shake Shack doesn't just want its restaurants to stand apart from the competition, it wants pretty much each Shack to have its own identity, so that there's a sense of community ownership. Much of that is done through its design efforts.""There is nobody in our space who is willing or able to design restaurants that look like that and charge $5 for a burger,"" Garutti said at a June 15 William Blair growth stock conference, while walking investors through about 20 slides showing newer, distinctive looking Shake Shacks. ""We have a design aesthetic, a goal to get better and do cooler, more experiential retail than we've ever done.""Among the 2017 crop of restaurants is one in Lexington, Ky., which features a salted caramel shake with Maker's Mark bourbon, which is distilled in the state. That exemplifies the company's effort to collaborate with artisanal producers or famous local chefs and cultivate what Garutti refers to as Shake Shack's ""halo effect"" that comes from its fine-dining lineage.Setyan credits Shake Shack management for the ""marketing genius of turning this into a lifestyle brand.""""They've done a very good job of positioning the brand as a destination"" for a younger, higher-income demographic, he said. Customers can easily justify spending $15 per check because they're comparing Shake Shack to an upscale burger dining experience that costs $20-$35, rather than to cheaper quick-service competitors such as McDonald's.While unit growth may be the biggest driver of profits going forward, Shake Shack also is taking steps to keep same-unit sales moving in the right direction. Digital ordering accounted for 3% of sales last quarter as the company launched an app for the Apple iPhone, but it's still working on its Android version.RELATED:Want Fries With That Breakout?

215,MCD,"Who doesn't appreciate a company that not only pays a dividend but has a history of consistently raising the payout each year?Those are the types of stocks in which Tuesday's ETF picks aim to invest.XVanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), which tracks the Nasdaq Dividend Achievers Select Index, counts among its holdings highly profitable companies that have increased their dividend for at least 10 years in a row.Top holdings as of May 31 included Microsoft (MSFT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and 3M (MMM), according to Morningstar Inc. Microsoft didn't start paying dividends until 2010, but has boosted its payout each year since. The other three companies are all members of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 straight years.While dividend stocks are often thought of as slow gainers, these four have all outpaced the S&P 500's 8% year-to-date return. Microsoft is up 13% through July 10, PepsiCo 9% and J&J 14%. 3M has rallied 18%.VIG is testing its 50-day moving average line and could set up a buy opportunity on a solid rebound. It offers an annualized yield of nearly 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout. The $24.5 billion fund has a 10-year average annual return of 7.3%, in line with the S&P 500's 7%. Its expense ratio is 0.08%.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) is showing similar action to VIG as it, too, seeks support at its 50-day line. As the name implies, the fund tracks the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.Johnson & Johnson and 3M are among its top 10 names. Other big YTD winners in the top 10 include McDonald's (MCD), up 28%, and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), up 26%. NOBL carries a 0.35% expense ratio and pays a 1.9% yield.The $3 billion fund, launched in October 2013, has returned nearly 8% for the year through July 7, according to Morningstar. That lags the S&P 500's 9.5% gain. NOBL has a three-year average annual return of 9.75% vs. the S&P 500's 7.3%.Going back to the June 30 picks, both SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) and iShares Russell 1000 (IWF) are still trading near their respective 50-day lines.

218,MCD,"X Amazon.com's (AMZN) planned $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market (WFM) would put the resources of a $470 billion company with a massive delivery infrastructure behind the growing demand for better, fresher ingredients and seems likely to upend the way Wall Street thinks about companies that have anything to do with food.The planned merger marks a ""seminal moment in the world of eating,"" RBC analyst David Palmer said in a research note, calling the combined company a potential ""category killer"" in home meals.""Virtually all of the companies in coverage — both in the food and the restaurant space — should be huddling up about the long-term implications,"" he wrote.Prior to the deal, some eateries were making moves in e-commerce. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have already worked digital ordering into deliveries, while fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) have also made a push into delivery and mobile ordering.The merger seems almost certain to deepen the bruising price war between chains like Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT) as an oversupply steers supermarkets toward discounts.Weaker demand in Asia and Europe has in recent years contributed to an oversupply of dairy, while cyclicality has pushed beef prices lower, spurring price cuts to move items off shelves more quickly.Meanwhile, discount European grocers like Aldi and Lidl plan to expand in the U.S., which could bring lower prices for shoppers but also lower profits for the industry.But in Amazon, the industry now faces a retailer that can ""price aggressively, and the smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain,"" Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a statement.Amazon's move also seems likely to hasten consolidation in the industry, Chadha added. Rumors have persisted through the year that Whole Foods or Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) were possible takeover targets by Albertsons.For now, news of Amazon's plans to barrel into the grocery business proved merciless to shares of many of its rivals-to-be.Shares of Kroger tumbled 9.2% to finish at 22.29 on the stock market today, but closed well off intraday lows. On Thursday, the stock sank nearly 19% after Kroger slashed earnings guidance but vowed not to ""lose on price."" Target fell 5%, and Wal-Mart, whose own discounts have escalated the price war in supermarket aisles, dropped 4.7%. Sprouts sank 6.3%. Grocery store operator and distributor SuperValu (SVU) crashed 14%, and distributor United Natural Foods (UNFI) lost 11%.The Amazon-Whole Foods deal would create a top-five grocer in the U.S., but it wouldn't be without challenges. Fresh groceries are lower-margin and require more work to handle.UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research note that wholesaler Costco (COST) could be protected from Amazon's move. He added that dollar stores Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) serve rural areas, where consumers have limited resources or are just looking for quick, fill-in trips.""Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared,"" he said. ""We would use this as a chance to parse through the noise.""Cowen analysts in March said the intersection of food sales and digital technology could drive U.S. e-commerce growth over the next five years. Their survey data said that younger consumers, who do more through their smartphones, were ""leading the U.S. shift"" and that U.K. survey data suggested ""3x more online grocery purchasers than the U.S., a positive indicator for U.S. adoption.""As more analysts speculate about retail's connected future — with the store perhaps not vanishing completely but sharing more space with online and mobile shopping — an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could help normalize a kind of shopping that bounces data from the price-tags in the store to the device in your pocket.""Amazon now has a high-end retail space where they can truly experiment with IoT, retail analytics, behavioral management, and consumer tracking techniques,"" Stephen DiFranco, an investment advisor to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, said in an emailed statement.As also stated in that email: ""You will never be alone in aisle 6 again.""RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Wal-Mart Beefs Up Online Ops With $310 Million Bonobos Deal

If the commission's suspicions are confirmed, the companies' actions could violate EU rules that bar anticompetitive agreements between businesses, the statement said.""We are going to examine whether the licensing and distribution practices of these three companies may be denying consumers access to wider choice and better deals in the Single Market,"" Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, said in the statement.The investigations into those three companies come as the EU looks into what it suspects might be e-commerce practices elsewhere that could harm competition.European regulators have been suspicious that, along with regulatory hurdles, some businesses have been erecting higher barriers to trade — often along national boundaries — in an attempt to stifle competition. The commission has also said in the past that cross-border online sales growth in the bloc has been lukewarm even as global trade expands online.Nike, a Dow industrials component, rose 0.6% to 54.66 in the stock market today, holding above its 50-day moving average after retaking that level on Tuesday. Comcast dipped 0.3%, slightly extended from a buy point initially cleared in late April.Nike is the licensor of rights for Futbol Club Barcelona's merchandise, while Universal Studios licenses rights for products related to movies such as ""Minions"" and ""Despicable Me,"" the statement noted.The commission this month opened a similar investigation into the clothing company Guess (GSE).And in February, the commission opened investigations into the online sales practices of companies that sell consumer electronics, video games and hotel accommodations to see whether they were excluding customers based on location or nationality.Vestager said last month that a broad inquiry had found that some companies' e-commerce operations ""may restrict competition by unduly limiting how products are distributed throughout the EU."" The commission ""gathered evidence"" from nearly 1,900 companies as part of that inquiry.Last month, Facebook was hit with a $122 million fine from the EU, with antitrust regulators alleging that the social media giant misled them over data-sharing issues related to its acquisition of WhatsApp.Apple was fined by the EU following allegations of striking illegal tax deals, while Amazon and McDonald's (MCD) have also been targeted over their tax arrangements.

Outside of the house, coffee and tea consumption are now about equal, wrote analysts, citing Euromonitor and MSUSA estimates.Shares of Starbucks dipped 0.1% to 62.19 on the stock market today, their fifth straight decline. Starbucks is near the top end of buy territory after overextending for a few weeks. The stock broke out of a flat base with 59.64 entry point in late April.Calling Starbucks the ""most promising growth model in the industry,"" Mizuho's Scott initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and 75 price target. He also highlighted the promise of mobile-order-and-pay once the company overcomes its workflow issues (read: recent issues of in-store congestion from the popularity of the order-ahead feature).If all goes according to plan, maybe someday China's coffee drinkers will be just like Americans: hogging the good tables for hours as they work on their screenplays at Starbucks.Meanwhile, Scott — who initiated coverage on a number of restaurant names including McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Yum Brands (YUM) — looked less favorably upon Starbucks' main U.S. competitor, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), starting it off with a neutral rating and 56 price target.""As the take-away coffee market grows increasingly divided between value and premium, Dunkin's positioning becomes increasingly challenged as it straddles value-orientation and upmarket beverages,"" he wrote, adding that increasing competition in the form of promotional activity from McDonald's and others ""should continue to drive menu deflation in our view.""Shares of Dunkin' Brands, which owns Baskin Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, sank 2.7% to 56.93, falling out of buy range after clearing a 57.90 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in late May.Yum Brands, which spun off Yum China (YUMC) last year, fell 1.2%.

226,MCD,"XIt was another good day for the bulls in the stock market today as more bullish breakouts emerged.The Dow Jones industrial average was in the driver's seat, up 1.2%, helped by strong earnings reports from McDonald's (MCD), DuPont (DD) and Caterpillar (CAT). All three firms topped earnings and sales expectations, and Caterpillar broke out bullishly over a 99.56 flat-base entry.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 showed gains of around 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 small-cap index gained 1%.

All are in buy range as of Monday's close except for Caterpillar, which took a big step Monday toward its own entry point.Meanwhile, look for Express Scripts (ESRX) to sell off at Tuesday's open on bad news. Express Scripts announced that it was likely to lose its top customer, Anthem (ANTM), sending shares of the pharmacy benefit manager down 15% late Monday. (CVS Health (CVS), which is a major PBM in addition to its drugstore operations, was up 3% late, perhaps on hopes that it will win the Anthem business.)On Monday, the Nasdaq composite soared 1.2%, hitting an all-time high.

Analysts expect a 6% sales decline, to $5.53 billion, with earnings per share up 8%, to $1.33. U.S. same-store sales will be watched closely.Beyond Q1 results and guidance, analysts will look for McDonald's clues about when it will roll out its mobile order-and-pay system, as well as any further talk of deliveries. Investors also will want to know how McDonald's big McCafe promotions are working, which could impact Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks has broken out of its own consolidation ahead of earnings on Thursday.Analysts expect the maker of heavy construction and mining equipment to report a 7.5% EPS decline, to 62 cents, with sales off 2%, to $9.27 billion.

229,MCD,"XStarbucks' (SBUX) new Unicorn Frappuccino may be a ""candy-colored nightmare"" (Yahoo Finance) that ""tastes like sour birthday cake and shame"" (Washington Post), but it's new drinks like that that are — partly — expected to help the coffee-store chain ramp-up its same-store sales growth over the next year.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan expects the java giant's U.S. same-store sales growth to ""accelerate to at least 5%-6% for the next four quarters"" starting in June, with global same-store sales growth also in the mid-single digits but ""modestly below"" U.S. levels. He upgraded Starbucks to buy from hold with a 67 price target.That comp growth is primarily expected to be driven by ""increasingly favorable comparisons,"" but also, to a smaller degree, ""beverage innovations,"" more food choices and technology such as Starbucks' mobile app and its personalized offers. (The Unicorn Frappuccino is presumably one such beverage innovation.)The My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program and the app's mobile order-and-pay function are also seen contributing to ongoing same-store sales growth, said Astrachan.Starbucks shares rose 1.8% to 60.08 in above-average volume on the stock market today, clearing a 59.64 buy point and hitting a one-year high.The company reports second-quarter results in one week on April 27.In recent coffee news, JAB — the parent of Peet's Coffee, Caribou Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain — announced two weeks ago the acquisition of cafe chain Panera Bread (PNRA) in a deal worth $7.5 billion.

Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) starts the week under heavy pressure even as Facebook, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) find key support.

Facebook dropped below the 50-day several times over the prior six sessions, but always closed higher. Alphabet tested but never dropped below that key support line.The rebounds, which generally came on higher volume, offer a chance for follow-on buys or an initial positive. Keep in mind that the uptrend is under pressure, so investors should be cautious about many any purchase.As for Netflix (NFLX), the fourth member of the ""FANG"" internet group, that stock is hovering below its 50-day line, though it's showing a little better action than Apple.Whole Foods shot up 29% to 42.68 on Friday, above Amazon's 42-a-share offer. Some investors and analysts see a higher bid as possible, with pure-play grocers Kroger (KR) and private-equity backed Albertsons cited as possible suitors. But Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) also suggested. Wal-Mart is the No. 1 grocer seller in the U.S., with Target also a big player.No doubt many grocery sellers' top executives and boards were mulling their next moves over the weekend.Shares of Kroger and other grocery sellers were big losers last week, amid concerns about the impact of an Amazon-Whole Foods deal and Kroger's big profit warning.RELATED:Why Lockheed's F-35 Could Stun Crowds At The Paris Air ShowParis Air Show Preview: This Will Be 'The Big Thing'Paris Air Show 2017: Latest Defense And Aerospace News And DealsThat's No Moon: Boeing, Apple Could Build This Disrupter In Space

NYSE volume was tracking close to Tuesday.Goldman Sachs (GS) and McDonald's (MCD) outperformed in the Dow with gains of more than 1%.Western Digital (WDC) was a solid gainer in the Nasdaq 100, up nearly 3%, after published reports said the company offered to buy Toshiba's chip unit for $17.8 billion. Western Digital is testing support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a base breakout in late March.Oil eased 0.5% to $51.21 a barrel Wednesday despite data from the Energy Information Administration showing the seventh straight weekly drop in U.S. crude supplies. That news was offset by a recommendation by a joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee on Wednesday to extend output cuts agreed upon in December for nine months.Inside the IBD 50, Stamps.com (STMP) continued work on the right side of a cup-shaped base as shares jumped 5%. It reset its base count last year when shares hit a low of 68.82 in July. That means its current base is first stage.Also in the IBD 50, China-based YY (YY) also outperformed, rising 3%. It's still in buy range from a 56.31 cup-with-handle buy point, although a lagging relative strength line raises some concern about the viability of the breakout.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gave up its 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Shares slumped nearly 4% after Edward Jones downgraded the beauty retailer to hold from buy.Chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) also reports Thursday after the close. Despite several quarters in a row of declining sales, it's a reasonable candidate for a call-option trade ahead of earnings as it works on a base with a 16.82 buy point.When shares were trading around 16.25, a weekly call option with a 16.50 strike price (May 26 expiration) came with a premium of 50 cents, offering a trade with downside risk of just 3%. The right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Marvell at 16.50 came at a cost of just $50.

238,MCD,"Shares of Grubhub (GRUB) slid on Friday, apparently after a TechCrunch report detailed how Facebook (FB) was stepping up the competition in food delivery.The report said Facebook has made an ""Order Food"" option available to some of its users. That option lets users order and pay for food, for pickup or delivery, entirely on Facebook, and works with restaurants that use the ordering services Delivery.com or Slice, the report said.Grubhub fell 1.6% to close at 43.37 on the stock market today. Facebook ticked up 0.3% to 148.06. Facebook first made food ordering available in October.Those plans come as Facebook aims for deeper community involvement and as more fast-food restaurants start to experiment with delivery, roll out mobile order and pay options, and try to figure out how best to approach the rise of companies like Grubhub.McDonald's (MCD) this week said it would expand its delivery service through its partnership with UberEats. Jack in the Box (JACK) also hopes its own delivery service, through Doordash, can give it an edge in late-night dining. Panera Bread (PNRA) also delivers.IBD'S TAKE: Even Domino's Pizza — a veteran at delivery whose own mobile order and pay platform has been successful — has tried to figure out how best to engage companies like Grubhub. Read IBD's interview with CEO Patrick Doyle here. Restaurants are hoping that delivery and mobile order and pay will eventually become the norm for the industry, whose last major technological disruption came from the drive-thru decades ago.But in the short term, investments in technology could weigh on margins and prompt other adjustments in things like packaging. Pizza, for instance, holds up well inside a cardboard box. French fries, meanwhile, are often the first casualty once they go into a takeout bag.McDonald's, Jack in the Box and Panera Bread were all up marginally at the close.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdoba

239,MCD,"X Jack in the Box (JACK) topped fiscal second-quarter forecasts after the close Tuesday, and said it is looking at options for its Qdoba Mexican chain.""At our investor meeting last May, we said one of the factors that would cause us to reconsider our strategy with respect to Qdoba was valuation,"" said Chairman and CEO Lenny Comma in a statement. ""It has become more apparent since then that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models. As a result, we've retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to assist the Board in its evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to Qdoba, as well as other ways to enhance shareholder value.Estimates: Earnings per share of 91 cents, up 7%, on revenue up 2% to $369.2 million. As of Friday, system same-store sales were expected to fall 0.8%.Results: EPS of 98 cents on revenue of $369.39 million. System-wide same-store sales at Jack in the Box fell 0.8%, and system-wide comp sales at Qdoba fell 3.2%.Outlook: Q3 same-store sales down 1% to up 1% at Jack in the Box and Qdoba system wide. Full-year comps sales are now seen up 1% at Jack in the Box vs. prior views for a 2% gain. Management narrowed its Qdoba comps view to a 1%-2% decline vs. a 1%-3% drop.""After a sluggish start to the quarter, which we believe was attributable to delayed tax refunds and record rainfall in California, Jack in the Box system same-store sales improved to positive territory as these transitory issues passed and we pivoted our advertising towards value messages,"" Comma said. ""However, same-store sales at Qdoba company restaurants worsened in the latter two months of the quarter, as we lapped more aggressive discounting in last year's second quarter.""But he added that Qdoba's margins improved in the final month of fiscal Q2 as it managed labor and food costs better, and Qdoba's comps have improved so far in Q3.Stock: Jack in the Box jumped 10% late, indicating an open Wednesday near a 113.40 buy point. Shares closed up 2.3% at 101.89 on the stock market today. McDonald's (MCD) rose 0.7% at 147.29 to a fresh record high, as did Wendy's (WEN) with a 1.8% gain to 16.41. Both stocks are above buying territory. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR) ticked 0.1% to 59.65, still in buy zone.Jack in the Box has said its sales growth comes from limited-time offerings, breakfast and late night more than the value deals being pushed by rivals.But McDonald's all-day breakfast service has at times hurt Jack in the Box's sales, and McDonald's drink promos and higher-end offerings represent a threat as well. McDonald's has also outperformed the quick-service sandwich category for calendar Q1, Cowen said in a research note on Friday.Jack in the Box's results come after California — where many of its restaurants are located — raised its minimum wage in January. The drought-ridden state also suffered an unusual amount of rain, potentially keeping more customers indoors.Last week, Wendy's topped Q1 estimates, helped by advertising around fresher ingredients and its 4 for $4 value meal.Last month, Restaurant Brands also beat views, but same-store sales declined at both its Burger King and Tim Hortons chains.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresRestaurant Brands Swallows The Competition To Find Growth

248,MCD,"X McDonald's (MCD) on Wednesday said it will widen its new delivery service to restaurants in Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio — the latest industrywide effort to tap a growing population that does business via their smartphones.Customers can order food on a mobile app or through UberEats, which McDonald's has partnered with for deliveries. The expansion now means that delivery is offered at some 1,000 U.S. McDonald's restaurants, including 300 in LA.""We are bringing a new level of convenience to more of our customers as we continue to transform the McDonald's experience,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement.McDonald's, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, last month said it would expand deliveries from its trial run in Florida, which began this year, to other cities in the U.S. during this quarter. Jack in the Box (JACK) has also expanded delivery to Los Angeles and Phoenix via its delivery partner DoorDash.McDonald's has also said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. and other areas by the end of the year. The burger chain is also rolling out its new restaurant format, called ""Experience of the Future,"" which will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.Wendy's (WEN), which also has self-order kiosks at some restaurants, is also rolling out a mobile order and pay system. Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King wants to expand a mobile platform of its own.The digital expansion has the potential to make ordering food easier than ever, and analysts have said smartphone ordering marks the biggest change to the way people buy fast food since the drive-thru.But the technology raises questions about how restaurants will manage margins as they spend on technology and how they handle traffic-flow through their restaurants.IBD'S TAKE: Even as restaurants race to expand delivery, Restaurant Brands International has been growing by acquisitions.Starbucks (SBUX), which has its own mobile order and pay platform, had reported some knots in in-store customer traffic after launching the system.McDonald's, which is already testing fresh, cooked-to-order hamburger patties at some restaurants, reported minor slowdowns at the drive-thru that were later corrected.McDonald's edged down 0.6% to 146.41 in the stock market today after hitting a record high Tuesday.Wendy's fell 3.4% after setting a fresh decade high on Tuesday. Restaurant Brands retreated 1.1% from an all-time best. Starbucks dipped 0.4% to 59.73, holding just above a 59.64 buy point. Jack in the Box, which late Tuesday topped earnings views and said it would explore ""alternatives"" for its Qdoba Mexican Eats chain, rose 5.6%.The industry's delivery expansion also raises questions about competition for driver's. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), whose mobile-ordering technology has fit in well with its decades-old delivery service, is currently testing GPS technology. CEO Patrick Doyle, during the Domino's earnings call last month, also said his company was a better place for drivers to work."" ... for those drivers who are listening to this call,"" he said, ""my pitch is you're going to be more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else, and that is ultimately what keeps drivers happy is that they're busy.""RELATED:Jack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdoba

249,MCD,"Being in the American restaurant business is tough, as cheaper groceries, heightened competition and never-ending searches for growth abound.Growth by novelty is one way to prosper. Take two recent limited-offer efforts from a couple of industry giants: Starbucks' (SBUX) recent unleashing of the rainbow-colored Unicorn Frappuccino and Yum Brands' (YUM) debut of the Taco Bell Naked Chicken Chalupa — featuring a shell made out of fried chicken.""(In a) saturated market, you've got to make your brand stand out,"" Morningstar's restaurant analyst, R.J. Hottovy, told Investor's Business Daily. ""You maybe have to push the envelope a little bit more in terms of menu innovation, and get people talking about your brand. I think that that's what you're seeing more and more of.""Another way to grow is to simply swallow another company whole, as in the case of Restaurant Brands International (QSR).The parent of Burger King and Canada's Tim Hortons outlets, Restaurant Brands is growing by acquisition, recently closing the buyout of Popeye's Chicken and adding the fried-chicken chain to its portfolio of burgers, coffee and doughnuts. The decision was broadly well-received.""I think it gives (Restaurant Brands) an interesting growth vehicle down the road,"" said Hottovy, adding that demand for fried chicken could be particularly appealing to the company's franchising partners abroad.Following a quarter of weaker-than-expected same-store sales growth in North America, Restaurant Brands' management sounded bullish on expanding Popeye's abroad.""One of the reasons we get really excited is the ability to accelerate the pace of growth, both in the U.S. and Canada, and all around the world,"" said Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz about the deal, on the April 26 call to discuss first-quarter earnings.For the quarter, profit of 36 cents a share marked 20% year-over-year growth and topped consensus by 2 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $1 billion, exceeding estimates for $990.3 million. But weak year-ago sales comparisons, including a 2.2% decline at Burger King's U.S. restaurants and a 0.2% dip at Tim Hortons' Canadian locations, marred the consensus beat.A certain Big Mac maker might have been to blame for the same-store-sales slips. In a world filled with artisanal burgers and trendy Shake Shack (SHAK)-type eateries, McDonald's (MCD) ubiquity still provides enormous power.""The comps were a little bit softer than what people were expecting, and I think probably you can trace a good portion of that back to McDonald's success,"" said Hottovy. ""A comp point for McDonald's has a much more disproportionate impact on the rest of the industry, just given its size and scale.""But it's worth keeping in mind that for Restaurant Brands, same-store sales growth isn't necessarily the most significant metric.""In a virtually 100% highly franchised business model like (Restaurant Brands), unit openings drive more operating leverage than comps,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles noted the day after earnings were released. He has a market-perform rating on the restaurateur with a 54 price target. And Piper Jaffray's Nicole Miller Regan reiterated her overweight rating and 66 price target.""Continued execution against the company's strategic blueprint as well as cash flows being returned to shareholders at an increasing rate (i.e., recently raised dividend now yielding 1.3%) remains the key catalyst,"" she wrote in late April.To be a fast-food giant in 2017 almost seems quaint, given the trends toward customized meals, natural and organic fare, and millennial-friendly experiences. But Burger King, the Pepsi to McDonald's Coca-Cola, remains engaged in a heated rivalry with the Golden Arches as both attempt to align their technology with modern customers.Burger King is reportedly debuting mobile payments soon. That feature is currently in test mode in the Miami area, according to Bloomberg, citing Burger King head Jose Cil on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant Brands tried to break out of a two-month-long flat base on April 25, immediately retreated the next day and then mounted another breakout on May 5 and hasn't looked back since. Shares continue to reach new highs. The company is currently ranked fourth in IBD's Retail-Restaurants Group, behind Dave & Buster's (PLAY).There's no national release date yet, but no doubt the Whopper maker is eyeing McDonald's plans to debut a mobile-order-and-pay platform in 20,000 locations by the end of 2017. Both lag behind Starbucks' robust mobile-order-and-pay system, an app feature that has become so popular, so quickly, that it actually wound up creating congestion in many locations a couple of quarters ago.Hottovy considers all three big foodie names winners, despite the macro pressures.""Some of the efforts McDonald's has done has put them in the winners' camp, and I think that's had a halo effect over probably Restaurant Brands as well as Dunkin' (DNKN) at this point,"" said Hottovy, adding that Starbucks would still be considered a winner despite not being at the top of its game.Both the BK parent and McDonald's have performed well in recent months. After struggling to break out of a flat base with 58.08 entry point, Restaurant Brands shares rose decisively into buy range on May 5. Its Relative Strength rating, which pits its performance against the S&P 500, is a solid 87.McDonald's recent ascent has been even sharper, gapping up 5.6% on its April 25 earnings report.As far as growth is concerned, McDonald's might have to contend with an ever-larger rival. After all, Restaurant Brands was born of a 2014 merger between 3G Capital-backed Burger King and Tim Hortons.The company will ""probably continue to look for more acquisitions in the future,"" said Hottovy.  ""Tough to say exactly where, but I think it gives them nice new growth and cost-cutting opportunities at the same time.""And Restaurant Brands is not totally immune to the charms of novelty items.

250,MCD,"Shares of Wendy's (WEN) jumped on Wednesday to their best level in nearly 10 years after the burger chain's first-quarter earnings came in above analyst estimates, likely helped by advertising around fresher ingredients and its 4 for $4 value meal.Wendy's North America same-store sales rose 1.6% — the 17th straight time the company has turned out an increase for the key industry metric — topping consensus expectations for 1.1% growth.Earnings per share fell 18% to 9 cents, but that was a penny above what Wall Street had forecast. Revenue fell 24.6% to $285.8 million, beating estimates for $282.56 million.Wendy's attributed the steep sales decline to 301 fewer company-operated restaurants.Shares jumped 5.1% to 15.87 in the stock market today, hitting its best level since late 2007. The stock is now extended from a 14.57 buy point.Rival McDonald's (MCD) climbed 0.1% to 144.52, near all-time highs. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) rose 1.2% to 59.92, holding above a 58.08 buy point.""We would note that these (Wendy's) results likely came on the continued success of its value news (rotation within the 4 for $4) and increased brand marketing around fresh beef, which we believe has helped to drive awareness/re-trial of core items,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.Wendy's also signaled that food costs could rise more than it had expected this year, potentially helping to discourage the discount wars that have attracted customers looking for cheap fast food but wilted industry sales.The company hiked its commodity inflation forecast to 1.5% to 2% from an earlier outlook of flat, ""which reaffirms our view of an inflationary (second half of 2017),"" RBC analyst David Palmer said in a research note.The decline in grocery prices has been steeper than that at restaurants, however, making eating in a more attractive option and compounding restaurants' sales difficulties.However, in a research note last month, SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said the pricing gap between restaurants and grocery stores narrowed ""meaningfully"" in March. Earlier this year, he said poultry and hamburger prices could rise this year, which would also help narrow that gap, and that restaurant sales could pick back up again starting in Q2 as the industry enters more forgiving comparisons.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresCheesecake Factory Misses, Habit Profit Tops After Yum, Papa John's Beat

273,MCD,"XAnalysts were upbeat on Snap (SNAP), Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (SBUX) and Micron (MU) Monday, while signaling more caution on Chipotle (CMG).Multiple analysts initiated coverage on Snap with buy ratings after the Snapchat parent got a slew of bearish ratings in the weeks immediately following its IPO.Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald gave Snap a buy rating and price target of 30, saying Snap ""looks well positioned for growth as advertisers clamor to serve ads to its large audience of deeply-engaged users, many of whom are in the attractive millennial demographic and are located in high-value ad markets.""

JPMorgan added Apple to its ""Focus List"" and raised its price target to 165 from 142, saying there is high pent-up replacement demand at the same time Apple is gearing up to launch its new iPhone.But shares edged up 0.2% to finish at 140.88.Special Report: IBD Best Mutual Fund AwardsCoverage was initiated on Starbucks with an outperform rating and a price target of 66 at Telsey Advisory Group, which cited the coffee giant's growth plans.China is the next big frontier for Starbucks as it plans to rapidly expand its store count there.

Revenue soared 58%. But the industry took particular heart in Micron's Q3 outlook, which placed the midpoint of earnings guidance 61% above consensus views. Micron shares ended the week up 11% and at a new high, extended from a February rebound from 10-week support.Under Armour popped 4% following an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Jefferies. The stock suffered a 63% sell-off over the past 11 months, but the Jefferies note diagnosed the correction as having formed a bottom and, given market circumstances, ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now.""

Shares are taking out new highs and are well-extended above a three-weeks-tight buy point of 83.97.BioTelemetry (BEAT) also gained 2%, narrowing its loss for the week to less than 3%.

277,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) plans to offer $2 McCafe drinks and $1 sodas in April, as well as a mobile ordering platform later this year, could come at an opportune time for the burger chain and Dow Jones industrial average component, as Starbucks (SBUX) may be showing signs of losing ground to rivals.Starbucks' U.S. share of foot traffic last month slipped to 11%, from 12% in January, according to restaurant-related data analyzed by marketing firm xAd.In an email, xAd said it was unclear why the slip in foot-traffic share occurred, but said that it may have been due to ""inclement weather or the overall issues with online ordering,"" among other potential factors. The trends were first reported by Bloomberg.The coffee chain has tried to find ways to unknot the longer lines and congestion that it says have resulted from its own mobile order-and-pay program, raising the possibility of logistical challenges to other restaurants that adopt a mobile platform.The McCafe and soda promotion could help McDonald's compete not just with Starbucks but with convenience stores, which account for more than half of restaurant-industry coffee service, according to an RBC Capital Markets research note last month, citing data from the NPD Group.""In our previous notes, we highlighted beverage value as one of the three reasons that we believe McDonald's US same store sales trends can accelerate as the company competes against the expansion of convenience store foodservice and fast casual,"" analyst David Palmer wrote.At a presentation last week, McDonald's said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. by the end of the year. McDonald's also sees a massive opportunity in delivery, and is exploring its prospects with companies like UberEats and GrubHub (GRUB).Shares of McDonald's rose 5 cents to 128.14 in the stock market today. The stock has recently formed a handle in a cup base, with a buy point of 130.10.Starbucks fell 1% to 55.19, its sixth straight decline. Starbucks undercut its 200-day moving average on Wednesday. Its relative strength line is the weakest in nearly two years, showing how Starbucks has lagged the S&P 500 index.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) fell 0.8% to 53.61, drifting further away from a 56.23 entry. GrubHub rose 0.6% to 33.57 after falling intraday to its lowest level since late July. Panera Bread (PNRA) rose 0.9% to 235.86, but closed below a 236.35 buy point from a four-weeks-tight pattern after rising intraday to an all-time high.IBD'S TAKE: Domino's Pizza's online ordering platforms have worked so well for the company, and while burgers and fries don't travel as well as pizza does, Jack in the Box customers that get delivery don't seem to be too bothered. The tougher competition comes as discounting efforts appear likely to shift toward drinks. While value deals remained abundant last year amid a slump in food costs, some analysts expect those prices to rebound this year. Restaurants have also struggled with cheaper groceries at grocery stores, which have encouraged people to eat in.But it's still too early to tell if Starbucks is seeing just a blip or something more persistent. From Q3 to Q4, xAd said foot traffic at Starbucks rose 1.3%.Since then, other factors may have contributed to last month's weakness.Starbucks' plan to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years — announced Jan. 29 after President Trump's attempts to temporarily bar the entry of refugees into the U.S. — appears to have also briefly annoyed some customers.Credit Suisse said in a note Wednesday that ""net sentiment"" data from NetBase showed the coffee chain's hiring decision ""could have upset some customers, perhaps negatively impacting sales trends."" While sentiment remained lethargic for 10 days from late January to early February, it has rebounded but ""seen significant volatility in recent weeks.""RELATED:McDonald's Stock Tests Key Support Levels Amid Turnaround DoubtsWhy It May Be Time To Sell Apple, Tesla; Starbucks Nears Buy PointToo Much Of A Good Thing?

278,MCD,"Sometimes a small prod is all it takes to make a hot investment idea go cold in no time — as small as a quarter-point bump in a benchmark rate in the case of low volatility and dividend stock ETFs.As the era of zero ends and interest rates rise, investors in exchange traded funds have turned away from certain high dividend and low volatility strategies this year. Instead, they favored more cyclical exposures that benefit from a tick up in rates — banks and transporters, for example.""Yet, thanks to product innovation, there are now strong smart-beta strategies that combine defensive and cyclical components,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA, wrote in a March note. Smart beta ETFs seek to achieve better returns or lower risk vs. cap-weighted counterparts.As examples of ""next-generation products"" for a rising rate environment, Rosenbluth offered these two names:As relatively new products without a three-year history, both ETFs should be traded with care. However, Rosenbluth considers them worthy choices for large-cap stock exposure in light of the March rate hike and the Fed's signals of more gradual rate hikes this year.XRLV is the younger sibling of PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), an ETF that aims to give investors a smoother ride in the stock market. SPLV invests in the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and surged in popularity during 2016's choppy markets. So did iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV).But this year through March 21, SPLV and USMV saw net outflow of $1.238 billion combined, according to FactSet data — a big chunk of their total assets, which now stand at roughly $19 billion.Hefty stakes in defensive, high-yielding sectors could be hurting them.Those equity sectors, such as consumer staples, real estate and utilities, are seen as ""bond proxies"" because of their higher yields. They have historically lagged the S&P 500 when bond yields are rising.As the Federal Reserve seems inclined to keep raising rates this year, more pain may lie in store for SPLV and USMV, in Rosenbluth's view.XRLV has little to fear in this context. It boots out the 100 most rate-sensitive stocks from the S&P 500 and so has virtually no exposure to utilities and real estate. Gas and electric companies such as Dominion Resources (D) and Southern Co. (SO), which belong in the older sibling's portfolio, are missing here.Instead, it skews heavily toward financials, technology and industrials, such as JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT). Those economically sensitive sectors tend to perform well amid rising interest rates.Basically, XRLV is defensive — but not too much.""It's a middle ground for investors who are expecting more choppiness in the marketplace but also wish to participate in an improving economy,"" said Rosenbluth.XRLV has gained 10.3% since the Nov. 8 election, roughly in line with the S&P 500 and outpacing the 9.2% advance of the low volatility heavyweights, SPLV and USMV.While the Fidelity dividend ETF also holds stocks that perform well when rates are rising, it avoids big sector bets.It is up 4.8% year to date and has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.05%.RELATED:The Best Lage-Cap Growth ETF For 10 Years, But Is It Best For You?

Third, investor sentiment is positive for such enterprise software offerings.""The San Francisco-based enterprise software developer raised $221 million with the IPO.

283,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) on Wednesday signaled a major shift in its operations, saying that it is testing food deliveries and will launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. and elsewhere by the end of the year.The moves mark the latest effort by a restaurant to become more mobile-oriented, as the smartphone replaces the drive-through as the next front for convenience in the industry. More restaurants are trying out mobile ordering and delivery services  to appeal to diners who would rather stay home.Dow industrials component McDonald's said at its 2017 investor meeting that it is testing or exploring deliveries with third-parties such as UberEats and GrubHub (GRUB).McDonald's said the deliveries business is already a $100 billion industry. McDonald's has tested deliveries for years, CEO Steve Easterbrook said, but now sees a chance to ""scale quickly."" McDonald's already gets $1 billion in delivery sales worldwide, mostly in China and other parts of Asia.There has been some concern that hamburgers won't travel as well as, say, pizza. However, Jack in the Box (JACK), which is testing late-night deliveries, recently said its late-night customers were more ""forgiving"" on quality issues.A big advantage for McDonald's deliveries: The burger giant noted that 75% of the population in its five biggest markets — U.S., France, the U.K., Germany and Canada — live within three miles of a McDonald's.McDonald's shares rose 1.1% to 129.05, hitting a more-than-nine-month high in the stock market today. Trading was  halted for a substantial time during the investor meeting. The stock has a potential buy point of 132.06 in a cup base going back nearly 10 months.GrubHub, which wasn't moving much before McDonald's comments, rose 3.2%, closing just below its 200-day moving average. Yelp (YELP), a local search service that has a GrubHub rival, climbed 2.85%.McDonald's mobile order and pay news followed news last year that the burger giant would debut such a system in 2017.The plans also follow Domino's Pizza's (DPZ) resounding success with its digital ordering technology. Starbucks' (SBUX) mobile order and pay platform has also been popular.IBD'S TAKE: Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle told IBD explained why his pizza chain should benefit from fast-food rivals adopting mobile ordering.But concerns have surfaced about the longer lines and traffic bottlenecks that have resulted from the coffee giant's mobile ordering platform, perhaps raising questions about what types of restaurants are best suited to the technology or the most effective ways to use it.Domino's stock fell 1.2% as McDonald's looms as a digital and delivery competitor, though it was off session lows. Starbucks rose 0.5%.McDonald's at the investor conference touted other digital initiatives, including revamping 2,500 U.S. restaurants to its advanced ""Experience of the Future"" format by year end as well as digital menu boards at drive-thrus. The chain said that format, which includes table service and kiosk ordering, will be in most of its traditional U.S. restaurants by the end of 2020.Following a Bloomberg report last week that McDonald's would start offering $1 sodas and $2 McCafe drinks, McDonald's also said Wednesday that it saw ""significant"" opportunity in coffee.McDonald's said it was re-evaluating ""everything"" in its core menu products, with an eye on improving the taste and quality of its food as more consumers go for healthier or fresher ingredients.""We are simply a machine when we get going,"" CEO Easterbrook said.McDonald's on Wednesday said it will return $22 billion to $24 billion in cash to shareholders over the next three years.The company also said it was targeting annual sales growth of 3%-5% and annual earnings-per-share growth ""in the high-single digits"" starting in 2019. McDonald's also said it was on pace to refranchise 4,000 restaurants by year's end, ahead of schedule.The plans, the company said, could help it retain and reclaim customers, who may have been lost to smaller burger or fast-casual chains pushing better ingredients.""As customers' expectations increased, McDonald's simply didn't keep pace with them,"" the company said in a statement.The aggressive showcase of McDonald's technological advances Wedneday follows concerns about the momentum of the company's two-year-old turnaround plans.Sales jumped following McDonald's introduction of All Day Breakfast in 2015, but analysts began to wonder last year whether the company could keep up its sales  acceleration and whether it had relied too much on the expanded breakfast hours to do so.RELATED:

The odds for a rate hike at the March 14-15 meeting have risen substantially since the start of the week.Wednesday's strong showing for the stock market came as the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers showed extreme bullishness again. The percentage of bulls came in at 63.1%, up from 61.2% in the prior week and the highest level since 1987. The survey is used as a contrarian indicator because excessive bullishness has been seen at or near market tops in the past.RELATED:Infrastructure Stocks Rise On Trump's $1 Trillion 'National Rebuilding' PlanCisco Partly To Blame For Palo Alto Networks' Pain?

286,MCD,"Jack in the Box (JACK), the burger chain that's really all about its tacos, and sit-down restaurant chain Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) reported quarterly earnings after the close. Jack in the Box missed badly, while Cheesecake Factory met on EPS and edged past sales views.Here are the details:Estimates: Fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of $1.24, a 33% lift, on revenue of $499.49 million, up 6%.Results: Adjusted EPS rose 27% to $1.18 on revenue of $487.9 million, up nearly 4%. Same-store sales rose 3.1% at Jack in the Box locations with Qdoba comps down 1%.""Consistent with restaurant and retail industry data, we've seen an abrupt downturn in February sales trends for both brands,"" said CEO Lenny Comma. ""We believe some of this slowdown may be attributable to delayed tax refunds, as well as record rainfall and flooding in California over the past few weeks which have impacted our Jack in the Box resultsOutlook: The restaurant operator sees Q2 comps flat to down 2% at Jack in the Box locations and off 1%-3% at Qdoba. For the full year, the company sees Jack comps up 2% and roughly flat at Qdoba. Full-year EPS will come in at $4.25-$4.45 vs. views for $4.72.Stock: Shares tumbled 10% in initial after-hours trading. Shares closed down 3.5% to 103.60 in the stock market today, piercing the bottom of a flat base.Jack in the Box fell during the regular session along with many other restaurant stocks, led by Papa John's (PZZA) (off 7%) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) (down 12.3%). Papa John's reported weaker-than-expected sales late Tuesday, while steakhouse Texas Roadhouse missed on the top and bottom lines.Estimates: Fourth-quarter EPS up 24% to 67 cents, with revenue rising 13% to $595.05 million.Results: EPS was 67 cents on revenue of $603.1 million. Same-store sales rose 1.1%.Stock: Shares fell about 1% in after-hours action. The stock closed down 0.9% to 60.10 Wednesday. Cheesecake Factory fell below its 50-day line on Tuesday.The earnings come as a debate this year emerges over when food prices might start to rebound, and how traditional restaurants will stay relevant to a generation of diners who look to their smartphones to order in.Cheap commodities have made food at grocery stores less expensive, steering more customers toward supermarket aisles and away from the drive-thru. Lower-priced commodities have also made it easier for fast-food chains to hawk value deals, which dented same-store sales across the industry last year.But if higher food prices this year end up discouraging discounting, rivals might have to compete more on Jack in the Box's terms, some analysts suggest.""We anticipate a shift from value-oriented promotions to innovation, and expect JACK to be a prime beneficiary,"" SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said in a research note this month.After spending last year promoting better ingredients, Jack in the Box said 2017 would be devoted to replenishing its menus with new items.Both Jack in the Box and Cheesecake Factory have also partnered with food deliverer and GrubHub (GRUB) rival DoorDash in some capacity to try out delivery services — something other restaurants are moving into as well.Jack in the Box said last month that many late-night customers were ""more forgiving"" to food that may have lost its flavor sitting in a delivery container. That delivery service is currently available in locations in California.And some analysts say Cheesecake Factory's delivery ambitions could help speed same-store sales growth in the second half of the year. The company currently offers delivery in around half its locations.""While many concepts are testing or utilizing delivery in some form, we believe Cheesecake Factory is one of the few well-positioned to capitalize on this growing trend,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said in a research note last month.""The brand's desirability, limited capacity at peak hours and a menu well-suited to large parties all suggest that delivery could be a compelling offering.""RELATED:Papa John's, Concho Resources Mixed; Texas Roadhouse MissesJack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerWhat Jack In The Box, 'Hunger Games' And 'Seinfeld' Have In Common

294,MCD,"Starbucks (SBUX) shares haven't been anything to write home about over the last year or so but have still managed to carve out a base, and fiscal first-quarter earnings late Thursday could provide enough of a jolt to send the stock into buy range.Wall Street analysts are expecting 13% profit growth — the slowest in five years — to 52 cents a share on 9% sales growth to $5.85 billion. The relatively weak profit gain comes as traffic at brick-and-mortar retailers, which are often adjacent to Starbucks locations, is losing more ground to e-commerce, pushing the company to expand its upscale offerings.""Our question is whether the company can overcome the natural erosion of traffic across retail (discussed in length at the Dec. 7 analyst day) or whether pricing efforts around premiumization are possibly too aggressive,"" wrote Buckingham Research Group analyst John Zolidis on Tuesday.While same-store sales managed to match forecasts last quarter, that metric in the U.S. has in recent quarters gotten a lukewarm reception on the Street.Wedbush's Nick Setyan said he expects ""sustained comp momentum"" in the Americas segment, while RBC Capital Markets' David Palmer said comps have been improving through the quarter. Zolidis, Setyan and Palmer are all estimating 4% in same-store sales for Q1. In Q4, Starbucks had global comp growth of 4%, and 5% in the Americas.At an investor day last month, COO Kevin Johnson said cold drinks, lunch offerings and continued digital and mobile efforts are three core comp drivers going forward.Shares ended trading up 0.4% at 58.70 on the stock market today, closing in on a 59.64 entry in a saucer-with-handle base. Investors should note a few technical points on this technical analysis. If you look at Starbucks' chart as a base going back to Oct. 30, then the midpoint of the handle is fractionally lower than the midpoint of the consolidation. But, using the 52-week high set in April, the handle — and 59.64 buy point  — are valid.McDonald's (MCD), which has tried to regain some coffee drinkers from Starbucks, was up 0.6% to 121.79, staying above its 50-day and 200-day lines. McDonald's dipped Monday after reporting Q4 results that topped views but indicated momentum from its menu revamp was fading.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) finished up 0.5% to 52.01.IBD'S TAKE: Buying and selling stocks ahead of a company's earnings announcement can be dicey, but options plays on Swing Trader offer a way to at least cap the risk while still participating in the potential upside.Howard Schultz, who is handing over the CEO reins to Johnson in April, will be focusing on the rollout of the more premium Starbucks Roastery and Starbucks Reserve locations amid what he calls as ""over-retailed"" American consumer environment. Schultz envisions 20 to 30 ""really grand"" Roastery hot spots and a big fleet of smaller premium Reserve locations.The company's current five-year plan includes 10% revenue growth, 15%-20% profit growth, mid-single-digit annual same-store sales gains and 12,000 more locations globally.Aggressive growth plans in China mean that we can expect to see twice as many Starbucks in the country — around 5,000 — by 2021, which the company expects will nearly triple the segment's revenue and operating income.But some initiatives have proved short-lived. The Seattle Times reported earlier in the month that Starbucks planned to close its ""Evenings"" offerings on Jan. 10 amid the buildout of the new premium locations. The program attempted to turn nearly 440 U.S. coffee shops into more after-work-friendly destinations with wine, beer and small plates. (The new premium locations will offer spirits.)RELATED:Starbucks CEO Says U.S. 'Over-Retailed,' Plans To Add 12,000 StoresWhat To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?Starbucks' Schultz To Step Down As CEO; No Other Leadership Change Seen

Volume was tracking higher across the board vs. the same time Friday.Automaker, online travel booking and software stocks led the downside in the stock market today, while retailers, hospitals and building-related stocks outperformed.Verizon (VZ) and Apple (AAPL) were among the biggest losers on the Dow, down 0.8% and 2.4%, respectively, and in above-average volume. Verizon is trading at its lowest levels since January, while Apple extends its recent slide to test its 200-day moving average.Apple has gotten hit amid concerns it would be pressured to manufacture more iPhones in the U.S., which is likely to drive up costs and prices. A Chinese state-controlled newspaper warned Monday Apple could get punished if President-elect Donald Trump launches a trade war with China, where the iPhone is manufactured.Other big-cap techs have been falling as well, including Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), each down 2% or more.But McDonald's (MCD) was the biggest Dow gainer, jumping 4% to a two-month high in fast trade.

297,MCD,"Fads come and go, and it's not a stretch to wonder if the slowdown in McDonald's (MCD) Japan's same-store growth might point to fewer Charizard captures, just months after ""Pokemon Go"" partnered up with the country's Big Mac chain.While Japanese consumers can be especially fickle with their fads, tech trends often begin there before spreading elsewhere.Same-store sales for McDonald's Japan grew 11.5% in September, a deceleration from a 15.9% gain in August and the spectacular 26.6% surge in July, when the game first debuted in Japan.Most McDonald's locations across the country became Pokemon ""gyms"" and game-related hot spots, which boosted McDonald's Japan sales, according to Nikkei reports. The stock also saw a 2.2% boost July 19 when the game went live in Japan, marking its biggest increase in seven months.Even with a mild slowdown last month, that's still a marked difference from the prior year's negative 1.9% in same-store sales, however. McD's in the country were plagued last year by the aftermath of several food-contamination incidents that tainted the Happy Meal maker's image in the country.McDonald's shares edged up 0.45% to 113.92 in the stock market today after falling intraday to their lowest level since November 2015.

Yum Brands is sinking after a late Thursday Q3 miss.While McDonald's Japan posted but two months of positive comps in 2015 and only one month of positive comps in 2014, this year has seen nothing but hefty double-digit comparable sales.September's growth is the lowest so far in 2016, though it's unclear just how much of that is tied to a fade in ""Pokemon Go"" users frequenting the fast-food chain.Spending per customer also decelerated to 4.1% from 7.9% in August and 15.3% in July.

307,MCD,"The overall 0.6% bounceback in retail sales last month comes with a caveat: Total spending looked healthy, but much of the gain came in categories that may not drive growth going forward.A core measure of goods spending that strips out restaurants, cars and gas, as well as building materials, rose just 0.1% in September. That was well below the 0.4% gain expected by economists and came after a 0.1% decline in this broad ""control group"" category of retail spending.Sales at electronics and appliance stores like Best Buy (BBY) remained a sore spot. Despite the midmonth launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.9% from August and 3.8% from a year ago. Best Buy shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today but are still near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs amid strong initial iPhone 7 demand and rival Samsung's overheating problems with its Note 7, which finally prompted the company to end sales and production of the smartphone.Slumping demand for PCs and printers led Hewlett-Packard (HP) on Thursday to announce a gradual reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. Electronics retailers also are being squeezed by the likes of Amazon (AMZN). Nonstore retailers saw September sales rise 0.3% from August after a 0.1% dip the prior month. Though online sales momentum has cooled a bit in the past few months, nonstore retailers still are posting double-digit year-over-year gains — 10.6% in September.Department store sales slid 0.7% from August and 6.4% from a year ago. Some of the slide reflects store closures. Still, analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded shares of Macy's (M) to neutral from buy on Friday, noting a slowdown in same-store sales growth. JPMorgan cut price targets and Q3 estimates on Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS).Macy's, Kohl's shares fell about 3% Friday while Dillard's skidded 4.6%. Kohl's and Nordstom fell fractionally.Everything to do with the housing market shined in September. Sales at building materials and garden equipment stores like Home Depot (HD) surged 1.4% from August, more than reversing a 0.8% decline the prior month. Meanwhile, furniture store sales rose 1.0% from August and 2.7% from a year ago.Home Depot shares rose 0.1%.One of the surprises in the retail report was the strong gain in spending at food service and drinking places, up 0.8% from August, when sales rose 0.7%. Sales have moderated on a year-over-year basis to 6.1% from the 8%-plus pace that prevailed for most of 2015. Still, the gains over the past two months are a pleasant surprise given that McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK) and others have cited pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.McDonald's stock fell 1.1%, while Wendy's and Jack in the Box rose fractionally.IBD'S TAKE: The Retail-Restaurants industry group is ranked in the lower tier by IBD, No. 113 out of 197 based on share performance. Investors will generally have more success buying leaders in top-tier groups, when the market trend is favorable. Sill, Papa Johns and Dunkin' Brands, are close to buy points and worth watching. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find out why they're the two top stocks in the group.September restaurant sales data out Thursday from TDn2K covering 25,000 locations shed further light on industry trends. Overall, same-store sales fell 1.1% from a year ago in September, while customer traffic slumped 3.5%. The sector is on pace for its worst performance since 2009.Still, overall sales are performing better than same-store sales because of continued industry expansion, and the quick-service industry is doing a whole lot better than the rest, growing same-store sales 2.2% from a year ago in the third quarter, Nation's Restaurant News reported.On Friday, Bank of America analysts upgraded Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to buy from underperform, noting that the research firm expects 10.4% U.S. same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Domino's reports on Tuesday before the open. Domino's rose 0.5%.Auto sales jumped 1.1% in September, as U.S. vehicle sales rose to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. Sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs outperformed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), helping offset their unit sales declines vs. a year ago.""The decline in gasoline prices relative to a year ago is likely to continue to support SUV sales,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""Nonetheless, overall vehicle sales are at a level that may be close to a ceiling.""Ford shares closed unchanged. GM rallied 1.1% and Fiat Chrysler shares 2.3%.Gas station sales helped pump up the overall retail sales gain, rising 2.4% from August. McCarthy and Simons noted that the big rise was based on seasonal adjustments: Gas prices fell in 0.8% in September, but they usually fall 2.8% during the month after the peak summer driving season.RELATED:Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

308,MCD,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

That's the opposite of what bulls like to see.The Dow Jones utility average was a top performer Wednesday, rising 1%. Given the chatter about an interest rate hike, the gain in the utility average was unexpected. (Higher interest rates make dividend-paying utilities less attractive.) From a wider perspective, some kind of rebound was no surprise. The utility average has retreated about 11% since its July 6 high.Consolidated Edison (ED) has dropped 11% off its high. The stock rose almost 1%, after falling in 12 of the previous 13 sessions. PPL (PPL) also bounced 1% higher, but it remains 18% off its high. The electric utility has skidded in 10 of the previous 11 sessions.Banks, which are likely to benefit from higher rates, made no dramatic moves Wednesday. Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were nearly flat. Citigroup (C) trimmed 0.5%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a Phoenix-based midcap, advanced 0.6%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, dairy products and gold and silver miners booked the best gains for the day, according to preliminary data. Biotechs took the hardest hit.Blue chips were almost even between winners and losers. Dow components Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) led with gains of about 1%.In the S&P 500, Kroger (KR) grabbed the pole position with a 3% pop. A recent Morgan Stanley report said Kroger's alternative formats have not been fully priced into the stock. Rumors also have swirled over a possible merger with Whole Foods Market (WFM).The Fed minutes from the September meeting showed three members favoring an immediate rate hike. They lost the argument, but may have set the tone for a rate hike in December.IBD'S TAKE: An uptrend under pressure makes buying stocks more risky than ideal, but some stocks could be setting up for breakouts.Railway CSX (CSX) reported quarterly results after the close. CSX fell 1% in regular trading Wednesday, its fourth daily loss in a row, and was slightly higher in extended trading. The Street's consensus estimate was for earnings of 45 cents a share, but the number came in at 48 cents. Revenue fell 8%.RELATED:Fed Hawks Are Gaining SwayPessimists Still Down On IBM, Which Reports Monday

318,MCD,"A team made up of the Carlyle Group (CG) and a Chinese state conglomerate is seen as the front-runner to win an auction for McDonald's (MCD) locations in China and Hong Kong, Reuters reported Thursday.As part of its turnaround plans after several quarters of sluggish sales, McDonald's this year said it wants to ""identify strategic partners"" for its franchise business in Asia, a move that would shift costs onto independent owners.Carlyle and partner CITIC Group, a state-run investment conglomerate, had made final bids for the China and Hong Kong restaurants, Reuters reported, as had private equity firm TPG Capital and real estate outfit Sanpower Group. It was unclear if others had also made bids.TPG teamed up with Chinese mini-market chain Wumart in the bid, while Sanpower had previously said it would work with Beijing Tourism Group, Reuters said, as having local partners can help companies outside China more easily deal with supply and real estate-related difficulties.Shares of McDonald's closed up 0.4% at 116.14 in the stock market today, but have been crawling near the bottom of a flat base in recent weeks. Yum Brands (YUM), which is planning to spin off its China operations later this year, climbed 1% to 87.79.IBD's TAKE: Even as the restaurant sector struggles, Papa John's continues to hover near a buy point. Find out why pizza stocks are doing better than other restaurants. McDonald's business in China and Hong Kong could be worth as much as $3 billion, Reuters said.The development comes as McDonald's and rival Yum Brands try to limit their exposure in the region after suffering from food-safety scandals in China in 2014.RELATED:Ackman's Chipotle Menu?

319,MCD,"The bulls regained control from the bears Thursday as major averages ended with strong gains in mixed volume.Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) were top performers in the Dow, with gains of around 3%. Skyworks (SWKS), Nvidia (NVDA) and Analog Devices (ADI) led the Nasdaq 100.At the close, the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.5%, helped by another rally in chip stocks. The Russell 2000 small-cap index added 1.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each gained 1%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Wednesday's levels. Nasdaq volume was too close to call.Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 3-to-1. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.Oracle (ORCL) rallied 1.5% ahead of its earnings report after the close but gave back 1% early after-hours trading. Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share of 55 cents, or 3 cents below views. Sales of $8.6 billion also was below estimates.In the stock market today, Dow component McDonald's (MCD) added 0.8% after Reuters reported the company has received final offers from three bidders for its China and Hong Kong operations.Meanwhile, leading growth stocks outperformed again. New Oriental Education (EDU), featured in Wednesday's Stock Spotlight column, soared nearly 7%. It's now slightly extended from a 45.47 entry.New Oriental was one of several strong gainers in the IBD 50, along with Abiomed (ABMD). Shares rose nearly 4%. Abiomed is getting support at its 10-week moving average for the first time since a breakout from a consolidation in early July.Elsewhere, Tyler Technologies (TYL) cleared a 171.51 flat-base buy point, rising 1.5% to 172.IBD'S TAKE: Tyler is one of several leading growth stocks in IBD's Computer-Tech Services group. See who the other top performers are with IBD Stock Checkup.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas intermediate crude oil futures for October delivery rose 33 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $43.91 a barrel.

"
320,MCD,"The biggest problem cited by McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN) and a host of other fast-food and fast-casual restaurant chains got even worse in August: The cost of eating in got even cheaper relative to dining out.Food at home prices fell 0.2% last month, while the price of food away from home rose 0.2%, adjusted for seasonal factors, the Labor Department said on Friday.Compared with a year ago, food at home costs 1.9% less, while food away from home costs 2.9% more. The divergence in prices has accelerated over the past year as the restaurant industry digests higher wages, yet the problem has been building for close to two years.Over the past two years, prices of limited service meals and snacks are up 5.9%, while food-at-home costs 1.1% less than it did two years ago. That gap of 7 percentage points is the biggest gap since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began breaking out fast-food prices in the late 1990s.Restaurants wanting to lure customers may have to limit menu price hikes, pinching margins.On an Aug. 10 earnings call, Wendy's said it was picking up market share in the hamburger segment of the fast-food industry, but industrywide demand has been flat.Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor explained why: ""It's gotten a lot cheaper, relatively speaking, to go get fresh beef at your local butcher and go home and grill it.""Prices for uncooked ground beef are down 8.8% from a year ago, despite a rare 0.8% rise last month, as cheaper corn for feeding cattle has helped reverse an earlier spike in prices. Poultry prices for home consumption are down 2.9% from a year ago.McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on a July 26 conference call, ""While we are benefiting from favorable commodity costs around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition.""He noted that menu prices were up about 3% from a year ago in the second quarter.IBD'S TAKE: If rising labor costs already are a concern for the fast-food industry, can low-cost chains live with a $15 minimum wage? Check out this Industry Snapshot to understand why a high minimum wage will be so difficult for fast-food franchises to digest.Jack in the Box (JACK) reported a 3.7% decline in transactions in the second quarter, citing a ""migration (of business) from our industry to supermarkets.""Still, margins at Jack in the Box brand restaurants increased 0.5 percentage point to 22.5% ""as favorable commodity costs more than offset wage inflation,"" said Jerry Rebel, Jack's chief financial officer.On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that sales at food and drinking places rose 0.9% in August after being flat in July. Overall, retail sales fell 0.3% last month, so the restaurant industry isn't the only one seeing challenging conditions.Same-store sales at restaurants were down 0.6% from a year ago in August, though not as bad as July's 1.4% year-over-year decline, according to TDn2K's Black Box Intelligence. Quick-service chains fared somewhat better than fast-casual.Ruby Tuesday (RT) said on an Aug. 10 earnings call, the last one before its CEO resigned, that ""business continues to be impacted by declines in guest traffic, pervasive softness in the casual dining industry and increased promotional activity by our peers.""Still, Brinker International (EAT), which owns the Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy chains, says it's staying on plan to raise prices 1.5% to 2% a year, amid labor-cost increases and doubts that food-at-home prices will keep falling.""It's a little different in retail where you just resticker the product every day, but for us, we believe that it makes more sense to be more consistent in your pricing,"" CEO Wyman Roberts said on an earnings call.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is still seeing positive same-store sales growth, but in the 2% to 4% range after double-digit growth the prior year. The steakhouse has resisted big wage increases, reporting only moderate wage inflation of 3.5%, but it's seen staff turnover spike to 120% of hourly workers on an annual basis, down from 20% several years ago. Now it is also facing potential cost increases from the Labor Department's overtime rule that takes effect in December.""We expect to experience continued food cost deflation again next year along with continued labor inflation,"" Texas Roadhouse CEO Wayne Kent Taylor said on an August 1 earnings call via a Seeking Alpha transcript. ""As always, we remain committed to protecting our everyday value positioning and will be conservative when it comes to taking any price increases.""Another consideration for franchises is that for McDonald's, the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain and others, franchise fees and rent, in some cases, is a fixed percentage of sales. That means lower prices would directly cut into franchise royalties, a cash cow.Meanwhile, grocery stores are struggling with lower food prices as well.Kroger (KR) lowered its earnings guidance earlier this month for the second half of 2016, citing food deflation and expectations of same-store sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. In part, Kroger is passing along lower commodities prices to its grocery store customers, but analysts have also cited price-cutting pressure from Wal-Mart (WMT). Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), SuperValu (SVU) as well as dollar stores and distributors have reported weak grocery results in recent weeks.

321,MCD,"Retail sales fell 0.3% in August, the Commerce Department said Thursday vs. estimates for a 0.1% decline. Excluding the auto sector, sales fell 0.1% vs. views for a 0.2% gain.July retail sales was revised up a tenth to a 0.1% gain but excluding autos they were revised down a tenth to -0.4%. The report likely reinforces market expectations that there will be no Federal Reserve hike in September.Economists had expected a solid bounceback in sales outside the auto sector during the key back-to-school month. But one of the only truly consistent sources of strength, Amazon (AMZN) and its category of nonstore retailers, saw a 0.3% decline in sales, a possible aftereffect of Amazon Prime Day in July. Nonstore sales still rose 10.9% vs. a year earlier.A second straight weak report may raise questions about the state of the consumer after the August jobs report showed a big slowdown in weekly wage gains and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index backslid this month.Auto sales for August showed a drop in the seasonally adjusted annual rate to 16.98 million vs. a 17.88 million pace in July, an apparent confirmation that sales will come in shy of 2015's record.Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) both reported year-over-year declines in vehicle sales during August. In fact, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) was the only one of the seven top U.S. sellers to report higher demand.Autos are a key component of industrial production. The Federal Reserve will release August industrial production data on Thursday, while the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed mixed readings for September manufacturing activity in their regional districts.The tepid 0.1% rise in nonauto sales in July came despite Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. A host of other retailers seized on the event to offer bargains of their own, potentially moving some back-to-school spending into July. Clothing stores saw a 0.7% gain. But general merchandise stores saw flat sales and department stores saw a 0.7% decline from July.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to be bought.Electronics retailers saw a 0.1% sales gain despite likely weak demand for Apple (AAPL) iPhone sales ahead of September's launch of the iPhone 7. Costco (COST) reported that its August same-store sales were flat from a year ago, as gains in other categories didn't outweigh lower gas and food prices.Grocery stores reported a 0.3% monthly sales gain while restaurants advanced 0.9%. That's despite a raft of negative news from those sectors amid falling prices.Same-store sales at restaurants were down 0.6% from a year ago in August, though not as bad as July's 1.4% year-over-year decline, according to TDn2K's Black Box Intelligence. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home.Kroger lowered its earnings guidance earlier this month for the second half of 2016, citing food deflation and expectations of same-store sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%. In part, Kroger (KR) is passing along lower commodities prices to its customers, but analysts have also cited price-cutting pressure from Wal-Mart (WMT).

322,MCD,"Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, delivering a fiery inauguration speech that promised to unseat the Washington establishment and return power to the American public.""Today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,"" Trump said in his inauguration speech. ""We are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.""Trump, 70, who has not previously held elected office, took the oath of office shortly at about noon on Friday from Chief Justice John Roberts at the U.S. Capitol. The midday ceremony completed an unorthodox transition of power in which the incoming Republican president relied on social media to set his agenda and address the public.""From this day forward a new vision will govern our land, from this forward it is going to be only America first, America first,"" he pledged.Trump rose to office in November on a populist, anti-establishment wave, defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton with a promise to shake up politics-as-usual and ""drain the swamp"" in the nation's capital. He has vowed to dismantle the policies of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.""The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,"" Trump said. ""Everyone is listening to you now.""Yet Trump enters office with historically low approval ratings — 40% according to Gallup — and a challenge to unite his divided nation. He and his party in Congress already are at odds, especially on the issue of the Russian government's role in electing him. Financial markets, which soared immediately following his election, have recently cooled.Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, rode to the Capitol from the White House in the presidential limousine together with Barack Obama — the first black president, whose legitimacy was once challenged by the man succeeding him.The shared ride to the inauguration is a tradition on a day filled with familiar rituals designed to ease the transfer of power. Obama and his wife, Michelle, hosted Trump and his wife for morning tea at the White House before the motorcade, another custom of the day.The Obamas greeted the Trumps on the White House's North Portico. Obama offered Trump a handshake. Trump gave Michelle Obama a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Melania Trump presented the outgoing First Lady a box wrapped in Tiffany blue.Scattered protests broke out in downtown Washington by activists supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, gay rights and women's rights, and others.A cluster of several dozen people, most dressed in black and with masks over their faces, charged down streets three blocks from the White House smashing windows of about a half-dozen businesses including a Starbucks coffee shop, a McDonald's (MCD) restaurant and branches of Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC). They were pursued by police who used pepper spray in an attempt to disperse the crowd.Protesters spray-painted an anarchy sign on a concrete planter. After police cornered a group of protesters at an office building, people in the surrounding crowd chanted ""you're protecting fascists"" and ""pigs quit your jobs.""Protesters elsewhere in the city were sometimes loud but largely peaceful. They were met by chants from Trump supporters.Even as Trump has defied convention with his reflexive, ubiquitous use of Twitter to excoriate critics and wage partisan warfare during the post-election transition period, he has embraced the pomp and tradition of Inauguration Day.Tens of thousands of people began assembling on the National Mall in the early morning hours, though crowds appeared to be notably smaller than for Obama's two inaugurations. Trains on Washington's subway system, Metro, were largely uncrowded and traffic in the city was light. Inauguration Day is a holiday for most federal workers.Metro said on Twitter that as of 11:00 a.m. in New York, 193,000 people had ridden on the system. That was the lowest figure since at least President George W. Bush's second inauguration in 2005. At the same time in for Obama's inaugurations in 2013 and 2009, 317,000 and 513,000 people had ridden the Metro system.There was a heavy security presence in the Capitol, with parked buses, dump trucks and humvees blocking intersections downtown. Police and soldiers patrolled Metro stations in the vicinity of the Mall.Like past presidents-elect, Trump spent the night before his inauguration at the historic Blair House, a quick walk from the White House. He attended a morning prayer service at St. John's church, known as the President's Church, across Lafayette Square from the White House. The Trumps are to attend three inaugural balls in the evening.Minutes before the Trumps arrived for tea with the Obamas, painters walked in to the White House West Wing carrying gray buckets. Workers rushed through a carefully orchestrated turnover of the presidential residence to prepare for its new tenant.Obama walked from the West Wing along a colonnade connecting to the residence, followed by Vice President Joe Biden. Asked if he felt nostalgic, Obama replied, ""Of course.""The president left a letter for Trump in the desk of the Oval Office, as is tradition for the outgoing chief executive, Obama spokesman Eric Schultz said. He declined to provide a copy of the letter.Trump's campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton, was met by a smattering of boos from Trump supporters when she arrived at the Capitol with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.""I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values,"" Clinton wrote on Twitter before the swearing-in. ""I will never stop believing in our country & its future.""Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer was loudly jeered by the crowd at the Capitol as he spoke in favor of gay rights and immigrants ahead of Trump's swearing-in.Trump invited Christian and Jewish clergy to speak at the inauguration: Reverend Franklin Graham, the Southern evangelical and son of Billy Graham; Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles; and Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, an African-American pastor from Detroit.Trump's inaugural address to the nation will be ""very personal and sincere,"" incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, and ""less of an agenda and more of a philosophical document.""Trump was born in the Queens borough of New York, one of five children to Fred Trump, a first-generation German-American, and Scotland-born Mary Anne MacLeod.A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, he took over his father's real estate business, later renaming it The Trump Organization. He drew attention for his flashy style and high-profile deals, some successful and others ending in bankruptcy, including hotels, casinos, an airline and Trump Tower.Trump's celebrity grew with his role as host of NBC's reality-TV hit ""TheApprentice,"" which began airing in January 2004. Contestants with businessskills competed through multiple elimination rounds over the course of aseason. Trump would dismiss losing contestants with the catch phrase, ""You'refired!""Trump considered running for president several times dating back to the late1980s. His political following expanded early in the Obama administration as hechampioned false claims that the president wasn't born in the U.S. and thus was ineligible for the office.Dozens of Democratic U.S. lawmakers planned to boycott Trump's inauguration, and law enforcement prepared for protests throughout the day and the weekend. Trump's advisers hope his opening remarks as president will calm and unify the nation.""The entire national heritage is at stake,"" said historian Douglas Brinkley. ""The one thing that makes our democracy stand supreme to others in the world is that we've been able to do these transfers in a relatively no-drama way.""The body language of Trump and Democrats alike will be parsed, and Trump's every word dissected.""After an election, people feel derailed, the people on the losing end feel derailed, and it's a long hangover, because so much is at stake,"" Brinkley said. ""The transition is supposed to be the healing,"" while ""the oath is the moment that is supposed to flip on our light switches and say, 'We're OK, we're going to move forward.'""Trump has pledged to overturn or revamp almost all of Obama's policies -- on health care, U.S. relations with Russia, China and European allies, his counter-terrorism strategy and environmental protections. He also has pledged to shape a more conservative Supreme Court over time.Vice President-elect Mike Pence was sworn in by Clarence Thomas, a conservative and the only African-American justice currently on the court.Former presidents and their spouses always are invited to inaugurations, but the tradition carries extra poignancy this year. Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara, fellow Republicans who publicly refused to back Trump, are hospitalized and will be absent.

323,MCD,"Restaurant stocks were off investors' menu after NPD Group forecast that industry traffic would ""remain stalled"" this year, as restaurants struggle to stand out and cheaper groceries offer more of a reason for diners to eat at home.While the research group on Tuesday said it expects quick-service restaurant visits to rise 1% next year, compared to flat growth last year. However, traffic at full-service restaurants is seen falling 2%, meaning no growth for the industry overall, NPD said.McDonald's (MCD) fell 1.7% to 119.62 in the stock market today, slipping further from a 124.10 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base. McDonald's shares tumbled through their 200-day line and are approaching their 50-day average. Yum Brands (YUM), which operates Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, fell fractionally as it tries to find support at its 50-day.Jack in the Box (JACK), among the better-performing restaurant stocks in recent months, dropped 2.9% to 108.40. The stock fell to 107.10 intraday, briefly dipping back into buy range from a 102.78 entry point.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) was down 0.6%, but extended a trend below its 50-day line after running up last year partly on the strength of its digital ordering platform. Dave & Buster's (PLAY), whose gaming-centric approach has also made it an investor favorite, fell 0.8%.NPD's forecast comes after restaurants last year struggled with a combination of harsh or unseasonable weather, competitive value deals, election-related anxiety and an oversupply in some ingredients that has helped keep costs down but also made groceries cheaper.""Commodity costs are expected to continue their decline and this may help restaurant operators in terms of offsetting higher prices for labor and medical insurance costs,"" NPD said in a statement. ""However, as the gap widens between away-from-home and at-home food costs, it will make for a more challenging environment for operators to get a greater share of consumers' wallet.""RBC Capital Markets, however, said in a research note last month that the drag from food deflation ""should diminish significantly"" in the second half of the year, helping fast food restaurants' same-store sales.NPD also said that restaurants would need to be more innovative to differentiate themselves from rivals and court millennials more likely to seek unique, memorable experiences in what they spend their money on.Mobile ordering, NPD said, is set to ""grow exponentially."" Menu customization and other technology that caters to personal choice will also be essential to restaurants' relevance, the firm added. Loyalty programs are also likelier to be a focus.Third-party delivery and pickup services, like GrubHub (GRUB) and Amazon.com (AMZN), are also likely to get more attention.""Taking advantage of the increasing popularity of delivery will provide restaurant operators with another avenue to drive traffic,"" NPD said.IBD'S TAKE: In an interview with IBD, Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said phone-based ordering will soon look ""quaint"" and he was still assessing what companies like GrubHub and Uber Eats mean for the restaurant industry.GrubHub sank 1.5% on an analyst downgrade Tuesday, while Amazon closed up 0.5%.SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett said in a research note Tuesday that he continued to expect restaurant stocks with the ""most differentiated concepts"" — such as Dave & Buster's, Wingstop (WING), fast-casual burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK) and Bojangles (BOJA) — to outperform.RELATED:Trump Taps Fast-Food CEO, Big ObamaCare Foe, To Head Labor DepartmentFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperWhat To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?

324,MCD,"She turned down a headhunter five times in one month — passing on such enticements as higher pay and four weeks of paid vacation — but Lisa Aragon just couldn't get the job recruiter to take no for an answer.Aragon doesn't work in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street. Far from it. She manages a Wendy's (WEN) in Albuquerque, N.M. In 20 years, Aragon had never been pursued as aggressively as she had by the recruiter from the Pilot Flying J chain of truck stops, a major franchisee of fast-food restaurants.""I told him, 'I'm happy where I'm at,'"" said Aragon, 41, who already looked forward to quarterly bonuses and a bump for her work as a trainer. ""There's no need for change right now.""In today's tight labor market, restaurants are embroiled in a full-on food fight over workers. The rank-and-file is winning referral bonuses, free meals and days off, and the scarcity of candidates may be raising the minimum wage without help from lawmakers.The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7% in December, near a nine-year low. With its insatiable appetite for new workers, the fast-food business serves as a leading indicator of a labor shortage. In September, annual turnover for restaurant workers jumped to 113%, the highest since industry-tracker People Report began collecting data in 1995.While that's good news for workers, it may not be for companies and customers. Restaurants will either have to raise prices or accept falling margins. Some stores' service is suffering.Andrew Puzder, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. Labor Secretary, will be acutely aware of the phenomenon. A foe of raising the minimum wage, he is chief executive of privately held CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains. Further intensifying demand for lower-skilled employees, Trump has promised to curb illegal immigration.""It's a hot job market,"" said Michael Harms, executive director of operations at Dallas-based TDn2K, People Report's parent. ""Every employee, whether they're 17 years old or 40 years old, has options.""Aragon's boss is already pulling out all the stops to keep employees. Over the last year, Eddie Rodriguez, who operates 177 Wendy's in Florida, New Mexico and Texas, raised hourly pay by nearly a dollar, to an average $9.05.Rodriguez gave referral bonuses of up to $250 to employees who found prospects. He offered more flexible schedules and used his own headhunters to find staff for his corporate office in Pompano Beach, Fla. He also makes sure he doesn't take anyone for granted.""Today's employee, they want to feel wanted,"" Rodriquez said.Customers, however, may feel less appreciated. Rodriguez can't find enough employees for the lunchtime rush, which means it takes longer to get a junior bacon cheeseburger.Diners also are kept waiting at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is trying to hire about 600 ""crew members"" for its U.S. restaurants. To be able to pay more, the company, for the first time since 2014, is considering raising prices in some parts of the country.Chipotle is already paying an average $10 an hour. (For those inside the Federal Reserve looking out for evidence that the tightening labor market is sparking inflation, this could be exhibit A.)CEO Steve Ells in a December conference call complained that the lack of well-trained workers has resulted in napkins left on tables, untidy drink stations and slower meals.""We took our eye off the ball on the customer service side,"" Ells told investors.Restaurants aren't just competing with the fast-food joint down the street. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) last year raised wages of more than a million employees to either at least $10 an hour or by 2% for those making more.Casual restaurants such as Olive Garden-owner Darden Restaurants (DRI) and quick-service haunts like Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell are all struggling to hire.""It's as hard as it's ever been to attract and retain great people,"" said Greg Flynn, Chairman and CEO of Apple American Group, a franchisee of Applebee's, Taco Bell and Panera Bread (PNRA) restaurants.Terry Smith, a franchisee who owns three McDonald's (MCD) restaurants, said he has been able to avoid the crunch and maintain his staff of 150 to 160 employees with small perks such as free meals and paid days off. He also visits each of his restaurants every day, making sure he knows workers by name.""I rotate through the restaurants and they see me,"" he said. ""If you treat them right and have a vested interest in them, they'll stick around.""

325,MCD,"Now that activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has disclosed a 9.9% stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), the hedge fund might push the embattled fast-casual chain away from discounting and toward, say, branding and breakfast. Or the fund might shake up the company's board. Or Chipotle could find itself on an entirely different -- albeit very unlikely -- path, like, say, getting repurchased by McDonald's (MCD).Such was the range of speculation among analysts a day after Pershing Square disclosed its stake, a move that lifted Chipotle shares 5.9% to 438.45 in the stock market today. After a foodborne-illness scare last year battered the chain's reputation, sales and shares, the stock is now as close to its 200-day line as it's been since last October.In an SEC regulatory filing, Pershing said Chipotle had a ""strong brand"" and ""visionary leadership,"" and that its stock is ""undervalued and is an attractive investment.""The fund said it intended to discuss an array of issues about Chipotle's direction with the company's management as they try to regain consumer trust through menu additions, discounts and loyalty programs. The company's first better-burger location, a Shake Shack (SHAK)-like outfit called Tasty Made, is set to open this fall.While Pershing Square's move makes management a bit more likely to effect changes that would please shareholders, it would also likely mean continued volatility for Chipotle's shares, Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a note.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse cautioned against refranchising its restaurants to independent owners in attempt to shift the burden of labor and other costs.""The typical activist 'playbook' in restaurants has called for a combination of refranchising, cost-cutting and leverage,"" Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said in a report.""However,"" he continued, ""in our view, these options are less appealing in CMG's case given a high current valuation, lack of franchising historically, and since CMG would be selling stores that are significantly diminished relative to historic peak volumes and profits.""West suggested that Pershing might try to push Chipotle to move away from store growth and discounting -- the latter of which he said investors haven't been keen on -- to focus more on existing restaurants and the Chipotle brand. He also said Pershing could steer Chipotle toward international markets and toward things like breakfast, drive-thrus and more effective digital engagement.Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis on Wednesday took a more open-ended tack, wondering how Chipotle's problems could be threaded into a concrete investment angle.He wrote that investors have expressed dissatisfaction with a wide range of topics -- slow developments internationally and technologically; complaints around management's structure and compensation; an unsatisfactory response to food-safety issues. But none of those complaints, he said, appeared ""to come together into a coherent, specific course of action that would unlock shareholder value.""While he emphasized that Chipotle's main focus needs to be on regaining trust among diners, he also wondered if McDonald's could end up repurchasing the fast-casual chain.""This idea has been mentioned to us more than once,"" he wrote.The idea is that if McDonald's, once a majority owner of Chipotle before Chipotle grew up to become an archenemy, repurchased the Mexican chain, the burger giant would have a way to keep growing. Moreover, McDonald's has the resources to clear the lanes for Chipotle's international expansion and make it easier to franchise Chipotle's restaurants, he wrote.""Frankly, we believe a McDonald's-Chipotle transaction has peu de chance (little chance)"" he wrote. ""Rather, we mention it in an effort to be comprehensive as we speculate on a possible activist angle for this investment.""IBD'S TAKE: With the U.S. elections and a wave of summer violence making the world a more stressful place, many consumers have been less inspired to eat out. Cheaper groceries and the economy haven't helped, either. Even Dave & Buster's, whose stock had been on the cusp of a breakout, sank Wednesday on disappointing quarterly results. RELATED: Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsInvestors Are Losing Faith In McDonald's, Losing Hope In Chipotle

326,MCD,"August's 151,000 job gain missed expectations and slowed from July. But the headline figure still looks decent, or even better for Wall Street because it means the Federal Reserve can take its time before raising interest rates.Yet a look below the surface reveals something entirely different: This was the worst jobs report since 2010.If the data are accurate, the economy is in much worse shape than commonly believed. Yet before going into the ugly details, consider some contrary signals:Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.Now here's what's wrong with the latest jobs report. The problem isn't primarily that job growth has decelerated, it's that wage gains also slowed and the average workweek is now shorter than at any time since the economy was still getting back on its feet in 2011 (unless you count two blizzard-hit months in the winter of 2013-14 when the workweek was equally short).IBD'S TAKE: Despite what the jobs report says, wages have been trending higher, and that's likely to continue as the economy nears full employment. Investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your investments rate.The most important number in each report isn't the net number of new jobs. It's a number that combines the total number of jobs in the economy, the length of the workweek and the average hourly wage. Here's the shock: Aggregate weekly payrolls, essentially the sum total of private-sector pay earned in a week, grew just 3.5% from a year ago in August, the weakest gain since September 2010. (The 3.5% gain matched the level seen in that unusually stormy December of 2013.)The biggest culprit was the length of the average workweek, which was revised down in July from 34.5 hours to 34.4 hours, then fell to 34.3 hours in August. Here's what that means when combined with the modest deceleration in job creation: The total number of hours worked in the economy rose just 1.1% from a year ago, the smallest increase since July 2010. By comparison, total hours worked have grown at least 2.3% vs. a year ago in each of the past five years' August jobs reports.Meanwhile, after average hourly wages grew just 0.1% in August, the annual rate of increase slowed from an upwardly revised 2.7% in July to just 2.4% last month.Despite the added jobs, the paltry wage growth last month and the drop in hours meant that aggregate pay fell 0.2% in August from July.The bottom line is that, if these details reflect reality, the purchasing power of American consumers has gotten pinched. That could help explain why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) have seen sales growth slow, while retailers like Target (TGT) saw a decline in same-store sales. It's also possible that companies facing margin pressures amid tough competition and higher wages have curtailed work hours.Still, the Labor Department data are subject to revision, unlike the tax data that are signaling a faster rise in aggregate pay, so it doesn't make sense to jump to negative conclusions.RELATED:Slower August Job Growth Will Keep The Fed On Hold In SeptemberAs Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A Lift

329,MCD,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook vowed Tuesday to appeal a European Commission ruling that would force the company to pay about $14.5 billion in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, where it has its European headquarters.The European Union's executive arm claims Apple received special tax treatment to lower its tax burden. In a letter responding to the ruling, Cook denied getting special treatment in Ireland and harshly criticized the EU's actions.Apple has been a ""responsible corporate citizen,"" working with Irish tax authorities to comply correctly with Irish tax law, Cook said.""The commission's move is unprecedented, and it has serious, wide-reaching implications,"" Cook said. ""It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe.""Apple and Ireland both plan to appeal the commission's ruling and are confident it will be reversed, Cook said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of just 34, meaning it has been outperformed by 66% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For a deep dive into Apple, check out the IBD Stock Checkup.""Using the commission's theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed,"" Cook said.Ireland Finance Minister Michael Noonan told Reuters that he ""disagrees profoundly"" with the EU tax ruling. Ireland's finance ministry said the full amount of tax was paid by Apple, and no state aid was provided.Cook said the EU specifically targeted Apple, which ended the June quarter with $231.5 billion in cash and securities.The EU's case against Apple is part of a broader crackdown on tax treatment of multinationals by EU member nations. The EU is still investigating Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD). And the EU has also had longtime tax battles with Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).Last year, Starbucks (SBUX) was ordered to pay 30 million euros ($33.4 million) in taxes back to the Netherlands. In January, Belgium was ordered to recover 700 million euros in taxes from 35 companies, including from BP (BP) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), among others.Apple stock ended trading down 0.8% to 106 on the stock market today.""The ruling is disappointing, and while Apple is confident in an appeal, the process may take several years and may have a near-term sentiment overhang on the stock,"" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said in a research report Tuesday.

330,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) agreed to sell a controlling stake in its China and Hong Kong operations to a group of investors for about $1.7 billion, a key component of the fast-food giant's reorganization in a market where it's striving to catch up with more nimble rivals.Chinese state-backed conglomerate Citic Ltd., Citic Capital Holdings and U.S. private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP will acquire an 80% holding in a deal valuing the business at as much as $2.08 billion, according to a statement Monday. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's will keep the remaining stake. The new owners plan to add more than 1,500 restaurants over the next five years in smaller Chinese cities.McDonald's and rival Yum China Holdings (YUMC), which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut brands in the mainland, are among retailers that are trying to fend off domestic competition and attract middle-class Chinese consumers who increasingly demand high-quality and healthier dining options. As McDonald's streamlines its sprawling global operations, the fast-food giant is also looking at further deals in markets such as South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia.Under the agreement, Citic Ltd. and Citic Capital Partners will jointly take a 52% stake, while Carlyle will hold 28%.""Citic and Carlyle's resources will allow McDonald's to expand rapidly and refurbish old restaurants, which is expensive to do,"" said Ben Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group. ""Given that McDonald's lags behind KFC in terms of store count in China, we can expect them to expand aggressively and invest heavily.""McDonald's currently operates or franchises more than 2,400 outlets in mainland China. Its five-year target means about 300 stores will be added annually. That compares with 600 stores for Yum China Holdings, which was spun off late last year by Yum Brands (YUM), and 500 restaurants for Starbucks (SBUX), according to the companies.While Citic and Carlyle are paying a ""substantial price"" for 20-year franchise rights, the food and beverage chains are ""cash machines,"" Cavender said. In contrast, Yum China licensed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands from Yum Brands for 50 years, with automatic renewals that could make it possibly indefinite.The McDonald's transaction is Carlyle's second-biggest deal in China, trailing only its investments in China Pacific Insurance Group Co., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The U.S. private-equity firm invested a total of more than $700 million in China Pacific Insurance in 2005 and 2007, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. A spokeswoman for Carlyle declined to comment.McDonald's CEO  Steve Easterbrook is pursuing a turnaround plan to revive the company as it faces the fourth consecutive year of traffic declines in the U.S., its largest market. The China deal combines McDonald's with partners ""who have an unmatched understanding of the local markets and bring enhanced capabilities and new partnerships,"" the CEO said in the statement.The new partnership will also focus on areas such as menu innovation, retail digital leadership and delivery, the statement said.McDonald's, which said in March it's seeking strategic partners in Asia, has committed to re-franchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and has set a long-term target to have 95% of its outlets owned by franchisees.U.S. restaurant chains have seen their market lead in China challenged by a growing lineup of Asian competitors such as Ting Hsin International Group's Dicos eateries. The seller of Big Macs is also playing catch-up to Yum China. Since the spinoff from its U.S. parent, that company has a carte blanche opportunity to pursue growth, its Chief Executive Officer Micky Pant has said.The monthslong auction process drew interest from international private-equity funds and local companies. In October, people with knowledge of the matter said TPG Capital had exited the race, leaving its erstwhile partner, Chinese grocery operator Wumart Stores Inc., to compete against Carlyle and Citic. Bain Capital had also teamed up with Chinese hotelier GreenTree Hospitality for a bid, the people said at the time.

331,MCD,"U.S. stock indexes moved into record territory Friday afternoon, as the Nasdaq headed for its fourth day of outperformance vs. the S&P 500.The Nasdaq popped 0.8% and the S&P 500 0.55%, both all-time highs. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.5% after coming within 1 point of 20,000. The small cap Russell 2000 edged higher. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges.Two former IBD leaders showed strength. Priceline Group (PCLN) was on track for a 1% gain and its fourth straight up day. The stock is completing the eighth week of a flat base. The potential buy point is 1601.03, but an early entry could come at 1566.73.Priceline's earnings growth has faded from its glory years of 2003-2014, when annual growth ranged from 118% to 28%. In 2015, earnings growth eased to 9%. The Street expects 11% for the full year 2016 and then 17% this year. Priceline's margins show no slippage. In Q3, margin after tax was 42.5%, the best in at least 18 quarters.Illumina (ILMN), also a former leader, gapped up about 4% in heavy volume.

"
332,MCD,"Apple (AAPL) has set up a court battle with European Union competition watchdogs who ordered Ireland to claw back a record $13.6 billion in unpaid taxes from the iPhone maker.The U.S. tech giant said Monday it formally appealed the EU's August decision to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg, as the European Commission and Ireland separately published details of their own arguments in the case.In an order that reverberated across the Atlantic, the EU slapped Apple with the multibillion-dollar bill, saying Ireland granted unfair deals that reduced the company's effective corporate tax rate. The U.S. Treasury said the EU was making itself a ""supranational tax authority"" that could threaten global tax reform efforts.The EU ""took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules, disregarding decades of Irish tax law, U.S. tax law, as well as global consensus on tax policy, that everyone has relied on,"" Apple said in a statement after filing its court appeal.Ireland already has asked the court to strike down the EU's decision from August. In a separate filing on Monday, the Brussels-based commission published details of its two-year probe, attacking the way Irish authorities taxed profits attributed to two of Apple's Irish units.The EU also took aim at Irish tax practices, saying they were ""too inconsistent"" to set firm rules for profit allocation.The Apple investigation and others probing arrangements for Amazon.com (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD) in Luxembourg are the cornerstone of an EU attack on national practices it claims help multinational companies avoid taxation.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has repeatedly argued that special tax treatment harms companies that don't get such advantages.According to Monday's EU filing, regulators shrugged off claims that they weren't fair to Ireland and Apple during the probe. They argued that they always respected their procedural rights and the subject matter of the investigation — profit allocation methods used in tax rulings — never changed.Ireland had ""ample opportunity"" to express its views and ""made use of that opportunity on multiple occasions,"" the EU said. While Apple only had the right to submit observations, it ""was given and has effectively made use of the opportunity to submit"" views to regulators on numerous occasions, according to the text of the EU decision.The EU's competition arm said it doubted that the methods used to produce taxable profit for Apple units complied with the so-called arm's-length principle for transfers between parts of a company.Ireland said the EU exceeded its powers by ruling on its tax jurisdiction, according to an Irish finance ministry statement on Monday.Ireland also challenges the EU's determination that Apple allocated almost all its European sales profits to what the EU said were ""head offices"" not subject to tax by virtue of their tax status in Ireland. Apple argues the units, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, were never exempt from taxation — and that under the law they are subject to deferred U.S. taxation.""These branches carried out routine functions, but all important decisions within ASI and AOE were made in the U.S., and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE,"" the Irish finance ministry said.The court appeals filed by Apple and Ireland follow those already pending by Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium concerning tax arrangements the nations granted to units of other multinationals, including Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)Though Apple will have to pay its tax bill within weeks, the money will be held in escrow. A final ruling from the EU courts may take several years.

333,MCD,"As has been the norm, Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in the third quarter as the information technology sector overall led the field, says a report by FactSet Research.Firms in the S&P 500 overall spent $115.6 billion on share buybacks in Q3, but that was down 28% year over year and the smallest quarterly total since Q1 2013.Top spender Apple repurchased $7.2 billion worth of shares in Q3. Following Apple for second place was General Electric (GE) at $4.3 billion, then Microsoft (MSFT) at $3.55 billion, Allergan (AGN) at $3.2 billion and McDonald's (MCD) at $2.77 billion.Apple, General Electric and Microsoft led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in Q2 as well. Three months ago Microsoft said its directors had authorized a new stock buyback program of as much as $40 billion, and the company reaffirmed that it is on track to complete its current $40 billion buyback authorization by year-end.IBD'S TAKE: Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding. It's also a move that companies make when they begin to transition from rapid growth into middle age.As has been the norm for the S&P 500 index, the information technology sector was the top spending group in terms of buybacks at $27 billion, but that was down 41% year over year. Several major contributors were the smaller repurchases from Oracle (ORCL), Intuit (INTU), and Apple. The financials sector was the second top spending group, with $25 billion worth of stock being repurchased in Q3.Apple shares rose 0.1% to 117.06 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple, Exxon Mobil Lead S&P 500 In Q2 Dividends PaidApple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Are Kings Of Cash

It jumped back above its 50-day moving average Tuesday but is still below its 200-day line and 20% off a 52-week high.Disney, up 1.3%, had already cleared a short handle with a 100.39 buy point but now has topped a more clearly defined entry at 106.36. The stock is trading at its best levels in nearly eight months. The entertainment and theme park giant's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" topped the box office for a third straight weekend. Evercore ISI upgraded Disney to buy from hold and boosted its price target to 120 from 103.Most big-cap techs including Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) were fractionally higher, but Apple reversed an early gain to a 0.4% loss.

335,MCD,"The European Union's executive arm on Tuesday ordered Apple (AAPL) to repay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, part of a broader crackdown into EU member nations' special tax treatments for big multinationals.The European Commission ruled that Ireland's tax benefits to Apple amounted to illegal state aid under EU rules.The executive arm of the European Union Tuesday concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits to the U.S. tech giant - which is illegal under EU state aid rules.""The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years,"" said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a statement.Vestager said this let Apple pay ""an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005% in 2014.""The adverse ruling was widely expected. Apple shares fell 0.8% to 106 at the close on the stock market today, its fifth straight loss.Both Apple and Dublin have said they'll fight the ruling, with the U.S. Treasury Department also objecting. Apple said the ruling will affect investment in Europe.The case, stemming back to initial EU charges vs. Ireland in 2014, will likely send a chill through boardrooms of multinational corporations. Vestager said the EU is still investigating Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD).Last year, Starbucks (SBUX) was ordered to pay 30 million euros in taxes back to the Netherlands. Belgium in January was ordered to recover back 700 million euros in taxes from 35 companies, including from BP (BP), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and others.RELATED:Apple CEO Tim Cook Slams 'Unprecedented' EU Tax RulingApple Schedules Sept. 7 Event For iPhone 7 Reveal

The Nasdaq edged up 0.1%. Volume rose 22% on the NYSE and 8% on the Nasdaq compared to Thursday, according to preliminary data.Yellen said early Friday that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened,"" while Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said a September increase is possible.Fitness equipment maker Nautilus (NLS) gapped up to soar more than 7% to a new high in heavy volume, rising decisively past a 21.22 buy point of a 27-week consolidation. It will join the small-cap S&P 600 index after the close Sept. 1.On the downside, computer networking stock Brocade Communications (BRCD) led the S&P 500 lower, plunging nearly 12% after its quarterly earnings report.Retailers were among the stocks hardest hit on Friday.Cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) plunged 6% in heavy volume. Ulta announced late Thursday that Q2 profit rose 24% to $1.43 a share on a 22% increase in sales to $1.07 billion.The results beat Wall Street forecasts, but Ulta's Q3 earnings forecast missed views. Ulta has enjoyed a big advance since it cleared a buy point in March, but it ended just below its 50-day moving average Friday.IBD'S TAKE: A stocks that pierces its 50-day line in heavy volume after a big advance could be in trouble.

"
340,MCD,"Even as the restaurant industry has struggled this year due to a litany of factors — cheaper groceries, discounting, rising labor costs — Domino's Pizza (DPZ) has thrived.Domino's overall ingredient costs tend to be lower than other restaurants, and a single pizza is generally affordable and feeds more people than other takeout fare. More importantly, the pizza giant was made for the smartphone, and its mobile-friendly ordering system has helped propel it above its peers.Domino's earnings and sales growth has been accelerating, while its stock has climbed 44% year to date. That compares to a 12% gain for IBD's Retail-Restaurant group, with nearly all of those gains coming after Donald Trump won the presidential election.Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle says the industry is undergoing its most ""profound"" transformation in decades, and expects Domino's to benefit from other restaurants' attempts to enhance their own technology. Further out, he sees pizzas that are still handmade, but not necessarily hand-delivered. Doyle also spoke about what the incoming Trump administration might mean for restaurants.An edited version of IBD's interview with Doyle follows.IBD: What do you see being the main themes that will define the coming year for the restaurant industry and Domino's Pizza?Doyle: Well, the industry overall has been relatively flat the last year or two. One factor is always the relative value of restaurant meals to grocery. Over the last couple of years that hasn't been as good for the industry. At Domino's we've had a pretty terrific last couple of years. And we think there are a lot of things that we got right that made that value equation better for our customers, in terms of getting food right, the service right and, recently, the use of digital. And we've gotten better-than-average growth as a result.If you look ahead to 2017, you're still looking at a pretty benign commodity-cost environment. You're going to continue to see from us and from the industry ongoing investment into technology. While we've been doing it for a while, you're seeing a lot of the restaurant industry putting more and more focus on that — whether or not it's dine-in restaurants and bringing ordering and payments into the stores. You're continuing to see a real split between the concepts that are, I think, doing things right and kind of modernizing their offerings and continuing to improve what they're doing and some that, frankly, have been struggling a little bit, maybe because the pace of change hasn't been what it's needed to be.IBD: If more restaurants are stepping up their technology investments, how concerned are you?Doyle: The more that digital technology becomes the default way that people are going to access brands, and it is already the majority of our business, I think that is going to continue to play to our strength. The pizza category is very fragmented. It is difficult for the regional chains to get their digital technology and experience to the same level that Domino's and some of the other national players are able to do just because of our scale. A lot of our growth over the past couple of years has really been market-share growth. So to the extent to which more digital investment is made across the industry, I think that means that customers become more and more accustomed to doing business that way with restaurant brands.IBD: Netflix has made it easier to stay in. Domino's has made it easier to order and eat in. How much do you think Domino's, indirectly, might be a streaming-media play?Doyle: Consumption of media and number of screens in front of people has gone up over the years, but I don't know that that's particularly accelerated over the past couple of years. You've just seen market share shift in terms of Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) Prime and DirecTV and others.What you've seen broadly in the restaurant industry is a split between dine-in and off-premise. If people are dining in, they are expecting a special experience. And you've seen some categories that have struggled because the experience hasn't been special. For years you've actually seen pretty significant growth in fine dining, though that has slowed a bit recently. But if people are going out, they want it to be a terrific experience. And I think the convenience of off-premise, whether it is delivery or carry-out, has continued to be pretty compelling.IBD: How does Domino's see technology changing its business going forward?Doyle: I think that when you look forward, the days of interacting with your technology through your phones are going to look quaint. We launched full voice ordering a few years back on our app, one of the very first, if not the first, commercial ordering applications with natural voice. We launched with Alexa (Amazon) earlier this year. What you're seeing with Alexa and Google Home (Alphabet (GOOGL)) — voice is probably a far more natural way for people to interact with technology over time, and you're starting to see that accelerate.As a delivery company we're looking very carefully at what's happening with autonomous and connected vehicles and drones and all of that. I think there's going to be a really significant evolution in the business model over the next decade.IBD: What does that look like when all this technology comes together? Is there a legitimate possibility of an Uber-ized form of delivery, where I yell to a device that I want to order pizza, it connects with a connected oven, bakes a pizza in a couple minutes, sends it to a self-driving, oven-equipped car?Doyle: It's all very ""Jetsons,"" isn't it? Absolutely those things are possible. And the pace of change has been dramatic. If you look at the restaurant industry broadly, the last big, really disruptive innovation was a few decades back, when people put in drive-thru windows. You are now seeing a pace of change through technology that is, I think, dramatically more profound.IBD: Elsewhere in the fast-food space, McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) this year have adopted or considered moving more toward self-ordering kiosks either to, ostensibly, supplement or save on labor. Do you see your technology eliminating jobs or supplementing them and, if so, to what extent?Doyle: With the growth that we've had over the last few years, even as technology might make us more efficient in the stores, we certainly employ more people today than we did a couple of years ago. They're going to be more efficient because of technology but technology, for us, has only allowed us to grow.IBD: So you see technology as labor-enhancing, as opposed to labor-saving?Doyle: At some level, yes. First of all, hand-made pizza is a very important thing to our customers. That's why, with the redesign of our restaurants, we're taking out the wall. We refer to it as ""Pizza Theater."" But we fundamentally do three things in our stores: we take orders, we make pizzas and we get them to our customers, whether or not it's a delivery or it's in store. And the pizza-making part of that, and that being done by hand, has some real magic around it with our customers. But certainly the order-taking process is now majority digital, and as we discussed, we're certainly looking at new and different ways in terms of how you deliver the pizzas.IBD: What does a Trump presidency mean for your industry and Domino's Pizza?Doyle: Employed people buy a lot more pizza than unemployed people. So it really comes down to whether or not overall employment levels are going to go up. I'll let the experts opine on whether we're going to drive more employment in the near term as a result of the new administration. But that's certainly what we watch as being the most important factor.IBD: Are there any particular opportunities that you see from a Trump administration?Doyle: One of the most interesting things out there is a lot of discussion around tax reform. A revenue-neutral approach that simplifies and broadens the tax base but decreases the marginal tax rate, I think, is potentially a real positive. All economic theory says that's a good thing for growth.IBD: Trump plans to nominate CKE Restaurants CEO Andrew Puzder as labor secretary. Puzder has opposed minimum wage increases, the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and the Labor Department rule that would expand overtime eligibility (which was delayed after a federal judge blocked it last month). What would you look for from him if he is confirmed?Doyle: I'm not going to get into all the specifics — it's obviously very, very early. But I know Andy, and having somebody that understands our industry has to be a positive overall.IBD: So if he laid off a minimum wage hike, if the Affordable Care Act were scaled back, those would be favorable things?Doyle: Our job is to thrive in every environment. We operate in over 80 countries around the world and have an awful lot of different approaches to health care, and to wages and all the rest of it. We have a lot of success in all of them.IBD: What's one of the bigger, newer things that you learned about the restaurant industry in 2016?Doyle: It is very interesting seeing the evolving approach of aggregators, both in terms of order-taking and delivery services — sites like Uber Eats and GrubHub (GRUB), where you're going in and ordering off of multiple restaurant platforms. There's been a lot of activity on that front over the last year or two. I don't know that we've learned anything yet, because it's still quite early for a lot of those different businesses, but certainly something fairly new and interesting that has been taking place. And some of those are more developed outside of the U.S. than they are inside. It's actually quite developed in China.IBD: Could you expand on what's happening with aggregators in China?Doyle: We're taking orders over our own platform, so it's not necessarily that I like it, but it's interesting. And they've built some scale in some markets, so we're certainly watching that carefully and understanding the implications for the category and for our business. Again, no real conclusions yet.

341,MCD,"Facing criticism that it was slow to respond to an E. coli outbreak last year, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), on Friday announced four new directors to its board in a long-anticipated shake-up supported by activist investor Bill Ackman.The new members — Paul Cappuccio, Robin Hickenlooper, Ali Namvar and Matthew Paull — actually joined the board on Wednesday. The move brings the current number of directors to 12, the burrito chain said in a statement Friday.""Chipotle has taken the important step of refreshing its board, which will position the company for continued growth and long-term success,"" Ackman said in the statement.The overhaul addresses concerns that Chipotle's board was too insular and lacked diversity. The changes also add restaurant-industry experience in the form of Paull, previously chief financial officer of McDonald's (MCD). Following a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks last year, Chipotle drew flak for lacking the operational expertise of larger fast-food chains.The revamped board ""gives us the oversight, accountability and leadership we need,"" Chief Executive Steve Ells said in the statement.Namvar is an executive at Ackman's firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, Chipotle's largest investor. He joined Pershing Square in 2006 and helped oversee its investments in McDonald's, Wendy's International (WEN) and other food companies. Paull, who previously served on Chipotle's board when the company was owned by McDonald's, is also on the advisory board at Pershing Square.Pershing Square disclosed a stake of almost 10% in Chipotle in September. If the holdings fall below 5%, Namvar will resign from the restaurant chain's board, Pershing Square said in a separate filing Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Chipotle shares are well off their peak of 758.61, reached just as disclosures over E coli outbreaks hit the restaurant chain, and now are below 400 a share. It's now ranked 48th among those in IBD's restaurant stocks group, with Jack In The Box (JACK) at the top of the list. Hickenlooper, meanwhile, is a former investment banker at Thomas Weisel Partners who serves in senior executive roles at both Liberty Global (LBTYA) and Liberty Media (LMCA) — two pieces of billionaire John Malone's cable and media empire. She married Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, earlier this year.Cappuccio, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk and associate deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice, rounds out the new additions. He has been general counsel at Time Warner (TWX) since 2001.The stock was up 2.1% in recent action. It had been down 20% this year through Thursday's close, hurt by Chipotle's food-safety crisis. The chain suffered a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks in 2015 and then struggled to repair its image, bringing massive sales declines.The reshuffle follows a CEO change on Monday, when Ells retook the role on a solo basis. He had served as co-leader with Monty Moran, but the board felt the arrangement made the chain harder to operate. Ells started the Denver-based company more than 23 years ago and ran it until 2009, when he assumed the shared role with Moran.Paull's involvement, meanwhile, extends a complicated relationship with McDonald's. Chipotle was a subsidiary of the burger giant before holding an initial public offering in 2006.Since then, Chipotle's executives have railed against traditional fast food and the burrito company has taken pains to distance itself from its former owner. Now, as Chipotle struggles with restaurant operations and new food-safety protocols, it's seeking advice from a veteran of the world's largest fast-food chain.Now, the question is how much difference the board changes will make, said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. It's a positive sign that Pershing and Chipotle are working together constructively, but the new board members alone aren't enough to jump-start the troubled chain's recovery, he said.""It's really about people trusting the brand again, and ultimately that's going to take time,"" he said.

342,MCD,"A year after the European Commission began formally investigating Luxembourg's tax treatment of McDonald's (MCD), the global fast-food restaurant is reportedly moving its overseas tax base to the U.K.The move comes just months after Brexit, the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union.The Happy Meal maker chose the U.K. because of the ""significant number of staff based in London working on our international business, language and connections to other markets,"" according to a McDonald's statement sent to Bloomberg.In December of last year, EU regulators set out to determine whether Luxembourg officials had given McDonald's an unfair tax advantage, alleging that McDonald's Europe Franchising had ""virtually not paid any corporate tax in Luxembourg nor in the U.S. on its profits since 2009.""In a statement to Bloomberg that echoes previous statements to other outlets, McDonald's said that it pays a ""significant amount"" of corporate taxes.McDonald's is not the only company currently being investigated. Amazon's (AMZN) tax arrangement in Luxembourg is also in the midst of an ongoing probe by the European Commission. That investigation began in 2014.In August, the commission concluded that Apple (AAPL) had received up to 13 billion euros of unfair tax benefits from Ireland.McDonald's shares climbed 0.4% to 120.45 in the stock market today.

344,MCD,"Five big-name stocks are making notable moves as the market continues to climb higher, including two IBD 50 members, Facebook (FB) and LendingTree (TREE), and two Olympics sponsors, Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD).Nike is trading well below its all-time high reached last December, but it has been rallying since hitting a 10-month low in July. Shares are now nearing the critical 200-day line, boosted by a quick-turnover rise on Friday in sympathy with Foot Locker's (FL) view-topping quarterly results. The athletic footwear and apparel giant's chart has suffered much technical damage, but retaking the 200-day line would be bullish.McDonald's is still feeling the pain from its announcement last month of weaker-than-expected U.S. same store sales in Q2, with shares dropping below their late June low to hit their worst level in five months on Friday. The stock is now 12% below its all-time high, reached on May 10.IBD 50 member Facebook continues to trade within buy range after clearing a 121.18 buy point, a sluggish breakout amid the recent new highs reached by the major indexes. Though the stock has been fading in recent sessions -- it's now 3% below its all-time peak reached on July 28 -- its uptrend remains intact.LendingTree, another IBD 50 name, is in danger of hitting the 5%-8% sell territory. The stock is now 4% below a 106.92 cup buy point. For those who bought the stock after it cleared that level, make sure to keep an eye out for any further losses.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 is a ranking of leading growth stocks based on key measures such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance during the past 12 months.

345,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) showed bearish action on the stock market Friday, as investors remained somewhat squeamish about restaurant trends generally.McDonald's fell 1.8% to 115.01 on Friday, hitting the lowest level in six months. It was the weakest close since early December. McDonald's is still struggling from reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 U.S. comps, partly due to broader consumer weakness. The all-day breakfast menu introduced late last year had fueled a turnaround, but investors are worried about growth drivers as comparisons get tougher.Meanwhile, McDonald's faces rising labor costs due to minimum-wage hikes and the company's own wage increases. Rising costs and weaker comps will squeeze margins, said Argus Research last week as it downgraded McDonald's.IBD'S TAKE: Rising labor costs are a problem for fast-food chains generally. Fast-food prices have never risen so fast vs. the cost of eating at home.  Chipotle Mexican Grill retreated 1.6% to 388.50, a three-year closing low. Chipotle is still trying to recover from last year's food-borne illness outbreaks. It's introduced a new menu item -- chorizo sausage -- and introduced its first loyalty program, Chiptopia. Chipotia is generous but complicated, so it's unclear how many people will use it aggressively and whether they'll keep dining at Chipotle in October.Starbucks (SBUX) fell 1.1% to its lowest level in nearly two months. Like McDonald's, Starbucks reported weak U.S. comps for its latest quarter but said that was an anomaly, vowing improvement. Still, a few days after the earnings report Starbucks stock met resistance at the 200-day line and began retreating, falling through its 50-day average as well.On the upside, Domino's Pizza (PZZA) and Papa John's (PZZA) have delivered strong results, sending shares to highs.Jack in the Box (JACK) spiked after its earnings report earlier this month and is now trading just below its all-time high of 99.99 set in March 2015.

346,MCD,"Homebuilders unexpectedly broke ground on more homes last month while industrial production rose by the most in over a year, suggesting the economy is more in line with the solid July jobs report than recent tepid retail sales data. Meanwhile, consumer prices were flat.Housing starts rose 2.1% in July to an annual rate of 1.21 million, the Commerce Department said, defying forecasts for a dip to 1.18 million. That's just below January's post-recession peak, but starts remain far below the 2-million-plus levels in the years before the crash.Building permits fell 0.1% to a 1.152 million rate. Economists expected a slight rise to a 1.16 million pace.Multifamily starts led the way, rising 8.3% to 433,000, the best since September. New construction on single-family homes inched up 0.5%.On Monday morning, the NAHB Housing Market Index showed a gain of 2 points to 60, as builders expressed stronger confidence in the buying outlook. Yet the question is whether they are putting their money where their mouths are or unsure if introducing more supply to the market could hurt pricing and weigh on margins.The July consumer price index was unchanged, as expected, thanks to lower gas prices. Core prices rose 0.1%, just below views for a 0.2% rise, as the price of medical care and other services continues to outpace goods prices.Core inflation was 2.2%, down from June's 2.3%.Bottom line: July's data show that housing continues to be a tailwind for the economy, while the prospect of Fed rate hikes still isn't much of a headwind.IBD'S TAKE: Should investors care about Fed rate increases? Because there's no simple answer, investors would be better off focusing on overall stock market conditions to know whether the time is right to buy shares. Visit IBD University to learn proven rules about timing stock purchases.Lately, grocery prices have been falling while prices for food away from home have been rising, and that continued in July. Fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) have cited that divergence as a headwind to sales.Industrial production rose 0.7% in July, the best monthly gain since November 2014 and beating views for a 0.3% rise. June's gain was revised down modestly. Manufacturing output climbed 0.5%, the best in a year.Industrial activity has been rising modestly in recent months. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported lower U.S. sales in July. Still, output of motor vehicles and parts rose 1.9% in July, the Fed data showed.There's reason to doubt whether the solid manufacturing gain is an emerging trend. Analysts think U.S. auto sales are approaching a long-term peak, and summer production is subject to seasonal volatility as auto plants retool.On Monday morning, the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Index unexpectedly fell to negative 4.51 in August from July's positive 0.55.

On Friday, JCPenney reported a smaller-than-expected Q2 loss, as same-store sales rose 2.2%. JCPenney was the bright spot among department stores in Q2, according to Cowen analysts. JCPenney shares rose 6% on Friday and 12% for the week.Nordstrom shares rose 3.1% to 52.96 intraday. JCPenney stock jumped 7% to 11.29.IBD'S TAKE: Nordstrom and JCPenney are rebounding, but they are still working on bases while their fundamentals are mixed. Meanwhile, Home Depot and Lowe's are holding at or near buy points, as their profit and sales have held up.

348,MCD,"The biggest problem for the fast-food industry just got worse. As rough as the burger wars are, fast food chains are facing even more heat from an increasingly tough competitor: eating in.While Wendy's (WEN) says it's picking up market share in the hamburger segment of the fast-food industry, industrywide demand has been flat.Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor explained why on an earnings call last week: ""It's gotten a lot cheaper, relatively speaking, to go get fresh beef at your local butcher and go home and grill it,"" he said, according to a SeekingAlpha.com transcript.Prices for uncooked ground beef are down 10.2% from a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday, in a reversal aided by cheaper corn for feeding cattle. Poultry prices for home consumption are down just over 3% from a year ago.Overall, the cost of food consumed at home fell 0.2% in July, while the cost of food away from home rose 0.2%. That continues a trend which has moved into uncharted territory.Over the past two years, prices of limited service meals and snacks are up 6.0%, while food-at-home costs 0.7% less than it did two years ago. That's the biggest gap since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began breaking out fast-food prices in the late 1990s. The shift has accelerated over the past year, in which food-at-home costs have fallen 1.6%, while fast-food purchases cost 2.9% more.On Monday, Argus Research analyst John Staszak downgraded shares of McDonald's (MCD) from buy to hold, saying that a difficult combination of upward pressure on labor costs and the relatively cheap cost of eating at home could be a negative for restaurant traffic and sales in coming quarters.McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on a July 26 conference call, ""While we are benefiting from favorable commodity costs around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition.""He noted that menu prices were up about 3% from a year ago in the second quarter.IBD'S TAKE: If rising labor costs already are a concern for the fast-food industry, can low-cost chains live with a $15 minimum wage? To understand why a high minimum wage will be so difficult for fast-food franchises to digest, check out this Industry Snapshot.Jack in the Box (JACK) reported a 3.7% decline in transactions in the second quarter, citing a ""migration (of business) from our industry to supermarkets.""Still, margins at Jack in the Box brand restaurants increased 0.5 percentage point to 22.5% ""as favorable commodity costs more than offset wage inflation,"" said Jerry Rebel, Jack's chief financial officer.Potbelly (PBPB) said commodity deflation had lowered its cost of goods sold to 27.3% in the second quarter, down 1.2 percentage point from a year ago. But labor costs are rising, from 28.5% a year ago to a range of 29% to 30%. ""We remain extremely focused on managing our labor expense through continued efforts and investments to improve our labor productivity as well as through targeted price increases,"" Potbelly CFO Michael Coyne said.In addition to labor costs, different industry dynamics have kept restaurant chains from trying to keep pace with grocery stores in cutting prices.Food-at-home deflation also is a big issue for fast-casual chains. But Brinker International (EAT), which owns the Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy chains, says it's staying on plan to raise prices 1.5% to 2% a year, amid labor-cost increases and doubts that food-at-home prices will keep falling.""It's a little different in retail where you just resticker the product every day, but for us, we believe that it makes more sense to be more consistent in your pricing,"" CEO Wyman Roberts said.Another consideration for franchises is that for McDonald's, the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain and others, franchise fees and rent, in some cases, is a fixed percentage of sales. That means lower prices would directly cut into franchise royalties, a cash cow.
"
349,MCD,"The restaurant industry did not have what you would call an amazing quarter. A muddling economy that has left many behind, ISIS-inspired violence that has become harder to anticipate, a U.S. election that finds new ways each day to insult our intelligence -- all of these factors have made spending on restaurants less enticing. Other issues, like discounting and cheaper groceries, have also dragged sales lower.But pizza chains like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) are way up in the wake of their second-quarter results, unlike McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Wendy's (WEN) and others.In fact, Domino's Pizza stock is up 31% so far this year, and Papa John's is up 33%, while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group is up just 5%. Starbucks has lost 7%, and McDonald's has advanced just 1%.Domino's and McDonald's shares rose 0.1% on the stock market today, while Starbucks was flat. Papa John's slid 0.65%.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Domino's Pizza broke out of a cup-with-handle base following the company's most recent quarterly results. Learn more about the basics of how and when to buy stocks here.While pizza stocks weren't the only strong performers in the industry this quarter, Domino's was the only one of the 25 largest restaurant concepts in America to turn out at least 5% same-store sales growth in the second quarter, Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said.What happened? Analysts cite value -- for both customers and the businesses themselves -- convenience, and a digital ordering platform that isn't just lip service to technology.KeyBanc said in a recent research note that the pizza sector stood to benefit from the uncertainty as more people opt to order in. On the value front, you can feed a few people for not that much money, and pizza's main ingredients are cheaper, helping pad margins.What's more, pizza has been delivered to household doors for decades. For Domino's and Papa John's, that facilitates the transition to digital ordering -- over a mobile device -- which for many is far more pleasant and convenient than ordering via a phone call.""When you look at the model for pizza delivery,"" Kalinowski said, ""that lends itself to digital ordering that most other parts of the restaurant industry don't.""While he said that digital ordering platforms will become more prevalent over time, some restaurants are more mobile-friendly than others. Starbucks, for instance, has a customer frequency that other restaurants don't, he said, so mobile ordering makes sense. For other restaurants, the returns on investing in mobile have been less certain.""It's almost like a keeping up with the Joneses problem,"" Kalinowski said.Pizza is also more mobile-order-friendly because of the way people eat it -- a single pie serves more people; that means less time ordering a bunch of individual items for each person in a group.""The thought process of ordering a pizza is relatively limited, other than a couple different toppings and a couple different pies,"" Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth said. ""For the most part, the majority will agree on what to get on pizza. Ordering Chinese food (is) much more difficult. Ordering Italian food (is) much more difficult.""

350,MCD,"Like other restaurant chains this earnings season, Shake Shack (SHAK) said on its second-quarter earnings call that Brexit, terrorism abroad and global economic strains could remain troubling, even though the fast-casual burger chain said it remained upbeat about the future.""Internationally, we are not immune to global economic and political uncertainty,"" Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti said on the call Wednesday.He added that ""recent terrorism in Istanbul"" would continue to hurt business at its four locations there. A shooting and suicide bombing in June at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Turkey's largest, killed 45 people. Then, last month, a failed coup attempt by a faction in the military resulted in a massive government purge from the nation's military, legal system, education system and media.Garutti also said that the company's Middle East business -- its website lists 26 locations in the region -- ""continues to experience headwinds, given the regional challenges, and the volatility of the oil market.""The U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union, he said, also ""brings new uncertainty"" that could keep the pound weak against the dollar. Garutti said Shake Shack would ""temper our near-term expectations.""McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) also described a less-certain consumer during their earnings calls.Shares sank 6.2% to 38.35 in the stock market today, though they are currently holding above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.That followed weaker-than-expected Q2 same-store sales growth. However, Shake Shack's Q2 earnings per share and overall revenue beat Street estimates, and the company raised full-year revenue guidance above views.Shake Shack also said it expected to open 18 domestic company-run locations this year, up from 16.IBD'S TAKE: While people might have been more reluctant to dine out during the second quarter, stocks like Domino's Pizza, Papa John's and GrubHub -- which lean more on digital ordering, delivery and takeout -- are way up comparatively. Read more about the fast-food and burger wars here. The sight of more empty tables at restaurants ""may be the result of consumers eating more at home amid the current political/social backdrop, which we believe could last through the November election,"" according to a KeyBanc analyst report cited by MarketWatch.Stocks like Papa John's (PZZA), whose business depends more on pickup and delivery, stand to benefit as a result, the note said.Papa John's and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are among the minority of restaurants to report strong earnings reports. Domino's is slightly extended from a breakout last month following quarterly results. Papa John's is consolidating near highs, forming a handle with a 78.19 buy point.Lower grocery-store prices and some harsh weather in some parts of the U.S. also weighed on second-quarter restaurant sales.Shake Shack's play for a higher-end fast-food consumer, however, means it doesn't have to worry as much about competing on value meals, the way traditional fast-food chains do.The company, SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said in a note, ""is largely immune to the current industry slowdown given its differentiation."" And Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said that the firm viewed Shake Shack's ""softness as temporary"". Others felt it was a good time to buy the stock, saying that even though its valuation has fallen its long-term potential remains strong.Newer menu items and limited-time offerings also helped, management said. The Chick'n Shack sandwich accounted for 8.4% of Q2 sales. Its Bacon Cheddar Shack ""has been the best performing LTO (limited time offering) we've run since we launched the LTO program last year."" The company has also tried out breakfast menu items in a handful of spots.Those menu adjustments come as restaurants try to draw new customers without cluttering up their menus and losing their identity. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), another fast-casual chain often praised for its concise menu, also said that the addition of chorizo to its menus had helped draw customers.Shake Shack also said it had higher labor costs during the quarter, but that the impact was cushioned by its sales growth. Management said on the call that they ""still expect labor pressure"" this year, following a recent wage increase.""But as we get to the second half of the year, we're going to continue to invest in our teams, in this competitive environment, to get the right people, in order to get the people that we need, in order to continue to execute the way that we have,"" CFO Jeff Uttz said on the call.McDonald's rose 0.5% Thursday, while Domino's Pizza gained 0.7% and Papa John's 0.9%. Starbucks fell 0.3%.

351,MCD,"The Summer Games aren't just a noble gathering of the world's athletic elite: The event is also a marketing gold mine for official brand partners and sponsors of individual athletes.And perhaps more so in 2016 than in prior Olympic years, trying to harness the life force of the internet can lead to unpredictable results, thanks to an often-rowdy digital commentariat on Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Snapchat and elsewhere. Brands can emerge from the melee as social-media stars or as sore losers.So here's a glimpse at how Coca-Cola (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE) and others are performing in Rio so far:Not Coke's fault, but the soft drink giant got mixed up in a PR debacle when an Olympian from Egypt told NPR that there was no coffee in the Olympic Village, because it was a Coca-Cola-only zone.The story went semi-viral. The New York Daily News, Business Insider, Fusion and others picked up on the NPR segment -- Cosmopolitan even grouped it under a listicle called ""11 Rio Olympic Village Horror Stories.""Spokespeople from Coca-Cola, an official worldwide sponsor of the Games, told several of those outlets that no, the athletes aren't limited to Coke products and yes, there is coffee in Olympic Village, but the damage had been done.That's probably not what gold feels like.Shares rose 0.3% to 43.75 on the stock market today. Coca-Cola stock has been trading below its 200-day average since reporting Q2 results late last month.The Big Mac maker is doing lots of feel-good stuff around the Olympics -- it sent kids to the opening ceremony! Its McNuggets are pink-slime-free! -- but you can trust hungry, tired reporters to weed out the real news: there's no McDonald's in Olympic Park.According to USA Today, Olympiads of years past have prominently featured a McD's in the press center. But McDonald's told the paper that it wanted to get into the local spirit and feature dessert stands instead, of which there are 2,500 in Brazil.There is, however, a full-service McDonald's in Olympic Village.

Nintendo (NTDOY) is a shareholder in both of the two companies and also owns the trademarks to Pokemon and the Pokemon character names.""Pokemon Go,"" a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game, has been the No. 1 most-downloaded game on the Apple (AAPL) App Store and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store since its July 6 launch.While the game is free to play, it sells in-game items that enhance the experience and help players advance. Apple and Google get a 30% share of in-game sales sold through their respective app stores.Nintendo stock rose 1.25% to 28.27 in the stock market today, though well off its five-year high above 38, touched July 18. Alphabet stock climbed 0.1%, while Apple stock was down 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Two video game companies are among the top-performing companies on the IBD 50: NetEase and Activision Blizzard. IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group currently ranks No. 56 out of 197 groups.The popularity of ""Pokemon Go"" has benefited a host of other companies. Some retailers like GameStop (GME) and McDonald's (MCD) have become stops for ""Pokemon Go"" players looking for digital creatures and in-game items and have seen a corresponding sales boost.""Pokemon Go"" has also spurred sales of smartphone battery packs because the game is a notorious power hog. The NPD Group reported that portable power pack sales were up 101% year over year in the two-week period in July following the introduction of ""Pokemon Go."" Makers of mobile power packs include Best Buy (BBY), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)-owned Duracell, Energizer (ENR) and Zagg (ZAGG).""Pokemon Go"" does not appear to be affecting sales for other top mobile game companies, Creutz said.""Multiple gaming companies that we cover have … said that they haven't seen much impact on their revenue from the launch of the game, suggesting that 'Pokemon Go' has largely been additive to the market,"" he said.The success of ""Pokemon Go"" demonstrates the importance of major franchises to game publishers, he said.""Companies with significant franchises and quality (intellectual property) are likely to increasingly dominate the space,"" he said.

355,MCD,"Shake Shack (SHAK) sank after-hours Wednesday after reporting weak same-store sales, while Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BUFF) rose after topping second-quarter estimates. Silver Wheaton (SLW) was also set to report quarterly results after the close.Estimates: Analysts expected the upscale fast-casual burger chain to report second-quarter earnings per share of 13 cents, a 44% jump from a year earlier. Revenue is seen rising 30% to $63.15 million.Results: Shake Shack earned 14 cents, up 56%. Revenue climbed 37% to $66.5 million. Same-store sales rose 4.5%, below forecasts of 4.9% or more.Shake Shack sees full-year revenue of $253 million to $256 million, up from its prior target of $245 million to $249 million. It sees full-year comps up 4%-5%.Analysts forecast 2016 revenue of $252.09 million, though that was before the $3 million beat in Q2.Shake Shack's stock dived 8% in after-hours action. Shares closed down 1.4% to 40.99 on the stock market today. Shake Shack has been trading sideways in 2016 after plunging in the second half of last year. But the stock has been trading recently above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Performance in the restaurant industry has also slowed recently, with violence, civil unrest and economic anxieties making many people more reluctant to eat out.Since customers expect to pay more when they go there, Shake Shack has largely been able to stay out of the hornets' nest of value-meal competition that has sucked in McDonald's (MCD) and others. But the better-burger outlet faces no shortage of competition.Estimates: Wall Street expects Silver Wheaton to report second-quarter EPS of 14 cents, up 7.7%. Revenue is seen rising 22% to $200.82 million.Results: Silver Wheaton earned 14 cents, in line, while revenue was $212.35 million.Silver Wheaton reported 7.6 million ounces in silver production, up 28% and 70.2 million ounces of gold, up 16%. The company substantially raised its full-year gold production target while slightly trimming its silver output goal.Silver Wheaton shares were little changed in late trading. The stock closed up 1.4% to 30.17 Wednesday as a weaker dollar lifted precious metals. That's up from 12.42 at the end of last year.Silver Wheaton is a ""silver streaming"" company, making upfront payment to miners for the right to buy a fixed percentage of their production.Gold and silver stocks, often seen as safer investments, have risen as many investors try to play defense amid what executives this earnings season have repeatedly characterized as a ""challenging environment."" Silver Wheaton's purchase agreements with miners help it avoid some mining-industry risks.Royal Gold (RGLD), which owns and manages royalty interests in gold mines, reported EPS of 32 cents and revenue of $94.1 million, below views for 33 cents and $100.6 million. Royal Gold dipped after closing up 1.25%.Estimates: Analysts expected Q2 EPS of 17 cents on sales of $280.93 million.Results: EPS rose 45.2% to 19 cents on net sales of $287 million, up 12.9%.Blue Buffalo raised its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to 74-76 cents, and also hiked its revenue guidance for the year to $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion. Analysts expected EPS of 75 cents and $1.143 billion in sales.The appeal of Blue Buffalo, which purports to make higher-quality pet food, has strengthened as more people put more money into caring for their pets.Shares rose 2% in after-hours action.

Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.The Dow Jones utility average dropped 1.6% on further signs that the Federal Reserve may be preparing to raise interest rates. CME Group's Fed Watch Tool sees an 18% chance of a rate hike in September, but a 43% chance of one in December. Higher rates could make the dividends of utilities look less attractive.Most utilities have recently lost their 50-day moving average line. Southern Company (SO), for example, shows typical action -- losing the line Aug. 11 and since unable to reclaim it.One stock that is comfortably above its 50-day line and that shows no signs of weakness is retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA). The stock rose 0.6% and notched another new high. Ulta Beauty is slated to report quarterly results after the close Thursday. Wall Street expects earnings to advance 21% to $1.39 a share. That would be the slowest quarterly growth in nine quarters. However, Ulta beat views last time around by 12%.Among the blue chips, losers led winners by a 9-4 ratio in the Dow. The biggest percentage losers were Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), down 1.5%, and McDonald's (MCD), down 1.3%. The best performer was Nike (NKE), up 3%.Of the 197 industry groups followed by IBD, farm machinery was the day's No. 1 winner, up about 5%. The worst performer was the metal products distributor group, down 6%, but that was chiefly because of one stock: Olympic Steel (ZEUS) plunged 16%.

358,MCD,"Nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 in July, the Labor Department said Friday morning, much better than expected for a second straight month, and reviving sentiment about the U.S. economy. But while the Federal Reserve will take notice, markets aren't expecting Fed action for several months.The jobless rate held at 4.9%, while hourly earnings rose 0.3% and the workweek nudged higher.Economists expected nonfarm payrolls up 185,000, the jobless rate dipping to 4.8% and average hourly earnings 0.3% higher.Also, June's strong figure was revised up by 5,000 to 292,000. May's weak hiring was revised up by 13,000 to 24,000.""Maybe it's not morning in America, but the coffee is brewing and jobs are being created,"" said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.Professional services, hospitality, retail and government sectors were key contributors. Manufacturing also rose in a broad-based gain. Mining, which includes oil drilling, showed further declines.The labor force participation rate rose 0.1 point for a second straight month to 62.8% as the labor force climbed by 407,000. The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed an employment gain 0f 420,000.""The July jobs report was uniformly positive and strong,"" said IHS Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh in statement. He said the strong labor force gain ""signals greater confidence among US workers about job prospects.""Behravesh did note that ""as the economy approaches and reaches full employment, the pace of jobs gains is likely to slow.""Stocks soared on the jobs report, with the S&P 500 hitting a fresh high and the Nasdaq composite rising to within 1% of its all-time best.Normally, back-to-back strong jobs reports and bullish markets would raise the specter of a Federal Reserve rate hike. But with other economic reports looking less robust -- and other central banks such as the Bank of England and Bank of Japan increasing monetary stimulus --- U.S. policymakers are still seen on hold for the foreseeable future.Fed funds futures peg the odds of a September or November meeting hike below 20%, vs. below 10% before the jobs report. The odds don't top 50% until next March, though investors see a reasonable chance of a December move.""Given the unevenness of the data and still-present imbalance in the economy across sectors with a relatively solid consumer and markedly weak business investment, policy makers are likely to wait for further information regarding the longer-term trajectory of activity,"" wrote Stifel Fixed Income chief economist Lindsey Piegza.Strong hiring and solid wage gains --  holding at post-recession high of 2.6% vs. a year earlier -- should underpin consumer spending, which the economy has relied on even more in recent months. Consumer spending rose at a brisk 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, even as the overall economy grew about 1% for a third straight quarter.But recent corporate reports have raised doubts about consumer-related stocks and perhaps the broader economy.Apple (AAPL) reported a second straight quarter of declining earnings and revenue. Apple shares have rallied as per-share earnings and iPhone sales topped weak forecasts, but they reflect weak demand.IBD'S TAKE: For a more detailed look at consumer-related stocks' recent woes, click here.Ford Motor (F) last week missed second-quarter earnings estimates, citing sluggish U.S. sales and higher incentive spending climbed. Ford predicted domestic industry sales would fall in 2016 and 2017. On Tuesday, Ford and General Motors (GM) reported declining sales vs. a year earlier. Other automakers generally reported weaker-than-expected results.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) also have reported weaker-than-expected U.S. comps, both citing consumer unease in part. Several analysts see restaurant stocks in trouble generally, though pizza chains are doing well.Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday reported weak July unit revenue, hitting airline stocks that day.Despite retailers' headwinds, the sector added 25,000 jobs last month.Manufacturing added 15,000, the best since January. Auto production had been a manufacturing driver for several years. If Ford, General Motors and others see flat to lower sales for the foreseeable future, that could hurt factory output and jobs. And with oil prices well off midyear highs, any hoped-for revival in energy-related jobs may also be short-lived.

Worst hit was Yelp (YELP), which collapsed 20% after its first-quarter earnings topped expectations, but revenue stopped short of targets. Further, its second-quarter and full-year guidance was below the consensus view.Priceline Group (PCLN) nosed down 4% after delivering mixed first-quarter results late Tuesday.

Dunkin' Brands has a possible 58.53 buy point. Shares have zig-zagged around their 50-day moving average over the last two months, but retook support at the key level in mid-April.The coffee market in the U.S. is a crowded place to be.

364,MCD,"The post-earnings shock has worn off. After diving in late trade Thursday on a same-store sales decline, shares of Shake Shack (SHAK) are heating up early Friday after getting an upgrade to buy from Buckingham Research Group. Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) is looking to recapture the luster of its hit Unicorn Frappuccino.Analyst John Zolidis bumped up his rating on Shake Shack to buy from neutral with an unchanged price target of 39, as he believes "" the trendy burger chain has now passed its most difficult compares from a same-Shack basis"" and is opening new locations ""at very robust volumes."" He also pointed out that the company's comp base is only 32 stores big, though the optics of same-store sales remains important.In the first quarter, Shake Shack profit grew 25% to 10 cents a share as revenue climbed 42% to $76.7 million, topping consensus for 8 cents EPS and $74.7 million in sales. (The company joined Wingstop (WING), Del Taco (TACO) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO) in beating forecasts late Thursday.)But same-store sales tumbled 2.5% as the premium burger-and-fries chain faced tough comparisons from a balmier Q1 last year that included the allure of Chick'n Shack sandwiches.Management upped its full-year revenue guidance but took comp outlook down to flat from previous guidance for 2%-3% growth.""We believe SHAK is now set up to start exceeding estimates and to resume the beat-raise pattern that existed prior to 4Q16 results,"" wrote Zolidis on Friday. ""We see this putting a floor in the shares and providing justification for valuation expansion even as shares remain expensive on near-term results.""Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan, however, reiterated his neutral rating with a 33 price target, and called the lowered same-store growth outlook ""realistic.""Shares of Shake Shack shot up 9.2% to 36.18 in the stock market today. The recent IPO is still looking to turn itself around, after pricing at 21 a share at the start of 2015 and rocketing all the way up to 96.75 by May of that year. The stock's 50-day moving average crossed below its 200-day line in March. Friday's action helped shares gap up above both their 50-day and 200-day lines.Meanwhile Wingstop, shot up 11.4% Friday afternoon, gapping out of a cup-with-handle buy point. El Pollo Loco leapt 11.2%. Del Taco edged up 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: As smartphones become more common, running a successful fast-food restaurant could become more about going digital. McDonald's (MCD), on its first-quarter earnings call, talked up its more mobile, touchscreen future. Starbucks remains in the zone — buy zone, after breaking out of a flat base with 59.64 entry — on April 20, though an intraday dip last week took it momentarily out of range.Shares was up 0.2% at 60.95 as the coffee-shop giant looks to replicate the ""incredible Instagrammable success"" of the Unicorn Frappuccino with its Frappuccino Happy Hour offerings. On its earnings call last week, Starbucks' new CEO, Kevin Johnson, had promised one new entirely new drink into Happy Hour this year that is going to be as good as Unicorn or better.""The coffee-drink ""happy hour,"" which runs from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., today through May 14.Part of that attempt is its new Midnight Mint Mocha Frappuccino and S'mores Frappuccino, and a Starbucks-themed Snapchat lens to encourage Snap (SNAP) selfies at Starbucks. The company said there will be a new lens every other day through the happy hour period.McDonald's, which competes in some fashion vs. Shake Shack and Starbucks, rose 0.35%, hitting a new all-time high.RELATED:Dunkin' Brands Sales Miss In 'Increasingly Challenging' MarketWhere Does Starbucks Go From Here?

The small cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.Among the Dow's 30 components, construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) rose almost 2% and discount retailer Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) almost 1.5%.

The five are fast-food chain McDonald's (MCD), tech services giant IBM (IBM), drugmaker Merck (MRK), health care products provider Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and soft drink maker Coca-Cola (KO).In the Nasdaq 100, Starbucks (SBUX) surged 2% in heavy volume as it climbed higher in a 5% buy zone. The stock cleared a 59.37 buy point in April and is now 3% above the entry. Starbucks had been moving sideways to down since hitting a high of 64 in October 2015.

367,MCD,"Habit Restaurants (HABT) topped earnings views while Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) missed estimates, after strong Taco Bell results helped Yum Brands (YUM) overcome weak Pizza Hut sales Wednesday, and Papa John's (PZZA) beat estimates Tuesday, continuing a busy week of restaurant earnings, which will include results from Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) Thursday.The reports come amid ongoing troubles for the restaurant business — groceries are still cheaper, although for how much longer depends on whom you ask. An abundance of value deals also means less money on the top line.Estimates: EPS to fall 20%, to 8 cents, with revenue up 17%, to $78.58 million. Same-store sales are seen creeping up 0.4%.Results: EPS of 9 cents on revenue of $78.6 million. Company-operated same-store sales climbed 0.9%.Outlook: Full-year revenue of $338 million-$342 million, with the midpoint in line with consensus estimates for $340 million, as comps rise 2%.Stock: Habit edged up 0.5% late. Shares fell 2% to close at 18.90, still extended from a 17.80 buy point.Most of Habit's locations are in California. Management has said that an abnormally large amount of rain in California, amid an enduring drought, led it to be cautious on its same-store sales expectations for the first quarter.Higher wages in the state, and thus higher costs, have also prompted concern on Wall Street, Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh noted. But he said he believed ""the current push to higher quality products (while maintaining its everyday value) will help … offset such concerns.""Estimates: EPS to increase 7%, to 73 cents, on revenue of $570.08 million, up 3%. Same-store sales are seen up 0.6%.Results: EPS of 72 cents on revenue of $563.4 million. Same-store sales rose 0.3%.Stock: Cheesecake Factory shares sank 6.5% late and look to drop back below a 64.51 buy point. Shares re-entered a buy zone Tuesday.Estimates: EPS of 60 cents, a 37% drop from a year earlier — before Yum spun off its China business, Yum China (YUMC) — with sales tumbling 48% to $1.351 billion.Results: EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $1.42 billion. Same-store sales rose by 2%, led by an 8% jump at Taco Bell, while KFC saw a 2% increase and Pizza Hut saw a 3% decline.Stock: Shares closed up 2.9% at 68.25 on the stock market today.Analysts say that Taco Bell has the most going for it out of Yum's three fast-food chains.""We view Taco Bell (32% of Yum's operating profits) as the crown jewel of Yum's portfolio and believe the brand will capture investor focus given nearly 100% domestic exposure,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a research note last week.Further out, RBC's Palmer said in a note last week that Yum's sales could be helped by ""ongoing"" momentum in Taco Bell, where value items like $1 taco burritos and $5 Triple Double Crunchwraps remain hits.Estimates: Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 7% to 74 cents on revenue of $438.71 million, up 2%. Same-store sales were expected to rise 2.2%.Results: EPS of 77 cents on revenue of $449.3 million, as same-store sales rose 2% for North America and 6% internationally. Digital sales percentage topped 60%.Stock: Papa John's fell 1.55% to end at 79.22, reversing earlier gains and falling back below its 200-day line. Shares closed up 2.3% on Tuesday.As with Domino's Pizza (DPZ), which reported first-quarter results last week that beat estimates, Papa John's digital ordering platform has lifted sales and helped the company avoid the bruises that other fast-food chains have dealt one another in an ongoing battle for the better value meal.The company still competes on value — pizza's main ingredients are typically cheaper than others. Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, though, said in a research note last month that ""sector competition may prevent meaningful upside"" to his same-store sales at North-American locations.Beyond Domino's, Yum Brands' Pizza Hut in March began ""what appeared to be some rather robust discounting activity in the U.S.,"" Kalinowski said in that note.The parent of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins reports first-quarter results on Thursday.Estimates: EPS of 48 cents, up 9%, with revenue up 1%, to $192.17 million. Comps at U.S. Dunkin' Donuts locations are expected to rise 0.7%.Stock: Shares dipped 0.65% to 56.36 but are still near a 58.53 buy point.Kalinowski said that Dunkin' Donuts was likely hit by the ""industry malaise"" that watered down results in other restaurants. McDonald's (MCD) $1 coffee promotion also means more competition.Slabaugh said Dunkin's Cold Brew and espresso drinks were bright spots but cited ""concerns surrounding traffic, a lack of clear catalysts, and a potential slowdown in operations outside of the northeastern U.S.,"" a Dunkin' Donuts stronghold.However, RBC analyst David Palmer said the company was working to make its franchisees more profitable.The company over the past year has tried to make Dunkin' Donuts what it has called a ""to-go, coffee beverages brand."" The company has expanded its mobile ordering platform and rewards program, and put more effort into increasing demand for packaged products at grocery stores and bottled drinks.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which on Monday reported first-quarter results that topped estimates, surged 11.6% to 51.30 on Tuesday, hitting a record high.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's Pizza Eyes Delivery Wars As McDonald's Expands Service

368,MCD,"Restaurant Brands International (QSR) on Thursday reported a drop in same-restaurant sales at Burger King's U.S. and Canada locations for the first time in some three years, an analyst noted, as restaurants nationwide struggle with deepening customer anxieties.But the fast-food giant said it remained confident about its direction and didn't offer much commentary about the state of the consumer.McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) have described uncertainties stemming from global upheaval, high-profile shootings, terrorist attacks and a chaotic election season. But Restaurant Brands wasn't as introspective, with management noting increased competition and repeating the common refrain of a challenging environment.""The industry changes from time to time,"" CEO Daniel Schwartz said on the company's earnings call. ""We try to get too focused on macroeconomic changes.""Same-restaurant sales growth at Burger King locations in the U.S. and Canada fell 0.8%. The last time comps in that region fell into negative territory was 2013, Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.With the exception of Burger King's Asia-Pacific regions, comps slowed across the board for Burger King and Tim Hortons, which Restaurant Brands also owns.Overall, same-restaurant sales at Burger King rose 0.6%, slowing considerably from 6.7% growth a year earlier. Comps at Tim Hortons slowed to 2.7% from 5.5% growth.Top- and bottom-line results were mixed during the second quarter. Total revenue edged down to $1.04 billion, compared to analysts' expectations for $1.043 billion. The stronger U.S. dollar weighed on revenue. Earnings per share rose 38% to 41 cents, topping estimates for 34 cents.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 3.4% at 46.31 in the stock market today, just above buy territory after breaking out last month. McDonald's edged up 0.7%, and Starbucks lost 0.9%. Jack In The Box (JACK), which reported strong quarterly results late Wednesday, jumped 10.6%. Wendy's (WEN) added 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Competitive discounting, potential overexpansion and consumer unease have hurt sales across much of the restaurant sector. However, Restaurant Brands' stock is one of the few in the sector to stay above its key 50-day line. Compare and contrast industry players at IBD's Stock Checkup.Restaurant Brands has tried to shift toward more of a franchisee-led model, which shifts more expenses from corporate onto independent restaurant operators.While fast-casual rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has tried to keep its menu simple, Restaurant Brands has in recent months has tried to brighten up its offering with occasional new products. Tim Hortons has launched iced coffee drinks and steak sandwiches. Burger King, meanwhile, has introduced grilled hot dogs and and Mac n' Cheetos.

369,MCD,"Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR) and Viacom (VIAB) beat earnings views, and Kellogg (K) met profit forecasts Thursday.Estimates: EPS up 13% to 34 cents, on a 0.3% rise in revenue to $1.04 billion.Results: EPS of 41 cents on revenue of $1.04 billion.Shares ended trading Thursday up 3.4% to 46.31.Estimates: EPS down 1% to 91 cents on a 3.4% revenue decline to $3.36 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of 91 cents, on revenue of $3.27 billion.Outlook: Full-year currency-neutral view raised to $4.11-$4.18 from $4.00-$4.07.Shares rose 1.7% to 82.42 at the close.Estimates: EPS down 31% to $1.01, on a 1.6% revenue drop to $3.01 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of $1.05 on revenue of $3.11 billion.Shares lost 1% to 43.56 at the close.
"
370,MCD,"Steakhouse chain Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) on Monday said same-restaurant sales so far in the third quarter had slowed from Q2, and the company missed Q2 total revenue estimates amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall.Same-restaurant sales for company-owned locations had risen by about 3.7% over the first four weeks of Q3, which began June 29, compared to the 4.5% growth reported in Q2. Analysts had expected Q2 comp growth of 4.2%.Earnings per share in Q2 jumped 57% to 47 cents, above views for 45 cents. Revenue rose 12% to $508.8 million, missing views for $509.8 million. Comp sales rose 2.8% at franchises.Texas Roadhouse's profits were helped by falling food costs, particularly beef. Food cost deflation for 2016 is now seen at 2.5%-3% vs. prior guidance of 1%-2% deflation.Shares dived 9% in after-hours action to around 43.25, signaling a move below the 50-day line at Tuesday's open. Texas Instruments had closed up 1% at 47.70 in the stock market today, rising above buy range after first breaking out in May. But they sank 4.7% after the close.IBD'S TAKE: As the restaurant sector struggles, Texas Roadhouse touched an all-time intraday high last month. Compare and contrast industry stocks at IBD's Stock Checkup. Analysts have soured on the restaurant sector in recent weeks due to rising wages in a more limited labor market, cheaper offerings from grocery stores and growing consumer unease.Indeed, Jefferies and Stifel downgraded Texas Roadhouse last week, saying the months ahead looked grim industrywide.Jefferies analyst Andy Barish wrote in a research note that the restaurant industry could face ""at least 18 months of challenges"" due to higher labor costs and an overexpansion in the amount of available seats in restaurants, compared to diners' demand. Stifel anticipated that within nine months the U.S. would be in a recession.""In spite of job growth and wage inflation, there are a number of distracting factors that make a pick-up in restaurant sales tough to call right now such as: negative news headlines, the political rhetoric and upcoming election season and more near-term, the Summer Olympics in Rio,"" Barish said.That sentiment was echoed in earnings calls last month by management at McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX). McDonald's got hit in the stock market last month after reporting disappointing quarterly results, while Starbucks cut its full-year sales outlook.McDonald's edged up 0.3% Monday. Starbucks dipped 0.7%.
"
371,MCD,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks. For a complete look at these stocks and other consumer giants, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) cut its 2016 outlook Tuesday, citing higher fuel costs and the weak British pound following the Brexit vote. Royal Caribbean stock sank 6.3% Tuesday. Carnival (CCL) lost 3.1%.Airlines sold off Tuesday as Delta Air Lines (DAL) said unit revenue fell sharply in July. Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high. But Procter & Gamble and other consumer- and food-product giants have been relying on cost cuts to offset declining revenue.

372,MCD,"If the 2012 London Games were colloquially known as the first ""Social Media Olympics,"" then the Rio Games' sophomore outing is in full swing, as Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB), Instagram and Snapchat are abuzz with winning activity from athletes and fans alike.The previous two parts of this series have examined how brands such as Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and McDonald's (MCD) have been making the best -- or worst -- of their time in Rio.Now it's time for a look at perhaps the greatest beneficiary of these Summer Games: the social media universe.NBC's Rio ratings have tumbled about 15.5% vs. London, says the Wall Street Journal, with an even steeper decline of about 30% among 18- to 34-year-old viewers (though it's worth noting that NBC is both live-streaming events and splitting the broadcasting duties across Bravo, CNBC, the USA Network and other Comcast (CMCSA) properties).For younger viewers, for whom a tape delay can seem as antiquated as a rotary-dial phone, #Rio2016 might be more appealing than a remote control -- especially when it comes with direct, behind-the-scenes access to their favorite Olympic athletes.Zuckerberg's well-oiled social media machine has nearly doubled its daily active user base over the last four years, with an average of 1.13 billion DAUs in June 2016 vs. 552 million in June 2012. As the social action moves from desktops to smartphones, mobile monthly active users have nearly tripled since then. Small wonder, then, that Michael Phelps would bother to host a nearly hour-long Facebook Live chat with his fans on the day of his last Olympic race, wherein he confirmed that 1) his favorite dessert is frozen Reese's, ""without question, but the holiday ones, because they're better peanut butter-to-chocolate ratio,"" and 2) he is definitely retiring.""They're starting to hashtag #4moreyears!"" he tells his Olympic roomies during the live-chat. ""No, no guys. No, guys. No, guys. ... (But) I'll be in Tokyo, I'll say that. I'll be there. No competing.""The video has gotten about 3.7 million views since Saturday.
"

Around the time of the London Games, Instagram had 80 million users; now it has 500 million, with about 60% of those users opening the app daily.And postings from Rio offer an intimate look at the athletes' living quarters, late-night shenanigans and teammate banter that viewers won't find in polished post-game interviews.

Facebook fell 0.8% to 123.90 on the stock market today.(IBD University has pro tips on when to buy stocks.)There may be no greater testament to the Olympic-sized influence of social media than Leslie Jones' ascendance from live-tweeting mega-fan to official NBC correspondent over the course of the Games.The comedian -- an SNL castmate and 25% of the new ""Ghostbusters"" foursome -- is the Biggest Olympics Fan ever. Her unreserved enthusiasm primarily took the form of posting short Twitter videos from her sofa while clad in a star-spangled outfit and American flag, at least until NBC picked up on the viral popularity of her Games-related tweets and decided to fly her down to Rio.Much of her bleep-able commentary probably can't be rebroadcast on NBC's TV stations -- Vulture has a pretty comprehensive round-up of her pre-Rio coverage -- but it seems like she's keeping all her best work on Twitter and Snapchat anyway.

Revenue fell 1% to $11.94 billion, above estimates but the sixth straight year-over-year decline as the networking giant transitions from sluggish switch and router hardware to software and security.

The company also pointed to improvements in its mobile order-and-pay system that are easing some of its woes from the previous quarter.""I have never been more confident that the comp growth that we have seen in the first half of the year, over time, beginning in the second half of the year and beyond, will be a distant memory,"" said Howard Schultz, who is now focusing on Starbucks' premium format concepts after stepping down as chief executive and handing the role to Johnson.And Starbucks might be cooking up more social-media-friendly drinks amid concerns over slowing growth in its key U.S. market.

379,MCD,"XWall Street on Wednesday managed to safely digest Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) after the company's earnings report late Tuesday.Chipotle reported better-than-expected earnings and sales. But the fast-casual chain's payment-processing network got hacked. Then again, it's testing two new desserts this month.So, as the once-trendy eatery tries to regain customers who might have fled following a well-publicized foodborne illness scare in 2015, should you, perhaps, consider buying Chipotle again?Shares sank through 2016 but have trended up this year, breaking out of a base above the 200-day moving average in late March. Shares rose 2.4% to 482.99 in the stock market today, hitting a 13-month high of 497.48 intraday.That comes as several other restaurant stocks have been breaking out of consolidations, including burger chains McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN) and, briefly, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR).CEO Steve Ells said in Chipotle's earnings release that ""2017 is off to a strong start."" And during the company's earnings call he attributed that strength to simpler operations, staff-training efforts, more-aggressive marketing, improvements in digital ordering, and ""a continued focus on serving safe, wholesome and delicious food.""Here's a look at analysts who strongly agree with that sentiment, cautiously agree or are still holding out.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan has said Chipotle's recovery is a matter of "" 'when,' not 'if,' "" — a position she repeated in a research note following the company's report, adding that the company's marketing efforts should help.But she also cautioned investors to ""remain patient"" about owning its shares, and to look for whether the company could now put together a string of quarterly improvements. She kept her ""overweight"" rating on the stock but upped her price target from $483 to $530.SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett offered a similar sentiment, calling the turnaround ""as real as it gets."" He said the chain's new TV advertising effort, along with the increasing digital orders and an expansion in delivery tests, could also benefit the company.Bartlett also raised his price target to $550 from $500. He has a buy rating on Chipotle and said he believes that any impact from the data breach would be ""insignificant."" Management said an investigation was focusing on ""current transactions in our restaurants that occurred from March 24, 2017, through April 18, 2017.""Bartlett and other analysts noted that Wendy's suffered a credit card breach last year that did minimal financial damage. But RBC analyst David Palmer, in a research note, said the hack might make consumers more wary about placing digital orders.Palmer also said that it was unclear, based on management's comments during the earnings call, how much advertising and digital efforts would help the company. He said further that while margin oversight got better, labor and food costs could creep higher in the quarters to come. He downgraded Chipotle to sector perform from outperform.During the call, management said those costs rose after bringing the preparation of items like lettuce and bell peppers back into restaurants. Incentive-based bonuses for managers who made customer experience better, as well as inflation, could offset sales increases and the company's other efforts to keep labor costs in check, management added. And while food costs as a percentage of sales improved during the quarter, an avocado shortage won't help.BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, who stuck with his neutral rating on Chipotle, said weak sales on the West Coast and in the Northeast were signs that ""recovery remains anemic.""Analysts were also concerned about what appeared to be weaker two-year sales trends. Cowen's Andrew Charles also said its analysis ""suggests underlying sales are challenged so far in April despite an effective 1% price increase.""""We remain cautious on the cadence of the sales turnaround but acknowledge with cost savings experienced in 1Q, CMG could be setting up to beat on margins, leading us to reiterate our Market Perform rating,"" he continued.Some analysts were also cautious on the company's valuation compared to results.""While we expect positive (same-store sales) to continue over the next few quarters given easy laps, we believe the current valuation reflects a high degree of optimism and leaves little room for error,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier, who nonetheless raised her price target on the stock to $440 to $375.Others say that skepticism is unwarranted.""At base, we believe the bears are wrong about the explanation for the slow pace of CMG's recovery, which is being incorrectly attributed to increased competition,"" Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis said. ""Our alternate narrative is that CMG's food safety incident occurred in a world of social media which massively amplified the effect. This has elongated the impact and delayed the recovery.""Analyst sentiment remains much more positive on McDonald's, which was lavished with price hikes after its first-quarter results topped analyst estimates. McDonald's fell 0.6% to 140.84 Wednesday, snapping a seven-day win streak. McDonald's soared 5.6% on Tuesday to a record high on its earnings.But Wall Street isn't as thrilled with Restaurant Brands International, whose shares sank 3.1% to 56.66 after the Burger King and Tim Hortons parent beat on the top and bottom lines but reported a surprise dip in same-store sales. Restaurant Brands fell back below a 58.08 buy point after edging past it on Tuesday. But the stock rebounded from an intraday of 54, rallying back above its 50-day line.Wendy's rose 0.1% to 14.78, still in range from a 14.57 buy point cleared Monday.As for Chipotle's desserts, one of the items being tested is bunuelos — fried tortilla strips with honey, cinnamon and sugar, management said. The dish will be served with an apple caramel butter dipping sauce.RELATED:Is It Time To Talk To Your Barista?

Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout.

Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated.

Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

381,MCD,"Amid the blue-and-pink haze that is the aftermath of the Unicorn Frappuccino, let's not forget that Starbucks (SBUX) reports second-quarter earnings and sales late Thursday.For the quarter, the java giant is expected to record 15% profit growth to 45 cents a share on revenue gains of 8% to $5.41 billion.Shares rose 1 cent to 61.12 in afternoon trade in the stock market today after falling as low as 59.92 intraday. The stock dipped fractionally Monday, breaking a six-session win streak that helped it clear a 59.64 buy point from a flat base on Thursday.The stock hit a one-year high that day following an upgrade to buy from hold with a 67 price target from Stifel, in which analyst Mark Astrachan sees U.S. same-store sales — a key metric — to accelerate ""at least 5%-6%"" over the next four quarters starting in June. He projects mid-single digit global comps. U.S. comps growth has been sluggish in recent quarters.Street analysts largely sound positive on Starbucks' rewards program, mobile order-and-pay technology and food and beverage offerings.""Recently, the shares have found life as optimism has increased that comps will reaccelerate in the second half against easier comparisons and as the company introduces new beverage and upgraded food items and takes incremental price,"" wrote Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis on Monday. But he expressed concern over the ""soft start"" to the year, among other factors, impacting guidance.RBC analyst David Palmer estimates that the U.S. segment should pull in 3% comps for Q2, which would be the same from the prior quarter. Wedbush is projecting the same, noting that consensus is currently for 3.5% in U.S. comps.The American market is increasingly saturated, and competition lurks not just from other coffee shops but from fast-food heavyweights such as McDonald's (MCD), which came out ahead of forecasts Tuesday morning with positive U.S. same-store sales. The chain's $1 coffee promotion in Q1 helped to cushion results; in the current quarter, McCafe is offering certain drinks for $2.Palmer sees a few sales trends to spur growth this year, including Starbucks' launch of ""suggestive selling and increased personalized marketing,"" easy comparisons, new cold drink and fresh-food offerings and the launch of a Chase Visa debit card that has My Starbucks Rewards. He maintains an outperform rating and 66 price target on the stock.Thursday's call will be the first under new Chief Executive Kevin Johnson. He succeeds Howard Schultz, who will focus on Starbucks' premium offerings as chairman.Expect to hear more about Starbucks' expansion in China — the market with the greatest opportunity for growth — the company's mobile technology advancements, and presumably, the success of the Unicorn Frappuccino.McDonald's shares rose 5.4% to 141.47, hitting an all-time high intraday as they work on their seventh straight gain. McDonald's is now extended from a 130.10 buy point.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) fell nearly 1% to 55, trying to hold above its 50-day moving average.

382,MCD,"Aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and enterprise software firm ServiceNow (NOW) on Thursday received several price-target increases after their March-quarter earnings reports. Elsewhere, fast-food king McDonald's (MCD) was upgraded, while restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) and weight-loss products company Nutrisystem (NTRI) were downgraded.Cowen reiterated its outperform rating on Boeing and increased its price target to 215 from 195. Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr called Boeing his ""No. 1 pick.""Chicago-based Boeing, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, on Wednesday reported mixed first-quarter financial results. Boeing's core EPS jumped 16% to $2.01, beating analyst views for $1.95. Revenue fell 7% to $21 billion, under views for $21.35 billion.""Q1 results were better than they appear; and commercial execution is improving,"" von Rumohr said in a report.RBC Capital Markets maintained its underperform rating on Boeing, but increased its price target to 146 from 138.Shares rose 0.8% to 183.22 on the stock market today, closing in on a 185.81 buy point.Santa Clara, Calif.-based ServiceNow received at least four stock price-target hikes after delivering beat-and-raise Q1 results late Wednesday.BMO Capital Markets reiterated its outperform rating on ServiceNow and increased its price target to 110 from 104. RBC Capital Markets kept its ""top pick"" rating on the cloud software developer and upped its price target to 110 from 108.

On Wednesday, Telsey raised its price target on burger chain McDonald's to 150 from 140 and reiterated its outperform rating.On Tuesday, McDonald's beat Wall Street's consensus estimates for Q1 sales and earnings, helped by its nationwide $1 coffee promotion and new Big Mac sizes — the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr.McDonald's stock rose 3 cents to 140.87.Investment bank Baird downgraded Buffalo Wild Wings to neutral from outperform and clipped its price target to 160 from 170.The Minneapolis-based company on Wednesday posted first-quarter sales and earnings that missed Wall Street's consensus estimates.Buffalo Wild Wings stock fell 3.7% to 156.40 but found support at its 50- and 200-day lines.Wunderlich Securities downgraded weight-loss plan provider Nutrisystem to hold with a price target of 160.Fort Washington, Pa.-based Nutrisystem late Wednesday posted better-than-expected Q1 results, but gave mixed Q2 guidance.Nutrisystem stock sank 7.5% to 51.40 Thursday.

383,MCD,"XDomino's Pizza (DPZ) is testing GPS-tracking technology and expects to retain drivers as a broad swath of restaurant chains — from fast-food icon McDonald's (MCD) to fast-casual favorite Panera Bread (PNRA) — explore or ramp up delivery.Just this week, McDonald's said it is expanding its delivery partnership with Uber and will launch home delivery in the U.K. in June. Panera, which is being bought by JAB Holding, said it will hire 10,000 new employees, with about three-quarters of them being delivery drivers.Addressing the growing demand for drivers, Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said during a conference call with analysts that the company's drivers will be ""more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else.""Shares of Domino's were up 2.5% to 185.55 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average on strong quarterly results, but off session highs of 188.85.Rival Papa John's (PZZA), which reports Tuesday, edged up 0.45%, and McDonald's added 3 cents.Domino's Q1 EPS jumped 42% to $1.26, beating Wall Street forecasts by 10 cents, as sales climbed 16% to $624.2 million, above views for $615.85 million. Same-store sales leapt 10.2%.The results come after Domino's stock lost 5.8% on April 7 on a report from M Science that forecast that U.S. first-quarter sales gains would come in ""well below the rough consensus estimate,"" according to CNBC.Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, in a research note before Domino's earnings, had also expressed caution about Domino's sales. He cited what he said appeared to be ""rather robust"" discounting at Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut last month, when the NCAA basketball tournament took place. Slower sales in the U.K. and Australia were also concerns.As other fast-food restaurants fought each other on discounts and cheaper groceries discourage eating out, Domino's last year largely remained above the fray, putting up solid sales and EPS figures.Customers are already used to ordering pizza over the phone, so Domino's mobile ordering platform has worked particularly well as other restaurants try to digitize ordering and the experience inside their locations.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

384,MCD,"XFacebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Paycom (PAYC), Impinj (PI) and Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) hail from different industries, but they all share a common trait. They all have Composite Ratings of at least 95 and are reporting earnings this coming week.Many big stock market winners have had 95+ CRs at the start of their big price moves.The Composite Rating, which goes from 1 to a best-possible 99, is an overall score for a stock that combine other proprietary IBD ratings of fundamental and technical factors. You should never buy a stock simply on ratings. But let's take a look of these five stocks, some of which are close to buy ratings.(Apple also is reporting on Tuesday. Apple has an 80 Composite Rating, reflecting its three-quarter string of declining earnings before a slim gain in its prior quarter. Analysts expect another modest rise in Tuesday's report. But the stock has been the top performer on the Dow Jones industrial average, and is still in buy range from a 141.12 three-weeks-tight pattern. Investors are looking ahead to the iPhone 8 later this year to reignite growth. Many also are hoping for Apple to return more of its huge cash hoard.)Facebook, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating.The stock had risen 29% in 2017 as of Friday.Facebook rose 1.5% to 152.46 on the stock market today, hitting a record high for a fifth straight session. The stock is well extended from any proper buy point.The social networking giant seems to have dealt with upstart Snapchat by cloning many of the Snap (SNAP) unit's most popular features, especially via Facebook's Instagram. Instagram recently topped 700 million users.Analysts expect Facebook to report 45% gains in earnings per share and revenue. That would actually represent the third straight quarter of decelerating growth for both, but it's excellent growth for so a large company with such stellar year-earlier comparisons.Qorvo, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating. It makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple iPhone and other wireless devices.Apple cleared a 64.90 buy point in early February, and didn't clear the 5% chase zone until early April. But Qorvo sank 4.35% to 68.03 on Friday, in more than double normal volume. Technically, the stock is just in buy range, but the high-volume selloff to below its 50-day raises some concerns.Qorvo moved back above the 50-day line on Monday, climbing 0.85% to 68.61.Chip stocks had a tough session Friday, with fellow Apple supplier Skyworks (SWKS) tumbling 4.3% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings late Thursday.Paycom, which reports Tuesday, has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating.Paycom makes cloud-based payroll and human resource software, targeting smaller businesses.Paycom cleared a 53.03 buy point on Feb. 17. Shares hit a record high last week, closing Friday at 60.25, extended from that entry area. So there is no proper buy point currently.Paycom rose 0.9% to 60.77 on Monday.Wall Street expects a 24% EPS gain, with a 28.5% revenue rise. That would mark the fourth straight quarter of decelerating growth for both, but would still be solid advances.Impinj, which reports Thursday, has a 96 Composite Rating.Impinj is a radio frequency ID (RFID) chipmaker and an Internet of Things play.The stock came public in July at 14 a share. The stock is working on the right side of a cup base with a 42.01 buy point.Impinj fell 5.2% to 35.53 after tumbling nearly 4% on Friday. But those losses follow 13 straight gains.Impinj is expect to post a 1-cent adjusted loss with revenue of $30.7 million. Both would represent big improvements from a year earlier.Cheesecake Factory, which reports Wednesday, has a 97 Composite Rating.Some restaurant stocks have been doing well, but mostly fast food, fast casual or pizza chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ). Cheesecake Factory is a rare sit-down restaurant stock that is performing.Cheesecake Factory's stock retook a 64.51 buy point a week ago. But shares dipped 0.9% to 64.16 on Friday, just below the entry, in below-average volume.Cheesecake Factory stock slid 0.6% to 63.80 Monday.Analysts expect a 7% EPS gain, which would end two quarters of acceleration. Sales should rise 3%, which would be the slowest pace in 13 quarters.RELATED:Which Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Which Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest Growing Companies?Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action PlanFacebook Ad Share Gains Touted Before Earnings; Stocks Hit High

386,MCD,"This earnings season, companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's (MCD) have been more candid about mounting global dread, going beyond euphemisms like ""challenging environment,"" as other giants like Apple (AAPL) and General Electric (GE) grapple with China's slowing economy and the Brexit vote.The remarks offer brief insights into management's thinking about an array of issues that have cropped up in earnings conference calls more recently, including the U.S. presidential election, the failed coup in Turkey and its fallout, mass shootings at home, and ISIS-inspired attacks worldwide.The CEOs of McDonald's and Starbucks -- whose sales depend on people going to their restaurants without worrying about their paychecks or safety -- both weighed in on the unease, according to Seeking Alpha transcripts.""I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election,"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said. ""You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so, we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn.""Schultz said conditions were ""quite unusual."" But he also said that the needs which the ubiquitous coffee chain appeals to -- ""the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place, an affordable luxury"" -- would benefit the company overall.While cheaper grocery prices may encourage more people to eat at home, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook said, ""there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge their financial security going forward, you know, whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world.""The company benefits from ""people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations,"" he continued. ""And if people are reining in their (spending) across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well.""That sentiment also lines up with a recent note from KeyBanc Capital Markets, which upgraded Papa John's (PZZA), saying that civil unrest and a heated political environment may keep people at home -- and keep them ordering pizza -- instead of going out.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Papa John's and rival Domino's Pizza cleared buy points recently despite the overall restaurant sector facing a slowdown amid wage pressure and tougher price competition.The Brexit vote also has come up a lot during earnings calls, but its impact is not yet clear, while other global events and the outcome of the U.S. presidential vote are adding another layer of complexity, according to comments gleaned from Seeking Alpha transcripts.Michael DeWalt, a vice president at Caterpillar (CAT), said the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, the upheaval in Turkey and ""all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections"" added to the risks the construction firm was facing.Big banks generally turned out solid second-quarter results, but Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) commented on the ""unique"" course of the U.S. campaigns, which have turned banks into the favorite punching bags of both Democrats and Republicans.Goldman CFO Harvey Schwartz said he felt ""this cycle will have unique aspects to it vs. other presidential cycles,"" but that he didn't foresee any short-term damage.But Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said world tensions could further stall any Federal Reserve interest rate increases. ""While the U.K. has a new leader,"" he said, ""the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign, and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.""McDonald's said Brexit had not significantly affected U.K. demand and that the vote was unlikely to harm commodity prices there in the near term. But the company shaved a few cents off its profit-per-share forecast in part because the vote caused the pound to plummet. Starbucks said Brexit had piled on to already existing worries in Europe.And General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said, ""Brexit is just another point of volatility. It wasn't the outcome we hoped for, but we were plenty ready for that as just another point of volatility.""It's difficult to gauge the state of China's economy through executives' commentary, which came in mixed.Apple CEO Tim Cook remained optimistic. Apple's fiscal Q3 results topped expectations, and iPhone sales were better than expected amid concerns the market was saturated.But while he said that ""switchers and first-time smartphone buyers"" made up most of the company's quarterly iPhone sales in Greater China, he conceded that the region's economy has cooled.""This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year,"" he said. ""Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies.""United Technologies (UTX), a conglomerate that owns the elevator and escalator-maker Otis, offered a glimpse into China's real estate market. Transactions, management said, had picked up some steam, but the gains hadn't translated into more money from elevator sales.""In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices -- particularly in the tier 1 cities -- show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down, and price pressure has increased,"" CFO Akhil Johri said on the company's earnings call.Meanwhile, GE said China was ""getting better."" Starbucks touted its own performance in the region, while McDonald's said comps in China rose.Those gains, McDonald's said, came ""despite a challenging environment.""

387,MCD,"JCPenney (JCP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, providing further evidence that consumer spending isn't as bad as investors had feared.The department store reported a 5 cent per-share loss minus one-time items, narrowing from a 41 cent loss in the same quarter a year earlier, as JCPenney pushed ahead with a reorganization. Analysts expected a 15 cent loss. Revenue grew 1.4% to $2.92 billion, a bit below consensus for $2.93 billion. Comparable-store sales increased 2.2%.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said in a client note after JCPenney earnings that it was ""the only positive comp"" among reporting department stores. Cowen has a market perform rating on JCPenney with a 10 price target.JCPenney Chairman and CEO Marvin Ellison, credited 60 more Sephora store-within-a-store cosmetics and beauty stops, center core refreshes and the rollout of ""buy online, pick up in store same day"" for lifting results. JCPenney stock has climbed 69% since hitting a 2016 low at 6 per share on Jan. 20, including an 8.6% gain Thursday. JCPenney rose 6% to 10.54 in the stock market today, a four-month high.On Thursday, Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) also beat on earnings, providing what Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins called ""rays of hope"" that the struggling retail sector may be bottoming. Macy's skyrocketed 17%, and Kohl's jumped 16% on Thursday, rebounding from recent and longer-term downtrends. On Friday, Macy's rose 2 cents to 39.83, while Kohl's climbed 1.7% to 44.95.Nordstrom (JWN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected profit, but revenue was a bit light. Still, Nordstrom rose 8.1% to 51.40 -- back above its 200-day line -- after soaring 7.5% Thursday.The upbeat reports are seen as part of a relief rally after many consumer-related companies, from General Motors (GM) to Ford (F) to McDonald's (MCD), reported sluggish U.S. demand.IBD'S TAKE: JCPenney shares are climbing the right side of a cup base with a 12.09 entry point. Cup and cup-with-handle bases are among the most common patterns stocks form. For more on how to spot winning bases, see the IBD University.Overall retail sales were flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday. July's total was well under estimates of a 0.4% gain. However, June's gain was revised up to 0.8% from the initial 0.6% reading.
"
388,MCD,"Even with Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day, retail sales were merely flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday.While July's totals came in well below expectations for an overall 0.4% gain, and a 0.2% rise outside the auto sector, the disappointment was softened by an upward revision to June numbers. The overall gain was revised to 0.8% from 0.6%, with sales outside autos rising 0.9%, up from 0.7%.Still, the year-over-year gain in retail sales slowed to 2.3%, which may slightly ding confidence in the strength of the American consumer. While a 2.7% drop in gas station sales held down July spending, consumers didn't put the money to work elsewhere.Non-store retailers continued to stand out, with sales rising 1.3% on the month and 14.1% on the year. That was surely helped by Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from the company's inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.But efforts by Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others to piggyback or cut into Amazon's big day may have fallen flat. General merchandise store sales dipped 0.1%, while department stores saw sales continue to decline, off 0.5% on the month and down 4.0% from a year earlier.Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday, while Nordstrom (JWN) saw a much smaller drop in same-store sales than analysts expected. All three companies saw sales drop from a year earlier. JCPenney (JCP), a relative bright spot, said on Friday that same-store sales rose 2.2% from a year before, about as expected.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to be bought.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) saw sales ease 0.5% after an upwardly revised 4.2% surge in June. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.Sales at food services and drinking places continued to be soft, falling 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%.

389,MCD,"Stocks moved sideways at all-time highs this week, but the week was packed with market-moving news. Alibaba (BABA) broke out as growth accelerated, while Acacia Communications (ACIA) exploded as fiber optic and IPO growth names sparked. Macy's (M) triggered a huge relief rally, and Wal-Mart (WMT) bought Jet.com to better compete vs. Amazon (AMZN). Oil prices rebounded, but solar stocks crashed.After weeks of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hitting all-time highs, the Nasdaq eclipsed its 2015 peak. All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings.

But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

390,MCD,"A new Burger King TV commercial is designed to trigger voice-controlled speakers from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in viewers' homes, adding a wrinkle to the debate over whether such devices have become too invasive.In the 15-second ad, a Burger King employee says, ""OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?""If viewers are watching the commercial near a Google Home gadget, the ""OK Google"" prompt will cause the device to read the Wikipedia entry for the sandwich. The TV spots are airing nationally starting Wednesday on networks such as Spike, MTV and Comedy Central.The commercial extends Burger King's record of trying to push the envelope with its marketing.In 2015, the restaurant chain sought a ""truce"" with rival and Dow component McDonald's (MCD) by offering to create a peace burger called the McWhopper. It also brought back its deliberately creepy King mascot in recent years. The character loomed in the background during the much-hyped boxing match of Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao in 2015.The Google stunt could renew concerns about whether voice-activated technology has unintended consequences. Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo devices and Samsung Electronics Co.'s smart televisions have faced criticism from privacy groups over the extent of the conversations and data that they track. The Echo, which answers to ""Alexa,"" also lets consumers buy products with quick voice commands — creating the potential for accidental orders.Burger King, owned by Restaurant Brands International (QSR), said it's not collaborating with Google on the ads. But the plug could give a boost to a device that is playing catch-up with the Echo. Analysts estimate that Google shipped about 500,000 units in the first quarter after the Home product debuted late last year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite questions over whether Burger King is making the right move by speaking directly to home devices, shares of parent Restaurant Brands International are in high standing. It holds an Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating of 94, good enough for second place among the Retail-Restaurants Group, just behind Dave & Buster's (PLAY).""It's a cool way, and a bold way, to surprise our guests,"" said Jose Cil, president of the Burger King brand. The company believes the interaction will be ""very positive,"" he said.A broader U.S. restaurant slump is forcing restaurant chains like Burger King to vie more fiercely for customers. Some have introduced new menu items and value deals, while others have increased advertising to boost customer traffic.McDonald's began offering $1 and $2 drink specials this month, while Wendy's (WEN) has been remodeling stores and touting its fresh beef.Burger King also rolled out a new version of its chicken sandwich last month, and it enlisted ""haters"" — people who criticized the old sandwich on social media — to market the revamped item.""Burger King has been doing creative, innovative things for a long time,"" Cil said. ""It's something that we feel strongly about.""RELATED:This Dow Stock Is Now In Buy Range, Nears New High As Restaurants RallyPanera Bread Hits New High On Buyout Buzz; Restaurant Stocks Back On Menu

391,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) on Tuesday said it expected foreign-exchange rates to hit earnings per share harder than anticipated this year, partly due to the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union. Meanwhile, its shares tumbled on weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales.CFO Kevin Ozan said on the burger chain's second-quarter earnings call Tuesday that it expected the tougher foreign-exchange environment to shave 2 to 4 cents off third-quarter EPS estimates and 9 to 11 cents off its full-year EPS target. The pound plunged against the dollar following the ""Brexit"" vote, and currencies elsewhere have weakened amid economic anxieties.Still, McDonald's said it had not seen any significant change in demand in the U.K. following the vote, and it did not expect the vote to affect food costs in the near term. McDonald's also said it expected U.S. food costs to ""remain favorable"" and stay relatively flat internationally.The company warned that labor costs were rising in many of its markets. Management also said on the call that the company's sponsorship of the Rio Olympic Games next month would keep third-quarter general and administrative costs higher, but without having much effect on general business trends.The burger chain also reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales on Tuesday.Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. International comps were in line, but U.S. comps rose just 1.8% vs. targets for about 3.2%.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38.Shares of McDonald's fell 4.5% to 121.71 on the stock market today. That undercuts a 124.18 buy point cleared on July 19 and puts the stock just below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant operator, but it's No. 21 in IBD's Retail-Restaurant group. To see how MCD stacks up against the top eateries in objective criteria, go to IBD Stock Checkup.McDonald's said its All Day Breakfast menu and McPick 2 offerings remained strong, but it noted ""softening industry growth."" CEO Steve Easterbrook on the call also discussed a ""broader level of uncertainty"" in consumers' minds, saying that global turmoil and the election season has made diners more cautious.But analysts have been concerned that All Day Breakfast had been doing a bit too much of the hard work in improving sales. SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett said that McDonald's results ""demonstrate that it is not immune to slowing industry trends."" Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said Tuesday that softer comps and higher labor costs mean ""at least 18 months of challenges"" for the restaurant sector.Easterbrook said its planned additions to its All Day Breakfast menu, set for September, would help ""reinforce the baseline momentum"" in the fourth quarter, which could be particularly difficult to lap on a year-over-year basis. The company's launch of All Day Breakfast last October drove sales improvement during that period, after struggling to compete with fast-casual restaurants.But Easterbrook said the company was focused on longer-term sustainability.""We are playing the long game,"" he said on the call, later adding, ""We're not going to manage it by quarter.""Stifel Nicolaus on Tuesday downgraded a slew of restaurant stocks, betting that the U.S. will enter a recession within nine months. Stifel analyst Paul Westra downgraded a number of eateries to hold from buy, including highly rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) and Dave & Buster's (PLAY). Texas Roadhouse plunged 5.9%, but found support intraday around its 50-day line. Dave & Buster's sank 3.4%.Stifel cut Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) to sell from hold. Chipotle was off 2.4%.Not all was awful, however. Easterbrook touted McDonald's recent agreement to incorporate its Japan restaurants into the augmented reality game Pokemon Go, saying McDonald's was ""enjoying what it's doing for our business in Japan."" However, the company would not say whether it planned to expand that arrangement to other markets.

392,MCD,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 indicated little change at Tuesday's opening bell. But Apple (AAPL), Walt Disney (DIS) and McDonald's (MCD), touted by teens in a new survey, are all Dow industrials components that are in or near buy range. Nike (NKE), another Dow stock, may be losing some teen steam.Dow Jones industrial average futures rose a fraction vs. fair value.  So did Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said late Monday that she does not want inflation to ""linger"" above 2%, but didn't seem concerned about short-term moves above the Fed's price target.The Dow industrials, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed with fractional gains Monday after an up-and-down session amid geopolitical concerns and new tax reform doubts. The Dow and S&P 500 have been trending slightly lower since their early March peaks and are currently trying to find support at their 50-day moving averages. The Nasdaq composite, which has moved sideways in recent weeks, is about 1% over its 50-day line. FANG stock Netflix (NFLX) rebounded above that support area Monday after an intraday drop threatened Netflix's first close below that line since late September.Crude oil futures were steady overnight. U.S. crude oil has risen for the past five sessions, their longest win streak of the year. U.S. crude rose 1.6% on Monday to $53.08 a barrel, a one-month high, as Libya's biggest oil field shut down after an unknown group blocked a key pipeline.Savvy investors know to make the trend their friend. So perhaps it's not surprising that Apple, Walt Disney and McDonald's, Dow consumer stocks that are trendy with teens, are also faring well on Wall Street.According to Piper Jaffray's semiannual teen survey, ""81% of teens expect their next phone to be an iPhone,"" a record high. The share of teens (75%) who have an iPhone edge up from last fall.Apple fell 0.1% to 143.17 in Monday stock market trading. Apple, which is on IBD's Leaderboard premium service, is still in range from a 141.12 buy point from a three-weeks-tight base.

McDonald's closed above that entry on April 5. It's traded above the buy point in each of the last three sessions, but hasn't been able to end above it.Nike remains the dominant athletic apparel brand for teens. But there are signs of gradual erosion. Adidas (ADDYY), which has made a big new push into America, is now the No. 1 new brand worn by teenage boys, according to the Piper Jaffray survey.Nike is up in 2017, but it's the Dow's worst performer over the last 12 months. Nike fell 0.4% to 54.90, below its 50-day line.

394,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) first better-burger location, called Tasty Made, will apply its focus on higher-quality ingredients and menu minimalism to the ultracompetitive burger business.The menu for Tasty Made, which will open in Lancaster, Ohio, this fall, will consist only of burgers, fries and milkshakes made from ""high quality ingredients that are grown and raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce them,"" according to company statement.""Early fast food burger restaurants generally had focused menus,"" Steve Ells, Chipotle's co-CEO, said in the statement.""We think there's great strength in that original fast food model and wanted to create a restaurant built around that,"" he added. ""Making only burgers, fries and shakes with really great ingredients, we think we can appeal to peoples' timeless love of burgers, but in a way that is consistent with our long-term vision.""But the opening, and Chipotle's attempts to diversify and tap better-burger nostalgia, would come amid heavy competition among burger chains. Traditional fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) and Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King are likely to compete on value, while better-burger rivals like Shake Shack (SHAK), Habit Restaurants (HABT) and In-N-Out are trying to compete more on quality.Shares of Chipotle finished trading up 1.1% to 430.55 on the stock market today. McDonald's shaved off 6 cents to 119.42, Restaurant Brands rose 1.9% to 44.67, Shake Shack lost 0.3% to 40.22 and Habit climbed 1.9% to 16.44.IBD'S TAKE: While parts of the restaurant sector struggled during the second quarter, companies that have more focus on digital ordering -- like Domino's Pizza, Papa John's and GrubHub -- are up. Compare and contrast restaurant stocks at IBD's Stock Checkup. Reports of Chipotle's interest in opening a burger restaurants first surfaced several months ago. The company has also opened an Asian restaurant and backed a fast-casual pizza restaurant.But sales in the restaurant sector overall also appeared to slow during the second quarter due to aggressive value offerings and consumers' economic uncertainty.Chipotle's plans also come as the company tries to revive sales and customer sentiment following a foodborne-illness outbreak last year. The chain's second-quarter results showed struggles on that front, but its limited-time loyalty program, Chiptopia, has provided some relief on that front.Expanding its menu has also helped. Chipotle recently added chorizo to its menu in some restaurants, with plans to bring the item to all Chipotle locations by the end of the year.Ells noted during the company's earnings call last week that such a move was ""unusual"" for a chain that has kept its menu simple.""But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years,"" he said then.

396,MCD,"Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported better-than-feared second strong quarter earnings, boosting shares of both department store chains and the broader retail sector. Nordstrom (JWN) late Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings.JCPenney (JCP) is queued for early Friday. Retail groups dominated the top-performing industries Thursday on the stock market today.The department stores offered some relief after a procession of consumer-oriented companies -- aside from e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) -- reported sluggish demand, from Ford Motor (F) to McDonald's (MCD), that fueled sector sell-offs often led by department store stocks.Macy's reported a 16% drop in earnings per share minus one-time items to 54 cents, beating estimates for 45 cents. Revenue slid 3.8% to $5.87 billion, the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year declines, but still topping consensus for $5.75 billion.Macy's said overall same-store sales fell 2% vs. a year earlier.The Cincinnati-based company plans to close 100 Macy's full-line locations, or 14%. Most of them will close in early 2017. Coach (COH) said on Tuesday it will shutter some 250 locations -- known as ""doors"" -- or about 25% of the total it has within North America, as part of ""the strategic decision to elevate the Coach brand's positioning.""Macy's said it's still seeing lower-than-normal store spending, but left its full-year guidance intact. The company sees EPS of $3.15-$3.40, with the midpoint slightly above consensus.Kohl's Q2 EPS rose 14% to $1.22, easily topping views for $1.03. Sales fell 2.1% to $4.18 billion, better than the expected $4.16 billion.Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman and CEO, said in a statement, ""Our sales improved over our first-quarter results but were below our expectations."" As a result, the company cut its full-year earnings guidance to $3.80-$4, down from $4.05-$4.25 previously but still above analysts' consensus for $3.83 at the midpoint.Macy's stock spiked 17.1% to 39.81 Thursday, the highest since the beginning of May. Macy's is trading above 200-day line for the first time in a year, as it tries to break a long downtrend.Kohl's rose 16.2% to 44.19. It's still well below below its 2016 high of 52.06, set on Jan. 7.Retails Metrics analyst Ken Perkins said in a report that for Macy's and Kohl's earnings provided ""rays of hope"" as inventories and margins improved. Still, he noted that ""both retailers guided FY16 earnings below the current consensus.""IBD'S TAKE: Traditional department stores such as Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom are getting beaten down by online retailers like Amazon. Giant Wal-Mart is trying to stem the tidy by buying a strong online presence.Retailers are under pressure due to a confluence of negatives. Fashion houses Kate Spade (KATE) and Michael Kors (KORS) noted in their reports that tourists visiting certain key cities have cut back on spending at their stores. The strong dollar is seen as the culprit, making some affordable luxury items too pricey for tourists.Spade and Kors also cited less foot traffic in malls. Consumers continue to opt for online bargains shipped to their home, for free if they're members of a service like Amazon's $99 a year Amazon Prime free shipping and video streaming.Brick-and-mortar retailers may continue to lose share in the crucial holiday buying season, while Amazon and other online retailers continue growing.Nordstrom jumped 7.5% at the close, then spiked after hours after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings. JCPenney climbed 8.6%, with analysts expecting a smaller loss Friday morning.The Commerce Department's July retail sales report, due Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show a 0.4% rise, or a 0.2% increase when excluding autos. There could also be an Amazon Prime Day effect in the data.

402,MCD,"The revival of the GOP push to repeal and replace ObamaCare didn't last long.Negotiations reportedly hit a wall late Tuesday, as concessions to House conservatives repelled more moderate Republicans, leaving no clear way forward.After signals that the House might vote on a revised bill before the end of the week, Republicans are now saying that talks about reviving TrumpCare have been tabled indefinitely.The initial demise of House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act two weeks ago was a negative for markets, raising concern that the rest of President Trump's fiscal agenda might be sidelined. Yet Wall Street appears to have decided that there's nothing to be gained by diving back into the treacherous politics of ObamaCare repeal.Stocks opened higher on Wednesday after ADP reported that private employers added a bigger-than-expected 263,000 jobs last month, and confirmation that TrumpCare has no pulse did nothing to dampen the mood. The Nasdaq composite rose to a record high in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, paced by McDonald's (MCD) and another good day for Caterpillar (CAT).Even as TrumpCare was being put back on ice, there were more signals from the White House that it wants to speed up the timetable for bringing forward an infrastructure bill. Dozens of Republican members of Congress were reportedly briefed on the Trump administration's emerging infrastructure proposal.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market uptrend has been under pressure lately, a signal to investors to be more cautious about buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Will Wednesday's rally give stock investors a green light? Read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's trend.Talks to revise ObamaCare repeal legislation collapsed, even as conservative groups that opposed the initial legislation were ready to climb on board. The Club for Growth put out a statement blaming moderates for balking at language that would let states opt out of ObamaCare regulations requiring guaranteed coverage with the same rate for sick and healthy customers.Hospital and insurer stocks that got hit on Tuesday bounced backed strongly. Tenet Healthcare (THC) rose 4.8%, while Medicaid-focused insurer Centene (CNC) gained 2.8%.RELATED:TrumpCare Is Back: Dow Inches Ahead As Pivot To Tax Cuts Is Put On HoldCaterpillar Lifts Dow With Goldman Push; Trump Readies Infrastructure BillThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

403,MCD,"Almost as soon as Pepsi (PEP) released its ""Jump In"" ad celebrating protest marches, protesters angrily complained that the ad was making light of protests — specifically Black Lives Matter protests — forcing Pepsi to pull the ad and apologize.Pundits immediately blamed the lack of racial diversity on Madison Ave., but it's more likely that the fiasco was the result of a lack of ideological diversity.In the 2-plus minute ad, model Kendall Jenner is in the middle of a photo shoot when a perfectly diverse group of marchers comes by carrying signs with peace symbols or messages like ""join the conversation,"" and dancing to a song with lyrics like ""We are the movement, this generation/You better know who we are, who we are.""At one point, Jenner is encouraged to join the march, and does so by dramatically pulling off her blonde wig and wiping off her lipstick, and somehow changing from a slinky dress into a T-shirt and stylish jeans, where she proceeds to hand a can of Pepsi to a cop, which elicits cheers from everyone. (You can see the ad for yourself on YouTube.)Pepsi issued a mea culpa after pulling the ad, saying it was just ""trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding"" — although the ad was clearly meant to pull at liberal heartstrings of those upset about a certain person being president.In a New York Times piece, advertising copywriter Nathaniel Friedman comments that ""One of the most frequent observations about 'Jump In' is that it rang so hollow that it's amazing no one involved in its creation anticipated this blowback. That's less surprising when you realize that minorities are underrepresented in advertising. For example, one report found that only 5.3% of managers and professionals at agencies in 2008 were black.""Of course, Neither Friedman nor anyone else making this observation knows the racial makeup of the people who put together and approved the Pepsi ad. But we'd bet there were more blacks involved than conservatives.Had there been even one nonliberal in the room, the ad probably never would have seen the light of day, because conservatives would have warned Pepsi that trying to overtly appeal to liberals — as this ad so clumsily does — almost always backfires, either infuriating liberals themselves or fueling endless calls for more appeasement.As the National Center for Public Policy Research's Justin Danhof once noted: ""Corporations that cave to the left only place a bigger target on their backs.""Some examples to show that Danhof has it right:In fact, a Fortune survey found that Wal-Mart is the company liberals say is the worst one for American and that they would most like to shut down.Making overt left-wing appeals not only tends to backfire with its target audience, it can easily antagonize those who aren't liberal. When Target (TGT) decided to change its bathroom policy to please the LGBT crowd, its sales tanked.After Kellogg (K) pulled its ads from Breitbart in November because it wasn't in line with the cereal maker's ""values,"" Breitbart mounted a boycott, which Kellogg said had no impact, although its stock price underperformed its main competitors for months after. Plus, weeks after pulling its ads, Amnesty International released a report saying that Kellogg, along with other food companies, had been getting palm oil from plantations ""where there are severe labor rights abuses,"" such as the use of child labor. Values, anyone?Corporate executives would do well to remember that — like tic-tac-toe and global thermonuclear war — the only way to win at the political appeasement game is not to play at all.RELATED:Corporate Execs Play Politics At Their Company's PerilWhy Are 'Progressives' Fighting Against Uber and Airbnb?Liberal Attacks On Restaurant Giants Punish Minority-Owned Franchises

404,MCD,"Just how strong is the U.S. consumer and what did Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day mean for the broad retail sector last month?Those are two big questions going into Friday's retail sales report from the Commerce Department to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.After a solid 0.6% rise in June, economists expect to see continued momentum, with overall sales rising 0.4% amid an uptick in auto sales from June levels. Yet, thanks partly to lower gas prices, sales excluding autos are expected to rise just 0.1%.But the latest signal on consumer spending offers a hint of possible upside in the retail report. Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday when they reported earnings for the quarter ended July. But Macy's and Kohl's did report lower sales vs. a year earlier.A host of retailers, including Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), offered bargains and free shipping in the week of Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from its inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to buy.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Nonstore retailers (largely e-commerce) have been by far the strongest retail category, with sales up 14.2% from a year ago in June.With low mortgage rates, building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) likely stayed on a roll after June sales jumped 3.9% from May and 7.6% from a year ago. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.All signs, though, point to continued softness in sales at food services and drinking places after a 0.3% decline in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%. 
"
405,MCD,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. The S&P 500 hitting a new record high Friday but closed the week down fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion. The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in mid-September.Apple stock rose 5.6% for the week, just retaking its 200-day line.Amazon Q2 EPS of $1.78 shattered the estimate of $1.11. Revenue rose 30% to 30.4 billion. Amazon Web Services continued to boom. Revenue guidance for Q3 also was strong, though operating income may be light.Amazon stock rose 1.9% to 758.81 for the week, hitting a record 766 intraday Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is a Leaderboard stock, hitting new highs as growth booms. But it's only rated No. 4 in IBD's Retail-Internet group. To see who's No. 1, go to IBD Stock Checkup. Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59% and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital. ""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.
"
406,MCD,"Since the fall, McDonald's (MCD) sales gains have been carried in large part by All Day Breakfast, and in smaller part by a stronger value offering, as well as some concessions to the rising demand for higher-quality ingredients.But as restaurant-industry sales trends slow and McDonald's approaches some difficult year-over-year comparisons, U.S. same-restaurant sales and any commentary on the future will likely be a focus when the fast-food giant reports Tuesday.Analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings per share of $1.38, up 9.5% from a year earlier. Total sales are seen slipping 3% to $6.3 billion. Same-restaurant sales are expected to rise around 3.3%.McDonald's launched All Day Breakfast in October. The expansion quickly proved a success, with more diners buying breakfast during later hours or tacking on a breakfast item to their lunch or dinner. The company this month said it would add more items to the breakfast menu in September.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's stock is in buy range from a 124.18 entry point. But the dividend giant is rated 17th in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group. To see who the real leaders are, go to IBD's Stock Checkup.But some analysts have worried that cheaper value offerings, while essential for competition, have weighed on restaurant sales during Q2. They also worry that consumer optimism has waned as rising gas prices leave less spending room for eating out and as social, economic and political anxieties escalate.Starbucks (SBUX) said Thursday that weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest are impacting brands everywhere.The strong dollar could also hurt international sales. RBC Capital Markets on Friday cut McDonald's full-year EPS outlook following the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" vote in June.Others suggest that All Day Breakfast may have masked McDonald's struggles elsewhere, and that it will be hard for the company to keep up year-over-year growth in the quarters ahead. In particular, RBC said in a research note Thursday, ""finding the right value message remains a struggle,"" potentially turning off many customers who go to McDonald's because the food is affordable.""The McPick 2 for $5 has been a sales driver, and it has been good for restaurant margins,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote. However, he said, ""the chain continues to wrestle with a 'Dollar Menu hangover' and prices for its premium items that are perhaps too high for perceived quality (e.g., relative to chains such as Chick-fil-A or In N Out).""Many franchisees resisted the Dollar Menu, which McDonald's has since replaced with McPick, complaining that it was difficult to juggle higher labor costs and food items sold for a buck apiece. But Cowen analyst Andrew Charles raised questions about the company's promotion of the McPick during part of the second quarter.""We believe there is risk of a soft Q2 top line ... as MCD paused the heavy value-centric messaging seen in Q1 during April and May,"" Charles said in a research note this week.He added that the company's Monopoly promotion, as well as its promotional efforts tied to ""The Angry Birds Movie,"" ""did not allow the brand to emphasize value as much as the soft industry backdrop demanded."" He said the company stepped up promotion for the McPick in June.On the quality front, McDonald's during the quarter said it would test fresh hamburger patties in the Dallas region.In a Nomura survey of a handful of franchisees published this week, some suggested the fresh-patty test would help consumer perception. Others, however, warned it wouldn't necessarily drive sales, while raising a host of food-prep and safety issues. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is still struggling to rebound from foodborne illness scares last year, and its Q2 results missed estimates Thursday.""We are the lightning rod,"" one McDonald's franchisee said. ""Chipotle will be a walk in the park if we have an incident.""McDonald's stock fell 0.7% to 127.40 on the stock market today. McDonald's is still above a 124.18 buy point in a double-bottom base. The W-shaped consolidation is a bullish pattern.

Apple (AAPL), Panera Bread (PNRA) and U.S. Steel (X) are a few names due to report in a busy after-hours session.McDonald's dropped 3% at the open after its second-quarter earnings bested analyst estimates, but revenue just missed and same-store-sales were far short of consensus views. McDonald's is in the 12th week of a cup base -- which eventually could lead to a breakout of the stock -- started after shares notched a record high in May.Texas Instruments (TXN) bolted 7% after a strong second-quarter beat.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 4% at the open.  The casino owner reported its first year-over-year revenue gain for Sands China in two years, buoying speculation that the Chinese gambling hub of Macau may be showing signs of revival and overshadowing otherwise weak second-quarter results.Israel-based Mobileye (MBLY) opened down 10% and is currently off 8.5%. The maker of camera-based autopilot technologies for cars rose briefly in premarket trading after reporting strong second-quarter results. But Mobileye Chief Technology Officer Amnon Shashua said during the company's quarterly conference call with analysts that Mobileye's relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) would not go further than the EyeQ3 processor currently used in Tesla models.

409,MCD,"The stock market was at session lows in afternoon trading Friday unti President Trump pledged a ""massive tax cut"" package will be released next week. Meanwhile, some major stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) and General Electric (GE) made significant moves.The Dow Jones industrial average was back to break-even, as Microsoft led with a 1.4% jump, hitting a new high in heavy trading, retaking a 66.01 flat base entry. The software giant reports earnings Thursday, and some analysts are expecting a big quarter. But GE remained a drag, down 2% after its earnings report in unusually heavy volume.The S&P 500 was off 0.2% and the Nasdaq down 0.1%. Volume was higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq. A sharp drop at 1 p.m. ET sent indexes to deeper lows. With today's losses, the S&P 500 has been frustrated in a new attempt to establish itself above the important 50-day moving average.Meat products, trucking, fiber optics and utilities were the top-performing industry groups. Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) soared nearly 9% in big volume after an analyst upgrade. The Dow utilities, often a defensive choice for investors, was up 0.7%. Energy, generic drugs and some computer groups were down.Bojangles (BOJA) just topped the 20.95 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, but volume was a bit below average. Still, the restaurants industry group has been trending higher and has provided a few opportunities. Starbucks (SBUX) broke out Thursday. Dow component McDonald's (MCD) is in buy range from its 130.10 buy point.Restaurant Brands (QSR) and Wendy's (WEN) are forming bases and have decent IBD Composite Ratings. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also is basing and Guggenheim started covering the stock with a buy rating Friday.Still, it's a tough market for restaurants in general, with many weak charts. This is what Nomura had to say about the industry on Monday: ""U.S. chain restaurant same-store sales appear to have been fairly lackluster overall, with tough comparisons being lapped year over year and a skittish consumer being among some of the factors behind this trend. On a month-by-month basis, January 2017 same-store sales were likely better than those of February and March. Comparisons for the industry ease somewhat starting with April.""RELATED:These 2 Industrial Bellwethers Topped Earnings, 1 Hit A Buy Point

410,MCD,"XU.S. stock indexes reverted to their indefinite trend on Friday, as small losses followed Thursday's big gains. The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. Volume fell on both major exchanges. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.3%.

"
411,MCD,"Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component McDonald's (MCD) cleared a buy point Wednesday, as several other restaurant stocks closed in on their own entries amid JAB's $7.5 billion buyout of Panera Bread (PNRA).The takeover of the fast-casual chain was the latest in the restaurant sector in the last few months. Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) announced last week the acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million in cash. And Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which also owns Tim Hortons, said in late February that it would acquire Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen for around $1.8 billion.Shares of McDonald's closed 0.9% higher at 130.41 on the stock market today, topping a 130.10 buy point, bucking the Dow index's 0.2% retreat, and getting closer to its all-time high of 131.96, reached in May of last year.McDonald's stock had formed a nearly yearlong cup-with-handle base, with shares rising steadily in 2017 as the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day line in mid-January, which is generally a bullish technical indicator.Shares of the Big Mac maker also got a bit of a boost after announcing last week that it will offer fresh-beef Quarter Pounders, served cooked to order.IBD'S TAKE: Can a ""golden cross"" be your ticket to profits? When a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, it can be positive confirmation of an uptrend. (Though it isn't mentioned often in IBD ""because it tends to be late compared to most of our buying rules,"" says markets writer Justin Nielsen. Restaurant Brands rose 0.5% to 56.06, working its way through a flat base with a 58.08 buy point. Jack in the Box (JACK) ended flat at 101.68 vs. a 113.40 buy point, and Wendy's (WEN) rose 1.2% to 13.53, nearing its 14.57 entry.Meanwhile, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) dipped 0.1% to 63.42, below a 64.51 buy point, and Habit Restaurants (HABT) ended unchanged at 17.45, near an 18.10 entry. Shake Shack (SHAK) fell 2.1%, and BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) was flat.
"
412,MCD,"JAB, which owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea, agreed to buy Panera Bread (PNRA) Wednesday for $7.5 billion, including debt, as competition in the coffee space heats up.X Luxembourg-based JAB will pay $315 per share for the fast-casual bakery, shares of which had shot higher in recent weeks amid takeover talk. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.Panera shares jumped 14.2% to close at 312.94 on the stock market today.JAB also has a joint venture with D.E. Master Blenders 1753 and Mondelez International (MDLZ).But JAB may be looking to reduce its exposure to the coffee business as competition intensifies.Java leader Starbucks (SBUX), for example, has seen its share of foot traffic fall to 11% in February from 12% in January, according marketing firm xAd.Meanwhile, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) has stepped up its offerings, and McDonald's (MCD) is selling $2 McCafe drinks and $1 sodas all this month.But outside coffee, JAB has stakes in beauty brand Coty and luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo. And earlier this week, JAB announced a deal to license Burberry Group beauty brands.McDonald's shares closed up 0.9% at 130.41 Wednesday, breaking out from its 130.10 buy point in a cup with handle base. Dunkin' fell 3%, and Starbucks dipped 0.2% to 58.22, but still near its own buy point of 59.64.RELATED: Dave & Buster's Guides Light After Q4 Beats; Ollie's Tops, Guides HighHappy Meals On Wheels: McDonald's Touts '3-Mile' Delivery Advantage

413,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) said Thursday it will serve fresh-beef Quarter Pounders, cooked when ordered, in most of its restaurants by the middle of next year, marking the latest move the company has made to keep apace in an industry migrating toward fresher ingredients and mobile technology.The decision follows the chain's plans announced earlier this month to launch a mobile order and pay system. The company is also testing food delivery and plans to expand the number of restaurants that offer table service and self-ordering kiosks.McDonald's shares rose 0.4% to 129.32 on the stock market today, trading just below a 130.10 buy point all month. McDonald's hit an all-time high of 131.96 last May.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) dipped 0.4% to 55.96 but still near a 58.08 entry. Jack in the Box (JACK) edged up 0.8%, and Wendy's (WEN) added 0.7%.As fast-casual dining from Chipotle Mexican Grill (GMG) and others chipped away at sales of fast food's old guard a few years ago, McDonald's in 2015 began a massive turnaround effort that included restructuring the company and refranchising more restaurants, a move that helps shift costs onto independent owners. All-Day Breakfast and other menu items reawakened sales near the end of that year.The company has also pledged to use only cage-free eggs by 2025, and it eliminated artificial preservatives and high-fructose corn syrup from some items while vowing to serve chicken that didn't have antibiotics needed in human medicine.On Thursday, CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement that ""we are committed to transforming more aspects of our business, including offering a more modern and enjoyable dining experience, adding new levels of convenience and technology, and making more positive changes to the food we serve.""IBD'S TAKE: Smartphones and voice-controlled devices are likely to play a greater roll in the way people order out. Here's Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle's take on where the industry is headed. The fresh-cooked Quarter Pounders were tested in more than 400 restaurants across the Dallas-Fort Worth region and in Tulsa, Okla. McDonald's first said that it was testing fresh hamburger patties in May.The company said the tests received ""overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers and employees"" and were ""driven by the Franchisees, our region and insights from what our customers are asking for when they visit McDonald's.""But offering freshly cooked hamburgers could mean big adjustments to the way restaurants operate. Margins could also become more of a concern due to the costs of managing fresh food.While fresh Quarter Pounders would mark a move toward the high end, McDonald's has also stepped up its value offerings, including a cheaper coffee promotion and a promotion for $1 sodas and $2 McCafe that starts next month.Chipotle shares rose 2.3% to 444.24, clearing a short flat base to their best level since early June.RELATED:Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsJack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery Customer 
"
414,MCD,"President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday named Andy Puzder, who runs the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast-food chains as CEO of CKE Restaurants, to lead the Department of Labor.The nomination puts a friend to the fast-food industry and outspoken opponent of big minimum-wage hikes, the ObamaCare employer mandate and the court-blocked overtime rule in a key policy position.Puzder's nomination underscores just how big of a deal Trump's election was for McDonald's (MCD), the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain, Wendy's (WEN) and the rest of the industry that's been under pressure amid record fast-food price inflation vs. the cost of eating at home.A central reason for those struggles is the upward pressure on labor compensation, Puzder argued in a September Op-Ed, noting that restaurants are much more labor-intensive than grocery stores, with relative labor costs of roughly 30% and 14% of sales, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Despite positive political news, shares of McDonald's are in the middle of a seven-month consolidation zone. But Restaurant Brands International just cleared a buy point on Thursday. Check it out at IBD Stock Checkup and visit IBD University for a primer on timing stock buys.In that column, Puzder issued a warning about the overtime rule that was set to take effect on Dec. 1, more than doubling the salary threshold to $47,476 below which workers must be paid time and a half for work beyond 40 hours per week. A federal judge later granted an injunction to 21 states and business groups that sued to block it from taking effect.""To remain competitive, restaurants will need to reduce labor costs by eliminating positions, reducing employee hours, accelerating automation and slowing expansion"" Puzder wrote. ""Yet another government mandate will only make this already difficult situation even worse.""Advocacy groups on the political left were distressed over Puzler's appointment and circulated a quote of his to Business Insider about the benefits of using robots to operate restaurants: ""They're always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.""Still, the results of November's election weren't a clean sweep for the fast-food industry. Arizona, Colorado and Maine voted to raise their minimum wage to $12 an hour, as Washington state voters approved a $13.50 minimum wage, all by 2020.Puzder also has been a big critic of the ObamaCare employer mandate, requiring businesses to offer coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week or pay a fine. The rule didn't lead to the explosion in part-time work that Puzder and other critics expected, but that's because ObamaCare rules made it relatively easy to evade the mandate.Puzder wrote in 2015 that just 420 of 5,453 full-time workers offered a $5,500-deductible plan were willing to pay the $1,116 premium.Stymied in its push for a big minimum wage hike, the Obama administration essentially took a backdoor route to achieving its goal. The National Labor Relations Board's push to upend McDonald's franchising model by labeling the fast-food giant a joint-employer of franchisee workers could have eventually forced the Golden Arches to the bargaining table with workers of restaurants operated by independent franchisees.While the NLRB's legal battle against McDonald's may not end immediately, there's now little doubt about the eventual outcome, once Trump's appointments are in place. The NLRB board currently has just three members, including one Republican, with two vacancies to be filled by Trump.The NLRB's ""expansive view of 'joint employers,' including franchisors ... will go out the window"" after Trump's victory, wrote Rob Rickman, an employment lawyer at Kane Russell Coleman & Logan, in a postelection analysis.While Puzder's views will face loud criticism from the left, his warnings may turn out to be prescient. Last month, McDonald's announced the nationwide rollout of self-pay kiosks, a step which Wendy's took earlier this year.RELATED:Can McDonald's, Other Quick-Service Franchises Digest $15 Minimum Wage?McDonald's Plans Its Own Brexit From EU; Amazon Probe OngoingFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperLiberal Attacks On Restaurant Giants Punish Minority-Owned FranchisesObamaCare Employer Mandate Is Worse Than Feared

415,MCD,"Stocks were mixed in early afternoon trading Tuesday as investors weighed generally positive economic data against some high-profile earnings misses.McDonald's (MCD) led restaurant stocks lower, while gunmaker Smith & Wesson (SWHC) broke out past a buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%, the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq was up 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was tracking higher on both the NYSE and Nasdaq compared to Monday.Smith & Wesson was a bright spot, however, rising 2% and clearing a 29.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume. The stock's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- indicates strong demand for the shares.The move up came after Smith & Wesson announced plans to buy Crimson Trace, a maker of laser sighting systems, for $95 million.IBD'S TAKE:  To find out how Smith & Wesson stacks up against rivals in the safety & security industry, see IBD's Stock Checkup feature.Restaurant stocks were among the worst performers. McDonald's led the Dow lower, sinking more than 4% in heavy turnover and slicing through its 50-day moving average.McDonald's said Tuesday that Q2 profit rose 12% to $1.45 a share, beating Wall Street forecasts. Sales dipped 4% to $6.3 billion, slightly below views. But the burger chain's same-store sales trailed analyst estimates.Meanwhile, Stifel Nicolaus downgraded several restaurant stocks to hold from buy on fears of a looming recession.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) plunged 6%, pulling back into buying range from a 45.01 flat-base entry.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) lost 5% and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) lost 2%.Meanwhile, managed care stock Centene (CNC) led the IBD 50 lower, diving 10% despite a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.The company said it won't bid for businesses that larger insurers plan to auction off as the industry consolidates.Economic data were generally positive as the Federal Reserve kicked off a two-day meeting Tuesday. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady amid concerns about the global economic outlook.Sales of new homes rose 3.5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000, the highest level since February 2008.Meanwhile, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence dipped 0.1 point to 97.3, still better than expected.
"
416,MCD,"Stocks erased early gains to turn lower Tuesday morning as Dow component McDonald's (MCD) reported weak domestic sales, with investors looking ahead to Apple (AAPL) earnings due out after the close.The Nasdaq fell 0.2%, the S&P 500 0.3% and the Dow 0.5%. Volume was tracking higher than at the same time Monday on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq exchanges in the stock market today.Crude oil prices fell about 1% to $42.73 a barrel, continuing a recent slide. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were testing support at their 50-day moving averages.McDonald's reported U.S. same-store growth below forecasts. The stock gapped down and was trading down 4.5% to 121.68. McDonald's had recently cleared a 124.18 buy point in a double-bottom base, but is now back below that entry area. The stock is also below its 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Apple fell 0.5% to 96.88 intraday, back below its 50-day moving average. Apple has been a laggard. EPS is expected to fall 25% when it reports after the close today.IBD'S TAKE: Apple was once a dynamic market leader. Now, it underperforms. See the tale of the tape at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among six Dow components that reported early Tuesday, Caterpillar (CAT) rose nearly 2% after posting earnings of $1.09 a share compared to $1.27 a year earlier, but better than the consensus estimate of 96 cents.3M (MMM) beat and raised guidance and was down nearly 2%. United Technologies (UTX) rose 2% after reporting its results. DuPont (DD) gained less than 1% after its report as it broke out of a cup-with-handle base. And Verizon (VZ) fell nearly 2% on its own report.
"
417,MCD,"Stocks sagged early Tuesday and then moved sideways in afternoon action.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 lost 0.4% and 0.25%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average was fractionally higher. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE.Blue chips were mostly down in the Dow, but McDonald's (MCD) led the upside with a 2.2% gain, though initial brisk volume has faded to average trade. McDonald's on Friday began putting Pokemon toys in Happy Meals, Bloomberg News recently reported. Nintendo's (NTDOY) Pokemon Go mobile game has become a craze.McDonald's stock cleared a double-bottom base Tuesday morning. A double-bottom base is a bullish pattern shaped like a W. The middle peak plus 10 cents becomes the buy point, which in McDonald's case makes for an entry at 124.18. The middle peak is just barely high enough to be a valid base.McDonald's is 4% off a new high. The company is due to release second-quarter results July 26.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) thrust nearly 3% up to a new 52-week high. Silicon Motion provides computer memory products called Nand flash controllers.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, paper products showed the best gain for the day, and computer hardware peripherals the worst action.In economic news, housing starts for June rolled in at 1.189 million, almost 2% better than expected. However, homebuilder stocks showed little reaction. D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest stock in the homebuilder group by market cap, stepped sideways in quiet volume. The stock is barely in the 5% buy range from a July 6 breakout. D.R. Horton reports quarterly earnings on Thursday.

419,MCD,"The Pokemon Go craze may have died down, but it's about to get a big jolt of caffeine — and a new Frappuccino drink — from Starbucks (SBUX).Multiple sites dedicated to the game have posted promotional materials for a nationwide partnership set to launch on Thursday, Dec. 8. A Starbucks spokesperson responded to a press inquiry saying that ""Starbucks has nothing to share at this time."" Still, the timing and nature of the marketing blitz leave little doubt that it is for real.The promotional materials marked ""Barista Need-To-Know"" offer some tasty details, hinting that Pokemon Go creator Niantic will be releasing new specimens of Pokemon into the wild to lure customers into Starbucks. Niantic developed the game in collaboration with the Pokemon Company, of which Nintendo (NTDOY) owns about a one-third stake.Shares of Starbucks ticked down 6 cents to close at 57.44 on the stock market today, while Nintendo shares rose 2.4% to 30.65.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks, like the broad Retail-Restaurants industry group, has lagged the market during the Trump rally. But Jack In The Box, IBD's No. 1 stock in the sector, broke out to a record high on Nov. 22. Keep an eye on Dave & Busters, the No. 2 ranked stock, which is set to report earnings after the close on Tuesday.The vast majority of U.S. company-operated Starbucks will host either a PokeStop, where players of the app can collect items needed in the game, or a Gym, where players battle to win bragging rights and PokeCoins, according to the leaked materials.Starbucks explained to its baristas that it expects participation in the game to ""encourage more customers to visit your store and increase number of transactions.""Team members also are instructed: ""When players come to visit, encourage them to purchase the new Pokemon Go Frappuccino.""The new Frap, flavored with vanilla, blackberry and raspberry, will be available as long as supplies last.Websites devoted to Pokemon Go speculate that the launch of the Starbucks promotion may be accompanied by the release of as many as 100 long-awaited Pokemon into the wild, with the goal being to catch them all.Niantic recently transformed the tracker that players use to find Pokemon in a way that will contribute to the success of the marketing promotion. Previously, players would see Pikachu and any other nearby Pokemon in their tracker, but now players can only see what Pokemon are hanging out at PokeStops. In other words, game players looking for new creatures will be led directly to a Starbucks, and a hot drink may seem like a good idea on a cold December day.Pokemon Go already has a partnership with McDonald's (MCD) Japan.Starbucks is set to hold its investor day on Wednesday, so expect to hear more about its Pokemon partnership then.RELATED:'Pokemon Go' Still Raking In $2 Million A DayWhat To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?Pokemon Go Explains Why Economic Growth Is So Sluggish
"
420,MCD,"Apple (AAPL) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) may face a tough battle in disputes over European Union demands for back taxes after the bloc's top court partly backed regulators' attempt to force Spanish firms to repay millions of dollars in tax breaks.In a ruling that could ultimately add impetus to the region's clampdown on special tax treatment for selected companies, judges at the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said a lower tribunal should re-examine a Spanish system that gave tax breaks to companies, including Banco Santander (BSBR), for the acquisition of stakes in foreign firms. Those tax advantages must now be repaid, the EU said in a statement.The EU General Court was wrong to rule that the European Commission failed to show that a group of companies was singled out by the program, which granted deductions for shareholdings in foreign firms, the top judges said Wednesday. Regulators don't always have to show that only certain companies benefit from the aid, the court said.""This is a landmark decision because it clarifies the rules of the game,"" said Raymond H.C. Luja, professor of comparative tax law at Maastricht University in The Netherlands. ""That will also have its effect on a number of ongoing cases.""Europe's crusade against unfair tax treatment has led EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to order Apple to pay a record $13.6 billion in back taxes because of arrangements with Ireland that she says weren't open to others. Belgium was also told to claw back roughly $730 million in tax advantages granted to companies, including AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer.""The judgment is important because it confirms that a measure may be selective, if it benefits only those companies that carry out certain transactions,"" the commission said in an emailed statement. ""The fact that the conditions that a company needed to fulfill were not strict and the benefits were therefore available to many companies does not call into question the selective nature.""Action has now moved to the courts with Apple filing its legal challenge this week, joining Starbucks (SBUX), a Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) unit and more than a dozen Belgian-based companies calling on judges to halt the EU in its tracks.Amazon.com (AMZN), McDonald's (MCD) and France's Engie are also being probed by regulators over tax deals with Luxembourg.The ruling ""re-establishes the comparability standards, meaning you have to look whether companies in the same legal and factual situation are treated differently, without proper justification,"" Luja said. ""That's the argument the commission is also using in many of the tax-ruling cases.""The court confirmed the principle that companies that are comparable, being in the same factual and legal situation, should be treated the same. But the ruling leaves a key question in the tax probes unanswered, Luja said.""It's not the standard that's the issue, because the court confirmed that,"" Luja said. ""The question in the ongoing tax ruling cases is whether the commission's assumption that a stand-alone company and a group company are comparable, is applicable, and there this decision tells us little.""So-called selectivity — or the notion that a tax break targets only certain companies and excludes others — is ""the key issue"" that links the Santander case with the EU's probes into the tax practices of international companies, said Edoardo Traversa, a professor who specializes in tax law at Belgium's Universite Catholique de Louvain.Apple and other companies can take solace in another ruling on Wednesday, where the EU's top court criticized regulators in a case involving tax benefits to airlines using Germany's Luebeck airport. That judgment said the EU was wrong to determine the tax breaks were unfair to others simply because they were granted only to airlines at that airport.Tax breaks are a subsidy that give some companies an unfair advantage, especially if they plow back their savings into competing against others in industries with price pressures and where margins are razor-thin, the EU's top state aid official said earlier this month. Regulators are ""very much concerned that this is going on"" with Amazon's tax arrangements, he said.Wednesday's ruling focuses on Spanish tax breaks for homegrown firms that allowed them to go on a buying spree abroad. Santander grew from being a provincial lender to become the second-biggest by market value in the euro region with the purchase of banks in the U.K. and the Americas. It built a balance sheet that's as big as Spain's gross national product.Spanish companies including Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), Telefonica and Iberdrola (IBDRY) also aggressively pursued expansion abroad.Spain must now demand the companies repay the tax advantages they received, the EU said. Regulators had agreed to avoid ""actively"" pursuing back-tax demands until the ruling was delivered.The European Commission told Spain in 2009 and 2011 to abolish the tax breaks and recoup tax advantages dating back to December 2007.But that order hit a roadblock two years ago when the EU General Court, the bloc's second-highest tribunal, ruled that the Spanish regime at issue was not selective and doesn't exclude any ""company from taking advantage of it.""Wednesday's ruling says regulators ""properly established the selectivity"" of the tax program because it was restricted to certain companies, undermining one of the key planks of the Spanish firms' arguments against the EU decision. While the case may take years to reach a conclusion, the judgment emboldens the EU in the midst of its war against tax subsidies.

423,MCD,"Starbucks' (SBUX) top bean, Howard Schultz, is relinquishing the position of chief exec come April and will focus on the coffee giant's premium retail efforts as executive chairman. In his stead will be current COO Kevin Johnson, a former Juniper Networks (JNPR) CEO and Microsoft (MSFT) vet who has been with the company since 2009.So what can coffee lovers and investors expect from the changes at the top?Some Wall Street pros mourned the loss of Schultz, who spent most of the last three decades at a company that is now a household name. Synonymous with coffee and often skewered as a yuppie staple, Starbucks has, under his tenure, become a pop cultural icon of middle-class aspiration.""In our coverage, we may not ever again follow a CEO with his combination of merchandising genius, energy, strategic thinking, and inspirational leadership,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog called Schultz ""without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world."" She has an outperform rating on the stock.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks has been a market laggard over the past year. But if you have an appetite for restaurant stocks, here are several eateries that are in or near buy range. Starbucks' advances on the tech front have put it far ahead of restaurant peers. The restaurant has cultivated a solid loyalty program and a mobile payment function that as of the most recently reported quarter accounted for 25% of all transactions.Shares fell 2.2 to 57.21 on the stock market today in response to the CEO shuffle. Starbucks stock has retaken its 200-day moving average recently, but has been lagging the overall market for more than a year.But the leadership transition is not wholly unexpected, and not unwelcome. Herzog says it's been in the works for years.""Importantly Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course,"" she wrote.RBC's Palmer says the shift is occurring ""during a period of strength.""Broadly, analysts don't appear to expect a huge shake-up from the change.And stockwise, the move presents ""more of a buying opportunity than reason to run away,"" headlined a report from Buckingham Research Group analyst John Zolidis, who believes that Schultz will still be very involved in the business and that Johnson is ""well qualified to step into the CEO role.""Other issues, in Zolidis' view, weigh on the stock. He sees a slowdown in U.S. same-store sales and ""modest downside risk to earnings.""Last month, Starbucks reported slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but issued somewhat cautious profit guidance for 2017. The company now seems to be looking to China as an area with the greatest growth opportunities.The stock has been on an upswing since then, however, going into management's investor day coming up on Wednesday.Starbucks in recent years has outpaced competitors at home, including McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN).But Dunkin' Brands earnings growth has picked up in recent quarters, with its Dunkin' Donuts chain expanding in California. Dunkin' Brands shares fell 0.2% to 54.27 on Friday, but are trading at their best levels since August 2015.RELATED:Starbucks' Schultz To Step Down As CEO; No Other Leadership Change SeenStarbucks Mobile Payments Now 25% Of All Transactions; Q4 Beats

424,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) appears to be building the right side of a base as it sails into earnings season. Second-quarter earnings are scheduled for Tuesday, July 26, before the market open. Analysts expect profit of $1.39 a share, a 10% increase from a year earlier, despite a 3% drop in sales to $6.28 billion. A favorable reaction to McDonald's move to…

425,MCD,"A scruffy, bearded Michael Phelps swims punishing laps alone in a darkened pool as an Edith Piaf-like voice croons ""It's the last goodbye, I swear/I can't rely on a dime-a-day love that don't go anywhere.""Cue a montage of the elite swimmer lifting weights, enduring ice baths and fire-cupping therapy, staring wistfully at a leaf-strewn backyard pool as he contemplates something. Actually, it's pretty obvious what the Olympian -- who just won his 19th gold medal on Sunday -- is contemplating, even if Under Armour (UA) isn't allowed to say it explicitly in its ad.""It's what you do in the dark that puts you in the light,"" flashes on the pitch-black screen. ""Rule yourself.""Expect to see that commercial a whole lot over the next few weeks, thanks to a change to the International Olympic Committee's Rule 40 that finally allows non-Olympic sponsors to advertise athletes competing in the Games.The much-talked-about policy shift is a big positive for brands who aren't among the 11 official worldwide Olympic sponsors, like McDonald's (MCD), or any of the 28 U.S. sponsors, like Nike (NKE). But it could especially benefit Under Armour's march toward the global stage.Nike, the far-and-away leader in performance gear, still towers over Under Armour. But the littler athletic company's scrappy-underdog brand image and well-chosen endorsement deals have resonated with young people. Of the three major labels -- Nike, Adidas and Under Armour -- Under Armour is the only one that has not sponsored the quadrennial event before. But the new guidelines may mean that it doesn't have to in order to reap the benefits.""The Rule 40 change really gives (Under Armour) an opening to leverage their athletes,"" said analyst Matt Powell of the NPD Group market research company. ""Before, they were really restricted in how much they could actually (do).""Before Rio, Rule 40 meant that only companies that had plunked down major money to call themselves exclusive sponsors -- like Coca-Cola (KO) or Visa (V) -- were allowed to feature their Olympians in ads during the Games.The restriction ostensibly protected sponsor investments, but it also shut out athletes' ability to capitalize on their medal efforts after years of training, causing a kerfuffle at the 2012 London Games. Non-sponsor brands were not even allowed to tweet ""Good luck at the Olympics!"" to their qualifying athletes.They still aren't. But following the loosening of Rule 40, those that have gotten prior approval can now showcase their finest athletes in ""generic advertising,"" so long as the Olympic rings and the Games' associated verbiage -- ""Olympics,"" ""medal,"" even ""2016,"" depending on how it's used -- are nowhere to be found in the marketing material. Companies had to apply for the waiver six months ahead of the Games.Hence, Under Armour's sentimental Olympic-but-not-really-Olympic commercial that heavily alludes to Phelps' last appearance at the international event. Instead of being kept silent at the world's greatest sports stage, the Baltimore-based brand can tweet and post Facebook (FB) messages, and broadcast their heavy hitters from the rooftops.Under Armour's ode to Phelps brought the athlete to tears when he first watched it, a moment conveniently captured on film and posted on the brand's YouTube page. The reaction video has been viewed over half a million times. The ""Rule Yourself"" ad itself has attracted well over 5.8 million views, the company's second most-watched video on the site despite being posted only four months ago.
"
426,MCD,"A similar Olympic-style campaign starring top U.S. gymnasts Madison Kocian, MyKayla Skinner and Maggie Nichols also made the rounds, garnering over 3 million YouTube views in the months before the Games. (Kocian made the Olympic team, and Skinner is an alternate.)""The changes to Rule 40 allow us to fulfill our No. 1 objective, which is to support the nearly 225 Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls tied to the Under Armour brand during the Games,"" an Under Armour spokesperson told IBD via email.And the timing of this effort coincides with Under Armour's push to assert itself not just at home, but abroad.International revenue, as of the company's June-ended second quarter, grew 72% year over year and accounted for 15% of total revenue. That's almost double the 8% of revenue that came from sales abroad just two years ago.""Between Nike and Under Armour, this is a big incremental opportunity for Under Armour and the reason they're being so aggressive,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner told IBD. ""Brazil is a huge market.""The Olympics' host country in particular has been a focus of Under Armour's push to grow its global soccer franchise and sell more cleats, he said. But for all the pomp and hype, the major sporting event only comes around every four years and lasts just two weeks, meaning it's not much of a needle-mover when it comes to stock price or annual revenue.For example, Ralph Lauren (RL), the official outfitter of Team USA, has seen its overall sales fall for four consecutive quarters and is expected to continue suffering declines for the next few years.And while the appeal of Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte in a preppy navy blazer and white pants has not been lost on his fans online, it is unclear whether that will translate into sales for a clothier whose Hamptons aesthetic is increasingly losing relevance on athleisure-dominated sidewalks.For Under Armour, the potential comes from establishing presence.""What it's going to do is allow them to get on conference calls and put together marketing with more confidence that they're one of the top three global brands -- help to solidify some long-term projections by country,"" said Weiner, adding, ""These are the kinds of events where you can drive home the point.""Powell echoed that sentiment, saying that this is an ""important"" Olympics for Under Armour.""But that said, the marketing around the Olympics is not really a visceral kind of marketing,"" but more to show ""that they're authentic and (their) Olympic athletes are performing at a high level.""He said he hasn't really witnessed a case of people watching the Olympics and then hopping aboard the brand train. Still, before the Games had even begun, at least one viewer of the Michael Phelps ""Rule Yourself"" campaign was sold.""I'll buy under armour (sic) just because of this commercial,"" said YouTube commenter Kevin Cass. ""Absolutely one of the best I've ever seen ... Under Armour,....you're the best in my books now. Good luck Michael!!!""As much as Under Armour and others are benefiting from the slight breathing room to Rule 40, the restrictions are still annoying parties on all sides of the equation.Athletes still have to watch what they say.How amazing is this! It's for that thing 😉 I'm doing this summer 😉 in South America 😉 #Rule40 pic.twitter.com/nJ2cQxPlXG— Jade Lally (@JadeLallyT69) July 27, 2016Even waivered sponsors must be careful, lest they face repercussions for accidentally using the trademarked #Rio2016 hashtag or mentioning the Olympics by name on Twitter.

429,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on Thursday emphasized that new efforts to reclaim customers -- including a new menu item and rewards program -- following last year's foodborne illness scares are working, even as the company's second-quarter results missed analyst estimates.The fast-casual chain said that the loyalty program, Chiptopia, has already attracted more than 3.6 million participants since the three-month-long promotion began on July 1, with nearly 30% of all transactions ""engaged in Chiptopia"" since then.The company said those initiatives, combined with a massive marketing effort, had helped to ease same-store sales and transaction declines seen so far this month.""While it has only been a few weeks since Chiptopia launched, we are pleased to see that July sales comp trends have already improved by 200 to 300 basis points, and transaction comp trends have improved by an even greater amount,"" co-CEO Steve Ells said in a statement.But on a conference call later, he characterized Chipotle's sales recovery as ""modest,"" and said the rebound hadn't come as quickly as desired. Management also cautioned that it's still unclear whether the improvement seen this month would last.Shares were down 1.6% late, after spending the past several sessions clinging to the underside of their 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: A menu revamp has been key to McDonald's recent success, after losing customers for years to fast-casual chains like Chipotle.Chipotle has been trying to recover from the 2015 outbreak, which spread to multiple states and sickened dozens. It has spent more money on new safety standards, mobile and direct-mail promotions, and a new menu item to win back customers the outbreak scared away.Ells noted that adding chorizo was ""unusual"" for a company often praised for its pared-down menu. So far, chorizo accounts for 6%-7% of entree sales at restaurants where the item is available, and the company plans to make it nationwide by the end of the year.But menu expansions can be a tough balancing act for restaurants. They can draw different kinds of diners, but too many additions can overwhelm customers and water down a chain's identity. Prior to McDonald's (MCD) sales turnaround last year, many analysts argued that its menu was too cluttered. McDonald's reports second-quarter results on Tuesday.Chipotle's second-quarter earnings per share sank 80% to 87 cents, missing estimates for 93 cents. Revenue fell 16.6% to $998.4 million, below views for $1.05 billion. Same-store sales fell 23.6%, compared to Street forecasts for around a 20% drop.Given the uncertainty over when the company might rebound, Chipotle has been reluctant to forecast profits for the second and third quarters.Chipotle's results come amid what Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said was like to be ""a somewhat volatile 2Q earnings season."" Heavy competitive discounting -- lower food prices have inspired a wave of value offerings -- as well as some bad weather and broader economic uncertainty could hit some restaurant chains.Earlier in the day, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) reported second-quarter results that topped analysts' expectations.Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note that Domino's domestic same-store sales ""likely will end up being the best of any of the 25 largest U.S. restaurant chains for the second quarter.""U.S. sales strength probably came from the company's shift to digital ordering technology, which has gained popularity with pizza lovers, Kalinowski said. Higher ingredient quality, a better marketing program and the company's loyalty program likely also helped, he said.Domino's jumped 5.7%.

430,MCD,"Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) led a rally in bank stocks Friday, as the strong July jobs report raised the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, potentially boosting lenders' net interest margins.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, far above expectations for 185,000, and hiring gains for the prior two months were revised up. The unemployment rate for July remained at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate crept up 0.1 point. The July figures follow strong results in June, after May's data disappointed.Fed funds futures prices indicate the chances of a rate hike at the central bank's September meeting have doubled to 18%.Shares of Bank of America closed up nearly 4% to 15.05 on the stock market today, gapping above their 200-day average for the first time since late December. Citigroup jumped 4.3% to 45.72, touching its 200-day line. JPMorgan rose 2.7% to 66.30. Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.8% to 48.68, retaking its 50-day line. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 2.6% to 162.09 while rival Morgan Stanley (MS) also rose 2.6%, to end the week at 29.01.IBD'S TAKE: July's jobs figures follow a solid round of earnings reports and stress-test results from the banks this summer. But the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union left the economic landscape there in the balance and led many analysts to believe the Fed would stay cautious on raising rates. A second-quarter roundup can be found here.  Still, the outlook for consumer spending remains uncertain, even though the banks' second-quarter results portrayed a relatively stable consumer outside of the energy sector. Auto sales have also disappointed recently, and concerns have grown about an auto-loan bubble.Companies from McDonald's (MCD) to Starbucks (SBUX) to Delta Air Lines (DAL) have cited the U.S. election, Brexit, and fears of violence in the U.S. and abroad as potentially affecting their business plans and consumer sentiment.

433,MCD,"The U.S. economy added 178,000 jobs in November as the unemployment rate fell to 4.6%, the lowest since 2007, the Labor Department said Friday morning.Economists had expected a gain of 170,000 jobs and an unchanged 4.9% jobless rate.Employers in professional and business services added 63,000 jobs, while health care sector employment rose by 28,000 and construction 19,000. Manufacturing shed 4,000 jobs.October payroll growth was revised down by 19,000 to 142,000, but that was largely offset by an upward revision to September's job gain of 17,000 to 208,000.The unemployment rate fell in large part because the labor force participation rate fell for a second straight month, dropping to 62.7% from 62.9% in September, based on the monthly survey of households.Meanwhile, average hourly wages rose 2.5% from a year ago, down from the 2.8% rate in October, easing concerns about upward wage pressures. Hourly wages reported by employers fell 0.1% vs. October.Treasury yields dipped after the report. The major market averages were mixed in morning trade on the stock market today, not that different from before 8:30 a.m. ET release. Still, Treasury yields have been surging since Election Day on prospects for tax cuts and infrastructure spending, which could stimulate both faster growth and inflation.A rate hike when the Fed meets on Dec. 14 is seen as a slam dunk. The real question for investors is whether the Fed, which has telegraphed two additional quarter-point rate hikes in 2017 and three in 2018 will have to step up the pace.Even with the jobless rate sinking, it's hard to draw firm conclusions based on Friday's report. The real questions are whether the drop in participation and October's drop in hourly wages are statistical noise.Over the past two months, the household survey shows the ranks of the employed have climbed by a total of 117,000, while the civilian labor force has shrunk by 421,000, meaning the ranks of the unemployed have fallen by 538,000. Still, participation was up by more than 2.1 million from a year ago.Meanwhile, there's little evidence to support a sudden drop-off in wage growth. That runs counter to what companies are saying in their earnings calls, and some economists said they suspect the weak number was a statistical quirk.The worry down the line is that increasing wage pressure will flow through to inflation and force the Fed's hand. November's jobs report shows that's not an imminent concern, but it's still one to watch.Starbucks (SBUX), which gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores that took effect in October, hiked prices in July after announcing the increase.McDonald's (MCD), which announced in 2015 that it would raise its minimum wage at company-operated stores to $10 over two years, has been raising prices faster than the industry as a whole, Fitch Ratings said last month.Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), whose Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana chains are in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, told analysts on a Nov. 7 earnings call that wage growth has picked up from 3% and would likely range from 3% to 5% in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: The Trump rally could be entering a period of consolidation as markets assess what the president-elect's tax cuts and infrastructure spending will lift earnings and inflation. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market trend and visit IBD University for a primer on how that trend should influence investing decisions.The Fed's latest anecdotal report on economic conditions released on Wednesday said that among the 12 Federal Reserve districts seven reported a tightening of labor market conditions, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas.A Boston respondent to the Fed survey indicated that ""eight out of ten potential hourly hires either cannot pass a drug test or cannot pass a simple math test.""Construction firms in Atlanta noted that difficulty finding qualified workers was resulting in project delays, while others noted a nursing shortage.""In response to the challenges finding workers, a number of firms continued to engage in partnerships with community colleges and workforce development organizations to develop customized training programs and internship opportunities, or to invest in automation to replace difficult-to-fill jobs,"" the Atlanta Fed district write-up said.How all this will play out isn't yet clear. Productivity gains could alleviate some of the wage pressures and the need for price increases.

434,MCD,"The U.S. economy likely added 175,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%, Wall Street economists are estimating ahead of Friday's employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET.The economy has a bit of momentum, the Federal Reserve is set to hike rates in two weeks and nothing in Friday's jobs report can possibly change that.The real issue for markets is all about expectations. Investors are beginning to assess what the Trump fiscal package of tax cuts and infrastructure spending means for growth as well as inflation in 2017 and beyond. In other words, investors want their cake and the punch to wash it down, but there's some concern that upward pressure on prices might lead the Fed to start taking the punch away with faster-than-expected rate hikes.That potential fly in the ointment means that one question matters more than any other in every single jobs report from here on out: How tight is the market for labor?IBD'S TAKE: Here's why wage growth may be about to take off, though markets may not love it.The clearest answer will come from the pace of average hourly wage growth, which accelerated to a cycle high 2.8% from a year ago in October.

Same-restaurant sales rose 1.3%.The results reflected ""our ability to leverage our cost saving initiatives and the favorable commodity environment,"" CEO Sandra B. Cochran said in a statement.Cracker Barrel raised its full-year EPS outlook to $8.10-$8.25, above views for $8.13. In September, the company had forecast full-year EPS of $7.95-$8.10. Q1's beat of 17 cents fully covers the 15-cent hike in the full-year range.The company held to its full-year revenue forecast of $2.95 billion-$3 billion, which it said reflected a handful of expected new store openings. Same-restaurant sales are seen up 1.0% to 2.0% for the year, the same forecast as in September.However, Cracker Barrel, which has a restaurant segment and a retail segment, cut its retail comps forecast and expects a greater impact from food deflation. Cheaper groceries have weighed results of grocery companies like Kroger (KR) and restaurants. Cracker Barrel's comparable restaurant traffic also fell 1.7% during the quarter.Shares rose 5.7% to 163.01 in the stock market today, hitting a four-month high. That follows a rapid postelection ascent driven by hopes that a Trump administration could cut taxes and regulations for businesses.Eighty-five percent of Cracker Barrel's stores are located in states that voted for Trump, and the chain could get a boost from consumer confidence, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Jake Bartlett said in a research note last week.But the chain's low to middle-income consumers are unlikely to see any additional benefit from Trump's tax-cut plans, he said, and Trump's infrastructure bill might not help the restaurant development projects that take place outside of the rural areas where Cracker Barrel outlets are located.IBD'S TAKE: Even as an array of restaurants join the Trump rally, pizza stocks like Domino's and Papa John's have outperformed a sector weighed by discounts, cheaper items at the grocery store and election-related anxieties. McDonald's (MCD) edged 0.2% higher to 119.69.Jack in the Box (JACK) initially sold off to 97.52 but closed up 6.1% to 107.82, clearing a 102.73 buy point. Jack in the Box reported mixed fourth-quarter results on Monday but guided low.RELATED:McNuggets, McPick 2, Breakfast Help McDonald's Beat Restaurant SlumpTyson's Weak Profit Outlook Sinks Shares, Other Meat Producers

437,MCD,"Kate Spade (KATE) plunged Wednesday after the handbag and fashion company missed estimates and slashed guidance, blaming tourism and general retail woes. The move also dragged down peers including Michael Kors (KORS) and Coach (COH) and exacerbated concerns about the consumer sector. Kate Spade's Q2 earnings per share rose 38% to 11 cents, missing estimates by 3 cents a share. The retailer topped earnings expectations in Q1 after missing the prior four quarters in a row.""Several factors contributed to our second-quarter results falling short of our expectations, the most impactful of which are the retail landscape and continuing tourist headwinds,"" CEO Craig Leavitt said in the written earnings statement.Terror fears and a rising dollar is hurting travel from Europe.The New York retailer sees full-year earnings of 63-70 cents, far below analyst consensus of 78 cents a share. It cut its 2016 revenue outlook to $1.37 billion to $1.48 billion, down from $1.39 billion-$1.41 billion, and below projections of $1.41 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Kate Spade's earnings miss and weak outlook is stoking fears that weakness in the consumer sector and a slump in tourism could be a negative economic indicator. To see how Kate Spade ranks vs. other retailers see the IBD Stock Checkup.Kate Spade shares dived more than 18% to 16.47 at the close on the stock market today. On Tuesday it fell more than 6% in sync with a broad consumer retail decline, falling below both its 10-week average and 200-day lines where it was trading on Wednesday.Rival handbag maker Michael Kors fell 2.6% to 49.02, while Coach was up slightly to 41.75.Luxury jewelry chain Tiffany (TIF), whose flagship New York location is highly dependent on tourism, was unchanged at 61.42 after falling as low as 58.76. Tiffany fell 3.6% on Tuesday.Meanwhile, JCPenney (JCP)  fell 1.6% to 9.13. Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) each were up more than 2% after opening sharply lower with Kohl's at 38.72 and Macy's at 33.43. JCPenney, Kohl's and Macy's all tumbled Tuesday amid a widespread sell-off in consumer-related stocks.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported declining July U.S. sales Tuesday, following Ford's weak earnings and industry guidance last week. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported weak July revenue, bringing down airline stocks that day. And Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) tumbled Tuesday on weak sales and sales guidance, following weaker-than-expected U.S. sales at McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX).

438,MCD,"Yum Brands (YUM) said late Wednesday its Chinese operations have momentum ahead of a spinoff later this year, and the fast-food giant raised its full-year outlook after second-quarter earnings topped views.The parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut said adjusted earnings per share climbed 9% to 75 cents, beating analyst expectations for 74 cents. Revenue dropped 3% to $3.01 billion, missing Wall Street's $3.09 billion target, as China sales eased 3% to $1.59 billion. But Yum now sees full-year core operating profit growth outlook of at least 14%, up from a prior view of 12%.In Q2, total same-store sales were unchanged from the same quarter last year. China comps were also unchanged but rose 3% at KFC locations, better than what Yum expected and the fourth straight increase.""Importantly, our China Division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positive same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks,"" CEO Greg Creed said in a statement.Yum shares rose nearly 5% to 89.65 late Wednesday after closing down 0.6% to 85.74 in the stock market today, falling back below an 85.89 buy point. Wednesday's action suggests Yum will re-enter buy range when regular trading starts Thursday.The company said it's on track to separate its China business by Oct. 31. The segment should have a total of 7,800 locations in China by the time it's spun off. The China division has an estimated value of $7 billion-$8 billion and accounts for about half of Yum's business.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) is looking to auction its China franchise, valued at up to $3 billion, which involves having local partners take over the company's nearly 2,900-store China and Hong Kong operations for 20 years and pay royalties to McDonald's.McDonald's will report Q2 earnings results on July 26. Analysts expect EPS to rise about 10% to $1.39 on a 3.4% decline in revenue to $6.28 billion.

A distribution day was taking shape on the Nasdaq. If it holds, it would be the tech index's first since the S&P 500 confirmed a new uptrend on June 30.

440,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has offered freebies, rewards and promises of more careful food preparation in a bid to woo diners back into its restaurants. Ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday, here's a look at what Wall Street expects from the company.Analysts are currently expecting a 79% drop in per-share profit to 94 cents, down from $4.45 in the prior-year quarter, on a 12% revenue tumble to $1.05 billion.Quick recap: The embattled fast-casual chain clocked in a devastating 29.7% slide in same-restaurant sales in its March-ended quarter and swung to an 88-cent-per-share loss. Chipotle management said in its previous earnings call that April comps were down 26%, excluding Easter benefits.All eyes will be on Chipotle's same-store sales again this Thursday. Credit Suisse said Tuesday that it expects a 20% comp drop for Chipotle's second quarter, matching consensus views, up from prior expectations for a 22% drop.""(But) these sales forecasts are a notable improvement from -30% comp in Q1, CMG's sales recovery seems to have stalled out in recent months,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Jason West on Tuesday.And Morgan Stanley on Friday downgraded Chipotle to equal weight from overweight, cutting its price target to 405 from 500, citing ""new evidence that the sales recovery will remain more protracted than the market believes, and possibly more costly as a result, as CMG likely needs to ramp up marketing (spending) to lure consumers back in.""Shares closed up 1.6% at 415.31 in the stock market today. The stock has lost about a third of its value since early November as foodborne illness outbreaks rocked investors' faith in the company. This has translated to a stock that has barely come up for air above its 50-day line over the last nine months.IBD's TAKE: While Chipotle shares have plummeted, McDonald's stock is approaching buy range ahead of its Q2 earnings results. For a deeper look at what that means for investors, read this Income Investor.Chipotle rolled out a loyalty program, Chiptopia, in an effort to attract more foot traffic. While the associated freebies are generous, the stigma and fear of getting food poisoning from the burrito chain seems to be lingering.Morgan Stanley said that its latest 2,000-person poll from June reveals that about 13% of Chipotle consumers maintain that they ""won't go back anytime soon, or at least not for another year — similar to results seen in January.""Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Starbucks (SBUX), and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) also report on Thursday.

"
441,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) just lost a battle in its legal war to shield itself from liability over the treatment and wages of the roughly 750,000 U.S. workers employed by its franchisees.The Golden Arches agreed to pay $3.75 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by workers of five restaurant-franchise operators over unpaid overtime and other labor violations. The settlement, revealed by plaintiffs' lawyers in a Friday court filing, is the first of its kind between McDonald's and franchisee workers and reflects a weakening of the legal protections for franchise chain operators.McDonald's shares were up 0.4% to 112.57 at the close on the stock market today.McDonald's is the prime target in the National Labor Relations Board's attack on the franchise industry as it aims to label the fast-food empire a ""joint employer"" of franchisee workers, upending the legal protections that have fueled the growth of franchising.In settling the class-action lawsuit, McDonald's continued to assert that it isn't an employer, and that the franchisee is responsible for scheduling, hiring and firing its workers. Indeed, the federal judge who certified the class-action suit in July sided with McDonald's on that key point but allowed plaintiffs' lawyers an alternative strategy for neutralizing the company's legal defenses.Yet U.S. District Judge James Donato said that the franchisee workers could seek to hold McDonald's liable under a related though less far-reaching assertion that franchisee workers believed that McDonald's was their direct employer, a legal concept known as ostensible agency.In August, McDonald's appealed the class certification to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. ""Because no court of appeals (including this one) has ever endorsed such a far-fetched and far-reaching theory of class certification, the district court's decision warrants immediate review,"" McDonald's argued.The company said that the question of ostensible agency was ""of exceptional importance not just to McDonald's in this suit (and several copycat suits), but for every corporate franchiser facing vicarious liability for the allegedly wrongful acts of a franchisee.""IBD'S TAKE: Read why the push for a $15 minimum wage may expose underlying issues in the franchise agreements of McDonald's and other fast-food chains.McDonald's said the settlement was made to avoid the disruption and cost of continued litigation. Yet covering the full economic losses of the workers and paying about $2 million in plaintiffs' attorney bills suggests McDonald's was eager to avoid taking the case before a jury.The settlement is likely to encourage yet more copycat suits and may lead franchisers to require each independent operator to get employees to sign a statement saying they understand that they aren't employed directly by McDonald's, though even that might not provide blanket protection from such suits. McDonald's also said it would provide more training to franchisees.Class-action suits allowed due to ostensible agency are much more than a nuisance, but the real game-changer would be a finding that franchisers are joint employers, which is upheld on appeal. Then McDonald's and other big chains wouldn't just be liable for franchisee labor violations, but might have to sit down at the table to bargain with all franchisee workers.RELATED:Fast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperMcDonald's Franchisees Are In A Funk — Like Its Stock Liberal Attacks On Restaurant Giants Punish Minority-Owned Franchises
"
442,MCD,"Few companies had higher stakes in the presidential election than McDonald's (MCD), and Donald Trump's victory has served up the equivalent of a quadruple cheeseburger on a Golden Arches platter.Most consequentially, a Trump administration is expected to stick a fork in the National Labor Relations Board's push to up-end McDonald's franchising model by labeling the fast-food giant a joint-employer of franchisee workers.Still, McDonald's was largely an afterthought on investors' post-election buy lists — until Monday. McDonald's rose 0.4% to 118.32 on the stock market today, the best since mid-August, after jumping 3.2% on Monday. Meanwhile, shares of Wendy's (WEN), which broke above a buy point at 11.00 on Nov. 7, added about 2% to 11.94.That legal battle threatened not only to make McDonald's and other major fast-food chains liable for workplace violations by independent operators, but also may have forced the parent company to the collective bargaining table with franchisee workers seeking to unionize.On top of that, a Trump victory promises relief for employers in modest-wage industries like fast food on multiple fronts. The ObamaCare employer mandate, which fines employers with at least 50 full-time-equivalent workers if they fail to offer acceptable health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week, will likely be repealed by the unified Republican government. The Obama administration's overtime rule, which doubles the pay threshold for salaried workers who can be denied time-and-a-half overtime pay to $47,476 effective Dec. 1, is likely to be watered down.That menu looks a whole lot more appetizing to McDonald's, its franchisees and investors than Hillary Clinton's plan to raise the minimum wage to at least $12 an hour and require companies to provide paid leave to workers, while continuing to have the NLRB carry forward its attack on the Golden Arches business model.Still, the results of Tuesday's vote weren't a clean sweep for McDonald's. Arizona, Colorado and Maine voted to raise their minimum wage to $12 an hour, with Washington state voters approved a $13.50 minimum wage, all by 2020.Rising wage pressures, both due to a tightening job market and government-imposed minimums, and increasing benefit mandates are among the reasons that fast-food inflation has been rising at a record pace relative to the cost of eating at home. Higher fast-food costs have slowed down customer traffic for the restaurant industry, which is experiencing its worst year since 2009.While McDonald's has raised its own base wage for U.S. workers to $10 an hour, the move doesn't apply to the roughly 750,000 workers employed by its franchisees.IBD'S TAKE: Read why the push for a $15 minimum wage may expose underlying issues in the franchise agreements of McDonald's and other fast-food chains and why Papa John's is on fire despite wage pressures.Trump's election doesn't mean that all of McDonald's problems have disappeared. On the day before the election, Fitch Ratings downgraded its rating on McDonald's long-term debt, saying that the chain has recently been raising prices faster than the industry as a whole and that it has gradually lost market share to improving quick-service competitors and fast-casual operators.""Fitch believes McDonald's will continue to gradually lose share over the medium term in the U.S. due to increased choices for consumers, stemming from the growth of specialty burger shops like Shake Shack (SHAK) and Five Guys, and some weakening in McDonald's brand perception within the hamburger category and among younger and health-conscious consumers in recent years.""Trump's election is likely to save McDonald's a small fortune in legal bills. Last month the company agreed to pay $3.75 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by workers of five restaurant-franchise operators over unpaid overtime and other labor violations. The settlement was the first of its kind between McDonald's and franchisee workers and indicated that the company felt increasingly doubtful about winning in court. Now, with Trump getting to fill the ninth slot on the Supreme Court, plaintiffs' lawyers may no longer see a pot of gold under the arches.While the NLRB's legal battle against McDonald's may not end immediately, there's now little doubt about the eventual outcome, once Trump's appointments are in place. The NLRB board currently has just three members, including one Republican, with two vacancies to be filled by Trump.The NLRB's ""expansive view of 'joint employers,' including franchisors ... will go out the window"" after Trump's victory, wrote Rob Rickman, an employment lawyer at Kane Russell Coleman & Logan, in a post-election analysis.A final verdict that McDonald's was a joint employer threatened to, in effect, nullify the terms of its agreement with independent operators and alter its business model overnight. McDonald's, Wendy's and the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain have all moved in recent years to shrink the number of company-operated restaurants, lowering their need for capital and their direct exposure to wage and benefit hikes. Franchisors like McDonald's and their franchisees would have stood to lose because the shared liability against workplace suits and the increase in bargaining power for workers would have hit the bottom line of both.RELATED:McDonald's Settles Franchisee-Worker Class Action As Legal Protections ErodeFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even Cheaper

443,MCD,"Donald Trump ditched reporters this week to dine at a New York steakhouse. But his victory has already helped put restaurant stocks back on the menu.Jack in the Box (JACK) and Dave & Buster's (PLAY) are near buy points Thursday. Meanwhile, Papa John's (PZZA) and Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) are now slightly extended from their recent breakouts.The National Restaurant Association expects Trump to ease regulations for the industry, including repealing ObamaCare and nixing the pending Overtime Rule that would make higher-wage, salaried workers eligible for overtime pay.Shares of Jack in the Box, which was added to IBD's Leaderboard Thursday,  jumped 2.3% to 102.54 on the stock market today, consolidating in a flat base and nearing its buy point of 102.78.The election was a boost for the fast-food restaurant, as voters in California, Massachusetts and Nevada approved marijuana legalization for recreational use. Marijuana use is notorious for sparking junk-food cravings known as ""the munchies.""But Goldman Sachs warned last month that diminishing benefits from California's minimum-wage hikes and Taco Bell's focus on breakfast and $1 offerings were risks for the chain.Jack in the Box, which also owns Qdoba Mexican Eats, will report quarterly results after the market close Monday. Analysts see earnings jumping 42% to 88 cents and revenue up 12.6% to $398.67  million.Dave & Buster's stock dipped 7 cents to 45.33 as it consolidates in a double-bottom base with a buy point of 47.40.The Dallas-based company operates 87 restaurant/arcade venues and will announce quarterly results Dec. 6.Papa John's shares rose 1.55% to 86.92, moving slightly out of buy range after breaking out past its buy point of 82.64 on Friday. The 5% chase zone goes up to 86.77.Darden shares edged up 1.2% to 72.47, also moving just beyond buy range. Darden broke out of a cup base and past its buy point of 68.78 last week. It's still in range to 72.22.Wingstop (WING) shares rose 0.5% to 29.94, building the right side of a base. Wingstop cleared an aggressive buy point on Tuesday as it broke a downtrend and retook its 50-day moving average.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) shares fell 1.1% to 45.46. Shares ran up after the election, building the right side of a base. It has a potential buy point of 49.09 for now but could form a handle, presenting a lower entry point.McDonald's (MCD) is also basing but has a lot of work to do. Shares have retaken their 50-day line and are approaching their 200-day, but are far from a proper buy point. Also, the fast-food giant continues to struggle with declining sales, as a U.S. revival runs out of steam and the strong dollar hits overseas results. Shares rose 0.2% to 119.45 on Thursday.McDonald's announced Thursday that it would expand table service to all its U.S. restaurants, invest in self-serve kiosks and launch mobile ordering in the U.S. and 10 key markets in 2017.RELATED: McDonald's 2017 Menu: Table Service, Mobile Ordering, More KiosksPapa John's Hits New High, Independent Of Postelection Sector Rotation 
"
444,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) will launch table service nationwide, while introducing mobile ordering and expanding digital kiosks beginning next year, the burger chain said on Thursday.Those plans  are part of McDonald's efforts to become a ""modern, progressive burger company,"" executives told reporters in New York.They would also appear to be in keeping with the company's apparent intent, announced earlier this year, to find a way for staff and technology to coexist — at least for now — even as labor costs rise industrywide.McDonald's currently offers table service at some 500 locations, and jobs will be added for the table service and kiosk assistance, Bloomberg said Thursday. Reuters reported that mobile ordering will be introduced in the U.S. and 10 ""major markets"" next year.IBD'S TAKE: President-elect Donald Trump has put restaurant stocks back on the menu, with Jack In The Box and Dave & Buster's near buy points, joining Darden Restaurants and Papa John's.Technology has increasingly become a part of the dining experience for younger restaurant consumers. Some of those customers have turned away from McDonald's to eat at a growing list so-called better-burger chains — Shake Shack (SHAK), Habit Restaurants (HABT), Five Guys, In-N-Out — that emphasize quality over value and have made it more difficult for McDonald's to balance the two. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) itself opened its first Tasty Burger location late last month.More restaurants have also eyed technology as a way to compensate for higher wages. Wendy's (WEN) this year said it would make self-ordering kiosks available in its restaurants to offset costs.Meanwhile, digital ordering platforms have helped to make Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) outliers in a struggling restaurant sector.Earlier this month, McDonald's also said it was planning a ""very significant acceleration"" in spending on technology, according to Bloomberg.And earlier this year, CEO Steve Easterbrook said that technology like self-ordering kiosks was not ""meant as a labor replacement"" and was unlikely to result in job cuts.""It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it's through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks — that is a societal trend,"" he said in May.""We want to adapt to that, but it's not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just reapportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.""Restaurants in recent months have also struggled to grow sales amid consumers' election-related anxieties, and cheaper groceries have given diners more incentive to eat at home.And McDonald's, which reported strong quarterly results last month, is also approaching some tough comparisons from a year ago, when its launch of All Day Breakfast helped revive lagging sales growth. However, some analysts this year have expressed concern that McDonald's had depended a bit too much on All Day Breakfast to drive sales.McDonald's shares rose 0.2% to 119.45 in the stock market today. Wendy's rose 1.3%, while Shake Shack climbed 0.4%. Habit fell 0.2%, while Chipotle closed flat.RELATED:Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsDomino's Earnings Sends Shares Higher, As CEO Sees Industry Mergers

445,MCD,"For much of the summer and fall, pizza stocks seemed to be the only restaurant stocks performing well, with Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) hitting a series of all-time highs. But since the election, several other restaurant operators have soared.Dave & Buster's (PLAY), Jack in the Box (JACK) and Bojangles (BOJA) are in buy range.Meanwhile, Wingstop (WING), Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), Cracker Barrel (CBRL) and Panera Bread (PNRA) are all closing in on sound entry points.Among restaurant giants, Yum Brands (YUM), parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, is consolidating well. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is approaching a buy point. But McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) have a lot of work to do.Here's a look at some of the restaurant stocks:Dave & Buster's combines a traditional sports bar with big-screen TVs, with a huge number of video games for kids and adults.Dave & Buster's cleared a 46.94 buy point above a handle in a double-bottom base on Nov. 23, the day before Thanksgiving, but in light volume. Shares rose 0.2% to 47.42 on the stock market today.Jack in the Box operates the eponymous burger chain as well as Qdoba Mexican Eats, a rival to Chipotle.On Nov. 21, Jack in the Box reported strong profit growth but sales and guidance were light. But after a brief tumble, shares soared the following day, busting past a 102.78 buy point and hitting a record high. Since then, shares have traded near the high end of its buy range, pulling back 2.5% to 104.95 Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant stocks rallied on the election results on hopes that a Trump administration would have a lighter regulatory touch on eateries, on ObamaCare, franchisee rules and overtime pay. A federal judge last week blocked Pres. Obama's overtime rule, set to launch Dec. 1. Here's how the overtime ruling affects fast food chains and other retailers.Bojangles is a Southern-inspired chicken-and-biscuit chain.Bojangles came public at 19 a share in May 2015, hitting a record 28.45 a few days after its debut. Shares then largely retreated through 2015, then moved sideways for most of 2016. But Bojangles has surged since its Nov. 3 earnings report. Shares cleared a 19.10 buy point on Nov. 22 and closed Friday at 20.05, at the very tip of the 5% chase zone.Bojangles fell 1.75% to 19.70 Monday.Yum Brands operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains. It just spun off its Chinese operations into a separately traded public company, Yum China (YUMC).Yum Brands has been consolidating in a flat base going back to early September with a potential 66.39 buy point. Yum retook its 50-day moving average last week, edging down 0.4% to 63.11 Monday, finding some support at the 50-day.The fast casual bakery/cafe ran up after the election. The stock has a potential buy point of 224.24, but could be starting to form a handle that would likely offer a lower entry. A pause before a breakout might be constructive after its rapid run-up.Panera Bread slid 2.3% to 212.19 Monday after Wedbush Securities downgraded the stock to neutral, keeping a 220 price target.RELATED:Analysts Find Restaurant Stocks UnappetizingThe country style restaurant chain reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Nov. 22, though sales missed slightly.

So investors may need to hedge any downside risk over the next several weeks.A long-short equity strategy minimizes an investor's market exposure, while allowing them to profit from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions.WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity (DYLS) puts the strategy in an ETF wrapper, at a competitive 0.48% expense ratio. That is far less than the average 1.49% annual fee plus 20% of profits charged by hedge funds.DYLS has long positions in roughly 100 U.S. large- and midcap stocks with strong growth and value characteristics. And it takes a short position in the S&P 500, as needed, to hedge market risk.The ETF toggles among 100% net long, 50% net long or 0% net long positions in response to hedging signals triggered by stock market conditions.When market conditions are robust, investors need not hedge downside risk at all and are fully exposed to the performance of the 100 underlying stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and McDonald's (MCD).In a mixed scenario — where profitability looks good but valuations are expensive, for example — investors are 50% exposed to the performance of the 100 underlying stocks.When risks are running high, the ETF is 100% hedged.According to WisdomTree, for the first time since February, the market environment has turned bearish. Company fundamentals, such as net margins, went from positive in September to negative for November.That triggered a hedging signal and the ETF went to its current 0% net long position. It still holds the 100 underlying stocks, but its 100% long position in that basket is offset with a 100% short position in the S&P 500. That makes it basically market neutral.Should market conditions improve, this strategy will automatically become more exposed to equities, Gannatti told IBD in a phone call.A 15% to 20% allocation to this ETF within an investor's U.S. equity allocation is advisable, he added. The strategy fits within the core bucket of a total portfolio.Other similar strategies include First Trust Long/Short Equity (FTLS), which uses earnings quality as the signal to go long or short. Meanwhile, PowerShares S&P 500 Downside Hedged (PHDG) invests in VIX futures, a measure of implied volatility, alongside the S&P 500.Unlike those actively managed peers, DYLS is rules-based. It is up 7.0% year to date through Nov. 8 — roughly in line with a 6.7% gain for the broad stock market.Assets have swelled 750% over the same period to the current $21.3 million.RELATED:Seize ETF Tools To Position Your Portfolio For Any Election Outcome

447,MCD,"There's a decent case to be made that investors' fear of Donald Trump winning the White House may turn out to be a good deal worse than the reality, at least in the intermediate term.Stock indexes crashed 5% overnight with odds for a December Federal Reserve hike tumbling. But after an initial modest sell-off at the open, the major averages have reversed for solid gains, with soaring bond yields.The overnight reaction to Trump looked like it may vindicate economists who predicted the market would fall up to 12% if Trump won. But once you consider Trump's near-term priorities and the challenges of working with Congress — even a GOP Congress restrained by a filibuster in the Senate — the agenda looks more market friendly than unfriendly.Priority one for Trump on the domestic front is likely to be revving up growth via infrastructure spending, cutting the corporate tax rate and offering multinationals the chance to repatriate overseas profits at a lower tax rate.He's talked about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, double what Hillary Clinton proposed to spend, with both candidates talking up the potential of public-private partnerships.""With the focus on infrastructure, the basic resources sector is one of the best performers today,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research in London.Both Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) surged on the stock market today, suring 12% and 9%, respectively. Shares of gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) initially spiked as Trump's victory fueled a safe-haven bid with the dollar plunging. But as stocks and the dollar rebound, gold erased its big gains and Newmont traded 2% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Gold prices are rising sharply Wednesday. That will give a big boost to Newmont and other gold mining stocks, which are technical turning points.Biotech and drug stocks such as Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) rallied on relief that Hillary Clinton will not be president and the Senate will remain in GOP hands. Clinton had vowed to crack on ""excessive"" price increases, notably on older treatments. She also likely would have pushed for the government to negotiate drug prices lower.Trump's victory means that regulatory relief for super-regional banks from Dodd-Frank regulations may go a step further than expected, paving the way for a round of acquisitions. It also may ease pressures on too-big-to-fail banks, which explains why Wells Fargo (WFC) popped 6% intraday, recovering from an overnight sell-off. Wells Fargo also may see less political pressure over its fradualent account scandal.""We expect a positive snapback move once investors digest the results and factor in a more favorable regulatory environment for the financial sector,"" wrote Brian Gardner, head of Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Banks have been rising in part due to expectations for a Fed hike amid stronger wage growth and tighter labor markets. While the Fed may decide to pause before hiking if Trump's election does send financial shock waves around the globe, that's far from clear.""Expect an immediate market pullback, on fear, and then a pause,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""Should Mr. Trump be able to reduce the uncertainty around what policies he intends to pursue, it is quite possible markets will recover as the economic fundamentals in the U.S. remain sound.""Trump is likely to kill President Obama's overtime rule that's due to take effect in December that guarantees time-and-a-half pay for salaried workers earning up to $47,476 — about twice the current level. Wal-Mart (WMT) already raised pay for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective September, to avoid being liable for overtime, but many employers have been slower to adopt the change as Congress aims to delay it. Some, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain's largest franchisee, have said they'll effectively demote their managers and make them punch the clock.The ObamaCare employer mandate is likely history, meaning modest-wage employers would no longer be fined if they fail to offer health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. Along with retailers, Trump may bring relief to restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) that are being squeezed by competition and compensation hikes, contributing to a record gap between the cost of fast food and eating in.What are markets scared about? Trump's threats to impose tariffs on companies like Ford Motor (F) that send cars to the U.S. from Mexico, to walk away from Nafta and to crack down on unauthorized immigrants are why economists have said his agenda could hurt the economy.If Trump were to start his presidency by labeling China a currency manipulator and imposing tariffs, that could start a trade war, with China reciprocating by targeting the sales of Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Microsoft (MSFT). China, facing slower growth and an unsustainable build up in debt, could easily spark another bout of financial market turmoil as was seen this past January.How Trump proceeds on trade will be one of his most important early decisions. The good news is that Trump isn't campaigning anymore — and his was an especially insular campaign. Surrounded by pro-growth economic advisors and now in direct contact with top business leaders, Trump is likely to act deliberately, not rashly. That may mean opening up talks with both countries about how to move trade relations forward and setting out intermediate term goals to measure progress.This seems consistent with Trump's victory speech words: ""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""Trump seems unlikely to back down from his pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico, but that, in and of itself, would have more of a symbolic than an economic effect. His rhetoric has shifted to cracking down on unauthorized immigrants who are violent criminals, and there may be fewer of those than he implies.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseTrump Wins, But Fed Hike Still On: Treasury Yields, Bank Stocks SoarAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?Overtime Rule Fallout: Fast Food Managers Told To Punch ClockFBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump Wins

448,MCD,"Business productivity rose at a 3.4% annual rate in the third quarter, tied for the second fastest growth in output per hour worked since the start of 2010, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.Business output rose at an annual rate of  3.5% in the quarter, while hours worked were up just 0.1%. That followed three straight quarters of declining productivity.While the productivity rise was boosted by inventory-building in the quarter, there's good reason to expect better productivity growth to continue after stagnating in recent years. That conclusion comes from a close look at how Wal-Mart (WMT), a prime force behind the last productivity boom, is re-engineering its business processes to meet competitive threats from Amazon.com (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others, while facing the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own pay scale.The key is that Wal-Mart's efficiency gains tend to be contagious when it shares those gains with consumers via lower prices, as it's begun to do again recently. Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.The upshot is that productivity could surprise on the upside, even as economists — including Federal Reserve policymakers — are becoming increasingly sure about a future with low-productivity growth, low economic growth and unusually low interest rates. The latest Fed economic projections in September marked the long-term economic growth rate down to just 1.8% from 2.0% in June.IBD'S TAKE: IBD recently examined a host of ways Wal-Mart is working to streamline its business, from using drones to manage inventories to its new ""Scan & Go"" app. For a closer look, read How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.Leaner stockpiles were a big reason productivity growth had been negative in recent quarters, but that was actually a positive sign for productivity growth going forward, because it's partly the result of better inventory management. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.RELATED:Forget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar StoresFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperWhole Foods Soars On Kroger Takeover Rumor, Wal-Mart Plans

449,MCD,"Just as virtual-reality and augmented-reality technologies are starting to take off, companies are looking at them as new ways to deliver advertising and marketing messages to consumers.Research firm IDC on Tuesday predicted that 30% of consumer-facing companies in the Forbes Global 2000 will experiment with AR and VR as part of their marketing efforts in 2017.IDC made the forecast as part of its annual year-ahead tech predictions. The research firm held a webcast Tuesday to discuss its predictions not only for 2017 but for the next four years and beyond.Here's a summary of several IDC tech predictions:By 2020, over a billion people worldwide will regularly access AR and VR content, IDC predicts. That's an audience that consumer brands will want to reach.Brands like McDonald's (MCD), Budweiser, Kellogg's (K), Ikea and Lego are already taking steps to capitalize on the new media, IDC chief analyst Frank Gens said Tuesday.Augmented reality layers digital information over what people see in the real world. Virtual reality completely immerses people in a digital world.AR and VR are new computer interfaces for interacting with information.""By 2020, the coolest mobile and web experiences we have today are going to seem very flat and hopelessly boring,"" Gens said.Augmented reality is getting started on mobile phones with applications like ""Pokemon Go."" It will shift to computerized glasses like Microsoft's (MSFT) HoloLens.Meanwhile, virtual reality is poised to redefine video games and video entertainment, Gens said.But the biggest impact for VR will be bringing an immersive experience to social networks, he said.""Social (media) is going to become increasingly immersive through virtual reality,"" Gens said.Facebook (FB) saw the trend coming, so it purchased the maker of the Oculus Rift VR headset.By 2020, over 20% of commercial media on Facebook will be 360-degree video and photo content, IDC predicts.Consumers are helping to push the development of artificial intelligence by using voice-activated digital personal assistants like Amazon's (AMZN) Echo and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home devices, Gens said.""Consumers are going to be essential to AI adoption,"" he said.By 2019, over 110 million consumer devices with embedded intelligent assistants will be installed in U.S. households, IDC predicts.IDC believes third-platform technologies and services will drive nearly 75% of information technology spending by 2019.IDC defines the third platform as the mix of mobile computing, cloud computing, social media and Big Data analytics. The first platform was mainframe computers and the second platform was client-server computing.The rapid growth of the third platform has surprised even IDC, Gens said. Last year, IDC predicted that such technologies would account for over 60% of IT spending by 2020.""Clearly there's a snowball effect happening,"" Gens said.Corporations and other enterprises are rapidly adopting cloud computing technologies, which are hardware and software resources accessed over the internet as a service.By 2020, 67% of enterprise IT infrastructure and software spending will be for cloud-based offerings, IDC predicts.During that time frame the cloud computing market will become increasingly concentrated.By 2020, the top five cloud infrastructure and platform players will control at least 75% of the market, vs. about 50% this year. Top cloud vendors include Amazon.com and Microsoft.""In other words, the big will get bigger,"" Gens said.IDC predicts that the fourth platform in computing will be technology integrated with the human body.""The next major milestone in IT, the fourth platform, will be defined by the ultimate step in proximity: The penetration of the human body and the integration of digital technologies with the human biosystem,"" Gens said. ""This means: the fourth platform is us.""IDC predicts that by 2020, one-third of health and life sciences and consumer product companies will begin to develop the first products that tightly integrate third platform technologies with the human body.The goal of the fourth platform is augmented humanity, Gens said. That means implanted technology for augmented senses, augmented memory and cognition and other physiological improvements.The fourth platform will be in the R&D and innovators stage until 2021, the early adopters stage from 2021 to 2026, and the early mainstream stage starting in 2026, IDC predicts.

450,MCD,"U.S. stock indexes struggled Monday, showing hesitation for the third session in a row.The Nasdaq trimmed 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average tacked on a 0.1% gain. The small cap Russell 2000 led with a 1% pop. Volume in the stock market today was running modestly higher on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.After the small cap S&P 600 logged a tone-changing gain of 3.1% Wednesday, the small cap index remains one of the few with strong follow-up action. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 haven't moved much in the past three sessions.If the uptrend is to avoid rolling over, the major indexes are going to have to get with it.Banks have been one of the market's stronger sectors. Eight banks have nailed down spots in the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals. On Monday, all eight rose, but three reversed lower in the day's range. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) erased most of a 5% gain. Home BancShares (HOMB) rubbed out most of a 4% gain. Chemical Financial (CHFC) also gave back most of a 4% advance.Morgan Stanley (MS) did a bit better, holding onto about 2% of a midmorning 3.6% gain. Morgan Stanley cleared a 32.47 buy point intraday in September. The stock sketched a handle with a 34.13 buy point and broke out on the Nov. 9 follow-through day. Shares are 15% extended.In the Dow, losers led winners by a 2-to-1 ratio. McDonald's (MCD) was the biggest gainer, up 3% in brisk volume. The stock recently reclaimed its 50-day moving average but remains under the 200-day line.The biggest loser in the Dow was Visa (V), down 4% in twice its usual volume. Visa was trying to retake its 50-day line but dropped to its 200-day line, where it appeared to find support.RELATED:Bank Stocks Staying On Bullish Path
"
451,MCD,"ETF investors, take note. The word on the street is that a Donald Trump presidency could hasten the end to an era of historically low interest rates. During his campaign, the president-elect rumbled that low rates hurt American savers and distort the market.So far, stock market investors have taken a Trump win in stride. Fears of market volatility if he won have not been realized. So a rate hike by the Fed next month is still seen to be in the cards. Beyond December, rates are likely to keep edging up. And if Trump's economic agenda drives up inflation, rates could rise more quickly.What does that mean for yield-hungry investors who flocked to exchange traded funds offering dividend income this year?Rising interest rates could be a headwind for income equities. Investors may dump their dividend stocks for less risky income assets, such as bonds, in such a climate. But rising rates don't weaken the case for all dividend-paying stocks, according to investment management firm BlackRock.""We prefer dividend growers over dividend payers in the environment of gradually rising interest rates we see ahead,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote in a Nov. 7 note. ""High-yielding dividend stocks typically suffer more when rates rise than dividend growers — quality companies with enough free cash flow to sustain dividend increases over time.""Popular ETFs that investors use to target dividend growers include Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity (SCHD), iShares Select Dividend (DVY) and SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY).All these funds own companies with long histories of increasing dividends. Their holdings include the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), McDonald's (MCD), AT&T (T) and Chevron (CVX), which have raised payouts from 10 to 20 consecutive years.The potential for a December rate hike will impact dividend ETFs differently, depending on their sector exposure, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of funds research at CFRA.""Higher-yielding sectors — such as consumer staples, telecom and utilities — would be more negatively impacted by a rate hike, while consumer discretionary, financials and technology should do better,"" he added.Rosenbluth recently studied the exposure of dividend ETFs to a particular high-yielding sector: real estate.With the recent elevation of real estate as a stand-alone S&P sector, ""investors now have greater transparency about the exposure they have to these income-oriented equities,"" he said.Although real estate companies are virtually synonymous with dividend investments, some dividend funds shut them out, Rosenbluth found. Others have big helpings in the sector. Even among dividend growth funds, sector exposures vary widely depending on the methods used to select and weight stocks.DVY has gained 15.3% in 2016 through Oct. 9 vs. 14.9 for SDY and 9.2% for VIG.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is up 7.8% and yields 2.08%.Investors poured roughly $3 billion into VIG, DVY and SDY combined year-to-date through October.Dividend income will account for a larger part of investors' more modest portfolio returns over the next five years, according to BlackRock.""Bond yields have likely bottomed out, and we don't see scope for big rises in already elevated stock market valuations amid tepid earnings growth,"" Turnill wrote.The new Fidelity Dividend ETF For Rising Rates (FDRR) selects stocks based on correlations to increasing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields.RELATED:Schwab's Sonders: Fed Should Stop Treating Economy Like Trauma Patient

Jack In The Box (JACK) and Wendy's (WEN) report results next month.Chipotle Mexican Grill rose 0.3% in afternoon trade to 413.35. Jack In The Box slid 1.5% to 97.06 and Wendy's rose 0.5% to 11.01.
"
453,MCD,"Even as Jack in the Box (JACK) appears poised for a windfall from looser marijuana laws nationwide, Goldman Sachs says that diminishing benefits from California's minimum-wage hikes and Taco Bell's focus on breakfast and $1 offerings pose risks to the burger chain.Jack in the Box's same-store sales have likely been helped by California's minimum-wage increases, said Goldman Sachs, which initiated coverage of the stock Monday with a sell rating and an 88 price target. But rising unemployment in the state during the fourth quarter could work to neutralize demand.Taco Bell's recent focus on breakfast, begun in 2014, and a $1 breakfast menu launched this March have also made competition more difficult for Jack in the Box, Goldman said. The $1 price is something a burger chain ""would struggle to replicate,"" analyst Karen Holthouse wrote in the firm's initiation note.""Taco Bell has one of the most flexible menus for engineering entry-level value,"" she wrote, ""and it plans to emphasize its all-day $1 menu in its fall creative.""The two chains also have a large presence in California — both have their roots in the state — and also vie aggressively for the attention of millennials, Holthouse noted.Jack in the Box's own Mexican chain, Qdoba, also faces competition from an array of fast-casual rivals, including Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which reports earnings Tuesday. But its push into catering could present future opportunities, Holthouse said.Jack in the Box fell 1.5% to 97.06 in the stock market today. Yum Brands (YUM), Taco Bell's owner, rose 1% to 87.80.IBD'S TAKE: Value deals like Taco Bell's $1 menu offerings have become more common as food costs fall. But eating at home has become cheaper as well, while labor costs continue to rise in the fast-food sector.However, Goldman noted, Jack in the Box's year-over-year comparisons get easier as the company laps ""promotional mismatches"" in its fiscal 2016 and McDonald's (MCD) launch of All Day Breakfast.As promotional competition adds to many restaurants' struggles this year, McDonald's and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) were outliers in the third quarter. McDonald's remains popular among younger diners. Domino's, meanwhile, has been helped in part by its digital ordering platform.McDonald's fell 0.3% to 113.57 Monday, after rising 3% Friday on its stronger-than-expected earnings.Domino's Pizza rose 0.1% to 166.53 after surging 10% last week to a record high on its booming earnings.As other chains contend with consumer anxiety about the presidential election, Jack in the Box's prospects look a little brighter elsewhere on the ballot.""Within quick-service,"" Cowen & Co. said in a research report last month, ""we note Jack in the Box has the greatest exposure to recreational marijuana use becoming more widely accepted in states that have already legalized use (10% of the store base), as well as 5 states with an upcoming legalized recreational use proposal on state ballots for the November election (52% of the store base).""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-MartMcDonald's: Labor-Saving Self-Order Kiosks Are Not A 'Risk' To JobsWhat Jack In The Box, 'Hunger Games' And 'Seinfeld' Have In Common

454,MCD,"Someday C-3PO and R2-D2 could be taking your fast-food restaurant order and cooking your burger and fries instead of saving the galaxy in ""Star Wars.""Before you say, ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" consider the current business and technology trends.The political push to raise the minimum wage nationwide to $15 an hour has motivated many restaurants and other businesses with low-skilled workers to think about replacing some human staff with automation and robots.At the same time, such technology is improving by leaps and bounds and costs are coming down.IBD'S TAKE: There always are some good stocks, with top fundamentals, at or near breakouts, and the IBD Stock Spotlight can flag them for you. Learn why Domino's makes the current list.Already restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) are adding self-service kiosks to take orders and payments from customers at thousands of locations. Domino's (DPZ) is testing four-wheeled pizza-delivery robots that drive to your home; you unlock the storage compartment with your smartphone.McDonald's stock rose 3% in the stock market Friday after the company posted better-than-expected Q3 earnings. Domino's stock, one of the restaurant industry's rare top-performers, touched a record high for the fourth straight day and ended trading up 0.6%. Wendy's stock rose 0.8% Friday, helped by the positive McDonald's earnings report.Restaurant kitchens will be the next area for automation to take hold, industry experts say.In Silicon Valley, some entrepreneurs are taking restaurant automation to the next level.The Eatsa fast-food restaurant chain, which has two locations in San Francisco, one in Berkeley and one in Southern California (Woodland Hills), is fully automated on the front end. Customers place their order at iPad kiosks and pick up their food from vending-machine-like cubicles without seeing a human worker. Eatsa serves vegetarian quinoa bowls with a variety of toppings. Kitchen staffers prepare the meals in a back room.Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants Holdings, told Business Insider last March that he was inspired by a visit to Eatsa to explore more automation for CKE's chains, which include Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.San Francisco-based startup Momentum Machines has built a machine that can crank out up to 400 made-to-order hamburgers an hour. A robot grills a patty, adds toppings, and assembles and wraps the burger without help from humans. Momentum plans to open a restaurant soon in San Francisco.Mountain View, Calif.-based startup Zume Pizza is using robots to make pizzas.In the realm of food-service innovation, engineers also have created robots to make and cook burritos, bratwursts, noodles, sushi and other eats.Costs are a big driver. As labor costs rise, businesses either can pass the increases on to consumers or look for ways to reduce their overhead. And raising prices for consumers can lead to reduced sales.Quick-service restaurants are turning to technology to improve efficiency and lower costs, just as other industries have. Automation has gone from ATM banking to self-service airport kiosks and self-checkout grocery aisles. Amazon.com (AMZN) famously automated much of its fulfillment warehouses after its acquisition of Kiva Systems in 2012.Restaurant automation would be happening even without the pressures caused by the ""Fight for 15"" movement, Jeff Burnstein, president of the trade group Association for Advancing Automation, or A3, tells IBD.""Whether it's manufacturing or other businesses, companies are looking at better ways to do things that will improve productivity and lower costs,"" Burnstein said.Industry experts say the Fight for 15 movement has accelerated the automation push in the near term.But automation has benefits for the restaurant industry beyond lowering costs, Dan Kara, practice director for robotics at ABI Research, tells IBD. Benefits include avoiding worker injury and preventing food contamination, he says.The move to more automation in the quick-service restaurant business is in the early stages. Automating the order-taking and cashier functions is the easy part, Kara said. Next-generation customer kiosks will move from touchscreen order-taking to speech recognition to simplify and speed the process, he says.People are more accepting now of self-service and automation technologies at retail.""In Wendy's or McDonald's today, you get your own sodas now. At one time, somebody did that for you,"" Kara said.Travis Briggs, CEO and partner at Robo Global, is keeping an eye on the workforce automation movement for investment opportunities. His firm created the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO), which consists of more than 80 stocks focused on robotics and automation. The 3-year-old fund hit an all-time high earlier this month. It was up 0.2% on Friday.""The people component of the restaurant business is an extremely expensive one,"" Briggs said. ""That's just a natural area (for more automation). We're moving from the stage where it's interesting and a novelty to a new era where it's a necessity.""The ROBO index includes industrial automation firms ABB (ABB) and Hollysys Automation (HOLI), asset-tracking specialist Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), machine-vision firm Cognex (CGNX), automated driving technology firm Mobileye (MBLY), speech-recognition tech firm Nuance Communications (NUAN) and robotic surgery pioneer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).But even if restaurants shift to more automation, they'll still need human workers.""If the robot breaks down, who's going to make the hamburgers or the sushi?"" Burnstein said. Employment will shift from low-wage burger flippers to higher-wage technicians and engineers to service and maintain restaurant systems, he says.RELATED:Wendy's Serves Up Big Kiosk Expansion As Wage Hikes Hit Fast FoodMcDonald's CEO Dodges Harsh $15 Fast-Food Wage RealityBlame Minimum Wage, Not Carl's Jr. CEO, For Automated RestaurantsThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025

458,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) reported better-than-expected earnings and sales early Friday even as the fast-food giant comes up on year-ago comparisons to the launch of All-Day Breakfast, which revived U.S. sales.Earnings per share rose 7% to $1.50, a penny better than forecasts, as sales dipped 3% to $6.42 billion, topping views of $6.28 billion. Global same-store sales rose 3.5% excluding currency impacts.Even as the restaurant industry experiences a bit of a slump, Q3 same-store U.S. sales rose 1.3%, said the company, thanks to its All-Day Breakfast, McPick 2 offerings and artificial preservative-free Chicken McNuggets.Same-store sales at segment that includes the U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany grew 3.3%.The Foundational markets unit, which includes Japan, experienced a 10.1% pop in same-store sales. Most McDonald's Japan locations became Pokemon ""gyms"" and game-related hot spots over the summer, prompting massive comp growth, although that has begun to decelerate.Shares of McDonald's climbed 3% to close at 113.93 on the stock market today after falling to an 11-month low on Thursday. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) rose 3.2%.

459,MCD,"Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) says franchisees are dragging their feet in opening new stores amid concerns about a higher minimum wage and the outcome of the coming election.The doughnut and coffee chain, which opened up 61 stores in the third quarter compared with 91 in the year-ago quarter, told Wall Street analysts on Thursday that it now expects to wind up at the low end of its target of 430 to 460 stores opened for the full year.The news comes just days after a survey of McDonald's (MCD) franchisees found growing tensions with the parent company, with the independent operators complaining of too much discounting even as wage pressures are growing and sales growth has slowed.Both developments highlight the difficulty digesting big wage hikes for quick-service chains that get most of their revenue from the royalties paid by franchisees. While franchise agreements differ from company to company, they all generally deliver a fixed percentage of sales to the parent company, regardless of the underlying profitability of the restaurants.Dunkin' Brands CEO Nigel Travis specifically mentioned a New York franchisee that put on hold consideration of opening another location after the state passed a law raising the minimum wage in the fast-food industry to $15 an hour, by 2019 in New York City and July 2021 in the rest of the state.IBD'S TAKE: Read why the push for a $15 minimum wage may expose underlying issues in the franchise agreements of McDonald's and other fast-food chains.Wendy's (WEN) said in an August conference call that it had tabled plans to franchise out its company-operated stores in the New York area, though management didn't elaborate on how the wage hike affected the decision.Travis related a conversation he had with a franchisee in one state that he wouldn't name: ""You're going to open one store this year, why don't you open two? And their response was, uncertainty, regulation, we don't know where the minimum wage is going.""Travis summed up the shift this way: ""What is driving franchisees towards the lower end is several factors and I've described it, put it together as uncertainty, as uncertainty over the general election, Senate, obviously, the House and local elections.""Hillary Clinton has backed an increase in the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, but at times she has spoken favorably about raising the wage to $15. Still, Republicans remain solid favorites to retain the control of the House, so any big federal minimum-wage increase looks doubtful at the moment. Yet other states and municipalities could decide to follow the path of New York, California, Seattle and Washington, D.C., in boosting their own minimum wage.When Wal-Mart (WMT) pulled the plug on two planned store openings in D.C. in January, the retail giant reportedly told local officials that the city's consideration of a $15 wage was among the reasons.A study of Seattle's minimum-wage hike by University of Washington researchers found that the first-year rise in the minimum wage to $11 an hour was ""offset by modest reductions in employment and hours, thereby limiting the extent to which higher wages directly translated into higher average earnings.""Dunkin' stood by its forecast of 4%-6% U.S. growth in 2017. Still, it generally takes about 12 to 18 months to open a Dunkin' franchise, so major shifts in franchise growth in the short term are unlikely.To help make franchising economics work, Dunkin' management noted plans to share profits with franchisees related to its partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) to market ready-to-drink beverages in supermarkets and convenience stores starting early next year.RELATED:Dunkin' Earnings Growth Picks Up, But Sales Dip UnexpectedlyFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperMcDonald's Franchisees Are In A Funk — Like Its Stock

460,MCD,"The relative expense of dining out vs. eating at home continued to ratchet up in September, confronting the restaurant industry with a choice between losing customers or discounting and hurting profits.The cost of food at home dipped 0.1% last month, adjusted for seasonal factors, while the cost of food away from home rose 0.2%, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.Compared with a year ago, food at home costs 2.2% less, while limited service meals and snacks cost 2.6% more. The divergence in prices has accelerated over the past year as the restaurant industry digests higher wages, yet the problem has been building for close to two years.Since September 2014, prices of limited service meals and snacks are up 5.7%, while food-at-home costs 1.4% less than it did two years ago. That gap of 7.1 percentage points is the biggest price divergence since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began breaking out fast-food prices in the late 1990s.McDonald's (MCD) Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on a July 26 conference call, ""While we are benefiting from favorable commodity costs around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition.""He noted that menu prices were up about 3% from a year ago in the second quarter.McDonald's is set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday before the open. On Monday, analyst Mark Kalinowski cut his estimate for third-quarter same-restaurant sales to 0.2% from 1.8% based on the firm's quarterly survey of McDonald's franchisees. Independent operators, which pay a fixed percentage of sales for the use of the McDonald's brand, marketing and rent seem to be bearing the brunt of the squeeze on profits. Numerous franchisees in the survey commented on the company's overemphasis on discounting and excessive complexity in the kitchen.On an Aug. 10 earnings call, Wendy's (WEN) CEO Todd Penegor explained why the hamburger segment of the fast-food industry had been flat: ""It's gotten a lot cheaper, relatively speaking, to go get fresh beef at your local butcher and go home and grill it.""Prices for uncooked ground beef are down 8.9% from a year ago, as cheaper corn for feeding cattle has helped reverse an earlier spike in prices. Poultry prices for home consumption are down 2.9% from a year ago.Jack in the Box (JACK) reported a 3.7% decline in transactions in the second quarter, citing a ""migration (of business) from our industry to supermarkets.""Still, margins at Jack in the Box brand restaurants increased half a percentage point to 22.5% ""as favorable commodity costs more than offset wage inflation,"" said Jerry Rebel, Jack's chief financial officer.IBD'S TAKE: Read why the push for a $15 minimum wage may expose underlying issues in the franchise agreements of McDonald's and other fast-food chains.A central reason for the increase in the relative expense of food away from home has to do with wage pressures, both due to market pressures and minimum-wage mandates, says Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, which operates the Carl's Jr. chain. In a September op-ed, Puzder cited industry association data showing that restaurants are much more labor-intensive than grocery stores, with relative labor costs of close to 30% and 14% of sales, respectively.Still, quick-service chains may not be feeling as much heat as fast-casual chains. September restaurant sales data from TDn2K covering 25,000 locations showed same-restaurant sales fell 1.1% from a year ago in September, while customer traffic slumped 3.5%. Overall, restaurants are on pace for their worst performance since 2009. But the quick-service industry has bucked the trend, with a 2.2% rise in same-restaurant sales in the third quarter.Much of that outperforming, though, may be thanks to Domino's Pizza (DPZ), which reported a remarkable 13% jump in U.S. same-store sales.RELATED:McDonald's Franchisees Are In A Funk — Like Its Stock Domino's Pizza Stock Jumps, Nears Profit-Taking Zone On Strong Q3

461,MCD,"Ronald McDonald is keeping a low profile until all those creepy clown sightings subside, but McDonald's (MCD) is expected to produce a profit when it reports third-quarter earnings and revenue results on Friday.Analysts forecast per-share profit growing 6% to $1.49, which would mark a sequential deceleration from the previous quarter but the fifth straight quarter of year-to-year earnings gains. Revenue is seen declining 5% to $6.28 billion, however — a potential ninth consecutive quarter of sales tumbles.McDonald's is still a top five brand in young people's minds, according to Piper Jaffray's latest teen survey, although it has slipped in the rankings from No. 3 to No. 5 over the last three years among upper-income teens. With average-income teens, the Big Mac maker fell to No. 3 from No. 2.McDonald's shares lost 1% to 111.25 at the close Tuesday. The stock continues to trade below its 50-day and 200-day lines after breaking support at both key moving averages in late July.Last week, the company said that it expects to incur about $130 million in pretax charges in the third quarter, which comes out to 12 cents a share post-tax, as part of its global general and administrative and refranchising strategy, first announced in November of last year.IBD's TAKE: McDonald's franchisees don't feel great about business, according to a new Nomura survey, which noted that both franchisees' business outlooks and corporate-relations sentiments have declined: ""McDonald's Franchisees Are In A Funk — Like Its Stock.""Restaurant stocks have broadly been declining in recent months, with IBD's Retail-Restaurants group trading below its collective 50-day and 200-day lines.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares edged down 0.1% to 393.36.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) reported earlier Tuesday, handily beating on the top and bottom lines.

462,MCD,"Not even Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or Brexit have affected appetites for Domino's Pizza (DPZ), as its shares jumped more than 6% on earnings Tuesday, and its chief executive said he expects more consolidation among fast-casual rivals as the company grows.CEO Patrick Doyle told Investor's Business Daily that the company has no interest in participating in a merger via acquisition, but he said some fast-casual pizza restaurants could probably come together as more pop up.""At some point, scale matters, and there are enough different players within that category that I'm sure you will see some consolidation at some point,"" he said.During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Doyle also said enough fast-casual restaurants started up at the same time and have a similar approach that tie-ups were likely.That consolidation would come as Domino's tries to position itself as a better-ingredient pizza chain and as bigger players in the business take market share from smaller competitors.The consolidation would also follow Domino's outperforming a slumping restaurant sector. Domino's third-quarter U.S. same-store sales jumped 13%, well above views for an 8.8% increase, the company said on Tuesday.Earnings soared 43.3% to 96 cents a share, topping estimates for 90 cents. Overall revenue rose 16.9% to $566.7 million.Shares ended trading up nearly 5% to 159.45 on the stock market today. The stock saw a similar bounce after Domino's reported second-quarter earnings, but shares in recent weeks had trended closer to their 50-day line, a key test of investor support.International comp sales climbed 6.6%. The stronger dollar, particularly against the pound, remained difficult, as it has for other companies with a presence in the U.K. But Doyle said he doesn't anticipate this summer's Brexit vote hurting U.K. demand.""It still has to play out, and you're still a couple years away from the actual exit taking place,"" he said of the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. ""But honestly, I think that was overplayed at the time on just how big an effect that might have on the U.K. economy and on the global economy.""Shares of Domino's and Papa John's (PZZA) have been outliers in a restaurant industry where comparable store sales have lagged due to value-meal-related discounting. Consumers also appear more likely to eat in or order in as grocery prices fall and anxieties about global events weigh.Fast-food bellwether McDonald's (MCD) reports Friday and total sales are expected to continue declining.During the call, Doyle said that frozen-pizza offerings at grocery stores have not affected Domino's sales all that much, adding that they were more likely to cannibalize other frozen food.""Despite how they've tried to position themselves, one more sale of frozen pizza is one less sale of frozen lasagna,"" Doyle said on the call.Domino's and Papa John's, analysts say, have benefited from a variety of factors. Lower ingredient costs in general have allowed for healthier margins for the business and more value — and food — for consumers. Digital ordering technology also lends itself more easily to the pizza business, where customers have already been ordering delivery over the phone for decades.Analysts had been watching to see if Domino's could continue to buck the trends seen with other restaurants.""This quarter further demonstrates Domino's ability to leverage its digital platform to consistently take market share in a mature, slow growth category,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh wrote in a research note.""Domino's posted the best Q2 domestic same-store sales growth of the 25 largest restaurant chains in the U.S. -- and now looks poised to do so again in Q3, likely by a wide margin,"" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Since breaking out of a cup base on July 21, Domino's shares have continued to rise, staying above their 50-day line and earning a place on IBD's Leaderboard. On Tuesday's earnings, shares jumped out but could be extended, signaling a note of caution for new investors.Domino's results follow a difficult third quarter for Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands (YUM). Pizza Hut's same-store sales slid 1% during the quarter.""We believe that Domino's particularly took share from Pizza Hut (which reported a 2% same-store sales decline for its third quarter), regional pizza concepts, and mom-and-pop pizza shops,"" Kalinowski wrote.Smaller pizza restaurants are likely to suffer as Domino's strengthens its digital ordering platform, Kalinowski said. Domino's last month launched a bot that allows U.S. customers to order pizza via Facebook (FB) Messenger, following ordering platforms it has introduced via Amazon (AMZN) and Twitter (TWTR).Doyle would not comment specifically on what other platforms the company was targeting, saying it would continue to look at where their customers spend their time.Even as anxiety about the election and global events weigh elsewhere, Doyle said he hasn't seen any meaningful change in consumer behavior as a result. Instead, he credited company fundamentals for Domino's success, rather than a greater desire to eat in due to that anxiety.And he said a dip in demand for Election Day, typically a big night for pizza orders, appeared unlikely, even as the presidential campaign takes on a darker, meaner tone.""Any time people are gathering around television sets, we're going to feel a positive effect from that,"" Doyle said.""In terms of its overall effect on a quarter, it's just not big enough that you'll actually feel it in our numbers,"" he continued. ""Certainly anything that becomes a spectator sport — and this election has clearly become a spectator sport — is going to have some positive effect.""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-MartForget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar Stores

463,MCD,"If McDonald's (MCD) investors weren't aware of the growing tensions between the fast-food empire and its franchisees, they're probably starting to learn.Shares of the Golden Arches fell 1.5% to 112.41 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest levels in 11 months, after a survey of franchisees by Nomura analysts Mark Kalinowski and Ryan Kidd raised concerns about both third-quarter results and the company's longer-term outlook.Although the stock had already slid 13% from its all-time closing high of 131.60 on May 10, Nomura cut its price target to 122 from 129 and kept a neutral rating, citing franchisees' feedback on their own third-quarter sales.Armed with the input from 30 domestic franchisees that operate 271 locations, Kalinowski and Kidd sliced their view of same-restaurant sales growth to 0.2% for Q3, down from their prior view of a 1.8% rise and the consensus view of a 1.3% gain. Meanwhile, Nomura trimmed its earnings-per-share estimate by 4 cents to $5.55 for 2016 and 9 cents to $6.10 from 2017. McDonald's is set to report earnings on Friday before the market opens.Rising tensions between franchisees and management aren't a big surprise, given the difficult operating environment. Not only is there fierce competition for market share between McDonald's and other burger chains like Wendy's (WEN) and the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain, but restaurants have come under added pressure because of the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out. On top of that, mild weather last winter and early momentum from all-day breakfast are giving restaurants a high same-store-sales bar to match.Asked to quantify their six-month business outlook on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent, franchisees gave it a 2.37 rating, down from 2.63 in July. Using the same scale, franchisees characterized the relationship between the McDonald's corporation and its franchise operators as 1.73, down from 1.96 in July.""In general, we argue that corporations who have franchisees on board and enthusiastic about senior management's plans/strategy tend to fare better in general than those that don't enjoy this type of a situation, all else equal,"" wrote Kalinkowski and Kidd.IBD'S TAKE: Read why the push for a $15 minimum wage may expose underlying issues in the franchise agreements of McDonald's and other fast-food chains.Franchisee surveys like Nomura's offer invaluable insight, especially as companies like McDonald's shrink the number of company-operated restaurants, because few public companies report much detail about the profitability of the franchisees. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Popeye's (PLKI) are among the exceptions.Franchisees pay a fixed percentage of sales to the corporation to cover the royalty for using their brand, corporate marketing and, in many cases, rent. A typical franchisee has to pay McDonald's 20% or more of sales. This isn't a concern as long as franchisees are turning a decent profit, but the situation could become a problem if franchisees are barely scraping by or losing money, even as the parent company wants franchisees to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to remodel. That said, it's far from clear how concerned investors should be about franchisee performance, because of the lack of transparency.Still, it's worth considering some of the things that McDonald's franchisees surveyed by Nomura had to say about the big cheese's strategy:""We are discounting almost everything from all drinks to many items on the regular menu, and some items on the breakfast menu. It is all about top-line sales, not running profitable restaurants. That is why operators need several restaurants today, as the return on their investment dwindles.""""Stop most of discounting, produce ads about quality of food, reduce base rents so we can afford to hire some good people.""""Do something incredible with our fries. Like add a sauce: cheese, garlic … something to energize our incredible fries.""""We have so messed up what we are about – convenience (translation: customers get in and out QUICKLY) because we continue to add complexity on top of complexity, that I'm not sure we can deliver on the single biggest reason that people come to McDonald's. I think that this is why we are in decline and I think that significant changes to our operational complexity would lead to faster service and therefore would drive more customers to our restaurants. Technology can help with this. ... I'd probably fast-track the app that we were told a year ago would make it personal, convenient, and quick by allowing order/pay before walking in the store and allowing our staff to get ahead of the curve.""""Kick the discounting addiction. Focus on profitable sales, not just customer counts.""""McDonald's Corporate only knows one thing: discounting. No new ideas, no innovation, just discounting.""""Who do you talk to? Nobody knows anything. High turnover of regional staff. $500,000 interior doesn't build sales, destroys cash flow, impacts only 20%-30% of your customers.""""Very soon McDonald's will have downsized so much they can't meet their contractual obligations to franchisees.""""It is a great time to be in our part of the country. The Vision 20/20 plan should help performance the next few years.""""Corporation is cutting their costs with layoffs and changing corporate training. All those costs are being shifted to the Operators' restaurants.""""Marketing is geared to enrich McDonald's Corporation – driving sales through discounting and very little consideration given to profitable sales. The cost of doing business continues to rise, from the outside as well as McDonald's initiatives. It's increasingly difficult to achieve and predict profitability going forward with all of the increases.""""McDonald's does NOT care about the Operator. It only cares about stockholders. Nearly half the Operators are in financial distress yet McDonald's keeps piling on costly mandates and initiatives. The Corporation, in an effort to be politically correct, is on the WRONG SIDE of issues which directly hurt the Operators (minimum wage, unionization, etc.).""RELATED:Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

464,MCD,"Retail sales rose 0.6% in September, despite not much help from launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, the Commerce Department reported Friday.Sales hit the consensus forecast of a 0.6% rise overall and a 0.5% gain outside the auto sector.Last month's report, which showed that nonauto sales fell 0.1% in August, was revised to a 0.2% decline.After consumer spending slowed over the summer, a healthy recovery isn't expected to affect the Federal Reserve's timetable for rate hikes — one in December and two next year.The retail sales report reflected and shed light on evolving industry dynamics.Auto sales hit the gas in September, rising to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. While unit sales dropped from a year ago at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs performed relatively well.Sales from nonstore retailers led by Amazon (AMZN) rose 0.3% from August and 10.6% from a year ago following a rare 0.1% drop the prior month that was possibly an aftereffect of Amazon Prime Day in July.IBD'S TAKE: Health and personal care retailers have seen 7.8% year-over-year sales growth, strongest outside of nonstore retailers. Ulta Beauty, an IBD 50 stock, boosted sales and earnings forecasts on Thursday and saw its shares surge above a seven-week consolidation zone.Sales at electronics and appliance stores such as Best Buy (BBY) fell 0.9% despite the iPhone launch in mid-September. Best Buy shares are trading near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs after strong initial iPhone 7 demand and again this month as Samsung faced repeated overheating problems with its Note 7, finally deciding to end sales and production of the smartphone.Sales at food service and drinking places had been decelerating, as fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) cite pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.

465,MCD,"The U.S. economy expanded at a 1.2% annual rate in the second quarter, barely improving from Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% advance, the Commerce Department said Friday. Wall Street had expected a 2.6% pace.Consumer spending was very strong  -- up 4.2% -- but housing and business investment declined, the latter for a third straight quarter.It's also the third straight quarter of anemic overall growth. In addition to Q2's 1.2% and Q1's revised 0.8%, Q4 2015 GDP growth was cut to 0.9%. On a per capita basis, the U.S. economy is essentially flat.Recent corporate news has worrisome. Ford Motor (F) reported stalling U.S. sales, even with higher incentives. McDonald's (MCD) also reported weaker-than-expected U.S. sales in Q2, while analysts turn bearish about restaurant stocks generally. General Electric (GE) reported declining organic industrial revenue and a big drop in industrial orders.The latest weak GDP report pushed back expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike for at least another year. Going forward, the U.S. consumer may not step up spending so fast. Meanwhile, business investment likely won't rebound, with oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel and the Brexit vote freezing corporate spending plans in the U.K. and Europe.Eurozone GDP growth in Q2 -- pre-Brexit figures -- was just 0.3% (not annualized) vs. Q1's 0.5%, the slowest pace in 2 years. Year over year, the currency bloc's economy grew 1.6%, down from 1.7%.Separately, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for July was 90 from June's 93.5, though it was better than the preliminary 89.5 July reading. The gap between consumers' current and future expectations about the economy are the widest since 2006, a possible recession signal.Also, the U.S.  employment cost index rose 0.6% in Q2 vs. Q1, the Labor Department said Friday. Wages and benefits rose 2.3% vs. a year earlier, up from Q1's 1.9% pace but still modest.
"
466,MCD,"The consumer is back. So are jobs. Services prices are increasing at the fastest pace in more than seven years. Even industrial production, the economy's weakest link, is back on the rise. Stocks have shrugged off Brexit and are trading at record highs.What more does the Federal Reserve need to resume nudging up interest rates from close to zero?June sales surged 3.9% at building material and garden stores like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), the Commerce Department said Friday. Sales from nonstore retailers led by Amazon (AMZN) continued to impress, rising 1.1% on the month and 14.2% from a year ago. The latter was the strongest gain in a decade.Overall, retail sales rose 0.6%, triple the estimated gain. Auto sales edged up 0.1%, amid a down month for General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM), but gains at Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Core retail sales, excluding frequently volatile auto, gas and building material sales, rose 0.5% for a second straight month, following a 1.1% gain in April.The economy likely grew at a 2.75% annual rate in the second quarter, propelled by a gain of at least 4% in real consumer spending, says Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research.Yet he expects the Fed to stay on hold through the U.S. presidential election, then hike its key interest rate a quarter-point in December. Markets don't see another rate hike until March 2017, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.But markets have been on a roller-coaster ride since they woke up after the U.K. Brexit vote results came in on June 23. Stocks initially tumbled, but the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hit all-time highs this week. After falling to a historic low of 1.34% before last week's June employment report, the 10-year Treasury yield has bounced back to 1.59%. That jobs report, showing a 287,000 increase in payrolls, erased concerns caused by the negligible May payroll gain.For now, yields may keep rising without a Fed hike because markets might start to price in a faster pace of rate increases in 2017 and 2018.Fed policymakers have signaled that they want time to assess the impact of the U.K. voting to leave the European Union. Initial indications are that the vote will hurt the U.K. but shouldn't be much of a negative for the U.S., which got a short-term boost from lower interest rates that fueled a surge of mortgage refinancing.While eurozone economies are expected to face a drag from weaker trade with the U.K., the real wild card is whether the political backlash that spurred the Brexit vote spreads to other parts of Europe, especially Italy. The next shoe to drop could come in October, when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's package of constitutional reforms meant to overcome gridlock faces a referendum.If Renzi's vote fails, he'll be on the way out, and the vacuum could put the anti-EU Five Star Movement in the driver's seat. But all that could take a year or more to play out, and the odds of Italy ever abandoning the euro are slim.Bottom line, European politics are unlikely to provide the Fed much of an excuse to stay on the sideline for long, particularly if core inflation continues to pick up.The core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in June and 2.3% from a year ago. The annual gain matched the biggest increase since September 2008.Services inflation, excluding energy services, rose 3.2% from a year ago in June, also matching May's gain for the biggest since September 2008.The Fed has set a 2% inflation target. But the central bank's preferred price gauge, the PCE deflator in the income and spending report, showed only a 1.6% annual gain as of May.Food prices fell 0.1% in June, as the price of food consumed at home fell 0.3% and the food away from home rose 0.2%. Now, food at home costs 1.3% less than a year ago, while food away from home is up 2.6%. That pricing differential may be among the reasons why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) have a seen a slowdown.Sales at food services and drinking places fell 0.3% in May, one of the softest spots in an otherwise solid retail report.Meanwhile, industrial production perked up 0.6% in June, the best gain in 11 months. Manufacturing output rose 0.4%, mining 0.2% and utilities 2.4%. That's the first time all year that each of the three categories saw an increase.Overnight, China said the world's No. 2 economy expanded 6.7% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier, matching Q1's pace. Economists had expected a dip to 6.6%. Meanwhile, separate June reports on industrial production, retail sales and bank loans all showed accelerating growth, topping forecasts.

470,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) is reportedly struggling to find qualified bidders for its China outlets in an auction that could bring in as much as $3 billion.The franchising of its China stores is part of the company's earlier reported revitalization plan. The plan also includes revamping its menu, including making breakfasts available all day long, and is seen as a way to distance itself from earlier food scandals in China.In May, McDonald's said it would streamline its international operations into four market segments, each headed by a then-current McDonald's executive, to cut down on bureaucracy.The world's biggest restaurant company has received more than a half-dozen bids. Among the bidders are state-owned China Cinda Asset Management, dairy foods company Beijing Sanyuan Foods, Sanpower Group and noodle shop owner ChemChina, another state-owned company, the Financial Times reported.The franchise auction reportedly involves local partners taking over the company's 2,800-store China and Hong Kong stores for 20 years and paying royalties to McDonald's.After reporting four quarters of shrinking earnings, McDonald's has reported double-digit earnings growth for the last three quarters in a row. It's projected to record a 22% jump in earnings per share for the current quarter.

473,MCD,"The oldest operating McDonald's (MCD), in Downey, Calif., doesn't look like other McDonald's locations across the country. The building is the size of a studio apartment, with horizontal red and white stripes. Towering over the parking lot is a sign that says ""Hamburgers,"" atop which stands Speedee, the hamburger-faced predecessor to Ronald McDonald. A museum contains a shake machine, paper cups and other fast-food artifacts.Just last year, the global icon, once one of the market's most tireless growth stocks, appeared to be on the brink of becoming a museum relic itself. Fast-casual darlings like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Shake Shack (SHAK) threatened to render the giant obsolete. But McDonald's has since shown a nimbleness under CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over in March 2015 and revived sales starting last fall.McDonald's now is approaching some tough year-over-year comparisons, and parts of the industry are reporting weakness during the second quarter. But a follow-up act is in the works that could set the stock on another run, as the 61-year-old company tries to reimagine what a fast-food burger can be without alienating its core customers.""The one good thing about a restaurant is that people have to eat every day, and everybody loves a good burger,"" said Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth.
"
474,MCD,"Visiting the Downey McDonald's, which opened in the 1950s, you get the sense that you're about to taste in purer form whatever it was that made a nation — and the world — fall in love with fast food.But bite into a hamburger there, and it tastes like any other hamburger from any other McDonald's being nipped at by ""better-burger"" rivals like Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out.""The meat's fresh, their fries are not Frankenfoods,"" Feinseth said of a trip to In-N-Out. ""They take the potato, they just julienne it and put it in the fryer. It's fresh, it's delicious, and that, by the way, was what McDonald's was.""That quality helped McDonald's, which came public in 1965, become one of the U.S. stock market's all-time success stories. From its low in the 1973-74 bear market, the stock has soared 23,000%, while blue chip stalwarts like GE (GE) and IBM (IBM) are up 5,000% and 1,600%, respectively. Put another way, $10,000 invested in McDonald's then would be worth $2.31 million now.Recent years, however, have seen a backlash against fast food and changes in eating habits toward fresher ingredients. Many young diners dismissed McDonald's food as poison. The Golden Arches appeared in need of change. But change into what? And from what? Over the past 10 years, what it was had become unclear.Indeed, the company inadvertently nurtured Chipotle into a leader of a fast-casual movement that threatened to kill it.In 2006, McDonald's sold off its ownership of the burrito chain, after having taken a minority stake in 1998. The burger chain said the decision would allow Chipotle to focus on Chipotle, while McDonald's could exact a ""singular focus on brand McDonald's.""Since then, fresh offerings from better-burger rivals lured away customers. Some of McDonald's attempts to go slightly higher-end weren't landing. Demand to be all things to all people, some analysts say, cluttered the menu. And franchisees, already contending with calls to pay employees more, were reluctant to get behind the value offerings the company built much of its reputation on.""For a number of years, (McDonald's) didn't have anything to really say,"" SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett told IBD.From mid-2013 to mid-2015, U.S. same-store sales fell or were flat, and the stock meandered through a listless, sideways pattern.Before Steve Easterbrook took over last March, he helped engineer a turnaround in Europe. He became the new CEO of McDonald's U.K. in 2006. Shortly after, he went on BBC's Newsnight to debate Eric Schlosser, author of the 2001 book ""Fast Food Nation,"" among the harshest indictments ever of the fast-food industry.Easterbrook also reduced salt levels in products and introduced more visible nutrition labels, as well as fair-trade, sustainably produced coffee. A McDonald's public-relations campaign called ""Make Up Your Own Mind"" sought to address questions about how the chain's food was made.U.K. division sales improved, and Easterbrook's efforts would serve as a blueprint for the company's turnaround.""That U.K. example is one that I point to, to kind of show that perceptions can change,"" Bartlett said.Since Easterbrook became McDonald's CEO, the company said it would begin using chickens that weren't raised with antibiotics used in human medicine and start working toward sourcing all its eggs for U.S. and Canadian restaurants from cage-free chickens.The company brought back butter and the English muffin to the Egg McMuffin. It showed it was listening and willing to try new things by introducing items such as the Artisan Grilled Chicken sandwich and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It experimented with digital orders and customization.""I think to some degree, the corporate culture in the past was like, 'Let's perfect everything before we roll it out,' "" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said. ""I think part of the cultural change that Steve is bringing is, 'Look, it doesn't have to be perfect for us to roll something out.' ""Those smaller rollouts, announced over 2015, helped pave the way for the biggest one of the year: All Day Breakfast.The October launch of All Day Breakfast, which many say is at the heart of McDonald's recent sales and earnings rebound, was easy for a number of reasons. The marketing, for one, was in the title. And unlike burgers, many breakfast items don't require raising and tending to a cow, so they cost less. Those items were also already on the menu and didn't need the testing required of new products.Making only some breakfast items available all day made the service less difficult to deliver during non-breakfast hours by easing demands on grill space. The service also managed to unlock sales from people who decided that maybe they wanted some breakfast with their lunch or dinner.""People look at one of those Egg McMuffins like a snack item,"" Feinseth said. He later added: ""You get a Quarter Pounder and you add the McMuffin.""Sales strengthened. In Q3 2015, U.S. comps grew 0.9%, followed by a 5.7% gain in Q4 and a 5.4% increase in Q1 2016. Earnings have rebounded to double-digit growth and look to stay there for the next few years after retreating in five out of the last six quarters.Still, total revenue has been falling since mid-2014, as the strong dollar has weighed on overseas results. Future quarters should see a tougher currency headwind.The stronger dollar has weighed on McDonald's international prospects in recent months, making it an underperformer vs. the S&P 500. Shares are down 8% from an all-time intraday high of 131.96 reached May 10. They finished Friday trading up fractionally to 121.31.Nevertheless, the stock is up 25% from a year ago. That easily outpaces Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) 4% uptick as well as declines of 34% at Shake Shack, 4% at Jack In The Box (JACK) and 10% at Wendy's (WEN).That's not to say the breakfast move was painless. ""The kitchen is impossible with All Day Breakfast,"" a franchisee said in a Nomura survey. ""It is killing our people.""But McDonald's didn't retreat. Despite the added complexity all-day breakfast requires, the customers wanted it, and on Wednesday McDonald's announced it will add more breakfast items to the all-day menu.As McDonald's looks to maintain its momentum, the company faces a delicate balancing act: How aggressively should it aim higher, toward better ingredients, without alienating millions of loyal customers who show up for the cheap food? Adding to the dilemma are higher wages, which also push prices higher.To appeal to cost-conscious diners squeezed by an anemic economic expansion that barely added to Americans' pay, value offerings have proliferated. McDonald's had tried out a Dollar Menu, causing an uproar from franchisees while doing little to improve its fast-food image. Then it started the McPick earlier this year, offering two items for $2. Franchisees called that version of the offer an ""absolute disaster"" and ""a suicide mission,"" according to Nomura's survey.But the company's recent decision to bump up the McPick to two items for $5 has worked better, and more gains could be ahead if diners become accustomed to paying the higher price.""At the very least, it teaches consumers McDonald's is not the Dollar-Menu company,"" Kalinowski said. ""I think that's healthy for the McDonald's system in terms of people (not just viewing) McDonald's as cheap food and that's it.""Along those lines, the company in May said it was testing fresh, never-frozen hamburger patties in 14 locations in the Dallas area. It has also tested garlic fries, bratwurst, new Big Macs, breakfast bowls and a Sriracha sauce.But systemwide changes could be slow to come. And a bigger rollout of a fresher hamburger could pressure McDonald's margins and upend preparations behind the counter.SunTrust's Bartlett sees the way forward involving a nationwide marketing effort behind the McPick, noting that higher-end chains like Shake Shack are already known for being more expensive and have leeway to charge more.""You have to be a lot of things to a lot of people. One of the things is you have to have that value consumer; you have to offer a good solution to them,"" he said. ""So this idea of just improving the quality of the food so that you can just charge more, and sales go up, and everyone's happy — some people just don't want to pay more.""But an RBC Capital Markets survey released in May suggested that if McDonald's uses better-quality ingredients, customers are likely to pay more.Perceptions of affordability seemed ""to be more of a function of 'what you get' than 'what you pay,' "" indicating that diners ""will be willing to pay up for what they perceive to be the 'good stuff,' "" RBC said.And despite McDonald's affordable value deals, customers gave it only a middling score on affordability.Meanwhile, Kalinowski singled out McDonald's fresh hamburger test, saying in a research note that it ""has the potential to be a big, big deal,"" as it would give customers better-tasting food cooked more quickly, meaning faster service and more customers cycling through the restaurant.Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy thinks the key to continuing growth is to still have value offerings but to focus on better ingredients.""It helps to widen your audience, it can help change misconceptions about the brand, and I think it speaks to the audience that you're looking for — the younger generation that may have turned its back on McDonald's,"" he said.

477,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) move to trademark ""Better Burger"" didn't just signal a possible new burger chain. It also underscores that Chipotle's core business may have peaked.Chipotle is just starting to recover from a slew of E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at several of its restaurants late last year, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ending its investigation on Feb. 1. Same-store sales plunged 14.6% in the fourth quarter and were down 26% in February. Chipotle has predicted it would report its first-ever quarterly loss in Q1.The burrito giant should see a rebound in sales from depressed levels. Consumer sentiment regarding Chipotle bottomed in January, according to William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia on Friday, citing her survey  of 800 adults. But while Chipotle's stock also bottomed in January, it hasn't made much of a recovery.IBD's Take: How Healthy Is Chipotle's stock and how does it stack up vs. rivals?But Chipotle's growth was decelerating rapidly, even before the food illness outbreaks. And other industry data also suggest that demand for Mexican food generally is no longer outpacing other types of cuisine.Chipotle is the king of fast casual eateries, as well as the clear leader among similar Tex-Mex chains, such as Jack In The Box (JACK)-owned Qdoba Mexican Eats, privately owned Freebirds World Burrito and more.But the Mexican restaurant sector is maturing, while upscale burger chains are growing in popularity, according to market tracking firm Technomic's President Darren Tristano.""When we looked at the market in 2015, sales in the (upscale) 'better burger' category grew 15%. Mexican slowed down to only 7% or 8%,"" he told IBD. Mexican restaurant growth had also been in the double digits.Take a look at the figures for high-flying burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK). There, sales rose 47%, but that was just $51 million compared with Chipotle's revenue at just under $1 billion in the fourth quarter.Chipotle needs to continue diversifying to grow, Tristano said.""When you have such large sales growth, it has to slow down. We saw that with a lot of other fast casuals too,"" he said.Sandwich and bakery chain Panera Bread (PNRA) used to enjoy double-digit and then high-single-digit same-store growth. But in the fourth quarter, that was reduced to 3.4%.It's not surprising that Chipotle's growth has faltered, but what is astounding is that it stayed so high for so long. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Chipotle's same-store sales rose a robust 9.3% vs. a year earlier. But comparable growth then accelerated every quarter until it peaked at 19.8% in the third quarter of 2014.""It was just getting bigger and bigger a few years ago,"" Argus Research analyst John Staszak said. ""Comparisons were getting more difficult.""Same-store sales growth cooled to 16.1% in Q4 2014, then to 10.4%, 4.3% and 2.6% in the first three quarters of 2015, respectively. Some of that was due to carnitas shortages as the company sought more humane suppliers.Another factor to consider is that Chipotle's food-illness woes haven't necessarily helped rivals. Jack-In-The-Box's Qdoba reported same-store sales growth slowed to 1.8% in its latest quarter, down from 14% a year earlier.Total U.S. Mexican restaurant sales grew at a 2.9% annual rate from 2010 to 2015, when they reached $38 billion, IBISWorld said in a report. The market tracker forecasts growth will slow to 2.5% a year for the 2015-2020 period.Further, Chipotle and its peers are losing ground when it comes to satisfying the public's appetite for hotter cuisines. Diners still love spicy foods, but that's expanded beyond Mexican and Asian dishes to fare such as KFC's spicy chicken wings and Restaurant Brands International (QSR)-owned Burger King's ""Angriest Whopper,"" which features hot sauce in the bun.""People looking for spicy foods might be headed for a Mexican restaurant, but there are many other choices for Americans now,"" Tristano said.Chipotle has already expanded into the Asian food sector with its ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants, though it hasn't rapidly increased those locations. It's dipped its toe into the fast-growing custom pizza sector by investing in the Locale pizzeria chain.Despite slowing growth, analysts are still bullish on Chipotle.""There is still strong association with the Chipotle brand. People have very short memories"" for health scares, said Bonnie Riggs, restaurant analyst for market-tracking firm NPD Group.In addition to eyeing the high-end burger sector, Chipotle at the end of March began testing an expanded drinks menu at a store in its home city of Denver as another way to regain customers and boost same-store sales and margins. Some analysts still see an opportunity to expand into breakfast.And the biggest mid-term source of growth is simply creating more Chipotle locations. The company added 192 stores in 2014 and 229 locations in 2015, with 220-235 planned in 2016.Investors can take heart, however. A restaurant operator that is maturing doesn't necessarily mean a death knell for the stock. Investors can, and usually do, reset expectations.Take a look at Panera, which is trading at-all time highs. There's also the fast-food king, McDonald's (MCD), which has rebounded to record highs, largely over excitement that U.S. same-store sales have turned positive following a long slump.And don't forget that expanding into burgers would bring some symmetry to Chipotle's story. McDonald's, home of the Big Mac, was a big Chipotle investor before divesting its stake.

478,MCD,"Stocks finished lower Thursday as earnings reports continued to pour in, with some big names falling after hours on quarterly misses.The Dow Jones industrial average led the downside with a 0.6% loss, the S&P 500 gave up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq edged nearly 0.05% lower. Volume was mixed in the stock market today, slightly higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary figures. Losers topped winners by a 5-3 margin on the NYSE; decliners barely outpaced advancers on the Nasdaq.The biggest losers included transportation, retail and homebuilder stocks. Oil drillers also lagged, as West Texas intermediate crude slid 2% to $43.26 a barrel. United Continental (UAL) slumped 10% to a two-month low in turbulent trade. The airline on Wednesday reported Q1 earnings and sales that fell 19% and 5%, respectively.On the Dow, Travelers (TRV) gapped down and sank 6%, closing well below its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover. The insurance giant reported Q1 revenue that beat, but earnings that missed consensus estimates.Mellanox (MLNX) gapped down and plunged 12% in massive volume. Shares fell below their 50-day line and undercut a 47.79 buy point of a cup with handle. The chip designer announced Q1 profit and sales that topped views, but its Q2 revenue outlook came in below estimates.Apparel makers and drug stocks outperformed. Among apparel makers, Under Armour (UA) gapped up and leapt 7% to a four-month high, clearing a 34.33 buy point of a cup with handle in fast trade. The sports apparel and athletic shoe maker reported Q1 results that beat forecasts.On the IBD 50, Citrix Systems (CTXS) surged as much as 12% to a 16-year high before easing to close with a 4% gain. The stock cleared an 84.27 buy point in brisk trade, but closed slightly below the entry. RBC Capital and Needham raised their price targets on the software maker, whose Q1 results late Wednesday crushed forecasts.After the close Thursday, Starbucks (SBUX) reported fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue that missed views, and provided a lower-than-expected outlook. Shares fell 5% after hours.Alphabet (GOOGL) was also down in extended trading, after the Internet giant's Q1 results came in below forecasts. As usual, the company didn't offer forward guidance.Microsoft (MSFT) fell 4% after hours, also on a miss on both the top and bottom lines.Economic news was mixed. Jobless claims fell for a second week, by more than 2% to 247,000, well below views for 265,000 claims. The Conference Board's leading economic indicators index climbed 0.2% in March, up from a 0.1% dip in February but below projections for a 0.5% increase.A light slate Friday includes the Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing Index for April and Baker-Hughes' weekly rig count.Earnings are on tap Friday from McDonald’s (MCD), Caterpillar (CAT), General Electric (GE) and American Airlines (AAL).

479,MCD,"The dollar has been the not-so-jolly green giant for corporate America since mid-2014, cutting top- and bottom-line growth. But with the buck retreating, the negative impact for IBM (IBM) and other U.S. multinationals faded in Q1 results, with even more improvement expected going forward.The U.S. dollar index fell Tuesday to its lowest levels since last August's flash market crash. That continued a downtrend this year after a huge run from mid-2014 to late last year. S&P 500 companies with heavy overseas exposure already are seeing smaller FX losses and raising full-year guidance on currency trends.""About 50% of (Johnson & Johnson's) sales come from overseas,"" said Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That’s an encouraging sign.""The dollar index shot up 25% from June 2014 to November 2015. That made U.S. exports less competitive, while reducing the dollar value of overseas income and revenue.The strong buck also contributed to the huge sell-off in dollar-priced commodities, with crude oil falling as much as 75%, hurting energy companies and emerging markets, both of which hurt the industrial sector.The dollar rose in large part because the Federal Reserve was moving toward raising rates, which it finally did last December, while other central banks eased policy. But the Fed has turned more dovish this year amid sluggish economic growth and financial turmoil earlier this year. The Fed now indicates just two rate hikes this year, down from four previously, with markets seeing just one tightening step, perhaps not until September.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank pushed ahead with negative rate policies, but their currencies unexpectedly rallied on those moves.  Also, China's yuan recovered its early 2016 losses vs. the dollar.""The dollar index was up 14% (year over year) as of August 2015,"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The dollar is now down about 4% vs. a year earlier, suggesting that the FX impact will continue to fade or even start to turn positive. The weaker dollar also has helped U.S. crude prices rise back above $40 a barrel from the mid-$20s in January.A slew of corporate giants with huge international exposure likely will report less of a dollar impact in the next week or so. General Motors (GM) and Alphabet (GOOGL) report on Thursday, with McDonald's (MCD) and General Electric (GE) on Friday.  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) are on tap next week.But ""less bad"" isn't quite the same as good. Apple is expected to post a rare sales decline. Overall S&P 500 Q1 earnings likely fell 7.6% while sales dipped 1.3%, according to analysts polled  by Thomson Reuters. Excluding energy, earnings are forecast to slip 2.3% with revenue up 1.7%.

480,MCD,"President Obama in 2011 endorsed a U.S. pivot to Asia, working to strengthen alliances in the region as China rises. Now McDonald's (MCD) is making its own strategic shift, announcing plans Thursday to add more than 1,500 locations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea over the next five years.The fast food giant already owns more than 2,800 restaurants in those markets, mostly company owned. But this time McDonald's said it's seeking ""strategic partners who will add value and unlock growth potential in key markets"" to help in its Asia expansion.""This will allow McDonald's to accelerate our growth and scale faster across diverse markets placing us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement. We're in the midst of transforming our business and taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to enhance our ability to grow around the world. These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision-making and achieve restaurant growth.""McDonald's recently said it was seeking strategic allies in Japan and Taiwan. McDonald's has a goal of boosting franchise locations to 95%, even in the U.S. where the franchise model is under attack.In China alone, McDonald's will boost its store count to 3,500 from 2,200 now, Easterbrook told the Wall Street Journal. That would make China its No. 2 market after the U.S. and ahead of Japan.McDonald’s has over 14,000 locations in the U.S. and more than 36,000 worldwide.McDonald's Asia expansion comes as Yum Brands (YUM) seeks to spin off its China operations. Yum's KFC and Pizza Hut chains have a big foothold in China, with Taco Bell set to open its first location in the country this year. China used to be a huge growth driver for Yum, but food illness scares slammed sales, which have been slow to recover.McDonald's has seen its U.S. business improve, helped by an all-day breakfast menu and other changes. Thursday's announcement suggests the company is now turning its attention to overseas initiatives as well.McDonald's shares rose as high as 126.96 on the stock market today, a new record, but pulled back to close up 3 cents at 12.86. On Wednesday, shares moved out of a cup base with a buy point of 124.93.Sonic Corp. (SONC), a burgers-and-shakes chain, rose 1.7% to 35.16, extending its breakout. On Wednesday, shares soared  6.2% to 34.58, clearing a consolidation to a 1-year high. Sonic reported strong earnings late Tuesday.Yum Brands fell 0.5% at 81.85.

481,MCD,"If Google and its Hands Free payments app can achieve a critical mass of brick-and-mortar stores, other digital wallet companies and payments processors could find themselves facing tougher competition -- at least, based on my test of the app.Hands Free is designed to eliminate the need to pull out a smartphone and tap it on a point-of-sale system when paying with Android Pay. It uses a combination of your initials, phone and picture to complete each transaction. And it works. Well.Google, which is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), rolled out Hands Free in March to at least 15 businesses with locations around the South San Francisco Bay Area. Since IBD's Silicon Valley bureau is located near several, I decided to test the idea of ordering and paying for something with only my voice -- part of the future we've been promised.After taking a selfie -- a photo is required to use the Hands Free app -- on my Nexus 5X phone, I headed to a nearby McDonald's (MCD), one of the chains participating in the pilot program. A colleague in the newsroom wanted a Diet Coke, and I was happy to oblige. Phone in my pocket, I walked up to the cash register, placed my order for a medium Diet Coke and then uttered the phrase ""Can I pay with Google?""The cashier skipped a beat and replied, ""Of course you can! Initials?"" I replied with mine. ""M.C. Hammer!"" she said, and pressed a few more buttons on the register.""Wearing a hat today, I see,"" she said, studying my hatless selfie on the register. And then she handed the beverage over with a receipt (I got an emailed receipt as well). Neither my phone nor wallet ever left my pockets.My order was small and the test limited, but it's clear that the implications could be far-reaching if consumers take to the idea. If Hands Free were available widely, I would certainly use it -- paying with just your voice is incredibly easy (and cool, too).At its core, Hands Free takes a swing at a big issue in payments (and e-commerce in general): how to make checkout as frictionless as possible.PayPal (PYPL) and its most recent endeavor on that front, One Touch, also attacks the friction problem. Apple (AAPL) Pay and rival Android Pay are also trying to innovate around the friction Silicon Valley perceives in paying with cash, a credit card or a mobile phone.With Google running a relatively small pilot program, it's hard to say at this early stage what impact Hands Free will have on its digital wallet.I doubt that being able to pay with Hands Free would alter where I go to buy things, but it just might be enough to convince me to pick Android Pay over its competitors.

482,MCD,"Private-sector employers continued to hire at a steady rate this month, adding 200,000 jobs after a slightly downward revised 209,300 in February, the ADP National Employment Report.Services firms accounted for 190,900 new hires, the vast bulk of new employment. Manufacturing added 2,600 jobs after losing 8,600 jobs in February. Boeing (BA) said Wednesday it would cut 4,550 jobs.Small firms led the way, adding 85,700 jobs, while large enterprises' net hiring slowed to 38,800. But year-over-year, large firms are adding jobs at the fastest pace since May 2012, while small business hiring is the weakest since mid-2014.Also, franchise employment rose by 22,000 in March and 4.1% vs. a year earlier, largely on restaurant franchise gains.  The National Labor Relations Board and several minimum wage hike efforts are singling out the franchise model used by McDonald's (MCD), Yum Brands (YUM) and many other fast-food chains.The Labor Department will release its March employment report on Friday. Economists expect to see a rise in nonfarm payrolls, including government jobs, of 210,000. They also expect a rise in hourly earnings and the average workweek, after weekly pay fell a stunning 0.5% last month.Image provided by Shutterstock.

484,MCD,"Grant Chen's Seattle restaurant netted just $8,856.57 last year after he had to start paying a minimum wage of $11 an hour. Starbucks (SBUX) raked in about $2.8 billion.So here's a puzzle: How can it be that the city's minimum-wage law puts Chen, a decidedly small-time restaurant owner, in the same large-employer category as Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz?You might call it guilt by association. Chen, a second-generation Chinese American, pooled together retirement savings with a few friends, along with loans from family members, and used the money to buy a franchise of a fast-casual chain that could provide the stability of a familiar brand, training and procedures that wouldn't require them to reinvent the wheel.Yet now national chains like McDonald's (MCD) that use the franchise model are under political and legal attack on multiple fronts. Small businesses — many of them minority-owned — are suffering collateral damage.Under the Seattle law, and potentially to a much greater extent under New York state's minimum-wage hike for fast-food outlets, small-business owners are being penalized for their association with large corporations that license out their brands.Discriminating against franchises ""paints the cross hairs on a disadvantaged portion of the population that utilizes the franchise model because the barriers to entry are low,"" Chen wrote in a blog post. The title: ""Seattle's $15 Minimum Wage Is Driving My Restaurant Out Of Business.""The crackdown on franchising comes even as minority ownership of franchises is surging, providing a tried and true method of democratizing the benefits of capitalism. The latest data from the Census Bureau released late in 2015 show that among businesses with at least 10 employees who operate franchises, 17.5% were minority-owned in 2012, up from 13.8% in 2007. Meanwhile, outside the franchise business, just 10.8% of firms with 10-plus workers were minority-owned.This year, Chen and Starbucks have to pay a minimum of $13 an hour, rising to $15 in 2017, with inflation adjustments thereafter. Smaller employers, those with 500 workers or fewer, get two extra years before they have to pay $15.In New York state, where the minimum-wage just began rising toward $15 an hour for quick-service chains with at least 30 U.S. locations, even small-business operators with a single location are on the hook for the higher wage. Meanwhile, the state's minimum wage for everyone else is $9 an hour, at least for now.The higher New York wage applies to a broad range of limited-service or takeout places, including Starbucks, Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell, Shake Shack (SHAK), Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN), Jamba Juice (JMBA), Wendy's (WEN) and Subway.The earliest consequences of this attack on national franchises are mostly confined to Seattle and New York state. Yet the consequences for the franchise business model could be incredibly far-reaching if courts uphold the National Labor Relations Board decision to designate McDonald's a joint employer of the 90% of its workers who are hired, managed and paid by franchise operators.That case, now being argued before an NLRB administrative law judge in Chicago, could put companies that use the franchise model on the hook for labor violations by the franchisees that operate company-branded restaurants.""To protect yourself, you would have to manage the employees,"" said Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, the company behind chains Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.""At that point, the 4% royalty doesn't work anymore,"" Puzder said, referring to the common 4% of revenue that goes to the franchisor as payment for everything it provides to help a franchise succeed.Further, if the franchisor is found to be a joint employer with its franchisees, that would effectively turn small businesses into large ones and create new liability to provide workers clocking 30 hours a week with health insurance under ObamaCare's employer mandate, says David Kaufmann, whose law firm Kaufmann Gildin & Robbins represents franchise industry employers.But the primary objective in rewriting decades of law and regulations governing the franchise industry is ""unionizing workers at franchises,"" Kaufmann said.Unquestionably, the push to unionize would be easier. Instead of organizing workers at individual franchises or groups of outlets under common ownership, unions could deal directly with the corporations behind the brands.The big flaw in the NLRB's case is that McDonald's, like other big franchisors, doesn't control the workers at its franchise locations and doesn't have the power to tell franchise operators how much to pay in wages. That reality was evident when McDonald's said last year it would raise its starting wage at company-owned locations to $1 above the local minimum wage. Franchise operators were reportedly less than thrilled by the move, likely because their workers wanted the same deal. But they had the ultimate decision.The NLRB joint-employer designation would fundamentally redefine the role of a franchisee, from someone who puts up risk capital and runs a business to make a profit into one among perhaps hundreds or even thousands of middle managers in a corporate empire.""The ability to run my own business was the very reason I put my savings on the line to become a franchisee,"" wrote Amir Siddiqi in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last year.Born in Pakistan, Siddiqi came to the U.S. at age 19 in 1985 and worked as a dishwasher at a Carl's Jr. across the street from his community college. He eventually worked his way up through management of the parent company, then seized the chance to become his own boss, putting up all of his savings and borrowing the rest needed to buy three Carl's Jr. franchises. Now he has more than 40 restaurants and 900 workers, including teenagers and immigrants working their first jobs.Making franchisors joint employers, Siddiqi said, could ""destroy a road to the American dream for people who are willing to take some risks for the chance to build a business and a better life.""The NLRB's joint-employer rule is expected to wind up before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and possibly the Supreme Court before it takes effect. Meanwhile, the International Association of Franchises has joined business owners in asking the Supreme Court to invalidate Seattle's discriminatory treatment of franchises. Among the petitioners is Ronald Oh, whose dad fled North Korea as a youngster. Now the family has its livelihood invested in a Holiday Inn Express (IHG) with a few dozen employees.""The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket,"" Oh said at a hearing on the wage hike, quoting Andrew Carnegie. ""This is our basket, and the eggs are the lives of my entire extended family. We are watching that basket carefully.""

485,MCD,"Buybacks stormed back into the news last week, with Bank of America (BAC) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM) announcing they will return more capital to shareholders ahead of their annual stress tests.That perhaps reassured buyback ETF investors, as doubts grow about whether the trend has legs.In 2015, S&P 500 companies spent $572.2 billion on buybacks, up 3.4% from the previous year, according to new data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Total shareholder return for those companies, including dividends and buybacks, in 2015 set a 12-month record, at $954.6 billion.""The report of buybacks' death was greatly exaggerated,” Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a press statement accompanying the data release.For companies, buybacks -- like dividends -- are a way to keep investors happy. Reducing the number of outstanding shares in a company drives up stock prices. And it's easy to do at a time when corporate cash hoards are growing and borrowing costs are near record lows.However, Silverblatt's research noted that S&P 500 buybacks actually ticked down 3% in Q4 over the previous quarter, to $145.9 billion. Some strategists argue that buybacks are no longer fueling share prices the way they did in the past.That seems to be true, as seen through the prism of exchange traded funds tracking buyback firms.SPDR S&P 500 Buyback (SPYB), which follows an index of the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios in the S&P 500, tumbled 7.2% in the year ended March 22. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slipped 0.7%.However, buyback ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term.PowerShares Buyback Achievers (PKW), the largest ETF in its segment, produced an annual average 13.4% gain over the past five years vs. 11.9% for SPY. SPYB does not have a three- or five-year history.PKW holds $1.77 billion in assets and tracks an index of U.S. companies that repurchased at least 5% of their outstanding shares in the previous 12 months.In theory, buyback ETFs give investors exposure to quality businesses. Companies buying back their own shares tend to have healthy bottom lines. The top three holdings out of 233 in the PKW portfolio are McDonald’s (MCD), Boeing (BA) and Qualcomm (QCOM).The ETF has been outgunned year-to-date, and over the past two and three years, by a smaller and newer actively managed peer.AdvisorShares TrimTabs Float Shrink (TTFS) invests in buyback companies while adding free cash flow and leverage screens. That helps it filter out low-quality stocks.""We try to find companies that don't finance buybacks with debt,"" said Ted Theodore, portfolio manager of TTFS.With rates poised to rise, Theodore believes many companies using debt for share buybacks may not have the ability to keep doing that.""Our companies do. They have good organic growth to them, not just financial engineering,"" he added, referring to criticism that buybacks can give share prices an artificial boost.TTFS holds 100 equal-weighted stocks, including Apple (AAPL). The iPhone maker spent $37.1 billion on share repurchases in 2015, helping the technology sector dominate S&P 500 buybacks.The ETF is up 3.3% year to date. It has averaged a 13.6% annual gain over the past three years vs. 11.8% for SPY.

486,MCD,"Stocks chalked up losses in early afternoon trading as the market shifted the focus of its worries.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each fell 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 flopped 1.7%, though small caps had been outperforming the major indexes recently.Volume in the stock market today was running slightly lower on both major exchanges.The indexes have recently patched over some worries. Strong jobs numbers last week eased concerns about a possible U.S. recession. Crude oil prices are working on their fourth consecutive week of gains. This has eased fears that job losses in the oil industry will offset any boost lower gasoline prices give to consumer spending.However, weak trade data from China thrust the Chinese economy back to the top of the worry list. Data for February showed that exports fell 25.4% from a year earlier.Oil, steel and mining stocks led the downside. In the S&P 500, Devon Energy (DVN) took the biggest hit, with the oil and natural gas explorer falling almost 9% in heavy volume, though there was no news specific to the stock.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks also skidded. The chip groups have rallied about 20% off their February lows and were probably due for some profit-taking.Blue chips were mostly down. However, Coca-Cola (KO) popped almost 1% to a new 52-week high.Among other Dow stocks,  the best performers included Nike (NKE), up 1.7%; McDonald's (MCD) up 1.3%; and Home Depot (HD), up 1.1%.

487,MCD,"McDonald’s (MCD) took over the top spot from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as the favorite restaurant destination among U.S. teens and young adults in 2015, according to a new poll released Wednesday, with the burger giant benefiting from a rebound in the quick-service sector.Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) remained a pretty popular destination among female respondents -- though less so than in previous years -- while Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell was a hit with young males.William Blair’s annual Teen/Young Adult Survey found that restaurant sentiment “weakened somewhat” in 2015, with about 43% of respondents saying they ate out more often than a year earlier vs. 48% in 2014. Still, those numbers compared well to the apparel category, where only 31% of respondents said they spent more on apparel in 2015.“For those eating out less often, financial reasons were by far the main culprit (40%), while the response ‘too expensive’ jumped to roughly 25% from 18% last year, perhaps reflecting push-back to price increases taken by restaurants on structural government-mandated wage inflation,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia said in a report.She said the quick-service sector “had a quantum leap in popularity” in 2015. Eateries in this category accounted for 38% of total restaurant visits by respondents in 2015, up from 30% in 2014. This represented an all-time high for the survey, driven by strong share gains from McDonald’s and Taco Bell.Fast-casual visits fell to about 20% of total visits in 2015 from 28% the prior year, and Chipotle lost the biggest chunk of share. That was the case even though the survey was completed before the E. coli outbreak at Chipotle restaurants, which was first reported in the fall. Casual dining surpassed fast casual to become the second-most-frequented subsector in 2015.“In terms of frequency (of visits), McDonald’s topped the list across genders, while Chipotle fell to second among females (from first the prior year) and third among males (from second the prior year),” Zackfia said.Among female respondents, Panera Bread (PNRA) held the third spot behind McDonald’s and Chipotle for the second year in a row. Starbucks remained in fourth place, though the percentage of female respondents who said they ate there most often fell to 6.3% in 2015 from 7.2% in 2014. Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden rounded out the top five among females.“McDonald’s gained material share over the past year across both genders, with the second-highest share gains behind Olive Garden for females and Taco Bell for males,” Zackfia noted.Among male respondents, Taco Bell ranked second behind McDonald’s as the most-visited restaurant. It was followed by Chipotle, DineEquity’s (DIN) Applebee’s and Wendy’s (WEN).Shares of McDonald’s closed down 0.3% on the stock market today.Chipotle rose 3.1%, Starbucks lost 0.8%, Yum fell 1%, Panera fell fractionally, Darden and  Dinequity climbed 0.7%, and Wendy’s retreated 0.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Small caps showed some strength, with the Russell 2000 rising 0.2% in early action.Volume was lower on the stock market today, down 2% on the NYSE and off 5% on the Nasdaq, relative to action at the same time Wednesday.Early jobs data may have added some drag to opening trade, as weekly unemployment claims unexpectedly rose and layoffs increased in February, although at a much slower rate than in the month before.Services sector activity slowed sharply in February, with researcher Markit putting its services sector Purchasing Managers' Index at 49.7 for the month, down from January's 53.2. That was the gauge's first decline since October 2013, with the drop putting it below the 50 level which divides expansion from contraction.The services gauge from the Institute for Supply Management was less gloomy, easing to 53.4 from January's 53.5 tally.

That 0.5% loss was recovered from the index's 8.8% dive to a Feb. 11 low and a significant step up from January's 7.9% slide. The last monthly gain for both indexes came in November.Friday's payroll report for February is the big economic news scheduled for the week. It will be the last monthly payroll report before the Fed's policy meeting in March, and with investor concerns about a revived recession dogging the stock market, it will be closely considered.After a barrage of speeches last week, Federal Reserve officials show a relatively quiet calendar, with only John Williams of the San Francisco Fed scheduled to speak Wednesday morning.This morning, Kingsbury International reports its Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index at 9:45 a.m. ET.

"
492,MCD,"A Marvell Technology (MRVL) patent settlement, a Chinese takeover of Ingram Micro (IM), NetApp (NTAP) layoffs and weak Jack in the Box (JACK) earnings moved those stocks in after-hours action Wednesday.Ending litigation that started in 2009, Marvell Technology agreed to pay $750 million to settle a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Carnegie Mellon University over disk drive technology.The settlement was announced six months after a federal appellate court vacated a record $1.5 billion judgment against Marvell and ordered a new trial. But the court also ruled that Marvell must pay at least $278.4 million in damages.A federal jury in Pittsburgh had awarded Carnegie Mellon $1.17 billion in damages in 2012. The trial judge later raised that total to $1.5 billion, reflecting Marvell's alleged willful infringement plus interest.A ""substantial share"" of the $750 million settlement will go to the inventors of the disputed technology, minus legal fees and costs, Carnegie Mellon said.Marvell shares rose more than 6% after hours.China-based Tianjin Tianhai Investment will pay $38.90 a share, or $6 billion, for Irvine, Calif.-based information technology company Ingram Micro.Ingram Micro stock soared 24% after hours when news of the deal broke.Tianjin Tianhai is a unit of Chinese shipping and aviation conglomerate HNA Group.

Revenue rose 0.5% to $470.8 million, missing estimates of $475.5 million.""We believe a competitor's messaging around its launch of all-day breakfast had some impact on our results, particularly in the 10:30 a.m. to noon period,"" Jack in the Box Chairman and CEO Lenny Comma said in a statement.McDonald's launched its all-day breakfast menu during Q4, which helped the Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast food giant post its best U.S. quarterly sales in nearly four years.Same-store sales at Jack in the Box's subsidiary Qdoba rose 1.5% at company-owned locations, less than previous projections of 2%. That's despite rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reporting plunging Q4 and January same-store sales due to food-borne illness scandals.Jack in the Box narrowed its full-year earnings guidance to  $3.50 to $3.63 a share, compared with the previous range of $3.55 to $3.70 a share.The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based data-storage company announced a plan to axe 12% of its workforce, or nearly 1,200 workers, as NetApp aims to cut $400 million in costs.NetApp estimated that it will book between $60 million and $70 million in costs tied to the layoffs during its fiscal Q4.For its fiscal Q3, the three-month period ended Jan. 29, NetApp earned 70 cents a share excluding items, down 6.7% from a year earlier, and beating by 2 cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 10.6% to $1.4 billion, missing estimates of $1.5 billion.NetApp also gave light Q4 guidance.But NetApp stock rose 2% late.

494,MCD,"Stocks opened firmly higher Wednesday, boosted by a raft of solid Q4 reports and a surprise uptick in producer prices and factory output in January.The Nasdaq stepped out to an early lead, up 1.6%. The S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and the Dow were close behind, up 1.2% apiece.Volume opened on a mixed note, up 3% on the Nasdaq and 7% lower on the NYSE, relative to trade at the same time Tuesday.The stock market today opened to mixed economic news, with producer prices rising more than expected in January, while housing starts and building permits slipped more than expected. It was the second weak data point for housing markets this week, after a surprise pullback in builder confidence from the National Association of Homebuilders' Housing Market Index on Tuesday.Industrial production was positive, rising 0.9% in January according to Federal Reserve numbers. The Fed also revised its December estimate downward, to an 0.7% decline. Economists had projected a gain of 0.4% for January.

Brent crude also gained 3% to $33.15 a barrel. The Energy Information Administration delayed its weekly inventories report, normally released on Wednesday, until Thursday.Dow stocks rose almost unanimously. McDonald's (MCD) was the weak spot, down more than 1%. Boeing (BA) topped the group, rising more than 2% following news that China's Okay Airways had committed to an order for 12 new 737s, valued at $1.3 billion.Priceline (PCLN) and Garmin (GRMN) duked out it at the head of the Nasdaq 100.Priceline gapped up to an 11% gain after reporting its Q4 earnings rose 16% to $12.63 a share, better than consensus forecasts for a 9% gain. Revenue also outpaced estimates. First quarter earnings guidance just met expectations. The gain hoisted Priceline back above its 50-day moving average to a test of resistance at its 200-day line. The stock is now 29% above an early February low and 16% below a November high.Garmin screamed ahead 13% as its its fourth quarter earnings decline of 4% clobbered expectations for a 37% drop. Revenue slipped 4%, also less than expected. Full-year earnings guidance was below expectations but revenue guidance was above expectations.  The advance drove Garmin above its 50- and 200-day moving averages. The stock remains 23% below its 52-week high.Fossil Group (FOSL) ran at the head of the S&P 500, up 23% after reporting strong Q4 results, but offering mixed Q1 guidance.Among IBD 50 stocks, Public Storage (PSA) locked up a 4% gain as its Q4 earnings edged out consensus estimates.

495,MCD,"With hotels in 87 countries, Marriott International (MAR) is finding it harder to protect itself from currency swings, as exchange rates in the $5.3-trillion-a-day market defy expectations.The chain locked in its 2016 currency hedges about four months ago, anticipating the dollar would extend a three-year winning streak. Instead, the greenback has had a mixed performance, slumping against the euro and yen this year amid turmoil in global markets. That’s a problem because the cost of the hedges would be wasted if the dollar weakens.“For better or for worse, you are locking in,” said Leeny Oberg, Marriott’s chief financial officer, in a telephone interview from Bethesda, Md. The company set hedges in 2016 with anticipation that the U.S. currency will strengthen, but less than last year.The dollar’s gain in 2015 and surging volatility squeezed revenue for Marriott, McDonald’s (MCD) and other companies that sell goods or services overseas, triggering some headaches for finance executives. It made sense for corporate treasurers to hedge against the dollar’s rally in 2015, which was widely predicted by analysts.This year, the task is becoming trickier as currency forecasts, which corporate treasurers use as a guide of where to hedge, have been upended. Options prices imply that, since the start of December, when some treasurers would have been firming up 2016 hedges, the chances of the greenback strengthening beyond the median year-end forecast of $1.08 per euro have fallen to 37% from 48%. The likelihood of it reaching the median estimate of 121 yen has plunged to 19% from 49%.The dollar’s path hinges on whether the Federal Reserve can keep raising interest rates while its biggest peers expand stimulus and the specter of a global slowdown threatens to derail the tightening cycle.Hundreds of companies in North America and Europe blamed currencies for hurting earnings last year, according to Scottsdale, Ariz.-based FiREapps, which makes software to help businesses reduce the effect of currency swings. Foreign exchange shaved 9% from McDonald’s full-year earnings per share and chopped more than $17 billion from Wal-Mart Stores’ (WMT) sales last year.A surging dollar decreases the value of overseas sales when they’re translated into the U.S. currency for the purpose of reporting earnings. If the revenue is left in the foreign country and not actually exchanged into dollars, the decline is on paper only. The strong dollar also hurts U.S. companies by making imported goods cheaper while U.S. exports are more expensive in foreign markets.""Companies are getting hit big-time by foreign exchange,"" said Niklas Bergentoft, a New York-based director at Deloitte & Touche LLP, who co-authored a report on corporate hedging published this week. ""We see this continuing for 2016."" Deloitte surveyed 133 corporations with revenue ranging from $1 billion to more than $50 billion.For companies in the S&P 500 index, a 1% gain in the trade-weighted dollar lowers collective revenue by about 0.3 percentage point, said Stewart Warther, an equity strategist with BNP Paribas in New York. A Fed gauge of the trade-weighted dollar rallied 11% last year and 8% in 2014. The biggest risk is it keeps going for another year.“All our hedges expired for 2015, and you move into 2016, and there’s a reset for everyone back to the market,” said Tom Szlosek, chief financial officer of Honeywell International (HON).The maker of industrial goods ranging from aircraft engines to gas detectors locked in hedges for the euro at $1.10 this year, said Szlosek, whose treasury team reports to him monthly on currency movements. The euro rose 0.5% for the week to $1.0984 as of 6:41 a.m. New York time Friday.Last year, the company offset about 85% of its euro exposure at $1.24, limiting the hit from foreign exchange to 10 cents of full-year earnings per share, which was $6.04. This year, the lower hedge level means foreign-exchange effects may reduce annual earnings by as much as 15 cents a share, he said.For Marriott, dollar strength will probably reduce the fees it collects for managing hotels by $30 million this year because about a quarter of this year’s estimated $2.02 billion in fee revenue will come from outside the U.S., Oberg said.The company uses forward contracts to manage its exposure to the yen, euro, pound and Canadian dollar, because they’re the most actively traded currencies and cheapest to hedge. These contracts cover about one-third of foreign revenue from hotel management fees.Hedges in 2015 helped keep the decline from foreign exchange at $32 million of fee revenue, said Oberg, who declined to say at what level Marriott has hedged for 2016.“The currencies did move farther than I think people expected,” she said. “So, it was very helpful to have the hedges.”About 90% of companies use derivatives, including forwards and swaps, to offset their currency exposure, the Deloitte study showed. Most surveyed firms hedged an average of 68% of their cash flow for three months -- that hedge ratio dropped down to 59% of transactions for three to six months in the future, then fell to 50% for six months to a year ahead.McDonald’s said it expects the dollar to strengthen this year, but at a slower pace, knocking off about 20 cents from earnings per share in 2016 following a 50-cent hit last year. The company focuses its hedging on the euro, pound, Canadian and Australian dollars and yen, said Becca Hary, a spokeswoman. The hamburger chain only hedges for operations reasons and not for the accounting effect when translating foreign currencies to the dollar for earnings reports, she said.Wal-Mart’s decline in sales because of weaker foreign currencies last year was “by far” the largest ever for the retailer, David Cheesewright, chief of the company’s international operations, said on a Feb. 18 conference call. Wal-Mart expects the strong dollar to drive down sales by $12 billion this year.Companies that have manufacturing plants in foreign countries, such as Honeywell, can mitigate the fallout from currency fluctuations with “natural hedges” by keeping costs in the local money, Szlosek said. Honeywell, which has factories in countries such as Mexico and Hungary, says that including exports it generates about 55% of its $38.6 billion of revenue outside the U.S.“We have a big manufacturing base in those places; we try to source as much as we can locally and pay in local currency,” Szlosek said. “That is a nice offset.”

499,MCD,"Stocks closed near session lows Thursday for their first decline in four days as oil pared its gains and investors weighed mixed economic data.The Nasdaq fell 1%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.3%. Volume was lower across the board according to preliminary figures, suggesting institutional investors stayed largely on the sidelines after a three-day stock market rally. Losers were about even with winners on the NYSE, but led by a 3-2 margin on the Nasdaq.Oil, medical and software stocks were among the day's biggest decliners. West Texas intermediate crude closed below $31 a barrel after a U.S. report showed stockpiles rose to an 86-year high.IBM (IBM) led the Dow with a 5% pop, gapping up past its 50-day moving average in fast trade. Shares, which have trended lower since July, extended their win streak for a fourth session. The tech services giant acquired Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion. Morgan Stanley upgraded the tech services giant to overweight from equal weight.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) provided the biggest drag on the blue chip index. The retail giant reported Q4 earnings slightly above views, but quarterly sales disappointed, as did its full-year revenue guidance. Shares closed 3% lower, after paring its loss from nearly 6%.Jack In The Box (JACK) gapped down and sank 16% in heavy volume to a 16-month low, excluding the Aug. 24 minicrash. After the close Wednesday, the San Diego-based burger chain reported disappointing fiscal Q1 results that sent shares down in extended trading. It blamed the all-day breakfast menu launch of a rival, aka McDonald's (MCD).Universal Display (OLED) led IBD 50 stocks with a nearly 6% jump in brisk trade, extending its advance for a seventh straight session. Shares nearly regained their 50-day moving average. Analysts expect the organic light emitting diode company to post an 82% earnings jump to 51 cents a share on a 27% sales increase to $71.5 million when it reports Feb. 25 after the close.Also on the IBD 50, landscaping equipment maker Toro (TTC) surged 4% in strong volume. It broke out of a cup with handle with a 75.22 buy point.Economic data were mixed. Initial claims for jobless benefits declined last week to the lowest since November. But the Philly Fed manufacturing survey index continued to show contraction and the Conference Board's index of leading indicators slipped, both in line with expectations.Friday's light economic data schedule includes the consumer price index for January and Baker-Hughes weekly rig count.

500,MCD,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

501,MCD,"Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) received a higher price target and earnings estimate Wednesday amid an upbeat outlook for sales growth and cost savings, though the company still isn’t getting as much love from Wall Street as chief rival McDonald’s (MCD).The higher estimates came a day after Restaurant Brands beat fourth-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, helped by a 6.3% same-store sales gain at its Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts chain. Burger King comps grew 3.9%.In a note published Wednesday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer raised his price target on Restaurant Brands to 38 from 36. Palmer also raised his 2016 per-share earnings estimate to $1.36 from $1.30 and his 2017 estimate to $1.60 from $1.53.“While (foreign-exchange) headwinds are likely to persist this year, we expect continued outperformance by Tim Hortons in Canada, slightly positive trends at BK U.S. and Canada, and more robust international growth for BK in 2016,” Palmer said. “Our model also reflects cost savings within the Tim Hortons distribution business, which we believe was a significant source of EPS upside vs. our estimates over the last two quarters.”Restaurant Brands is already one of the more efficient operators in the fast-food sector, Palmer said. He estimates that Restaurant Brands’ capital spending per restaurant this year will average about $7,600. That compares to $11,000 at Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and $21,500 at Wendy’s (WEN). McDonald’s has the highest overhead costs of any of the four, Palmer noted, though he didn’t provide 2016 capex estimates for the fast-food chain.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands’ top line should get a boost from an ever-widening market reach.“International unit growth has been accelerating, (and) the company’s domestic sales momentum seems to have improved in recent months,” Palmer said.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 2% on the stock market today. The stock is up 18% since hitting a three-and-a-half month low of 29.28 on Feb. 11, though it is still down about 24% from its 52-week high of 45.71 set last February.In contrast, McDonald’s set a record high earlier this month and is up about 24% over the last year. Shares have been on a sharp rise since October, when McDonald’s launched its successful all-day breakfast menu.Even so, McDonald’s shares fell 0.45% Wednesday. Yum rose 2.4%, while Wendy’s gained 1%.

502,MCD,"Pizza stocks Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) jumped Wednesday as an analyst sees pizza deliveries faring well amid civil unrest.In afternoon action in the stock market today, Domino's Pizza rose 1% to 136.89, just below a 137.12 buy point after rising as high as 137.87.Domino's is slated to report second quarter earnings on Thursday. Analyst consensus is for Q2 earnings per share to rise 16% to 94 cents and revenue to grow 9.25 to $533.44 million. Domino's has missed Wall Street's earnings target in two of the last three quarters.Papa John's jumped as much as 4% after KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded its stock to overweight from sector weight and raised its price target to 80. KeyBanc said in a client note that people may be eating at home more often, and munching on delivered comfort foods like pizza amid civil unrest and a contentious presidential election race. Papa John's, which is in the midst of a long consolidation, climbed 3.15% to 71.30 Wednesday, clearing resistance near 70.Among other restaurants, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which operates Burger King and coffee-and-doughnuts chain Tim Hortons in more than 100 countries, was also breaking out Wednesday from a flat base with a 44.06 buy point. Restaurant Brands shot as much as 3% to an all-time high at 44.93 before settling to a 2.3% gain at 44.50.Burger King rival McDonald's (MCD) eased 0.35% to 126.06 and Jack-in-the-Box (JACK) climbed 1.4% to 89.13, hitting an 11-month high.Yum Brands (YUM), which operates Pizza Hut as well as KFC and Taco Bell, rose 0.35% to 87.87.The Retail-Restaurants group, ranked a weak 151 on IBD's list of 197 industries, has traded in a narrow range since mid-March but on Tuesday rose above its 200-day average and continued climbing on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Several restaurant operators report quarterly financials Thursday.

503,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) said Wednesday that it will add McMuffins, McGriddles and biscuit sandwiches to its All Day Breakfast menu nationwide in September, amid concerns about whether the company's recent sales growth is sustainable as it approaches some tough year-over-year comparisons.Shares dipped 0.1% to 120.63 in the stock market today. The stock is making its way through a flat base and has drifted below its 50-day line since May.The stock has gotten a huge lift since All Day Breakfast was introduced last fall, demonstrating to investors that the company could change and turn around flagging sales after a weak 2014.In the years prior to the launch, McDonald's lost customers to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and other fast-casual chains tapping into a growing preference for higher-quality or healthier ingredients.But some analysts have questioned whether the burger giant has relied too much on All Day Breakfast for its sales growth. Others say the menu expansion could help prop up sales, but not tremendously.""It's a positive, but it won't have nearly the same impact that the initial All Day Breakfast launch had,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's stock is in the midst of a consolidation, but below its 50-day moving average, a sign of weakness. Investors should wait for MCD to build the right side of a base and form a proper entry point before making any moves.Analysts have also worried about slowing industry sales amid broader economic uncertainty. Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski last month downgraded McDonald's, citing the tough comparisons and saying the U.S. restaurant industry ""could remain sluggish for the remainder of 2016"".Chipotle shares climbed 1.1%. Wendy's (WEN) rose 0.5%, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (RBI) added 1.3%, and Yum Brands (YUM) rallied 1.4%.

505,MCD,"Phil Knight just does it.He turns Nike into a champion.He makes icons out of the Swoosh and the athletes who wear it, from track king Carl Lewis to tennis queen Serena Williams.He has $24 billion, ranking 17th among America's wealthiest, reports Forbes.As CEO for four decades and now chairman, he's overseen Nike (NKE) stock sprints of 9,000% (1984-97) and 613% (2009-15).He's out with a book, ""Shoe Dog,"" a tale of his long slog in the footwear industry.By next year, the Nike co-founder will wear a new title: former executive. He'll be leaving the world's No. 1 sports merchandising company, with 63,000 employees and $31 billion in annual sales.""Pretty good when you consider that in 1964 we had $8,000 in sales and $234 in profit,"" Knight, 78, told IBD. ""We had to run a tight ship.""And what waves he's created.""He built an empire on a vision of shoes,"" said H.W. Brands, author of ""Masters of Enterprise."" ""He made lots of money, employed lots of people and gave great satisfaction to his customers. He could have done a lot worse.""Knight also has made lots of impressions with Nike's advertising, especially with the ""Just Do It"" campaign.""When the Bulls won their third straight National Basketball Association title in June 1993,"" Donald Katz wrote in his book, ""Just Do It,"" on the Knight endeavor, ""the most popular line imprinted on caps and sweatshirts was a play on Nike's famous call to arms of the reinvention years: 'Just Did It' went the variant apothegm. 'Again And Again And Again.' ""That repeat success has led to Swoosh equipment all over the field. They're all so colorful these days, with Olympic track shoes and college football helmets especially going Nike neon and glossy.The college football uniforms ""have all sorts of fingerprints,"" said Knight, lauding Todd Van Horn and Tinker Hatfield in the Nike design department.As for what gets the chairman going, ""I'm still a good shoe guy. New shoes light me up.""Which brings up the Olympics, running Aug. 5 to 21 in Rio de Janeiro.""I always get pumped up for the Olympics,"" said Knight. ""I'm a running guy, and I like that this is really the chance for track and field to shine.""We get to display our product. If this were a fashion show, that would be our runway.""The Olympics always bring back memories, especially with Tiger shoes at our first Games, the 1968 Olympics.""By that two-week extravaganza in Mexico City, Knight's dream was still fresh. As he noted in ""Shoe Dog,"" the sneaker idea germinated during a 1962 run in his native Portland, Ore., not long after graduating from the University of Oregon, Stanford's business school and the Army.He thought of one of his teacher's points: ""The cowards never started, and the weak died along the way -- that leaves us.""He also thought of what inspired him: ""The secret of happiness ... lay somewhere in that moment when the ball is in midair, when both boxers sense the approach of the bell, when the runners near the finish line and the crowd rises as one. ... I wanted that, whatever that was, to be my life, my daily life. ... So that morning in 1962 I told myself: Let everyone else call your idea crazy ... just keep going. Don't stop.""He didn't. Soon he was off to Japan to land a deal selling sneakers in America. He went on to travel more of Asia and beyond, finally settling home in early 1963 and seeing that first box arrive: ""12 pairs of shoes, creamy white, with blue stripes down the sides. God, they were beautiful. ... I'd seen nothing in Florence or Paris that surpassed them.""Knight was infatuated, something crucial in what drives him: ""Your business has to be something you really love. Remember that there will be a lot of dark moments. You never make it overnight. You have to be prepared for the tough times. As my Stanford Small Business Management professor Frank Shallenberger liked to say, 'The only time you must not fail is the last time you try.' ""Knight simply kept trying. He asked for shoe input from his Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman, and over lunch in January 1964 he told him ""about my trip around the world. Kobe, Jordan, the Temple of Nike.""Bowerman was hooked: ""Those Japanese shoes. They're pretty good. How about letting me in on the deal?""Knight: ""When the waitress dropped off the check for the two hamburgers, we split that too. Fifty-fifty.""The Knight-Bowerman team became Blue Ribbon Sports, distributing Japanese-made shoes in the American West.""I quit my job at the accounting firm,"" wrote Knight, ""and all that spring I did nothing but sell shoes out of the trunk of my Valiant.""By July, he had sold out his first shipment. He ordered 900 more and got a bank loan to back him. It was part of a hot 1964, with every Japanese runner at the Tokyo Olympics wearing the same Tigers that Knight was selling.The next year, Knight made his first hire, Jeff Johnson, who would brainstorm the firm's new name: Nike, for the Greek goddess of victory.Knight cheers such wisdom: ""Underlining all the hurdles are people. We've hired a lot of creative people, whether they're the lawyers to think or the accountants to count. The people are the life and death of our company.""Then there was Carolyn Davidson. Knight met her in a college hallway and asked her to design print ads. She created the Swoosh that ran as hard as any company's logo, including the McDonald's (MCD) arches.Johnson put it this way: ""It was a holy mission, you know, to Swoosh the world, to get Swooshes on everybody's feet. We were Knight's crusaders. We would have died on the cross.""Knight's company was alive and kicking in the late 1960s, doubling sales yearly to today's equivalent of $2 million. Still, he taught accounting at Portland State University for needed cash. And while there he met a student, Penelope Parks, who became his wife and mother of their two sons.The next decade brought Knight his first big-name endorsement athlete, Romanian tennis star Ilie Nastase, and college basketball coach Dick Harter of Oregon. Such recognition helped Nike ignite sales from $8 million in 1974 (worth $38 million today) to $140 million in 1979 (or $457 million now).The 1980s saw Nike factories humming in Taiwan, Korea, England and Ireland, and Knight's fortune multiplying to the $200 million range.The CEO was sitting pretty at Nike's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters, which expanded to 200 acres with buildings named after endorsement stars: Joan Benoit, Ken Griffey Jr., Mia Hamm, Tiger Woods, Dan Fouts, Jerry Rice, Steve Prefontaine.The biggest Nike get was Michael Jordan, fresh out of college in 1984. Knight saw him as an NBA giant before many others did and signed him to beat sneaker rival Reebok.""I just don't want to be like my competitors,"" noted Knight, who also says: ""We take a lot of our culture off the athletic field. Just like with tackles and running backs, we have to have better people than the competition.""He recalled a remark by Bowerman, who died in 1999: ""Play by the rules, but be ferocious.""As Jordan soared, so did the firm he sported. ""Air Jordan proved to be a very good thing for Nike,"" wrote Brands. ""The line sold more than $100 million in its first year, the largest figure for any endorsement in history until then.""From 1985 to 1993, wrote Katz, ""Nike's ad budget swelled from under $20 million to well over $150 million -- new Nike commercials projected billions of Michael Jordan impressions with each new selling season.""Knight, the former middle-distance runner, was on another lap toward becoming ""the most powerful man in sports,"" as the Sporting News dubbed him.Now in his last leg as Nike's chairman, Knight spends half his time on projects at the Beaverton office a half-hour from his home, in what he calls a good relationship with CEO Mark Parker.Knight doesn't run anymore, no thanks to his age. Instead, he walks for exercise and stays atop his old sport.Watching a race once, he said: ""There was much to be learned from such a display of passion, whether you were running a mile or a company.""Co-founded Nike.Overcame: A culture that hadn't caught on to the running mania.Lesson: Get ahead of the pack and keep going.""I believed in running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves. Belief, I decided. Belief is irresistible.""Related:Nike Climbed 38,673% On A Powerful Brand, InnovationHenry Crowell, Oatmeal Tycoon And Marketing PioneerCan Stephen Curry Be Under Armour's Michael Jordan?

Once high-flying Shake Shack (SHAK) has tumbled 59% from its peak.Shares of Yum Brands, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR), Wendy’s (WEN) and Jack In The Box (JACK) have lost ground too.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan noted that some rivals in the sector are only now starting to tweak their strategies, while McDonald's is putting its own in place.""They spent the last 12-plus months creating strategy, and now they’re executing,"" she told IBD.

518,MCD,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that the bank would hike its minimum hourly wage to $12-$16.50 for 18,000 employees, many of them bank tellers or other customer service employees, arguing that wages for many in the U.S. ""have gone nowhere for too long.""The increase, which comes as bank branches face potential disruption from new technology, will take hold over the next three years, Dimon said in an op-ed in the New York Times. The bank's current minimum hourly wage for U.S. staff is $10.15, he said.Dimon's announcement also comes amid calls nationwide for higher pay from restaurant and retail employees who have struggled to make ends meet and complained of difficult or reduced schedule hours. A day earlier, coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX) said that it would institute a minimum 5% pay hike for store managers and other employees in U.S. company-operated stores as of Oct. 3. Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give a raise to more than 1.2 million store employees earlier this year.But wage increases could mean higher prices for customers, as well as  the arrival other ""labor saving"" measures. Starbucks raised coffee drink prices Tuesday, a day after its wage-hike announcement. Wendy's (WEN) has said it would make self-ordering kiosks available to its restaurants. But McDonald's (MCD), which has announced its own base pay hikes, has said such technology would be unlikely to result in lost jobs.Dimon said JPMorgan would also put more than $200 million this year toward training thousands of its entry-level consumer banking employees. The pay increase and the training investment would help retain and develop talent.In the coming years, however, bank branches could be overhauled due to the rise of financial tech startups, which could move many of the services provided at a local branch to one's smartphone. The fintech industry in recent months has had its own problems with loan volume growth and the possibility of increased regulatory scrutiny, but its technology could result in lost jobs.JPMorgan, which reports Q2 earnings on Thursday, closed up 1.5% in the stock market today, pushing above its 50-day moving average. Starbucks climbed 2.1%, while Wal-Mart fell 1.1%.McDonald's edged up 0.2%, while Wendy's ended flat.

"
520,MCD,"Cooking-equipment maker Middleby (MIDD) spent a good part of last year trying to address a troubling situation: 75 reports that gas ranges made by Viking, the high-end oven maker it bought some three years ago, were turning on by themselves. Viking recalled around 60,000 ovens due to those reports, and Middleby -- which makes cooking appliances for homes and restaurants -- stresses those ovens were made prior to the acquisition. But the recall heightened problems within Viking that weighed on Middleby's finances. Among them: Delays in refrigeration products Middleby had been trying to make more energy-efficient, concerns about Viking's residential products and questions over whether the $380 million Middleby paid was too much for a company seen as lacking new ideas or sufficient margins.For Middleby officials, quality concerns of this magnitude are not what they're used to encountering.""Papa John's (PZZA) runs our oven almost 18 to 20 hours a day -- especially on weekends,"" Chief Executive Selim Bassoul told IBD. ""And it cannot break down. It is not allowed to break down.""Yet shares of Middleby are up around 32% since February as the company turns out sales growth that outpaces competitors and works aggressively -- and to a large extent effectively, some analysts say -- to turn Viking around. The company has a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. That sales growth has been led by an array of kitchen items that cater to more selective home chefs and a competitive restaurant industry, which has been set on international expansion and on serving food in a way that's quicker, fresher and more cost-effective.Roth Capital analyst Tony Brenner wrote in a research note last month that new product introductions addressing increased speed, energy and labor saving ""should continue to play a key role in increasing sales and margins."" Those gains would also come as the bar rises for service, even within fast food.  An array of big restaurant chains are customers of Middleby -- Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- along with higher-end chains. Want an oven that can cook a pizza in 90 seconds or a steamer that saves water by utilizing the food's moisture? Middleby has those. Need an oven that can make a steak look and taste like it was fussed over by a chef, or an oven system that can do the work of a line cook or two? Middleby has some of those too.Middleby has a lot of those things in no small part because of acquisitions. It has made more than 40 since 2000, according to the Great Lakes Review stock-picking service, with most of those deals coming during Bassoul's tenure. ""He never sits on his laurels,"" Elliott Schlang, Great Lakes' founder, said of Bassoul. ""He's always doing something new and innovative, to broaden his product line and to give the restauranteur what he needs.""Restaurants, Bassoul said, face greater demand for breakfast, potentially requiring adjustments to space in the kitchen and on the grill. Greater demand for delivery and analytics, he said, will necessitate more connected, automated cooking equipment. And higher employee wages -- as have been demanded industrywide -- are inevitable.""It's going to happen,"" he said. After reaching an intraday high of 127 on June 8, shares slipped below their 50-day moving average Friday in light of the U.K. Brexit selloff. Shares ended Monday trading around 110. That means restaurants will likely seek technology in place of people. The company's Kitchen of the Future, a conveyor-oven system with an infrared broiler and warming cabinet, helps restaurants get more usage out of each square foot. The system also uses technology that cuts usage of oven burners when not in use.    ""This array replaces convection ovens, fryers, microwaves, grills, charbroilers and salamanders (broiler units), prepares food faster and with greater consistency and can eliminate two or three line cooks from the kitchen,"" Brenner wrote. Profit margins on such projects, he said, ""reportedly exceed 50%.""Middleby's ventless cooking equipment saves energy -- and a lot of money -- because it doesn't require a large, bolted-down ventilation system. Since much of a kitchen's layout hinges on where ventilation is located, ventless technology helps kitchens become more flexible with floor space and menus. The company's holding trays can also control for moisture and heat, enabling restaurants to keep items fresher for longer and served quickly.""People have a tendency to think this stuff tastes like airplane food,"" BB&T analyst Schon Williams said of machine-prepared items. ""I've done a lot of taste tests -- and it's improved the taste concept among customers.""The company's food and beverage equipment has also helped some restaurants with an international presence to step up their breakfast game, although Middleby wouldn't say who.""We have a number of key executives throughout our organization that literally know how to build a store, build a restaurant, build a small-box retail operation, that know how to lay out a kitchen, that actually have done that,"" COO David Brewer told IBD.And as more people aspire toward the artisanal in their homes, the sophistication in Middleby's commercial operations has made its way into its residential products. Viking plans to launch an oven that, it says, can cook a rack of lamb in four minutes and a 12-pound turkey in 42 minutes.The company could also use design elements from AGA Rangemaster, a U.K. company it acquired that's known for its rustic-chic ovens and cast iron cookers, to make fancy home products even fancier.Management's experience in cooking equipment has also helped during the company's rare moments of difficulty, as with the Viking acquisition.After that acquisition, the company deployed scores of engineers to Viking to assess potential problems. In quality tests, they hung weights off of refrigerator doors, which could sometimes fall off, Williams said, and in one instance Bassoul slammed an oven door over and over until it broke.The company strengthened Viking's packaging materials. Following the recall, Middleby has sued former senior staff at Viking, and Middleby's salesforce has worked to reclaim goodwill among dealers and made the wiring of Viking ovens less complicated.""That's a hallmark of Middleby, just in terms of reducing the number of parts, reducing complexity whenever possible,"" Williams said. He later added: ""Time and time again they've proven they can restructure all these businesses.""Almost all Viking dealers have resumed buying the company's products, Middleby says. As restaurants expand internationally, so will Middleby, and Bassoul hopes to make its Viking residential platform a more global entity.Steel prices, Schlang noted, risk hurting the bottom line if they rise, and the company's food-processing business still lives project to project, analysts say. Brenner also said that Middleby's main competitors are bigger and have deep pockets. Manitowoc (MTW) is among its biggest rivals, but its focus isn't exclusive to food service.Restaurant same-store sales were also sluggish in the second quarter and could lag through the year. But as they try to keep costs down and investors happy, equipment could play just as much of a role as the food in improving what they offer to customers.""You can do that in a simple way,"" Brewer said. ""You can put the ketchup on top of the meat patty, you can put ketchup underneath the meat patty, add a pickle -- that maybe gets you a quarter. But eventually you have to bring in a new bread and toast it a different way.""

521,MCD,"Stocks surrendered most of their early-morning advance by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, as the U.K. referendum on retaining or rejecting membership in the European Union grew closer.Meanwhile, Emergent BioSolutions (EBS) plunged nearly 19% to about 32 to 31.05 as volume soared approached 8 million shares vs. its float of 33 million. The anthrax vaccine firm's average daily volume over the past 50 sessions is 451,000 shares.The Nasdaq composite let an early 0.7% wither to a fractional gain. The S&P 500 faded to trade just a hair positive, while the small-cap S&P 600 traded lower.The Dow Jones industrial average also shed early gains and was 0.1% lower, led by McDonald's (MCD), the only member of the 30-stock average to fall nearly 2%. The world's largest burger chain gapped down at the open and was testing buying support at 120, a psychologically key round number.Notice how on a daily chart, the stock was beginning to live beneath its 50-day moving average, which flattened out in May.McDonald's is expected to grow Q2 profit by 11% to $1.40 a share, which would mark a fourth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth. But sales continue to wither, and Wall Street sees Q2 sales slimming by 3% to $6.29 billion.Emergent, a leader in vaccines against the bioterrorism agent anthrax, is falling after news that the U.S. government has issued two solicitation notices for the development of vaccines for its strategic stockpile. Reports noted that the Department of Health & Human Services does not specifically state the number of vaccine doses to be procured each year.The stock had formed a somewhat sloppy base that began with its Dec. 30, 2015, peak at 40.49. The four-month base featured a triple-bottom look, which is generally a flaw. Still, Emergent staged a breakout past a 38.69 early buy point on April 6 in big volume. That eventually led to a 14.7% gain through its peak of 44.38 in early June.Amid the current choppy market, a good sell rule these days is to sell more quickly on the way up; so rather than wait for a 20%-to-25% gain to emerge, an investor can take at least partial profits in a position at 10% to 15%. In the case of Emergent, a second key sell signal emerged on June 17, as the stock sliced sharply below its 50-day moving average in volume 47% above average. In the following two sessions before Wednesday's big spill, the stock barely rebounded in light volume, a subtle sign that its character had changed.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, top-ranking stocks Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Dycom (DY) fell mildly in ultra-light trade -- that's the right combination of price-and-volume action you want to see when a good stock takes a break. Dycom, a solid play in the telecom infrastructure space, is still in buy range from a recent new handle buy point of 86.14.As seen in Tuesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market's current outlook was downgraded from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure."" This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower, given the increased intensity of professional selling. The S&P 500 recently saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) rise back to 5, while the Nasdaq composite's count is currently at 4.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

526,MCD,"The Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) brand has taken a beating due to several food-safety scandals, but analysts appear mostly positive on the fast-casual eatery's ability to engineer a turnaround -- eventually.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday ended its food-safety probe of Chipotle. But perceptions can take longer to change, and Chipotle late Tuesday warned of a ""very difficult"" 2016 after reporting sharply weaker fourth-quarter earnings. The company also disclosed it received a new government subpoena as a criminal probe expands.Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan told IBD that the earliest he sees Chipotle sales returning to a pre-food-crisis level is in 2017.""Even when they do, we may see a different Chipotle"" than the one investors knew before the outbreaks hit, he said, given permanent supply chain changes and food-safety measures. Plus, labor inflation and food cost inflation aren't going to stay static, and the company ""is not in a position to take prices up over the next year and a half, two years.""Restaurant-level margin percentages have ranged from the mid- to high-20s over the last few years, but Chipotle recorded a 19.6% margin in Q4.""Margins look closer to 20% than what they've looked historically, and that makes Chipotle not exceptional where they have been exceptional in the past,"" said Setyan. He said that brings its valuation into question.""Arguably, it now no longer deserves a premium to its restaurant peers,"" he said.Sales growth already was stalling before the food illness news slammed business. But investors were taken aback by Chipotle's January sales news and forecasts for no profit in the current quarter.Shares fell 2.9% to 461.74 in the stock market today after trading as low as 440.41 intraday.Several other analysts see the light at the end of the tunnel.""We are optimistic that margins can begin to recover in 2017, particularly if food-cost inflation remains benign, as we expect,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a Wednesday note. ""Chipotle's restaurant-level economics remain best-in-class despite recent brand damage.""Palmer cited improving throughput, new menu items, catering, mobile ordering and strategic marketing as reasons to believe that Chipotle can return to mid-single-digit comps and 20% earnings growth in the wake of its food-safety issues.Bob Derrington of the Telsey Group projects that same-store sales will turn positive in Q4 of this year. The bar is low for lapping comps, however, as Chipotle posted a 14.6% same-store sales decline for Q4. Wedbush's Setyan also sees positive comps ""no sooner than Q4.""January comps crashed 36%, Chipotle said late Tuesday.Credit Suisse analysts Jason West and James O'Brien ""continue to believe the brand will fully recover,"" according to a report Wednesday. The bank maintains an outperform rating but lowered its price target to 475 from 530.Bank of America boosted Chipotle's rating to neutral from underperform, citing poll results in which almost one-third of respondents said they still ate at the restaurant as often as they used to. Only about one-tenth had stopped visiting Chipotle.During Tuesday's post-earnings call, Chipotle management said it would be ""really hard to predict"" a recovery timeline.""When we looked at other events, other companies that have gone through something like this. The recovery typically takes four or five quarters or so,"" Chipotle CFO John Hartung said during the call.

527,MCD,"A year ago, you would have been hard pressed to make a case that fast-food restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Wendy's were better bets for investors than trendy fast-casual outlets like Chipotle Mexican Grill. That's a much easier sell today, given the beating Chipotle has taken, following E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at a number of its eateries, as…

528,MCD,"Walk down Seventh Avenue in downtown Seattle and you can't miss them: three gigantic spheres resembling melted-together Milk Duds rising in the shadow of Amazon.com's (AMZN) new 500-foot-tall office tower. The architectural oddity has already become a tourist attraction and social media phenomenon. Passers-by snap photographs and watch construction crews attach glass panes to the steel frames. Images stream through Instagram and Twitter.When they open in 2018, the 100-foot-tall orbs -- Amazon calls them Biospheres -- will host more than 300 plant species from around the world, creating what the company sees as the workplace of the future. Amazonians will be able to break from their daily labors to walk amid the greenery along suspension bridges and climb into meeting spaces resembling bird nests perched in mature trees, where the company expects them to brainstorm -- and perhaps even invent the next billion-dollar opportunity.Amazon's new headquarters was designed to project a forward-thinking company eager to help employees be more productive, creative and happy by providing a connection to nature. But the most trendsetting and appealing feature of the new complex is most likely its location: plopped between glass and steel high-rises on a busy street in downtown Seattle where food trucks are abundant, apartments are within walking distance and Happy Hour greets employees at quitting time.Over the years, founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has made clear his disdain for the free lunches, massages and other perks commonplace in the suburban enclaves of Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB). His big advantage in the amenities arms race is a commitment to preserving an urban campus, no matter how big his company gets.Other tech companies are following his lead by squeezing new offices into cities where millennials prefer to live. LinkedIn (LNKD) consolidated staff scattered around San Francisco into a 26-story tower in March. Salesforce.com (CRM) will be the anchor tenant in a 61-story skyscraper a few miles away that will be the city's tallest upon completion in 2018. Uber has plans for a new headquarters in San Francisco's Mission Bay. Industrial-age leviathans are doing it, too. General Electric (GE) is shifting from suburban Connecticut to Boston, while McDonald's (MCD) is moving from Oak Brook, Ill., to Chicago.Amazon's is the most ambitious gambit of them all. When its spheres and three surrounding towers are completed, the company will have 10 million square feet of office space in Seattle, more than 15% of the city's inventory, on a campus that occupies more than 10 square blocks. That will provide space for Amazon to more than double in size, to 50,000 Seattle workers in the next decade. ""How big can Amazon get and stay in Seattle? That's what they're trying to find out,"" says Glenn Kelman, the CEO of online real estate company Redfin. ""Can you create a massive company in the middle of a city?""Amazon's commitment to Seattle began long before the spheres were conceived. In 2010, the company moved to South Lake Union from leased space it was outgrowing in an old medical building. Amazon leased retail space on the ground floor of its office buildings to hand-picked bars, restaurants and coffee shops, speeding the neighborhood's transformation from a hodgepodge of car dealerships and secondhand stores into a vibrant business district where people could work, live and hang out.Veteran fine-dining restaurateur Tom Douglas was among the businesses lured by a growing concentration of well-paid tech workers. His survey of Amazon workers indicated they wanted cheap burgers and beer, which encouraged him to break from his traditional model and open the Brave Horse Tavern with a wide assortment of local brews, pub fare and long tables for family-style seating. ""I'm sure glad we did that survey, because we might not have gone with this concept otherwise,"" Douglas said. ""At the time, none of us realized how big and fast Amazon would grow."" The economic ripples from Amazon have since pushed beyond burger joints and cafes. Yellow cranes mark the skyline where new office towers, hotels and luxury apartments are rising.Just six years after relocating, Amazon has outgrown South Lake Union and is marching toward the city's urban core. The spheres, designed by architecture firm NBBJ, are Amazon's boldest statement yet in the first project it's building from the ground up.They were inspired by Amazon research indicating that a key thing missing from typical work environments is a link to the natural world, said John Schoettler, the company's global real estate director. The challenge was creating an environment conducive to plants without being hot and muggy like a greenhouse; the spheres had to be comfortable for humans.A staff horticulturist scoured the globe for species that can thrive in a cool, dry environment. Many of the plants are endangered species, meaning that the spheres double as a conservation project. Schoettler said the design was chosen to be an architectural focal point in the city, similar to the iconic Space Needle. ""We wanted to create a place employees would be proud of and proud to bring their families,"" he said.Inevitably, the company's growing presence is making it a scapegoat for common urban woes such as traffic jams and rising rents. New, luxury, one-bedroom apartments packed with amenities that appeal to young urban tech workers fetch upward of $4,000 a month, putting them out of reach of the Starbucks barista.To some longtime Seattleites, the new South Lake Union feels sterile, like an open-air mall. Wide sidewalks are devoid of cigarette butts and shattered beer bottles. Street people banging bongos and strumming acoustic guitars with mangy dogs in tow, a common sight in Seattle's retail and financial districts, are conspicuously absent. South Lake Union has become ""a dormitory for Amazon and now Facebook and Google,"" said Jeff Reifman, a tech consultant.Meanwhile, the Space Needle's owners have complained that all the towers being thrown up by Amazon and developers hoping to house its workers are crowding out views of the aging tourist attraction.For now, Amazon's growth seems unstoppable, and it will continue to redefine Seattle, one of the nation's fastest-growing cities. Nathan Wilhite, 36, helped fuel that growth when he moved from Chicago to Seattle four years ago. He rides his bike to work, parks it in an Amazon bike locker and showers before starting at about 8 a.m. He'll break for a spinach, avocado and almond milk smoothie while catching some sun in a courtyard where other Amazonians congregate to eat lunch.Wilhite is glad he picked the Amazon job over opportunities he considered in Silicon Valley that would have required long commutes by car. The way he sees it, ""one of the best recruiting tools Amazon has is if people come interview on a nice day, and people are sitting outside having lunch from a food truck.""Related:Chic Co-Working Spaces Now Drawing A Corporate CrowdL.A.

529,MCD,"Shares of McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) fell Wednesday after Nomura downgraded both stocks to neutral, saying the burger business overall was no longer ""a beacon of brightness for the industry.""""With the U.S. restaurant industry looking like it could remain sluggish for the remainder of 2016, and McDonald's starting to lap tougher comparisons in Q4 . . . , we believe MCD stock is more likely to be range-bound for the rest of this year,"" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note, in which he cut McDonald's price target to 129 from 142.""While we applaud changes that management continues to make (e.g., testing of fresh beef and actions to reduce costs), we believe that a neutral rating is more appropriate at this time,"" Kalinowski said.mcdThe McDonald's downgrade echoes concerns from some other analysts that the burger chain's sales rebound last year depended a little too much on All Day Breakfast, which was launched nationwide in October. RBC last month said the improved sales showed the ""heavy lifting"" done by All Day Breakfast.Meanwhile, same-store sales industrywide have weakened in the second quarter, possibly due to growing consumer anxiety, bad weather or an abundance of competitive discount offerings spurred by cheap food costs.Also, burger chains like McDonald's and Wendy's, in general, face more competition from the likes of Shake Shack (SHAK), Five Guys, In-N-Out and others who put more of a focus on higher-quality ingredients.Kalinowski estimated that comps for burger chains were just ""barely positive"" in the second quarter. ""No longer is the burger segment a beacon of brightness for the industry, as it was in Q1.""He added that a data breach affecting more than 300 Wendy's restaurants could hurt also hurt its same-store sales. He cut his price target on the stock to 11 from 12.50.McDonald's closed 1.6% lower at to 120.62 on the stock market today, nearing the low end of the flat base it is forming with a 132.06 buy point. Wendy's fell 1.8% to 9.81. Yum Brands (YUM), now Kalinowski's top stock pick, lost 0.5% 83.89 but is still near an 85.89 buy point.Kalinowski also brought the pain to the pizza industry on Wednesday, downgrading Papa John's (PZZA) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ), citing slower industry trends and more competition from Yum's Pizza Hut.Papa John's fell 0.35%, while Domino's slipped 1.6%.

547,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) has imposed ultra-high rents and restrictive contracts on its European franchisees, ultimately harming their competitive position by forcing them to pass on costs to consumers, according to an antitrust complaint filed with the European Commission by three Italian consumer groups.The complaint could add to the fast-food chain's difficulties in the European Union. Authorities last month began investigating whether the company received illegal tax breaks in Luxembourg.McDonald's shares closed down 0.6% in the stock market today.The European Commission said it would review the consumer groups' complaint, which alleges that McDonald's made franchisees pay rents that were 10 times normal market value. It also says one- to two-year noncompete clauses in franchise contracts prevent franchisees from changing brands.McDonald's stood by its franchise system, saying in a statement that it ""helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers.""If the company were found in violation of the law, it could face penalties of as much as 10% of its international revenue, according to the Wall Street Journal.EU lawmakers in recent months have tried to crack down on multinationals who have allegedly used their size — and some creative accounting — to work out favorable tax arrangements.In October, the EU ordered Starbucks (SBUX) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to pay unpaid taxes after ruling that their tax arrangements in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, respectively, broke the law. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) have also been in the Continent's cross hairs over their tax deals there.Apple shares rose 1.5% Tuesday. Amazon was flat. Starbucks climbed 2.8%, and Fiat Chrysler was up nearly 1%.And on Monday, the European Commission determined that tax exemptions, which had given dozens of multinationals some $760 million in tax breaks on Belgian profits, ran afoul of the law.AB InBev (BUD) and BP (BP) were among the companies that benefited, the Journal reported.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

551,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) further cut its fourth-quarter guidance Wednesday and disclosed a subpoena in connection with a federal criminal investigation into a restaurant hit by norovirus in August.The fast-casual burrito chain said December comparable restaurant sales plunged by 30%, and it now expects Q4 comps to sink by 14.6%, with earnings per share coming in at $1.70-$1.90. That's far worse than the 8%-11% quarterly comp decline and EPS outlook of $2.45-$2.85 that the company forecast last month.Chipotle said in a regulatory filing that a separate norovirus incident last month at a restaurant in Brighton, Mass., had compounded the company's problems following an E. coli outbreak at some of its locations during the fall.The restaurant chain also anticipates one-time Q4 expenses of $14 million-$16 million to cover food replacement, food safety, inspection, marketing and other costs. That's a higher estimate than the $6 million-$8 million estimate offered in December.And Chipotle sees restaurant-level operating margins shrinking to 20%-21%, compared to the 22%-24% projected last month.

553,MCD,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 with the largest amount spent on stock buybacks in the first quarter, which in total set a nine-year high as companies sought to boost their stock price in a slumping market, according to the S&P Dow Jones Indices.Gilead spent $8 billion, up from the $3.1 billion it spent in the prior quarter. Apple spent $6.7 billion, slightly down from its prior quarter's $6.9 billion.Companies in the S&P 500 spent a total of $161.4 billion in stock buybacks in Q1, up 12% from Q1 2015. It was the second-largest expenditure on record, following the $172 billion spent in Q3 2007, as reported by the S&P Dow Jones Indices.The information technology sector continued to dominate buybacks. Following Apple in the IT sector were Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Microsoft spent $3.85 billion, with Oracle at $2.2 billion and Alphabet at $2 billion.Following Gilead and Apple as the biggest spenders, General Electric (GE) was No. 3 at $6.3 billion, then came Pfizer (PFE) at $5 billion and McDonalds (MCD) at $4.3 billion. Microsoft was No. 6 overall.For the ninth consecutive quarter, more than 20% of the S&P 500 companies reduced their year-over-year diluted share count by at least 4%, thereby boosting their earnings per share by at least 4%.""The pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn of the year, which coincidentally started in early February when many earnings lock-ups ended,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a statement announcing the Q1 tally.""The upswing in both expenditures and participation appears to persist in the market, meaning that the upturn in Q4 was not a single-shot,"" he saidAccording to Silverblatt, cash reserves set a record, increasing 1.6% to $1.347 trillion. That topped the prior record $1.333 trillion set at the end of 2014. Silverblatt adds that the current cash level is 86 weeks of expected 2016 operating income, giving corporations leeway in their expenditures.Among the two buyback leaders, Apple stock rose 3% in Q1, ending the quarter at 108.99, Apple stock was down a fraction to 95.55 at the close on the stock market today.Gilead shrank 9% in Q1, ending the quarter at 91.86. Gilead stock ended trading Wednesday at 82.45, up 0.8%.

554,MCD,"Under the glare of the fight-for-$15 movement, McDonald's (MCD) CEO Steve Easterbrook told a shareholders meeting on Thursday that self-service kiosks and automation might change jobs but won’t eliminate them""It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it’s through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks -- that is a societal trend,"" he said. ""We want to adapt to that, but it’s not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just re-apportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.""Vilified by Big Labor as a symbol of low wages, it's easy to understand why Easterbrook would want to soft-pedal the truth about how the fast-food industry is likely to respond to a much higher minimum wage. Yet the economics of operating a fast-food franchise with thin profit margins points to a harsher reality.When Easterbrook talks about how McDonald's will respond to minimum wage hikes, it's worth remembering what he said when the company hiked its average hourly wage to just above $10 an hour last year -- but only for employees at the roughly 10% of 14,500 U.S. restaurants operated by the company.The franchisees who operate the vast majority of McDonald's ""make their own decisions about how they run their business and pay their employees.""To the extent that the highly publicized wage hike put pressure on those franchisees to follow suit, they were none too happy about it, because a big wage hike squeezes franchisees in multiple ways:First, their labor costs go up, which puts pressure on them to raise prices. Higher prices could translate to lost sales.Second, assuming that higher prices generate enough extra revenue to pay for the higher labor costs, franchisees have an added burden: The fees they pay to the companies behind franchises like McDonald’s and Burger King (owned by Restaurant Brands International (QSR)) are a fixed percentage of sales — a 10% revenue increase means a 10% hike in franchise fees.Chains such as McDonald’s and Burger King charge franchisees a royalty of around 4%-5% of sales and a similar-size  marketing fee. On top of that, a number of chains, including McDonald’s, Burger King, Tim Horton’s, Wendy’s (WEN) and Jack in the Box (JACK), generally lease out their restaurant locations to franchisees for an additional percentage of sales.Between marketing fees, royalties and rent, a franchisee can owe McDonald's an amount equal to 20% of sales or more.Some simple math illustrates the challenge for a McDonald’s franchisee facing a big wage hike. Assuming a franchisee earns a 2% profit margin, then a 10% price hike that’s just enough to cover extra labor costs would, all else being equal, erase its profitability.A survey conducted for the Employment Policies Institute found that franchise businesses would be more likely than non-franchise businesses to cut jobs (65% vs. 51%) and turn to automation (54% vs. 37%) in response to a $15 wage. While the group advocates against minimum-wage hikes, the notion that franchisees would be less able to manage higher labor costs jibes with the reality that labor costs passed through as price increases would also raise the cost of royalties, marketing and rent.Wendy's said recently that it will make self-service ordering kiosks available across its 6,000-plus mostly franchise-operated restaurants in the second half of the year, as minimum wage hikes and a tight labor market push up wages.For quick-service chains with few company-operated stores, a much higher minimum wage won’t have much of a direct effect, but a deterioration in the financial health of their franchisees would bode ill for the company’s future.Further, one of the growth strategies for fast-food chains is modernizing their restaurants, which requires investments of several hundred thousand dollars per restaurant for each franchisee. Such investments will be harder to make if profits are being squeezed by higher wages.Advocates of a $15 wage argue that companies will save from lower turnover, while many customers will have more money to spend. Yet few operators will be willing to take a leap of faith that they can pass along big price increases without losing customers to higher-end competitors or to eating at home.Wendy's CEO Todd Penegor said the company is ""working so hard to find efficiencies"" so it can deliver ""a new QSR experience but at traditional QSR prices.""Former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi, for one, isn't nearly so sanguine about a $15 wage as Easterbrook sounded on Thursday: ""It will mean wiping out thousands of entry-level opportunities for people without many other options,"" Rensi wrote last month.
"
555,MCD,"After an hour of talking about refranchising and earnings accretion, Jack In The Box (JACK) said Wednesday it will try to become a higher-end burger chain by tapping into two parallel trends that have developed over the last 20 years.The first: the evolution in diners' preferences away from deep-frozen chicken patties with abstract shapes to fresher, better-tasting fast-food items. The second: a shift within popular culture from cheeky to earnest.When Jack Box, the burger chain's balloon-headed, wise-cracking mascot, was created in 1995, the company was trying to tap into a pop culture then defined by ironic, adversarial posturing. But the company suggested Wednesday at its 2016 investor day that the irony once employed in some of its advertising -- the very device that makes many ads seem pointless, too clever, or halfheartedly mean to many older consumers -- no longer jibes with the culture or the chain's more recent focus on quality.""As we started to really shift the quality of our product and the service that we provide to our customers, it was no longer the right way for us to communicate our brand by letting humor dominate the messaging around our food,"" Richard Cran, vice president, marketing communications, said at the conference.""When Jack was created, the No. 1 reigning sitcom ... was 'Seinfeld,' "" Cran added. ""If you think back to how the finale of 'Seinfeld' ended, it ended with the four friends being put in jail for basically just being unpleasant people -- a little bitter, a little bit too sarcastic. And at times, Jack shifted toward that part of his persona too much.""A slide from the company's investor presentation further detailed the cultural changes. Pop culture, Jack In The Box said, had moved from being ""disenfranchised"" to ""empowered,"" from ""sarcasm"" to ""optimism"", or, say, from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""The Hunger Games.""So after years of ads in which Jack Box materialized in stoners' dark, TV-lit basements offering food that either cured or helped them explore their loneliness, viewers might now be more likely to see the mascot embark on a what the company called a ""heroic but silent quest for better ingredients and better burgers.""Fast food's flight to quality comes even as the cheap, commodity-induced discounts that have also characterized the industry show no signs of easing. But Frances Allen, Jack In The Box's brand president, said the company's opportunity ""is not to stay in the very value-driven QSR space,"" referring to quick-service restaurants.And she said the company's goal, by 2020, was to move beyond QSR to become a ""top QSR-plus burger destination,"" referring quick-service restaurants branded as higher quality like In-N-Out and Chick-fil-A but aren't as high-quality as fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Those ambitions could raise more questions about whether Jack In The Box might spin off Qdoba Mexican Eats, the fast-casual chain that the company acquired in 2003. Jack In The Box at the conference said it had a ""firm commitment"" to growing Qdoba but that it could consider alternatives if those plans didn't work out.Offering up a specific deadline by which to make that decision would be ""extremely irresponsible"" and distracting to leadership, the company said.Jack In The Box jumped 5.5% in the stock market today to 83.39. McDonald's (MCD), which held its annual shareholder meeting Thursday, inched up 0.4% to 123.79. Chipotle lost 1.3% to 452.03.
"
556,MCD,"Temple Grandin had trouble relating to people. But she sure could relate to animals. By dealing with her autism, she developed a unique understanding of creatures to build humane facilities for farms and slaughterhouses.Grandin has built many animal handling facilities for slaughterhouses, feed yards and ranches in the U.S., Canada and Europe.She has also created animal welfare guidelines for the meat industry, advised McDonald's (MCD), Tyson Foods (TSN) and other firms on animal welfare, written articles for a maze of publications and become a professor of livestock behavior at Colorado State University.Now 68, she's aiming to help give children the same social awareness that her life has imbedded in her.Grandin's autism helped her decode animals' behavior and understand why they think the way they do, says Teresa Corey, a conference director for Future Horizons, a group based in Arlington, Texas, that hosts conferences and publishes information on autism and Asperger's syndrome.Autism and Asperger's are developmental disabilities that cause people difficulties with social interaction and communication. Signs are typically first noticed during a child's first two years.Good Feeling""Temple would watch how cows became calm in the squeeze chute as they went in for vaccines,"" said Corey. ""With her autism, she didn't like to be touched, and marveled at how cows would be calmed down with a squeeze and built her own squeezing machine.""Grandin has become so successful in improving handling facilities and speaking on autism, HBO made a movie of her life starring Claire Danes in 2010.Early life wasn't easy for Grandin. Born in Boston in 1947, she displayed classic symptoms of autism, such as the inability to speak and an aversion to physical contact.Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital labeled her brain damaged. The diagnosis of autism was still new, having been recognized just a few years before her birth.Autism now affects 1 in 68 American children and is one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the country, according to Autism Speaks, a nonprofit science and advocacy organization.Grandin's mother, Eustacia Cutler, sent her to a speech therapy school and hired a nanny; they teamed up to give her a traditional upbringing. They taught her table manners, how to interact with her mother's guests and not to spend much time in front of the TV.""You have to stretch (mentally to overcome autism),"" Grandin told IBD. ""My mother knew how to stretch me when I was a young child. She knew how to get me partly outside my comfort zone.""Grandin had trouble with speech and making friends, and didn't like going into crowded rooms. But her mother made her socialize with people at parties and work outside the home. The push paid off, with Grandin now speaking in front of thousands of people about autism awareness and animal science.Still, Grandin says, her adolescence and high school days were rough. Students picked on her, and she moved to Hampshire Country School in Rindge, N.H. The boarding school took gifted students with behavioral issues.The vibe was positive, with Temple working in a horse barn and gaining a strong work ethic.""A problem I'm seeing today are kids getting coddled too much and aren't learning how to work,"" she said. ""I'm seeing kids graduating from high school without ever having a job, and for kids that are quirky or different, that is causing big, big problems.""Grandin credits her old-school upbringing and exposure to work as part of her path upward.She grew interested in cattle and animals when she met them at her aunt's ranch in Arizona and credits her aunt as a crucial mentor.Grandin also lauds a high school science teacher for motivating her to study with hands-on projects.She liked such classes, which went beyond textbooks, and encourages that style of learning: ""My ability in art was always encouraged, and that became the basis of my career in industrial design.""Grandin turned her love of animals, science and art into a career, riding education to the hilt. She received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Franklin Pierce College (now University) in New Hampshire, then landed a master's in animal science at Arizona State University and a Ph.D. in that subject from the University of Illinois.Grandin took what she learned in school and her grasp of what causes animals stress, and went to work designing more humane facilities across the world. She points to hard work over a sustained period as the top key to her advancement.Meanwhile, she leapt at opportunities — such as when she built a better dip vat in Arizona for John Wayne's Red River feed yard in the 1970s on orders from the Agriculture Department after an outbreak of scabies, a contagious skin disease caused by mites, among cattle.""Lucky breaks gave me a lot of jobs,"" she said, ""but I still had to do work after that.""International ReachEquipment that Grandin designed handles 50% of all cattle in the U.S. and Canada.Her 2005 book, ""Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior,"" was a New York Times best-seller; several hundred industry publications printed excerpts.Corey says that Grandin solved problems by exploring and refusing to deliver pat answers for her professors in college.As for entering the rancher workforce, autism made it especially hard. It helped that an engineer, Jim Uhl of Agate Construction in Scottsdale, Ariz., explained how to get along with co-workers.""There are a lot of talented people out there, and bosses need to learn how to work with them,"" Grandin said of hiring people with special needs. ""Being blunt helps; don't be subtle. And work with a clear goal; don't be vague.""Despite rising in industrial design, Grandin had her setbacks.In the 1980s, the Kahn slaughterhouse and meatpacking plant in Cincinnati hired her to build a conveyer belt to transport pigs too sick or weak to walk up to the third story to be slaughtered.The problem with her design: The belt just pushed the pigs on their backs and was ineffective.""What I learned from that project is that I treated the symptom, not the root cause,"" she said.After collecting the ID tags of the sick pigs, she found they all came from the same farm. The slaughterhouse could have saved money by buying the farm new boars to produce healthier offspring that could walk to the top of the facility instead of paying for the conveyer belt.Down, Not OutGrandin says that she went into a six-month depression after the project failure, but she learned that not everything could be solved by ""throwing engineering at things.""Just as engineering didn't magically solve the problem at the slaughterhouse, Grandin thinks some people expect quick fixes to complicated problems.""Too many times, people look for a magic fix like putting iPads in schools,"" she said, ""but that's not going to fix everything.""She stresses the need for good management in business and good teachers in schools, especially to inspire those who need extra guidance to realize their abilities.""I'm worried that today, too many kids are being labeled as dyslexic, with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autistic, and they are becoming those labels,"" Grandin said. ""Some of those talented people whom we need to fix the problems of tomorrow are getting that handicapped mentality.""She points to Nikola Tesla, the great inventor of a century ago. If he had stayed out of futuristic findings because of his autism, the world would've been slow to develop alternating current generators.For someone who had trouble socializing in high school, she sure has no problem finding pals in the animal science and autism communities. ""She has friends from ranchers in Montana to Claire Danes in Los Angeles to the students she works with to people in the autism field,"" said Corey. ""She takes people for who they are, and social status doesn't even enter into the picture.""Corey likes Grandin's approach and marvels at how they haven't had a disagreement in their long friendship. ""Empathy goes a lot further than sympathy,"" Corey said of Grandin's ability to interact with others who have autism or parents with autistic children.Grandin says that she lives by this philosophy: Stop looking for all sorts of complicated meanings in life, and just focus on things you can do to improve the world.One way she does it is using the money she's earned from speaking engagements to support autistic students in reaching their full potential.

578,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) CEO Steve Easterbrook said Thursday that self-ordering kiosks and other technology were unlikely to result in job cuts and were not ""meant as a labor replacement,"" even as higher wages prompt fast-food rival Wendy's (WEN) to aggressively seek labor-saving technology.Easterbrook's response came at an occasionally tense company shareholder meeting, before which protesters staged demonstrations and demanded McDonald's pay its employees more. He was addressing an attendee who asked the following question:“With all the talk and all the protesters and the $15-an-hour wage, if that is mandated, if the government does raise the minimum wage, do you see McDonald’s substituting capital -- having kiosks where people order, automatic pancake machines and things like that taking the place of workers where people will end up losing jobs because of the higher wages?”Easterbrook said that he saw that technology complementing labor more than replacing it.""If we were able to alternate certain non-value-added processes in the restaurant we’ll do that because it’s a smart thing to do,"" he said. ""But then that gives us more opportunity to bring that manpower front-of-house -- we can offer better dining area experience and service experience. So I don’t see it being a risk to job elimination.""Still, he said, the jobs themselves could be different.""It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it’s through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks -- that is a societal trend,"" he said. ""We want to adapt to that, but it’s not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just re-apportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.""Easterbrook's announcement follows Wendy's plans to make kiosks available across its restaurants in the second half of this year, although franchisees don't have to use them. Minimum wage hikes in some areas as well as efforts to attract stronger talent have pushed up Wendy's labor costs, the company said this month on its first-quarter earnings call.President Todd Penegor said then that ""we'll continue to invest in technology with things in the front of the house and consumer facing, like customer self-order kiosk, mobile order, mobile pay.""McDonald's is testing mobile ordering apps, something that Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell, Starbucks (SBUX), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and others and others already are doing. New mobile payment services such as Apple (AAPL) Pay, Samsung Pay also are fueling the shift. Such mobile services also substitute for labor, though workers could be shifted elsewhere.Along with higher wages, fast-food restaurants have been squeezed by competition both on value offerings and chains advertising better ingredients. April was a slow month for the restaurant business, possibly due to bad weather in some areas, the discounting and more tepid consumer sentiment, analysts suggest.""In addition, we wonder if declining food at home prices have begun to weigh on restaurant demand,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote in a research note last week. ""For fast food, we believe recent weakness is increasing resolve to deploy value marketing this summer, which may increase risk of market share losses by those chains with limited marketing scale.""McDonald's shares closed up 0.4% on the stock market today. Starbucks edged up 0.25%, Domino's added 1.4% and Apple added 0.8%. Wendy's dipped 0.6% and Yum Brands fell 0.2%.

579,MCD,"Whereas many U.S. companies have yet to crack the code in China, it’s Starbucks’ (SBUX) largest international market. And the coffee giant is betting on further growth there.Starbucks announced Thursday its first international Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room, which will open in Shanghai in 2017.CEO Howard Schultz told CNBC that he wouldn’t be surprised if one day Starbucks had more stores in China than it does in the U.S.Despite the bullish outlook, Starbucks shares are in need of a caffeine boost. The stock has been trending lower since gapping below its 50-day and 200-day lines after earnings in April. Shares ended trading 0.3% higher in slightly above-average volume on Thursday. Starbucks is now about 13% below its all-time high reached last October.Other notable companies are trying to tap into the China market. McDonald’s (MCD) announced in March that it plans to open 1,500 new restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea within the next five years. McDonald's edged higher in the stock market today.But for some, the market has proved to be very tricky, with government censorship rules making it seemingly impossible for Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Netflix (NFLX) to do business there, at least for now.Facebook rose 1.3% while Alphabet dipped 0.2% and Netflix jumped 2.6%.And though Apple (AAPL) relies heavily on China for the production of the iPhone, its sales in the Greater China region plunged 26% in the fiscal second quarter, as local competitors are on the rise.Apple was up 0.8% at the close.As for Starbucks and its success in China, Schultz said that while the Chinese economy may see “cyclical changes,” the company early on had established “a great enduring relationship with the local customer.”

581,MCD,"Jack in the Box (JACK) gapped up to a 2016 high Wednesday after the fast-food chain predicted strong profit growth for years by franchising more locations and pulling back on spending in the coming years, following moves McDonald’s (MCD), Wendy’s (WEN) and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain Burger King to franchise more.Jack in the Box shares rose 5.25% to 79.05 in the stock market today, hitting their best levels early December. That follows a long comedown amid aggressive competition from other chains, who have inundated customers with value options and attempts to use better ingredients in their food. Analysts say bad weather, and perhaps broader uncertainty about the economy, also weighed on same-store sales for many restaurants last month.Jack in the Box detailed in a slide presentation what its profits could look like if it increased its franchise mix to 90%-95%. The company targeted annual operating EPS growth in the midteens over the next few years following the completion of those plans, which could wrap up by the end of fiscal 2017.The refranchising would follow similar moves from McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King, which have sought to insulate themselves from higher minimum wages in some areas and other supply costs. Refranchising can help shift more of a restaurant chain's expenses to its local, independent owners.Jack in the Box also said it has lots of room to grow, particularly in areas outside of the West Coast and Texas where Jack in the Box restaurants aren't as prevalent. The company also runs Qdoba Mexican Eats, a smaller rival to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG). Qdoba has outpaced Jack in the Box's namesake growth, perhaps benefiting from Chipotle's food-illness woes.The company also sees capital expenditures rising this year and next but topping out at $135 million to $140 million from 2018-2020.Wendy's stock rose 1.1%. McDonald's, whose annual shareholder meeting takes place Thursday, fell 0.6%. Restaurant Brands edged down 0.5%. Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 0.2%.

589,MCD,"It's understandable if executives at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and other fast-casual restaurant chains are feeling a little heartburn heading into the new year.
"
590,MCD,"The recent E. coli outbreak at dozens of Chipotle restaurants was enough to give the whole restaurant sector indigestion, considering that Chipotle had been one of the industry's leading lights earlier in the year. Even before the E. coli news hit, though, Chipotle and other fast-casual chains were falling out of favor on Wall Street.
"
591,MCD,"""It's been a tough market for high-beta restaurant stocks,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Andrew Charles told IBD. ""There's a very risk-averse type of investor out there, which you can see in the fact that two of the best restaurant performers have been big names like McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) . In comparison, high-beta stocks have underperformed.""

592,MCD,"Shares of Chipotle, Panera Bread (PNRA), Shake Shack (SHAK), Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), Habit Restaurants (HABT) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO) spent the latter half of 2015 heading south.
"
593,MCD,"Analysts say that a number of factors contributed to the decline, including slowing financial growth, overheated valuations and competition from an increasingly crowded field.
"
594,MCD,"Fast Casual Off IPO Menu?
"
595,MCD,"The challenge facing fast-casual restaurant stocks as they enter 2016 is figuring out how to recapture some of the magic that pushed the group to record highs during the first half of 2015. That won't be easy, considering the current mindset of many investors.
"
596,MCD,"It's also unlikely that you'll see many new issues stepping in to give the fast-casual group a shot of adrenaline in 2016, says Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson.
"
597,MCD,"""You're seeing harder market conditions for a lot of IPOs — not just for restaurants, but also for tech firms and other industries,"" Anderson told IBD.
"
598,MCD,"Meanwhile, slowing same-restaurant sales growth has hit most fast-casual chains of late. Zoe's, Fiesta, El Pollo Loco and Habit logged decelerating comp growth during the first three quarters of the year. While Panera saw a year-over-year improvement in comp growth during each of its first three quarters of 2015, that came off easy comparisons with 2014, when gains were minimal.
"
599,MCD,"Chipotle Stock Turns Toxic
"
600,MCD,"The real trouble came for Chipotle, whose comparable restaurant sales growth decelerated in each of the first three quarters of 2015, all down sharply from 2014. During the second quarter, Chipotle's comp growth fell to 4.3% from 17.3% the prior year. Q3 comps grew 2.6% vs. 19.8% a year earlier.
"
601,MCD,"Things got even worse earlier this month when Chipotle, in the throes of its E. coli crisis, warned that fourth-quarter same-store sales won't increase but instead will fall by 8% to 11%. The company also said that earnings per share will end up at $2.45 to $2.85 a share, well off the $4.09 that analysts had expected.
"
602,MCD,"Amid new E. coli issues, Chipotle's stock fell 8.5% in the last week, 35% off its August peak.
"
603,MCD,"The best performer among fast-casual stocks has been Shake Shack, which had its initial public offering in January. Its year-over-year comps grew 11.7% during the first quarter, 12.9% during the second, and 17.1% during the third. Even so, Shake Shack shares are down 58% from their high of 96.75, set in May.
"
604,MCD,"All of the fast-casual players have faced rising competition — not just from each other, but also from privately held chains and small local and regional operations looking to hop on the fast-casual bandwagon.
"
605,MCD,"""It's a very fragmented industry,"" Cowen's Charles said. ""There's not just one player you have to worry about, but many different types of players.""
"
606,MCD,"Competition doesn't come just from other fast-casual chains, either. Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, a research and consulting firm, points out that some companies face increased competition from chains that don't fall under the fast-casual umbrella.
"
607,MCD,"Panera Faces Bakery Rivals
"
608,MCD,"""There are a number of menu categories that are starting to see some maturity, including bakery cafes,"" Tristano told IBD. ""Panera is the leader in the bakery cafe segment. It's not only seeing competition from other fast-casual chains, but also from Starbucks and drive-through chains like Dunkin' Brands (DNKN). A lot of fast-food players are really pushing the convenience of drive-through.""
"
609,MCD,"Companies that focus on more narrow niches should fare better. Tristano points to Zoe's, which specializes in healthier Mediterranean dishes.

"
612,MCD,"The Mexican category is ""still dominated by Chipotle,"" Tristano said, though he added that Qdoba Mexican Eats, owned by Jack in the Box (JACK), is continuing to grow in a lot of markets where it overlaps with Chipotle.
"
613,MCD,"The wild card is how Chipotle's E. coli woes will affect the competitive landscape. The outbreak has spread across nine states and sickened more than 50 customers. The chain also came under question when 150 people who ate at a Boston Chipotle contracted norovirus.

614,MCD,"Chipotle's woes could open up opportunities for other fast-casual chains to pick up market share.
"
615,MCD,"""For every loser, there will be a winner, and Panera will be the real winner at the start,"" said Maxim's Anderson. ""Even though Panera is not a direct competitor to Chipotle in terms of Mexican food, they have a lot of geographic overlap and share the same types of customer.""
"
616,MCD,"Anderson recently made Zoe's a top pick for 2016, saying that its compelling menu, demographic targets and solid economics all support continued expansion.
"
617,MCD,"Tristano is among those who reckon that Chipotle can bounce back and re-establish itself as a force in the restaurant industry.
"
618,MCD,"""Fortunately for Chipotle and other brands, consumers tend to be very forgiving,"" he said. ""The Chipotle brand has a very strong customer following, and because of that they are still in a great posi tion. Of course, they still have to ensure quality and safety, which they are very focused on right now.""

619,MCD,"Even though fast-casual chains have stumbled of late, many industry watchers still have a positive outlook on the sector.
"
620,MCD,"Sit-Down Still No Standout
"
621,MCD,"Tristano forecasts 7.1% unit growth for fast-casual chains in 2016, in contrast to around 1% for full-service eateries.
"
622,MCD,"""There's still a market-share shift away from more traditional full-service/fast-food categories and toward fast-casual,"" Tristano said.
"
623,MCD,"That's mainly because consumers continue to gravitate toward what fast-casual chains offer, according to analyst Charles.

Its new fiscal Q3 forecast also comes after delivering 6.5% same-store sales growth in Q2.Stephens analyst Will Slaubaugh said in a research note earlier this month that ""more frequent value days, chicken sandwich launches, new shakes, and most recently, lemonades, have all been positive contributors"" to Sonic's performance.""However,"" he noted, ""we have some concern that the impressive acceleration in 2Q could have raised SSS expectations above where we are comfortable in the near term, given the choppy restaurant environment and difficult weather trends in April.""Speaking about Red Robin's Q1, Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro said ""the soft industry environment and lower TV advertising spend"" were among the main factors for the weaker results.Some analysts appear to be concerned that with more value deals, each value offering means less.""The availability of deals, in our view, is creating the notion that value is an expected part of the fast food experience, particularly as the pricing gap widens between traditional fast food chains and fast casual chains,"" RBC wrote in a report this month.

632,MCD,"Fast-food giant McDonald's (MCD) has again found the recipe for growth. Last month, the company posted a third-quarter profit of $1.40 a share, up 28% from a year earlier. Earnings had fallen in the previous four quarters. McDonald's third-quarter sales, however, fell 5% to nearly $6.62 billion, hurt by a strong dollar. Its top line has now contracted for five straight quarters. Excluding currency headwinds, revenue was up 7%.The company's global comparable sales rose 4%, with U.S. sales up 0.9%. McDonald's saw strong demand for breakfast items, and the introduction of its buttermilk fried chicken sandwich also helped. But in its high-growth segments, which include China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, comp sales were up 8.9%.Last month, the company started to serve breakfast all day in efforts to drive sales. The company unveiled a restructuring plan in May.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 1% to $4.86 a share this year. For 2016, EPS are slated to rise 9% to $5.29. McDonald's profit fell 13% in 2014.McDonald's stock hit its lowest levels in more than two years during late August. But just two months later, it hit a record high.The stock has cooled off from a big breakout past a 101.98 buy point from a flat base in October. It has now formed a three-weeks-tight add-on pattern with a 114.06 entry. Tight price action after a big breakout is good to see and signals support by professionals such as hedge funds and mutual funds.McDonald's is a member of the S&P; Dividend Aristocrats; it's an S&P; 500 firm that has increased its dividend each year for at least 25 straight years. The fast food giant has raised its dividend each year since 1976.In September, McDonald's lifted its dividend by 5% to the current quarterly rate of 85 cents a share. The stock pays $3.40 on an annual basis and has a yield of 3%.

Shares cleared a 117.09 buy point and climbing as high as 120.79. But the Leaderboard list stock has consolidated since then. Facebook fell as low as 116.73 intraday Wednesday, slightly below the buy point, but closed up 0.3% at 117.65 on the stock market today, flirting with its buy point.McDonald's formed a seven-week-long cup based in February and March, with a 124.93 buy point. It rose to 125 on March 23 and 131.96 on March 30. Along the way, it reported a 22% increase in Q1 EPS on April 22. But shares have drifted lower A Sonic (SONC) same-store sales warning triggered a sell-off in fast food restaurants Wednesday. and McDonald's fell 1.2% on Wednesday to 126.21, below its 50-day average for the first time since March 8.

685,MCD,"Wendy's (WEN) said that self-service ordering kiosks will be made available across its 6,000-plus restaurants in the second half of the year as minimum wage hikes and a tight labor market push up wages.It will be up to franchisees whether to deploy the labor-saving technology, but Wendy's President Todd Penegor did note that some franchise locations have been raising prices to offset wage hikes.McDonald's (MCD) has been testing self-service kiosks. But Wendy's, which has been vocal about embracing labor-saving technology, is launching the biggest potential expansion.Wendy's Penegor said company-operated stores, only about 10% of the total, are seeing wage inflation of 5% to 6%, driven both by the minimum wage and some by the need to offer a competitive wage ""to access good labor.""It's not surprising that some franchisees might face more of a labor-cost squeeze than company restaurants. All 258 Wendy's restaurants in California, where the minimum wage rose to $10 an hour this year and will gradually rise to $15, are franchise-operated. Likewise, about 75% of 200-plus restaurants in New York are run by franchisees. New York's fast-food industry wage rose to $10.50 in New York City and $9.75 in the rest of the state at the start of 2016, also on the way to $15.Wendy's plans to cut company-owned stores to just 5% of the total.Still, Penegor said that increased customer counts more than price hikes drove the chain's 3.6% same-store sales increase in the first quarter.Although profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, Wendy's shares dived nearly 9% Wednesday because of weak second-quarter sales.""We are seeing a bit of a softer overall category in April"" relative to the past two quarters, Penegor said on an earnings call, implying more of an industrywide trend than an issue specific to Wendy's.Penegor said the reason for softer growth was hard to pinpoint, but he listed a cautious consumer, tougher spring weather in the Northeast, and a wider gap between the cost of food at home vs. food away from home as possible contributors.While Wendy's management was upbeat about company prospects, noting that it just experienced its first year with a net increase in restaurants since 2010, its downbeat comments about sector growth were contagious. McDonald's eased 1.7% after touching a new record high on Tuesday. Yum Brands (YUM), which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, slipped 2.6% and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) fell 3.4%.For now, Penegor said, wage pressures have been manageable both because of falling commodity prices and better operating leverage due to an increase in customer counts. Still, the company is wary about both wage hikes and a possible recovery in commodity prices and is ""working so hard to find efficiencies"" so it can deliver ""a new QSR experience but at traditional QSR prices.""In addition to self-order kiosks, the company is also getting ready to move beyond the testing phase with labor-saving mobile ordering and mobile payment available systemwide by the end of the year. Yum Brands and McDonald's already have mobile ordering apps.

"
688,MCD,"One of the rallying cries of the Fight for $15 movement is that employers like McDonald's (MCD) make billions in profits on the backs of taxpayers.In the view of the political left, companies shouldn't be credited for employing large numbers of workers with modest skills, but rather vilified for paying so little that workers need to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and earned income tax credits.Now that same low-wage argument used against the fast-food industry and Wal-Mart (WMT) is being brought to bear against a surprising target: manufacturers. It seems that even as Donald Trump has vowed to bring factory jobs back to the U.S. — and get Apple (AAPL) to start making its Apple iPhone at home — by threatening to impose tariffs on imports, the reality of manufacturing employment is no longer quite what it used to be.The Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley, found that the federal government and states spent $10.2 billion per year on safety net programs for factory production workers and their families from 2009 though 2013.The families of 34% of production workers were enrolled in at least one public safety net program, rising to 50% among factory workers hired through staffing agencies. The latter number is ""similar to the rate for fast-food workers and their families,"" the Berkeley labor center said.Citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the researchers find that production workers employed by staffing agencies earn 27% less than those employed directly by manufacturers — $12.05 vs. $16.56 an hour. Further, temp workers now account for an estimated 9% of all frontline manufacturing production workers such as assembler, up from 1% just 25 years ago.In many instances, those workers with vastly different pay, benefits and job security work side by side. Ford (F) and Nissan (NSANY) are among automakers that utilize staffing companies in the U.S., the Washington Post reported.In truth, shaming companies for their workers' reliance on federal programs has seemed more like a tactical move than a well-considered argument. Shifting low-wage workers out of Medicaid will help boost California's $15 minimum wage to $18.52 or more for workers clocking at least 30 hours, making better pay an even bigger stretch for modest-wage employers.Already, minimum-wage hikes in California are speeding up the exodus of the garment-manufacturing industry from Los Angeles.While factories are an unlikely target for nationwide minimum-wage protests, the Berkeley researchers suggest another course of action. Noting that many manufacturers receive significant tax subsidies as states and localities try to attract and retain them, they advise ""conditioning subsidies on strong wage requirements across the workforce.""That would provide further incentive for manufacturers to shift work out of state or out of the country.

691,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) is in an interesting position as it approaches its annual investor/analyst day, with a rising share price but sluggish sales as it and other fast food giants face rising competition from fast casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Shake Shack (SHAK).
"
692,MCD,"The investor day meeting is scheduled for Tuesday from 1 p.m to 5 p.m. Eastern. Investors should be pretty pleased with McDonald's stock performance of late. Its shares are up about 20% for the year and touched a new high of 113.96 on Oct. 26.
"
693,MCD,"That rise comes despite five straight quarters of lower sales. Its Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating of 80 out of a possible 99 is not bad, but not nearly as strong as retail-restaurant group leaders like Starbucks (SBUX), which has a 94.
"
694,MCD,"Even so, McDonald's has lately rewarded investors who watched the company's stock price go sideways for much of 2015. In a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.
"
695,MCD,"EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.
"
696,MCD,"On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""

708,MCD,"Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.McDonald's (MCD) is in an interesting position as it approaches its annual investor/analyst day, with a rising share price but sluggish sales as it and other fast food giants face rising competition from fast casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Shake Shack (SHAK).The investor day meeting is scheduled for Tuesday from 1 p.m to 5 p.m. Eastern. Investors should be pretty pleased with McDonald's stock performance of late. Its shares are up about 20% for the year and touched a new high of 113.96 on Oct. 26.That rise comes despite five straight quarters of lower sales. Its Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating of 80 out of a possible 99 is not bad, but not nearly as strong as retail-restaurant group leaders like Starbucks (SBUX), which has a 94.Even so, McDonald's has lately rewarded investors who watched the company's stock price go sideways for much of 2015. In a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""One thing Palmer will be looking for from Tuesday's meeting is whether certain company initiatives, including a bigger national advertising push, will drive higher sales of improved menu items such as the Quarter Pounder and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich.What else should investors look for from the gathering? Menu upgrades.

713,MCD,"Stocks held on to firm gains with an hour left in Tuesday's session, while Amazon.com (AMZN), the fifth-largest company on the Nasdaq, got even bigger as it surged to an all-time high of 701.93.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 paced the advance, each rising 1.1%. But in the stock rally today, the Nasdaq this time did not lag and was also up nearly 1.1%. Volume was running almost 10% lower on the NYSE vs. the same time Monday, but it bulged 11% higher than Monday's level on the Nasdaq.The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.6%, further indication that large- and mega-cap stocks held the upper hand. Chip stocks rebounded, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or the SOX, jumped 1%. The SOX is still down 3% year-to-date vs. a 1.7% gain for the S&P 500. The Dow utilities lagged, up just 0.2%. Yet yield plays continue to thrive. In Monday's action, real estate firms, mostly REITs, dominated IBD's new high list. See the May 9 new high list here. Second in the list were medicals, and then business services-related stocks.IBD's Take: How healthy is Amazon's stock and how does it compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupAmazon expanded its market cap to almost $331 billion, as shares rose 21.32, or more than 3%, to 701.07. Volume was running 45% above average with less than an hour to go in the market. Amazon's average daily turnover is 4.12 million shares, meaning its dollar volume exceeds $2.8 billion each day.The e-commerce giant announced a new service called ""Amazon Video Direct,"" a self-service program that will allow video creators to reach tens of millions of Amazon Prime customers. Its streaming video service is already a huge hit, providing heavy competition for Hulu and Netflix (NFLX). But in this new service, video makers will be able to earn royalties based on hours streamed.Amazon was highlighted in IBD Leaderboard, a premium service for investors seeking to find emerging market leaders just before they break out, as early as March 29; that day the stock closed at 593.86. It soon formed a proper handle in bone-dry trade for nine sessions, setting up a new buy point at 603.34 and a breakout in rising volume on April 13, ahead of its April 28 Q1 report. Amazon has rallied 16% since then.Watch to see if the company finds upside resistance near 700 over the next few days. Also, negative reversals in heavy volume would pose as a negative sign.Other big-cap leaders making headway on Tuesday include McDonald's (MCD), whose new build-your-own TasteCrafted chicken or beef burgers and all-day breakfast menu continue to excite investors. The Dow component rose 0.5% to a new high of 131.50 in light trade and is just extended 5% past a 124.93 flat-base entry. The stock, which gets a 90 Relative Strength Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, ranks fifth among all stocks in IBD's Retail-Restaurant industry subgroup in that measure.In Q1, McDonald's sales, influenced by currency headwinds, fell 1%, the smallest drop amid seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines. Full-year sales are seen slipping 3.3% to $24.6 billion.Wireless telecom giant T-Mobile (TMUS) rose. It is possibly making a second attempt at a breakout past a 41.33 buy point in what looks like a stretched-out double-bottom base. But the base has shown areas of choppy price action. T-Mobile recently reported a first-quarter net profit of 10 cents a share vs. a 9-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 11%. The stock's Composite Rating is respectable at 91.On the downside, SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) fell 18% to 18.53 in huge volume despite a spectacular Q1 report that included a 164% jump in earnings of 58 cents a share, trouncing Wall Street's consensus view by 45%. The solar panel inverter expert's net margin sharpened to 18.6%, a quarterly high. Yet sales growth of 45% to $125.2 million represented a slowdown from revenue gains of 183%, 121%, 72% and 70% in the prior four quarters, respectively.SolarCity (SCTY) also got rocked, sinking 24% to 17, nearly taking out its Feb. 11 all-time low of 16.31. Volume was running more than five times its 50-day average. The solar systems installer suffered a wider net loss in Q1 at 25 cents a share and cut full-year guidance. The company is also feeling the chilling effect of a decision by the state of Nevada to cut solar-energy-related subsidies to homeowners and businesses.The Energy-Solar subgroup ranks in the bottom quartile of IBD's 197 group rankings and is down 43% year to date.

716,MCD,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Wal-Mart (WMT) reported strong results, but Target (TGT), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) were among those with weak results or outlooks. Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years. Weekly jobless claims fell sharply after spiking to the highest since February 2015 in the prior week. Industrial production was strong in April, but manufacturing surveys for May from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed unexpected deterioration.Existing-home sales and housing starts rose for April, while builder sentiment was steady in May.Mega-investors piled into Apple. Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday May 13 that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple last quarter, valued at about $1.07 billion at quarter’s end. Midweek, Greenlight Capital disclosed it raised its stake in Apple 30.7% to 8.2 million shares, and billionaire George Soros' Soros Fund Management said it took a 3,100-share stake in Apple. Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search. Google Home, expected to ship in 2016, will compete with the Amazon.com (AMZN) Echo.

However, Google did not unveil a VR competitor to Facebook’s Oculus Rift. Apple rival Xiaomi plans to ship its Android-based TV set-top box to the U.S. in 2016.Both home improvement chains topped estimates on strong housing market growth and favorable spring weather, raising guidance. But Home Depot fell 2.5% on Tuesday and 1% for the week, as same-store sales growth cooled from 10.2% in Feb. to 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Meanwhile, Lowe’s shares climbed 6.4% to an all-time high, breaking out of a nearly four-month long consolidation.Salesforce.com reported Q1 EPS and revenue that topped views as the business software provider signed more big deals with enterprise customers. Billings rose 31% year over year, accelerating from 28% in Q4. Salesforce.com increased its full-year revenue guidance slightly to $8.2 billion. On its earnings call, management touted a new cloud alliance with Amazon Web Services. Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online.

But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

Volume was tracking lighter across the board vs. the same time Friday.The ISM manufacturing index eased to 50.8 in April, down from 51.8 in March and below economist forecasts for 51.5. But it remained positive for the second consecutive month; a reading above 50 indicates expansion.Food, internet retail and steel stocks led the upside in the stock market today. Amazon.com (AMZN) added 3% in heavy trade. Shares are now extended from a 603.34 buy point and from an alternate handle entry of 638.11. The stock gapped up and soared 10% Friday, after its earnings report late Thursday crushed views. Nomura on Monday set a price target of 775, which represents about 15% upside from Amazon's current level.Goldman Sachs (GS) and McDonald's (MCD) outperformed among blue chips, with respective gains of 1.6% and 1.3%. McDonald's shares are in buy range from a 124.93 flat-base buy point cleared in late March. The fast-food giant has served up robust double-digit profit gains the past three quarters.But Apple (AAPL), down 1% in above-average volume, was the biggest loser on the Dow. The stock is working on its eighth straight loss and has given up 11% since the iPad maker's quarterly results disappointed late Tuesday and it reported a year-over-year iPhone sales decline for the first time. Apple is close to undercutting its late January low.Solar, automakers and oil stocks lagged. West Texas intermediate crude slid more than 2% to $44.82 a barrel. Among oil stocks, Baker Hughes (BHI) reversed from a 5% early spike and sank 3% in massive volume.

Halliburton rose 2% in fast trade, on track for a fifth straight advance.Tesla Motors (TSLA) pulled back 1% ahead of its Q1 earnings report due Wednesday after the close. Analysts expect a loss of 58 cents a share on a 45% sales jump to $1.60 billion. Shares have eased following a recent rally but are holding above their 10-week and 40-week lines.

That topped the 6.22% average annual gain by equity-income funds.Equity-income funds outperformed during most of the Great Recession. They had better quarterly returns as a group from the fourth quarter of 2007 through Q1 2009. And they were close during the rest of 2009.That's what you expect from equity-income funds. In a market downturn, the income they generate can cushion the blow to investors from declines in stock share prices or at least slower growth of shares.But the broad market bogey came roaring back after the financial crisis. And it outperformed equity-income funds from Q2 2014 through Q4 2015.Look how that adds up. It can give a nice little boost to your overall portfolio or to your retirement nest egg in particular.If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on March 31, 2006, after 10 years your money would have grown into $20,047.If you had invested the same amount in a cross-section of equity-income funds, it would have swelled to $18,531.In that decade, the now-$520 million Nicholas Equity Income Fund (NSEIX) was the best-performing equity-income fund.

It had another 8.5% in foreign stocks, and the balance in cash and other types of assets.Consumer cyclicals comprised the fund's largest sector, with a 26% weighting. Health care and technology were the next largest sectors, with weightings of about 14% and 15% respectively.Six Flags Entertainment (SIX), a theme-park operator, is a recent holding that has helped the fund outperform despite a broad market that has been on a roller-coaster ride of its own for nearly six months.Six Flags fell Thursday and Friday amid a broad market pullback. Even so, the stock is up 27% over the past 12 months. Its dividend yield is 3.8%.The average 12-month dividend yield for all equity income funds is 1.94%.On Wednesday the company reported a loss of 51 cents a share for Q1. Still, the outcome was better than seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected. Their consensus was for a 64 cent loss. And even with the loss, the results were better than the year-earlier quarter, when the company lost 75 cents a share.Six Flag's Q1 revenue of $115.4 million also topped analysts' expectations.EPS grew 52% 105% and 32% the past three quarters.The stock has IBD's Composite Rating of 95.

It may mean it takes some time.""Monster is still figuring out how it will launch in China and in what cities, he added.Sacks also said that Monster has grown its market share over the past three months, and in cases and units, the company is now ahead of rival Red Bull.Monster stock climbed 8% in extended trading after closing the regular session down 0.4%. Coca-Cola finished 0.9% higher.In June, Monster closed a deal with Coca-Cola in which it made the soft drink giant Monster's preferred global distribution partner. They also swapped several brands, and Coke took a 17% stake in Monster.The deal caused problems in Q2, when disruptions related to the distribution shift to Coke hurt Monster's sales growth. Monster cited lower inventories maintained by bottlers in the transitioned territories, plus uncertainties with certain international distributors outside of Coke's network.But on Thursday, Monster said that distribution is now going more smoothly.""We are pleased to report good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers,"" Sacks said in a statement.The news helped boost third-quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 20% to 84 cents, beating analyst consensus by 3 cents. Gross margin widened to 61.5% from 53.8%.Net revenue climbed 19% to $756.6 million, topping estimates of $735.5 million. Unfavorable currency rates reduced net sales by about $28.6 million in the quarter.Net sales to customers outside the U.S. grew 25% to $170.6 million. Asia-Pacific sales jumped 43% in dollars, and management said that the Europe-Middle East-Africa market is operating well with improvements in increasing distribution.Monster is also looking to a recent deal with McDonald's (MCD), which is selling Monster beverages in about 20 of its U.S. restaurants in a trial that could open up a new market for Monster drinks.
"
734,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) held its annual investor/analyst day Tuesday on the same day that thousands of fast-food workers nationwide held protests calling for higher pay, but the company chose to focus on its growth strategies.The meeting took place as McDonald's eyes ways to better compete against fast-food rivals such as Yum Brands (YUM) — owner of the KFC and Taco Bell chains — as well as fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Shake Shack (SHAK).During the first hour of the scheduled four-hour meeting, McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook and other officials outlined several new goals that the company looks to achieve in coming months.""My priorities for McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company are threefold: driving operational growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value,"" Easterbrook said. ""We are taking bold, urgent action to reset the business and prepare the company for the next chapter of its history.""McDonald's constant-currency financial targets for 2016 include systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%, excluding potential charges associated with its refranchising strategy and cost-saving initiatives.More Franchises, Fewer CostsIn terms of refranchising, the company raised its target to 4,000 restaurants from an earlier target of 3,500. This accelerates the pace and increases the global franchised percentage from the current 81% to about 93% by the end of 2018. McDonald's long-term goal is to become 95% franchised.McDonald's also raised its net annual general and administration cost-savings target to $500 million, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017. This reflects a $200 million increase from the previously announced target. The new target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes.In addition, Easterbrook said McDonald's has no plans to spin off its properties into real estate investment trusts, as had been speculated.""We have given REITs serious consideration, but we don't believe it serves best the interests of shareholders to pursue REITS at this time,"" he said.Easterbrook also mentioned plans to grow its store count internationally and improve McDonald's level of efficiency and customer service. It looks to add more restaurants along Germany's Autobahn, for example. Meanwhile, it is looking to change the way it toasts buns and grills meat.""We were not executing to our standards,"" he said. ""We were missing customer expectations in too many places. For too long we've asked customers to adapt to us. A big part of turning that around is giving customers more choice and always adapting to meet their needs.""Meanwhile, McDonald's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 89 cents per share of common stock, payable on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 1. This represents a 5% increase over its previous quarterly dividend.Protests NationwideWhile the meeting was taking place, fast-food workers in hundreds of U.S. cities held strikes and demonstrations calling for higher wages. It was the largest collection of rallies yet in a cause that seeks to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.The demonstrations began around dawn at McDonald's locations in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities. The protests are expected to continue throughout the U.S. for the remainder of the day and culminate in a rally at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee.Earlier this year McDonald's said it would raise wages by more than 10% for workers at U.S. restaurants that it operates, and pay at least $1 more per hour than the local minimum wage for workers at U.S. restaurants.Financially, though, the company has been in a bit of a funk of late. It has logged five straight quarters of lower sales. Year-over-year earnings have declined in four of the last five quarters, though its most recent quarter showed a 28% EPS gain. That kind of performance compares unfavorably to other stocks in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, including Starbucks (SBUX), Chipotle and Shake Shack.Even so, McDonald's stock price has been on a nice roll lately. Shares hit a fresh high of 113.96 on Oct. 26 and are up more than 10% since Oct. 21.Growth DriversIn a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as recent earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""On a more positive note, McDonald's recent decision to offer an all-day breakfast menu has been a success.""We believe that McDonald's consumer base is broader at breakfast, so increased availability of breakfast items could inspire trial of other core items and day parts,"" Palmer said.McDonald's shares rose 0.3% on the stock market today. Starbucks added 1.4%, while Chipotle climbed 3.2% and Yum lost 0.3%.Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.

759,MCD,"Macy's (M) dismal first-quarter results and guidance Wednesday bolstered views of Amazon's (AMZN) unrelenting dominance, sending shares of the department store chain -- and most stocks in the retail and consumer sectors -- down.Companies ranging from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Michael Kors (KORS) to Nike (NKE) to Tiffany (TIF) to Williams-Sonoma (WSM), sold off. But Amazon stock rose 1.45%, hitting a fresh high.Macy's report followed Gap's (GPS) forecast late Monday of a 5% drop in Q1 same-store sales and weak earnings. The chain also noted a ""tepid macro environment for apparel retail.""""In light of AMZN and M's recent results, we feel more confident that AMZN will displace M as the #1 US Apparel retailer by '17,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Wednesday note, doubling down on his assessment from last year.Macy's earnings fell 29% to 40 cents a share, 4 cents above views, on a 7% revenue decline to $5.77 billion that fell short of estimates for $5.93 billion.Same-store sales -- sales at facilities open more than a year -- at both Macy's-owned outlets and licensed operators dropped 5.6%. For Macy's-owned stores only, comps fell 6.1%.Shares plunged 15.2% on the stock market today to the lowest since December 2011.

On Monday, it said it topped its own goal for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.IBD's Take: Is Macy's a premium or discount stock? And how does it compare to retail rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupMacy's is still in the best position among its department store peers, said Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins, despite Macy's recent struggles, although ""Amazon is doing so many things that a retailer like a Macy's, Target (TGT), Wal-Mart . . . just aren’t able or willing to do.""Adding to the sell-off was Macy's warning on weak consumer spending. Shares of companies not in direct competition with Amazon dropped as well, including McDonald's (MCD) and Panera (PNRA).""We are seeing continued weakness in consumer spending levels for apparel and related categories,"" Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""In particular, our sales trend relative to expectations meaningfully slowed beginning in mid-March, and first-quarter results are below our original outlook.""The company now sees full-year per-share profit of $3.15-$3.40, down from its previous outlook of $3.80-$3.90 and far below Wall Street estimates for $3.80 a share. It also expects 2016 same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to fall 3%-4%, vs. prior outlook for a 1% decline.""We are not counting on the consumer to spend more,"" Lundgren said, so the department store is ""working harder to give customers more reasons to buy from us by delivering outstanding style, quality and value.""For the second straight year, tourist spending is falling in the double digits, he said, and noted a slowdown in some ""center core"" categories. But he also said that the first quarter is a ""relatively small portion of the total year"" and sees a chance to play catch-up over the next three quarters.Still, Macy's isn't exactly the next Sears Holdings (SHLD), which has seen years of falling sales and store closures.""That's a leap,"" laughed Perkins, though he also said the department store's current struggles are more than just a bump in the road.But like Sears, Macy's is evaluating real-estate proposals for joint ventures or similar arrangements. Macy's has been under pressure to spin off its real estate holdings to raise cash.

760,MCD,"Shares of McDonald’s (MCD) rose Friday after the fast-food giant delivered another robust quarter, driven by the continued success of its all-day breakfast menu, as well as positive results from its McPick initiative.McDonald’s earned $1.23 a share in the first quarter, up 22% vs. a year earlier and 7 cents above consensus analyst views. It was the third straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth -- the first time that’s happened in five years.Quarterly revenue dipped 1% to $5.9 billion but still topped estimates for $5.8 billion. It was the sixth straight year-over-year revenue decline but the smallest drop in that string. Sales would have risen 3% excluding the strong dollar.U.S. same-store sales rose 5.4% year over year, which also beat consensus. Global comps rose 6.2% excluding currency shifts, helped by an extra day due to the leap year.McDonald’s shares rose 2% shortly after the opening bell on the stock market today but soon erased their gains and closed down 0.2%. The stock touched a new intraday high of 129.80 on Wednesday but fell nearly 3% Thursday. Shares broke out of a consolidation to a new high on March 30, but in weak volume.Can McDonald's, Other Quick-Service Franchises Digest $15 Minimum Wage?Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said in a prepared statement that the turnaround plan McDonald's announced last year is ""taking hold."" That plan includes the all-day breakfast menu launched in the fall, as well as this year’s McPick 2 for $5 promotion.""The ongoing investments we’re making in running great restaurants and delivering what matters most to our customers are beginning to yield sustained positive results,"" Easterbrook said. ""For the quarter, we generated higher sales, revenues and operating income in constant currencies across all business segments.""Another element of the turnaround plan has been an aggressive move to refranchise restaurants. Over the past five quarters McDonald’s has refranchised about 700 restaurants, JPMorgan analyst Virginia Chambless noted in a report. That figures includes 200 restaurants during the first quarter.McDonald’s recently announced plans to start selling Johnsonville Brats again after a seven-year hiatus, perhaps in response to a recent move by rival Burger King to sell hot dogs at its restaurants. Starting April 25, brats will return to menus at 125 McDonald’s locations in southeast Wisconsin.Another potential growth driver is McDonald’s expansion in Asia. The company recently said it will add more than 1,500 locations in China, including Hong Kong and South Korea over the next five years. It already has more than 2,800 locations in those markets, most of which are company-owned. This time McDonald’s is looking for ""strategic partners"" to help in its Asia expansion.""This will allow McDonald's to accelerate our growth and scale faster across diverse markets, placing us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,"" Easterbrook said. ""We're in the midst of transforming our business and taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to enhance our ability to grow around the world. These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision-making and achieve restaurant growth.""It might take awhile for McDonald’s ambitious Asia expansion to be completed, however.""The company continues to search for a strategic partner in Asia but cautioned the process could take 12 to 18 months,"" Chambless noted.McDonald’s isn’t the only fast-food chain to enjoy a rebound on Wall Street. Shares of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is up 10%, edging higher Friday morning.Shares of Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) have risen about 12% this year.

The S&P 500 and Dow were mostly unchanged.The stock market today slips into Friday's session with slender gains: the S&P 500 is up 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq holds less than a 0.2% gain. But nearly two-thirds of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD advanced for the week through Thursday, with steel makers, ore miners, enterprise software developers and pipeline operators among those posting gains of 5% or more. On the downside, homebuilders, computer makers and meat producers were among the hardest hit.Friday's few scheduled economic reports include a preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index estimate from researcher Markit at 9:45 a.m. ET.

Analyst chatter was active in both stocks Friday.Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V) dropped 3% in early action following their quarterly reports late Thursday.

"
784,MCD,"Mkts went into reverse yesterday.....as earnings seasons moves on and investors/traders struggle with how overvalued/overbought the mkt is based on broader macro economic conditions and very mixed earnings reports - ...the dollar ended the day higher sending oil and other commodities lower as investors reconsider the prospect of higher rates here in the US when the FED meets next week. Once again - many are left asking - Could the FED surprise the mkts and hike in April? Let me be clear - in the words of Luis Enrique - ""Yo no se manana..."" (I don't know about tomorrow)...but I do know that today - the answer to that question is NO WAY!Once again - you got some of the talking heads suggesting that the US economy is so strong that rates need to rise sooner rather than later - the most recent Hawk is Eric Rosengren - Boston's Fed President as he re-iterated 'his' opinion on Monday that the FED'was closer to raising rates than many investors anticipate.... and that the mkt may be underestimating the FED's pace of tightening'Ok sports fans - here we go again.....all the talk of the next FED move just days ahead of their meeting and the end of the month..... Now while I believe that we won't get a move in April - I do expect the FED to leave the door wide open for the June hike (as expected). To add fuel to that fire we heard from Peter Gorra - head of FX trading at BNP Paribas......(Forex - FX - trading is defined as the global decentralized mkt for the trading of currencies - buying, selling and exchanging them at current prices). Currencies are very sensitive to any move in rates so - Peter does sit at the center of speculation.....and he thinks that""U.S. data has actually been pretty good, and there is very little chance of a June move by the Fed priced in,""Ok - first - US data has been pretty good? Really? Let me count thy ways:Yesterday's Philly Fed report - big disappointment, Earlier in this month alone we learned that ISM NY - disappointed, Empire State Manf - disappointed, labor mkt conditions - disappointed, Factory orders - disappointed, Factory orders ex Transports - disappointed, Durable Goods - disappointed, Durables Ex transports -disappointed, Wholesale inventories - disappointed, Wholesale trade - disappointed, Retail Sales - a big disappointment, PPI - oh right - negative, PPI ex food and energy - negative, Construction Spending - negative, Industrial production - another negative.....but so much for the negatives...lets accentuate the positives shall we?Non Farm payrolls - met expectations in terms of 'jobs created' - never mind that they are low wage, temporary (let's ignore that fact), and forget the fact that layoffs hit a 6 month high in January with daily headlines of more 'restructurings' (layoffs) as we move thru earnings season.... US Markit ISM met expectations (positive), ISM Manf -beat, ISM Prices Paid - beat, Oh and the Univ of Mich sentiment survey was 'better than expected', and Earnings reports - yeah - they are missing top line organic growth, yet still beating embarrassingly low earnings estimates - but hey - a beat is a beat and that is positive...so maybe Pete is on the right track.....But as far as the mkt NOT pricing in a June hike - I would disagree - the FED has been quite clear on that point...she has left the June door wide open - if investors have not heard that call of the wild - then they are living under a rock.....Now the real question is not if they have heard the call - the question is Do they believe the call? And that is up for discussion - because here is where I do agree with Peter.....if investors do not believe her and ignore the calls for higher rates and then she in fact moves on rates - then he is right - investors will scream - what the ...?Given Yellen's clear dovish stance, the mkts are not looking for any rate hike this month at all, but we are seeing a small pullback - which reflects just a bit of 'uncertainty' as some investors/traders recede to the sidelines.....but then I expect that next week we will get the usual ramp up when it is clear that rates will go nowhere. Look - the Fed is worried about the both the US and the global economies and feels a bit trapped...... So - next week expect more 'nothing done'.Yesterday's ECB press conference doesn't help.....He (Mario Draghi) did nothing in terms of another policy move but did leave the door open to further negative interest-rate cuts....oh...and that is another sure sign of 'strength'! This morning we wake up to the latest Japanese headline - Hold on this one is good.....""BoJ Officials Are Said to Eye Possible Negative Rates on Loans"" - Yes - you read that correctly.....the headline suggests that the BoJ may consider offering NEGATIVE rates on some loans (in addition the negative rates on deposits) in order to stimulate their economy....... So the bank will pay YOU to borrow money to invest......Does the word 'desperation' come to mind at all?This morning US futures are once again hovering around the unchanged line...initially lower by 3 pts in early trading - but have now recovered a bit and are slightly positive at 7 am. There are no economic reports today to speak of , but we will get another slew of earnings....Caterpillar (CAT)and McDonald's (MCD) will hit the tape prior to the opening while Alcoa (AA), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), Sun Trust (STI) report post close. Traders will now get a chance to react to last nights announcements from Alphabet (GOOGL) and General Electric (GE)...Alphabet missed on both the top and the bottom line (that was surprising) - the stock sold off 5% in the moments after the announcement and are trading at $722/sh right now.GE on the other hand beat the estimates but is also seeing some profit taking in their stock in early morning trading. Trading at $30.65 down 0.30 cts.As we approach the end of April you would expect to see is a narrowing of market breadth and this is exactly what we are currently seeing. The S&P is testing the November 2015 highs (just over 2100) and hitting a wall......Relative Strength (RSI) which began to roll over in March is suggesting market breadth is narrowing or that fewer and fewer stocks are holding up the indexes as money moves into the largest blue chip companies (think safety) typical of what you would see ahead of an expected correction.Now that being said - there are so many other things to consider......The Fed and the fact that we are in a Presidential election year.....and we are in the 8th year of the current presidency... and historically, the mkts tend to peak in April and then suffer for the rest of the year.Since 1900, the S&P has on average, fallen by 1.2% in the 8th year of a presidential term, with the market rising only 44 percent of the time. This summer will be very interesting.....History shows us (82% if the time) that if stocks rise between July 31 and October 31, then we can expect the incumbent party to win in November (Think Hillary).....BUT If stocks fall, (86% of the time) then the thinking is that a new party will take over. (Think Trump) ....so will history repeat itself or not?I expect the mkt to continue to churn and challenge resistance right here at 2100........I do not expect any major move in either direction until next week's FED announcement. Remember - it is also month end - so expect some window dressing as we move thru next week.

Same-store sales grew 6%. Operating profit jumped 35%.The growth is encouraging ahead of the unit’s spinoff, following food-safety scares in recent years that sent sales plunging.""KFC China had an outstanding Chinese New Year bucket promotion leading to 12% same-store sales growth for the quarter,” Creed said.Yum plans to spin off its China restaurants by the end of 2016 and expects to add 600 stores there this year, pushing its total to 7,800.

821,MCD,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, top-rated stocks such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are good prospects for a stock watch list.The Internet giants are among five key earnings reports slated for Thursday, along with McDonald's (MCD), Skechers (SKX) and Under Armour (UA).AmazonAmazon said on Tuesday that it will hire 100,000 for the critical holiday season. Many of those employees will ship packages to Amazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year for free shipping and video streaming. Amazon has around 47 million U.S. Prime users who spend about $1,200 a year each on its site, MarketWatch recently reported, citing Consumer Intelligence Research Partners data.Consensus is for e-commerce leader Amazon to report a 13-cent per share loss, improved from a 95 cent loss in Q3 2014. If Amazon tops estimates, it would be the third time in the last four quarters. Revenue is expected to jump 21% to $24.91 billion. That would be the best sales gain in five quarters.Under ArmourSome analysts project that athletic clothing, shoes and accessories maker Under Armour got a boost from back-to-school sales, continuing its four-year-plus streak of double-digit quarterly sales gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q3 EPS minus one-time items to rise 7% to 44 cents, reversing the prior quarter's 12% decline. Q3 sales are expected to rise 25.3% to $1.175 billion, a bit lower than the 29% pop it saw in Q2 but still a strong gain. Cowen & Co. analyst John Kernan is more bullish, forecasting 45 cents EPS on 26% sales growth, led by a 35% surge in footwear, ""in line with management's guidance,"" Kernan said in a report.AlphabetAs of early October, Google became a unit of Alphabet, an umbrella company that includes the company's future-looking projects such as research into how to improve human longevity and contact lenses that measure glucose levels to relieve diabetics from painful pinpricks.Analysts will look for info on how Google mobile search is faring. Mobile revenue is expected to top desktop search revenue next year, Evercore ISI said in a recent report. Under its new structure, the Google business — search, YouTube, Android and most of the previous company — have become the biggest segment within Alphabet.Consensus is for Alphabet to report $18.5 billion Q3 revenue, up 12% vs. the same quarter a year ago. EPS is expected to rise 13% to $7.20.Skechers USAIBD 50 stock Nike (NKE) has long dominated the athletic shoe market, but Skechers — although much smaller — is gaining acceptance as a top athletic brand, analysts say. BB&T launched coverage on Skechers last Thursday with a buy rating and a 150 price target, citing Skechers' ""appealing assortment of lower-price technical footwear.""Skechers has also become the category leader in walking shoes, with a 22% market share. Analysts expect a 67% surge in Q3 EPS to 55 cents, continuing a two-year streak of double-digit quarterly increases. Revenue is projected to climb 30% to $876.5 million.McDonald'sShares of the world's biggest restaurant chain hit an all-time intraday high at 105.20 on Thursday, Oct. 15, with shares pulling back modestly since then. McDonald's revamped its menu earlier this year, adding healthier fare catering to the consumer trend toward fresher, more natural foods. It also has started selling breakfast all day.McDonald's is reportedly near a decision on what to do with its extensive real estate holdings amid calls for a spinoff of those assets into a real estate investment trust. Wall Street is looking for a 17% hike in Q3 EPS to $1.27 but expects revenue to fall 8.3% to $6.41 billion amid contraction in China's economic growth, weakness in European markets and the impact of a strong dollar.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

823,MCD,"Stocks held solid gains in early afternoon trading Thursday as Wall Street digested news from the European Central Bank and another avalanche of earnings reports.Despite rising distribution in the Nasdaq in recent days, the S&P 500's follow-through day on Oct. 2 is starting to look a whole lot better.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all rose around 1.7%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Thursday's levels in the stock market today.The ECB left rates unchanged. Comments from ECB chief Mario Draghi fueled speculation that more quantitative easing could be in store for the eurozone.Steel, software security and machinery-related stocks outperformed, but hospital stocks plunged after Community Health Systems (CYH) issued a profit warning.On the NYSE, advancing stocks topped decliners on the NYSE by 4-to-1. On the Nasdaq, the ratio was 2-to-1.In earnings news, Dow component McDonald's (MCD) jumped 7% on news that global same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter.

825,MCD,"Investors will get a chance to see how much more sizzle McDonald’s (MCD) can add to its stock price this week when the fast-food king reports first-quarter earnings.The iconic burger chain is already one of the restaurant industry’s top performers this year, with a stock price trading near record highs and an aggressive growth plan that includes a big expansion in Asia.Now all all eyes will be on McDonald’s Q1 results, due Friday morning. Industry watchers expect another strong quarter, at least on the bottom line.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters look for McDonald’s to log a 15% year-over-year earnings gain to $1.16 a share, which would be the third straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth. That hasn’t happened in more than four years.The top-line forecast is a little muddier. McDonald’s overall revenue is seen dipping 3% to $5.8 billion for the quarter, which would be the sixth straight quarter of lower revenue.However, same-store sales growth — a more important industry metric — has been strong. Most analysts see McDonald’s Q1 U.S. comps up 4% to 4.5%.During the 2015 fourth quarter, McDonald’s posted a 5.7% increase in same-store sales, well above consensus. Earnings rose 16% to $1.31 a share, topping forecasts by 8 cents. Sales fell 4% to $6.34 billion, but still topped views for $6.2 billion.The company’s recent financial turnaround is partly the result of success with its all-day breakfast menu, which debuted in the fall. Its McPick 2 for $2 deal, an alternative to the Dollar Menu, didn’t fare as well. It was later replaced by the McPick 2 for $5, which has performed better.""While the McPick 2 for $2 and industry conditions were relatively weak in January, McPick 2 for $5, along with ongoing strength from All Day Breakfast, have bolstered sales trends in March,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report. ""We believe that the McPick 2 value brand will be one of several reasons that McDonald’s can sustain (same-store sales momentum).""Meanwhile, McDonald’s said it will begin selling Johnsonville Brats again after a seven-year hiatus, perhaps in response to a recent move by rival Burger King to sell hot dogs.Starting April 25, brats will return to menus at 125 McDonald’s locations in southeast Wisconsin, according to news reports.Another potential growth driver is McDonald’s big expansion in Asia. It recently announced plans to add more than 1,500 locations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea over the next five years. It already has more than 2,800 locations in those markets, most of which are company owned. This time McDonald’s is looking for ""strategic partners"" to help in its Asia expansion.""This will allow McDonald's to accelerate our growth and scale faster across diverse markets, placing us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement. ""We're in the midst of transforming our business and taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to enhance our ability to grow around the world. These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision making and achieve restaurant growth.""Wall Street seems happy with McDonald’s direction. The company’s stock price set a new high of 128.90 on Monday and is up about 9% since the beginning of the year. McDonald's ended virtually unchanged Tuesday.That’s part of an overall rebound in fast-food stocks. Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) has risen around 13% for 2016; Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is up 10%; and Wendy’s (WEN) has risen about 2%.Meanwhile, shares of fast-casual stocks such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Habit Restaurants (HABT) have struggled.

826,MCD,"Optimism among small-business owners slipped 0.3 point in March to a two-year low of 92.6, and the 7.7-point decline in the index over the last 15 months is a flashing warning signal of a possible recession, the National Federation of Independent Business said.April's Index of Small Business Optimism could determine whether a recession alarm should be rung, according to William Dunkelberg, NFIB chief economist.Regulations were small firms' top concern, with 21% listing it as their primary worry, followed by 20% of respondents who cited taxes as their main worry.New York and California are two states that have passed gradual raises of their minimum wage to $15 per hour -- moves hailed by unions but criticized by small businesses.Supporters of the wage hikes have targeted blue-chip companies such as McDonald’s (MCD) and Wal-Mart (WMT), but opponents argue that the pay raises will hurt small firms and their workers more.""Arbitrarily raising the cost of labor reduces employment opportunities and raises prices,"" Dunkelberg said in a statement. ""This just gives small firms an incentive to find ways to use less labor.""But survey respondents were less pessimistic about whether business conditions will improve during the next six months. The expected-business-conditions reading rose 4 points to -17.The NFIB's overall index hit a post-recession peak of 100.3 in December 2014, but has remained below 100 since that time. Though the March decline wasn't a huge change, it is below the index's 42-year average of 98.

Find out at IBD Stock Checkup""We continue to view SBUX as a best-in-class operator and an industry leader in the increasingly important realm of technology-driven consumer engagement,"" wrote Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh on Monday. He has an equal-weight rating and 56 price target on the stock.Starbucks' rewards program boasted 11.1 million active U.S. members as of January, with its mobile app accounting for over a fifth of all domestic transactions and with its order-ahead feature also picking up steam.Consensus estimates for domestic same-store sales and global comps are 7% and 6.5%, respectively, according to his report.Piper Jaffray, which noted in its semiannual teen survey last week that Starbucks was still No. 1 with young people, said its latest channel checks leave the firm ""confident that Starbucks is well-positioned to continue driving strong same-store sales trends in 2016,"" citing well-received food and drink offerings and targeted promotions.But with expectations high for the coffee titan, a solid quarterly report may not impress.""(E)ven if Starbucks reports good results -- based on lofty investors’ expectations -- the shares may still face some added pressure, as good results may not be good enough to support SBUX’s shares at current levels,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Brett Levy on Friday. He has a hold rating on the stock.Starbucks is a member of IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group, which includes Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), McDonald's (MCD), Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and the beleaguered Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Yum is slated to report Wednesday.

829,MCD,"So yesterday at about 3 pm EST the news hit the tape, the twitter sphere and the media outlets.....Headlines screamed:***BREAKING NEWS – SUNDAY APRIL 17, 2016 - ***Failure In Qatar - OPEC ministers unable to come to an agreement - oil mkts began to tremble - investors/traders now had to re-assess the reality of a fractured oil mkt......Oil which has rallied 18% from the early April lows and 30% off of the January lows and are now front and center as Asian mkts prepared to open - initial reactions saw oil plunge 6% as investors hit the sell button first only to ask questions later.....the headlines saturated the web.....who would be first to announce this failure and then the resulting mkt action? The headlines began...""Doha Summit Fails to Agree on Output Freeze""""Oil Freeze Talks End in Failure Amid Saud Demands Over Iran""""Oil Tumbles 5% on Doha Deal Disappointment""""Asia Stocks at Mercy of Post Doha Oil Moves""""Oil's Grand Bargain Falls Victim to Saudi Arabia's Iran Fixation""Futures around the globe plunged as day turned to night and the sun began to set in the US just as it began to rise across Asia….US futures were down 11 pts at 8 pm Sunday evening – while futures across Asia pointed in a similar direction as investors dealt with the fallout. News stories began detailing the talks that took place in Doha – the Qatari capital – which dragged on and on – going some 10 hrs past the original scheduled end time – as ""Howie Mandel"" shouted out –No Deal!Oil ministers from 16 nations, representing 50% of the world's production, gathered in the Qatari capital as they worked towards stabilizing the global mkt with artificial production quotas - the first real attempt at coordinating output among OPEC members and nations outside of the group since 2001. The barriers were numerous - would everyone fall into line? Would Iran come to the table? Could they really commit to restraining production? As we know - the Saudi's made it very clear from the beginning......they wouldn't restrain their production without commitments from other major producers including Iran, which had already made it clear that they had no such intention.The breaking story about a failure to agree on output or production quotas among the world's biggest oil producers now opens the flood gates to what many now expect to be a new retreat in oil prices.""Discussions stumbled after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations wouldn't agree to any deal unless all OPEC members joined including Iran, which wasn't present at the meeting…""Angus Nicholson – an analyst at IG Ltd in Melbourne, Australia had this to say:""The market has been so heavily positioned for a deal to go through, The change of tone from the Saudis, particularly driven over the last few weeks by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been quite a surprise to the market. With Saudi Arabia fighting proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Syria/Iraq, it is understandable that they had little inclination to freeze their own production and make way for newly sanctions-free Iran to increase their market share.""So then what happened? Was there really a change in tone from the Saudi's? Did investors get this all wrong? Once the idea of a freeze was floated (two months ago) – trader types started buying up oil – as it was assumed that any freeze would trim supply just as summer was about to begin and the driving season was about to take off… Oil rallied 30% off the lows as the excitement built…..but hey, buyer beware – remember it was the news sources that reported this ‘cease fire' all while the Saudi's and the Russians never really confirmed or denied the story - they let it play out in the media - they never explicitly committed. ….It all sounded good – but it did require that all members fall into line and Iran had said from the very beginning that they had no intention of ‘playing nice in the sandbox'.Overnight oil suffered a bit - with Brent down 4% and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) down about 4.5% - makes some sense - but equity mkts did NOT follow suit and implode the way many thought they might.....In fact - we have to ask: Is a ‘No-Deal' actually better for the mkts in the long run as it allows for supply and demand to find its ‘natural' level of equilibrium vs. ‘artificial production controls' which will only put off the inevitable? ( I mean look - we all know what artificial controls can do to mkts - think massive QE programs instituted by every central bank)As Asian mkts opened – the pressure came to bear - mkts sold off - but not to the extent that many were prepared for.....…..Japan was the outlier - falling some 3+% - but this had more to do with the major series of earthquakes in the past 3 days – vs. the oil story.... South Korea (Kospi) moved 0.28% lower, Australia stumbled by 0.4%, Hong Kong lost 0.9% and China was off 1.43% by the end of the day.As the sun sets on Asia it rises in Europe and as the clock ticked – European mkts were the next to react.....they too are under a bit of pressure – taking their cue from investor angst in Asia - but again - equities are not getting clobbered by any stretch.......Currently Brent North Sea Crude oil is off by 2% while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is down by nearly 3% trading at $39/barrel. FTSE - 0.07%, CAC 40 - 0.04%, DAX +0.06%, EUROSTOXX - 0.18%, SPAIN -0.35% and ITALY +0.11%.US futures which were down 11 pts Sunday evening have recovered a bit from the initial ‘knee jerk' reaction trading last night – currently they are lower by 7 pts as the reality of this OPEC decision permeates the psyche. Since the equity mkts did not implode on this news (as many had expected) – we need to ask: Are investors trying to separate action in the oil/energy space from the rest of the mkt. Now while energy names will get hit today – think transports and manufacturers as beneficiaries of lower oil prices.Earnings will continue to ramp up this week as we enter the thick of it. Last week- the message was all about the banks….now while we saw trading revenues decrease and loan loss reserves increase and most reports miss revenue estimates - they all managed to beat the on the bottom line. Uncle Lloyd (Blankfein) released a strategic restructuring plan ahead of his earnings this week - Headlines read:""Goldman's Blankfein Demands Deepest Cost Cuts in Years"" -on the chopping block? Travel limits, Entertainment, deferring projects and Layoffs as he""has already adjusted his workforce, relying more on JUNIOR bankers, moving support staff to cheaper locations and investing in technology to improve productivity""(Junior bankers? I mean if you want a Jr banker there are so many other places to go - You don't go to GS for a Jr. Banker)The stock rallied on this news taking it to its down trending 100 dma at $163.... earnings are due tomorrow...so the clock is ticking....did he do a good enough job of acknowledging the disastrous industry environment for the sake of investors?Earnings today include Morgan Stanley (MS) - they beat the estimate - reported 0.55 cts/sh vs. exp 0.46 cts/sh, Pepsico (PEP) - beat reporting 0.89 cts/sh vs. the 0.81 cts/sh expected. HASBRO (HAS)toys also beat 0.38 vs. 0.23 cts/sh.....later in the week we will hear from American Express (AXP), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Cocoa Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT)There is not major economic data points today..so the chatter will be about earnings and oil.....and the 3 FED speakers today....Dudley at 8:30 am, Kashkari at 12:30 pm and Rosengren at 7 pm....Take Good Care

But the bank sounded bullish as it upgraded the beleaguered restaurant chain to overweight from neutral.""In all, our call is based on Chipotle being a highly meaningful brand that with time and expense can regain customer trust,"" wrote JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe on Thursday.Shares closed 2.55% higher but remain below their 50-day moving average. The stock has been trading below its 200-day since losing support at the level in late October, and is 40% off its all-time high.The E. coli and norovirus episodes that hit Chipotle locations across the country also hit its brand image, with same-store sales down 14.6% in Q4 and an expected loss in Q1, the latter of which would mark a first for the company’s quarterly results.""We expect normal earnings growth to resume by F18 -- after nearly doubling in F17 -- and believe 20%+ EPS growth can be sustained through at least F20,"" said Ivankoe.He is not the only analyst who sees the light at the end of the tunnel for the burrito chain.Piper Jaffray’s latest semiannual teen survey found that Chipotle still holds major sway over America’s young people. The firm is positive on the company’s long-term story as well, with an overweight rating and 590 price target.The stock is a member of IBD’s Retail-Restaurants industry group, which is at No. 75 among IBD’s Industry Sub-Group Rankings, joined by Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), Yum Brands (YUM) and others.RELATED:Starbucks Is Still Tops With Teens, Chipotle Hangs OnWhy Chipotle Mexican Grill May Have Reached ‘Peak Burrito’

841,MCD,"Hedge funds are loading up with pork.With Americans expected to eat the most pork since 2007, money managers are now the most bullish since 2014 on hog futures, which already are at a nine-month high. Fast-food restaurant owners like McDonald’s (MCD) are selling more bacon, and the price of pork bellies used to make the rashers has surged 30% this year.Demand at home and abroad is rising faster than U.S. farmers are boosting output. Pork remains a cheaper alternative to beef cuts that last year surged to records as supply shrank, government data show. Hog futures for settlement in June are up 16% since mid-November, more than almost every other commodity, including gold.“You have to be bullish in the near term,” said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at broker-dealer National Securities Corp. in New York, who helps manage about $3 billion. “Exports have been strong, that’s what’s driving this.”The net-long position in hog futures and options jumped 20% to 51,505 contracts in the most recent week, the biggest gain in more than a month, according to Commodity Futures and Trading Commission data. Holdings have surged sixfold since mid-December and expanded in 13 of the past 14 weeks.Futures for June settlement, the most actively traded hog contract, fell 1.9% to 82.275 cents a pound at 11:16 a.m. Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices are 12% higher than a year earlier. April futures, which had been the most active until March 8, are trading at 69.775 cents a pound Monday, up 18% since mid-November.In a March 16 report, financial services firm Societe Generale SA raised its second-quarter forecast by 16%, predicting that the front-month contract would average 78.9 cents, compared with 69.4 cents so far this year for the April contract.U.S. hog producers have been expanding after futures surged to a record in 2014, when a piglet-killing virus reduced the domestic herd. Pork production last year was the highest ever and is forecast to increase 2.1% in 2016, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.But people are eating more pork. On average, Americans will consume 50.4 pounds this year, the USDA said on March 9. And more meat is getting shipped overseas.U.S. exports in January were 10% higher than a year earlier, and shipments have averaged 13% above year-earlier levels every month since September, government data show. They exceed the USDA’s full-year increase forecast of 3.2%.Even with the recent rally in prices, beef’s premium to pork is more than 50% above the 10-year average, and wholesale pork is well below its five-year average.More fast-food restaurants are promoting breakfast items all day that feature pork products, said Dennis Smith, Chicago-based senior account executive at Archer Financial Services. As the cost of ground beef slips from recent records, burgers are making a comeback and restaurants are adding bacon as a topping, said David Maloni, principal at the American Restaurant Association in Sarasota, Florida. Wholesale pork bellies are up 88% from a year earlier at $1.3428 a pound, USDA data show.Not all pork items are rallying. Easter hams are priced to sell, dropping 11% since the end of January to 52.05 cents a pound, USDA data show. Bacon fetches a premium to ham that is more than 60% above the five-year average.Rising pork supplies could end the rally, with the increase in hogs overwhelming processing plants later this year. Farmers tend to boost output in the second half of the year.“There’s definitely a good cause to be bullish through the third quarter, but be very careful in the fourth quarter,” said Will Sawyer, an Atlanta-based vice president for Rabobank Food & Agribusiness Research and Advisory. Processing all the hogs “could come at a price that’s less than what futures are showing today,” he said.

842,MCD,"The European Union on Tuesday laid out proposed new rules governing how big companies report corporate taxes as it battles to keep billions in euros within its borders.The EU's European Commission on Tuesday proposed to amend rules governing how large companies report corporate taxes. The Commission, the EU's executive arm, estimated that tax avoidance in Europe costs EU countries 50-70 billion euros ($57 billion-$80 billion) a year in lost tax revenue.The new rules could impact U.S. giants such as McDonald's (MCD), Amazon.com (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which have all faced, or currently face, EU scrutiny.The proposal would force companies with annual European revenue topping roughly $855 million to be more transparent and to publish key information ""on where they make their profits and where they pay their tax in the EU on a country-by-country basis."" The proposal was amended to require corporations to reveal taxes paid in so-called tax havens.European Commission member Jonathan Hill said in a written statement that the proposed changes to existing rules aren't a reaction to the Panama papers. Millions of documents were recently leaked from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specializes in setting up offshore tax havens, mostly for rich individuals.However, Hill added, ""I think that they (the Panama papers) have strengthened our determination to make sure that taxes are paid where profits are generated.""Last October, the EC ruled that tax deals granted to Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat in Luxembourg were illegal state subsidies that the companies must repay.The EU was already investigating McDonald's for allegedly exploiting an agreement with Luxembourg to avoid taxes worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The probe is looking into whether the agreement, under EU rules that prevent taxation in both the U.S. and EU, allowed McDonald's to avoid taxes in both regions.McDonald's has said that it paid its fair share of taxes in the EU, amounting to more than $2.1 billion from 2010 to 2014, Bloomberg reported. The EC is also probing an agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg, centering on whether that country agreed to cap taxes that Amazon pays no matter how much profit it makes there.Alphabet in January agreed to pay $260 million to the U.K. to settle back-tax issues. Many criticized the settlement as peanuts.Apple's Irish tax arrangements also are under EU scrutiny, with a European Commission judgment still pending.The EC statement Tuesday said that the next step is submitting the proposed new rules to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU for discussion, a process that could take months or years, analysts said. If adopted, all 28 EU member states would then have to translate the rules into national legislation.McDonald's, which has a strong 90 IBD Composite Rating -- which means that it's outperformed 90% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth recently -- edged higher in late afternoon trading on the stock market today. It's risen steadily since last fall, advancing about 25% from an Oct. 6 low of 101.98.Amazon, which is on the IBD Leaderboard list of top-rated stocks, may be forming a late-stage cup-with-handle base with a 603.34 buy point. Its shares rose 1% to 601.79 Tuesday.Apple was up 1.2% at 110.31. Starbucks, a stock on the IBD 50 list, fell 2.5%. Alphabet climbed 0.8%.
"
843,MCD,"While much of the media attention in the restaurant industry has focused on the McDonald’s (MCD) financial rebound and Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG) food safety problems, drive-in chain Sonic (SONC) has quietly become one of the sector’s top performers on Wall Street.The company’s shares are up about 7% since the beginning of the year and have risen more than 35% since Feb. 10. In comparison, IBD’s Retail-Restaurant group as a whole has risen about 4% since the beginning of the year and 9% since Feb. 10.Sonic’s stock touched a 52-week high of 36.34 on April 6. The high capped a rally that began a week earlier, when the company beat fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue views and logged a 6.5% annual gain in same-restaurant sales, or at outlets open more than a year. The latter increase was especially impressive, considering that it came on top of an even bigger gain during the previous year’s second quarter.""The clear highlight of the quarter was a better-than-expected systemwide comp of 6.5% against a difficult 11.5% comparison, easily ahead of our estimate of 3% to 4% and consensus of roughly 1.5%,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote in a research note.Sonic reported results after the close on March 29. The next day, its stock price popped 6%.It was a welcome reaction for a company that has largely flown under the radar in the restaurant sector. Most of the attention has focused on rebounding fast-food stocks such as McDonald’s, Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as flailing fast-casual chains like Chipotle, Shake Shack (SHAK) and Habit Restaurants (HABT).McDonald’s has benefited from successful initiatives such as its all-day breakfast menu and its ""McPick 2 for $5"" promotional deal. Meanwhile, Chipotle continues to feel the fallout from the E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at several of its restaurants.Sonic operates in a kind of middle ground between fast food and fast casual. Like fast-food chains, it focuses on quick service. The main difference is that at some Sonic restaurants, you can have carhops on roller skates deliver your food to your car.Like fast-casual restaurants, Sonic specializes in fresh, made-to-order fare that includes burgers, hot dogs, toaster sandwiches, burritos and various breakfast and side items. It has more than 3,500 locations in 45 states, making it the nation’s largest chain of drive-in restaurants. The drive-in concept separates it from other quick-service restaurant (QSR) brands like McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s (WEN), which offer drive-through but not drive-in service.""Sonic represents one of the most highly differentiated QSR brands in the country with a fun, 'retro-future' look that breaks through the clutter in a crowded QSR segment,"" Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle noted in a report.Another way in which Sonic differentiates itself is its technology focus. Over the past couple of years, the company has invested heavily in new Point-Of-Service (POS) and Point-Of-Personalized-Service (POPS) platforms, while other chains have focused more on mobile apps.Sonic’s POS platform is designed to improve the order process, cut food and packaging costs, reduce employee waste and theft, and optimize labor so the right amount of staff is on hand at the right time. The POPS platform lets Sonic tailor offers to customers based on their past purchasing history. It also provides on-site redeemable offers to customers.At the end of the second quarter, the POPS platform was in 1,616 locations and was about halfway through its rollout, Zackfia noted. The rollout should be finished by the end of the 2017 calendar year.""POPS will facilitate technology and social media initiatives (and) allow for uniquely personalized engagement that we anticipate will be a key driver of future same-store sales momentum, including the systemwide rollout of a mobile app that includes mobile payment,"" Zackfia said.Although Sonic’s heavy investment in technology has cut into the company’s bottom line, most analysts reckon that it will pay off in the long run.""While some investors might have hoped for a little better flow-through to the bottom line given the (same-restaurant sales) upside, the team appears to be making the appropriate investments in the business to continue generating market share gains in the future,"" Slagle noted.Sonic officials have a similar take. On a second-quarter conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Clifford Hudson said the company’s POS and POPS investments provide an ""opportunity to leverage this technology and enhance the customer experience in a way that competitor brands can’t.""Even with rising technology costs in recent years, Sonic has done pretty well on the earnings front. It has logged 11 straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth.Earnings came in at 18 cents a share during the fiscal second quarter, which ended Feb. 29. That was up 38% from the prior year and two cents ahead of consensus. Revenue rose 5% to $133.2 million, also topping estimates.Sonic raised its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to a range of 4% to 6% vs. prior guidance of 2% to 4%.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Sonic to post earnings of $1.36 a share for the entire fiscal year, which ends in August. That would represent a 24% year-over-year gain. Earnings are seen rising another 14% in fiscal 2017.

"
849,MCD,"There's more than meets the eye to California Gov. Jerry Brown's plan to hike the state minimum wage to $15 an hour — about $3.50 more.Including nonwage costs — payroll taxes, paid sick leave and ObamaCare's employer mandate — minimum compensation for a full-time worker could rise as high as $18.52 an hour by 2022, an IBD analysis finds.Social insurance taxes would add $1.15 an hour to the $15 wage. Three days of paid sick leave now on the books in California would add another 19 cents. And the ObamaCare after-tax fine, now $2,160 per uncovered full-time worker and rising each year, will equate to roughly $2.18 an hour in pretax wages. Adding in workers' compensation insurance and unemployment insurance would push the total close to $19 an hour.One big change from a $15 minimum wage has flown below the radar: Many low-wage workers would no longer qualify for Medicaid. For example, a single mom with one child who worked 32 hours per week would earn more than the 138% of poverty cutoff for expanded Medicaid under ObamaCare, though her child would still qualify. A single adult who works just three full days a week also would exceed the income threshold.To no small degree, the $15 minimum-wage movement is asking low-wage employers to lift their workers up closer to the middle class and to provide a full menu of social benefits on top. It looks like a recipe for trouble, and even Brown may be wary about it, insisting that the governor retain authority to delay wage hikes if the state sees a fall in employment or retail sales, or if the state faces a budget deficit. Brown had little room for maneuver because a $15 wage initiative that qualified for the November ballot looked like a sure winner and would have provided no flexibility if the wage hike started backfiring.One early-warning sign for California's wage experiment was Wal-Mart's (WMT) announcement in January that it would shutter stores in Oakland and Los Angeles and cancel two planned stores in Washington D.C., dealing a blow to three cities on the leading edge of the push for a much higher minimum wage.Before Los Angeles put its minimum wage on a path to $15 an hour, the question of how city employers would respond to the simultaneous imposition of a health insurance mandate was simply ignored. An analysis of the wage hike's labor cost impact by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, explicitly excluded health insurance — or a mandate penalty. The authors explained: ""Health benefits are excluded since ... the costs of the benefits will not change if wages are increased."" The Congressional Budget Office came to a different conclusion, finding that the ObamaCare employer mandate would exacerbate the impact of a minimum-wage hike. It estimated that a minimum-wage hike to $10.10 an hour could cost 500,000 jobs.""(The) additional cost on employers for some low-wage workers who do not currently have employment-based health insurance ... further boosts the likelihood that employers' savings from reducing the size of their workforces would exceed their adjustment costs,"" the CBO said.Those adjustment costs might include adding labor-saving technology.Wendy's (WEN) CFO Todd Penegor explained in an August earnings call, ""We continue to look at initiatives and how we work to offset any impacts of future wage inflation through technology initiatives, whether that's customer self-order kiosks (or) whether that's automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant.""Starbucks (SBUX) and Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell are among the restaurant chains promoting mobile ordering, which reduces the need for cashiers. McDonald's (MCD) is about to start testing mobile apps as well.The truth about the ObamaCare employer mandate is that it hasn't been nearly as much of a burden on businesses as feared, so they haven't had to cut workers' hours below 30 per week in a dramatic way. But the reason is hardly cause for celebration: Employers have figured out how to dodge liability by offering ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay.That's left millions of modest-wage, full-time workers without affordable coverage options. It's possible that California's embrace of a $15 minimum wage will add to their ranks. But the status quo of full-time workers thrown under the bus by ObamaCare may not hold. If the mandate ever becomes something that can't be easily dodged, minimum-wage employers in California will likely cut work hours in a big way, diluting the promise of a living wage.

"
852,MCD,"Here's one data point that doesn't gibe with the complaint that economic gains are increasingly limited to an exclusive club: Minority-owned business ownership has been surging.Among businesses with at least five employees, the percentage with minority owners rose to 13.3% from 9.7% from 2007 to 2012, finds an IBD analysis of the most current data from the Census Department.The rise in minority ownership among businesses operating franchises of established brands has been especially impressive. In 2012, 21.1% of franchise operators with at least five workers had minority owners vs. 15.8% in 2007. Meanwhile, among firms that don't operate franchises, 12.6% had minority owners in 2012, up from 9.3% five years earlier.The jump in minority ownership of franchises helps explain a surge in minority-owned restaurants noted by the National Restaurant Association.The data confirm something that is well understood by many entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds who have sought to carve out a share of the economic pie: Franchising has provided one of the most accessible and surest paths to business success.Among African-Americans, for example, fully 24% of all businesses with at least 50 workers are engaged in franchising, the new Census data show.Yet this model is increasingly under attack from the political left, which sees franchising as a problem, not a solution. Whereas thousands of minority business owners may see franchising as the best approximation of a golden goose within their reach, the labor movement and its campaign for a $15 minimum wage can't see past their arch-nemesis — the golden arches.In their view, dispersing economic power among franchisers makes it harder to unionize service-industry workers than it would be if labor unions could directly target corporate giants. In that sense, minority-owned franchises are merely an obstacle that must be steamrolled for the greater good.The National Labor Relations Board provided a steamroller suited to the task in designating McDonald's (MCD) a joint-employer of employees who work for franchise-owned locations — about 90% of the restaurant chain's total workforce.McDonald's contends that the designation makes no sense because franchise operators make all decisions involving hiring, firing, pay and work schedules. The company's legal challenge is now being heard by an NLRB administrative judge, but the case may take a few years to play out as it heads next to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then possibly to the Supreme Court.Beyond facilitating a push to unionize franchises, the joint-employer designation would turn small employers into large ones subject to ObamaCare employer penalties for failing to offer qualifying health coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. It also would make corporations with deep pockets liable for labor violations of its franchise operators.Together, these factors would put so much strain on franchise operators and their brand-name partners that their agreements — typically 4% of revenue goes to the franchisor in return for training and the benefits of scale and name-recognition — may no longer be viable.That's a risk the left is apparently unconcerned about, as evident in the appeal before the Supreme Court challenging Seattle's discriminatory treatment of franchises. In petitioning justices for a hearing, the International Franchise Association highlighted internal emails among government officials expressing their disapproval of the franchise model.At issue in the case is Seattle's more-rapid phase-in of its minimum wage for franchise businesses, which are considered to be large employers if the chain has more than 500 workers systemwide, even if the franchise operator has a single location.In an email to a fellow city council member, Nick Hanauer explained the reason for treating small-business that operate franchises differently than other small businesses: ""The truth is that franchises like Subway and McDonald's really are not very good for our local economy. They are economically extractive, civically corrosive and culturally dilutive.""Presumably, one of the reasons that a broad segment of franchising companies has made a concerted effort to increase local minority ownership is to make the business model more of a contributor to local economies.There are other advantages, as well, such as a low cost of capital. In the ObamaCare era, letting others do the hiring also may help limit the cost of the employer mandate.New York, in ordering fast-food companies to pay a $15 minimum wage — phased in by 2019 in New York City and by 2021 statewide — also lumped small franchise operators in with bigger employers.The New York Fast Food Wage Board blasted the franchise industry for a ""combination of profits and impoverishment,"" saying that the industry gets a subsidy in the form of public assistance to its workers.The rule covers a long list of food vendors without table service which have at least 30 locations in the U.S. Among them are Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell, Shake Shack (SHAK), Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN), Jamba Juice (JMBA), Wendy's (WEN) and Subway.Ironically, big franchisors like McDonald's might stand to gain if their franchises raised wages. That's because the typical 4%-of-revenue royalty would rise if the franchise was able to pass along a price hike to customers to cover higher labor costs. Thus, the real gripe with the franchise industry may be a royalty structure that provides an incentive to keep costs down. That's why franchisers may be highly likely to eliminate labor costs by investing in technology if wages rise too high.Image provided by Shutterstock.

853,MCD,"High-rated Adobe Systems (ADBE) stock edged up Thursday but closed down slightly for the week of its Adobe Summit 2016 digital marketing conference. That’s a week after shares advanced almost 9% on the strength of Adobe’s first-quarter earnings report and outlook.The Adobe Summit in Las Vegas drew more than 10,000 people -- the company’s largest live event to date. The theme centered around how brands are increasingly interacting with consumers in a wave of “digital experiences” online that leverage social networking.Actor George Clooney spoke at the Adobe Summit on Wednesday, but most presenters were from the tech and business worlds. Executives from major brands were among the featured speakers, from McDonald’s (MCD) and Mattel (MAT) to General Motors (GM) and General Electric (GE) to Comcast (CMCSA) and Charles Schwab (SCHW).That's right. It's George at #AdobeSummit talking experience and creativity.

In recent years, Adobe has moved headlong to host its products in the Internet cloud, using the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, with platforms that handle content’s entire life cycle from creation through tracking consumer interaction with it. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen summed up a broad Adobe goal: being able to “make, monetize and measure” the digital experiences that people have.""Management highlighted that it is investing around the 'experience business’ wave of disruption and innovating at the platform level, both of which will be important in driving long-term growth for the digital marketing business,"" Samana wrote. ""While it is in the early stages, we see the platform play as strategically smart, as it should enhance the value proposition for Adobe’s entire product suite, making it stickier with customers.""Adobe, which is on the IBD Big Cap 20 stock list, closed up 0.4% Thursday at 92.52, down 1% for the week. The stock market is closed on Good Friday, March 25. Adobe gets a high IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99.

854,MCD,"The strong dollar has been a drag on U.S. multinationals for several quarters. But with the greenback turning flabby, investors are betting on better corporate results, pushing Dow stocks General Electric (GE), McDonald’s (MCD), Microsoft (MSFT) and Coca-Cola (KO) near or above buy points.Another Dow component, Nike (NKE), fell Wednesday after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue for its February quarter, in part due to the dollar. The athletic shoe and apparel giant's sales rose 8% but would have climbed 14% excluding currency swings.Yet the currency headwind is waning. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against the euro, yen and 4 other  currencies, has turned lower vs. a year earlier in the last few weeks -- down 0.9% as of Wednesday, even with a recent upturn. At this time last year, the dollar index was up 21%.The Federal Reserve's decision this month to trim its plans to hike interest rates certainly had an impact. When investors expect U.S. rates to be lower for longer, their view tends to negatively impact the greenback, which becomes less attractive to yield-seeking investors. The dollar has rallied somewhat in recent days on less-dovish comments from various Fed officials.Although companies are still using the dollar as a reason for negative guidance, they're using that reason ""a little less than before,"" said Gregory Harrison, a senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.""It seems like other factors are a little more prominent now -- like the slowing global economy and the slowdown in China,"" he said.Uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election usually tends to make consumers pull back a bit in spending, he added, noting also that a sagging energy sector has been a much bigger drag on corporate earnings than the dollar.""That’s kind of expected to remain the case throughout the year -- at least until the fourth quarter,"" Harrison said.Meanwhile, central banks in Europe and Japan have gone to negative rates, but their recent moves unexpectedly lifted their currencies against the dollar. The Chinese yuan has erased its early 2016 losses vs. the greenback.And stocks have responded. General Electric saw its stock break out of a cup-with-handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17, a few weeks after Coca-Cola cleared a long consolidation to a record high.McDonald's briefly rose to 125 on the stock market today, hitting a record high and just passing a buy point of 124.93. But the below-average volume rise faded to a 0.3% gain at 124.19.Procter & Gamble (PG) stock is on the cusp of retaking a buy point at 83.10. Microsoft also is close to an entry point.Of course, the dollar isn't the only reason for their success.McDonald's decision to introduce an all-day breakfast boosted the fast-food chain in Q4 to its best U.S. quarterly sales in nearly four years after several years of struggling.Coca-Cola is in the middle of selling its U.S. manufacturing and distribution operations by next year. Instead, Coke plans to focus on its concentrate-making business, which is more profitable. Procter & Gamble is moving to focus on more-profitable core brands.GE is transitioning back to its industrial roots, with a strong digital footprint. The company is selling off much of its once-massive GE Capital financial services unit. General Electric is also moving its headquarters from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston, a tech hub located near several major universities that should supply the company with fresh, young tech talent.Despite the market turbulence over the past 12 months, Microsoft has been a top performer, gaining 26% from a year ago; near the end of last year, it eclipsed its dot-com boom peak. The company has finally made a push into mobile, and its Windows 10 operating system has won praise -- especially after the debacle of Windows 8.As for Nike, the athletic brand king had been closing in on a new high but closed down 3.8% Wednesday. Nike reported after Tuesday's market close that fiscal Q3 earnings rose 22% and that currency-neutral futures orders leapt 17%, both results better than expected. But Nike sales fell short, and the company gave cautious fiscal 2017 guidance.A weakening dollar should provide a better business climate for blue-chip giants going forward. But if the Fed turns hawkish and the greenback firms up, investor optimism about profits may fade, threatening Dow breakouts.Those with a more skeptical view say that the window was closing on the tough year-over-year currency comparisons anyway and that the real story was corporate earnings finally catching up to the sluggish revenue environment.""Revenue growth has been somewhat constrained for quite some time,"" said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial. ""That just reflects you can only get so far on the expense side of the ledger and support earnings growth that way. Cost cutting can only take you so far.""

855,MCD,"Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity Fund (GSXAX) is on a roll. Through March 31, the now-$558 million portfolio was the eighth-best performing U.S. diversified stock fund in the prior 12 months with a 7.58% return, according to Morningstar Inc. And it was No. 1 among small-cap funds. The S&P 500 advanced a more modest 1.35% in that period.At the quarter's end, the fund ranked in the top 1% and 2% of its small-cap growth peers over the past three and five years, respectively.The fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Thirty-two-year-old Ralph Bassett and 47-year-old Jason Kotik, two of the fund's four managers, spoke with IBD from their offices in Philadelphia about how they invest.IBD: Describe key aspects of your research process.Kotik: We have concentrated positions of between 40 and 60 names. We start with meeting a company's management team. Some investors look at screens. We look at a company to understand its business model, to look at its historical margins and returns, the balance sheet, things like that. We build a list of questions for that management team.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe bigger difference (between us and other funds) is that, while we interview company management like other investors do, we take a three-to-five-year or longer approach to understanding businesses because we'll hold them a long time.Our turnover is 25% to 35% a year, the lower end of the range for most funds. Our approach is really about understanding management's discipline around their capital investments, understanding them and building a relationship with them.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceSo, in the future when things don't go as planned -- and there's always a time when things don't go as planned, always -- we know how they will react, based on their answers to our questions.That's really the most important part of understanding a business.IBD: You recently wrote that volatility can be an opportunity. Was the recent market volatility a buying opportunity?Bassett: In the back half of last year and the first month of this year, I would say there was more opportunity than we'd seen in a long time.We did find some companies of higher quality but linked to less predominant macro themes (than the ones that hurt the energy sector). Things unfairly got discounted around macro contagion and dollar strength. We take a long view and assume dollar strength will subside over time. So we found some good opportunities.IBD: What are some examples?Kotik: We found opportunities to take advantage of names we own. One example in Q4, we were able to top up Canadian Western Bank. When you think of western Canada, you think of oil and gas, the oil sands market. So you'd think their loans portfolio would be filled with damaged goods. But less than 3% of their loans are to oil companies. They had traded down to tangible book and to book value. We took advantage of the marketplace selling off energy stocks and Canadian stocks and anything related to the Canadian dollar, and we added to our position.IBD: What example would you provide, Ralph?Bassett: We initiated a position in WisdomTree Investments (WETF) in February at the depths of the market. Their business is focused on ETFs and specifically those that are bespoke in nature -- bespoke in the sense that they are the only solely-ETF-focused company that is public. They also have been very innovative and quick to market with products compared to their peers. Now they have a wide product menu, and that can capture shifts in client asset allocation over time.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersWe had grappled with their valuation for a while. Frankly, we watched it tumbled from 30 to 24 to roughly 10 -- then it got more intriguing. A lot of concerns about their product concentration and competitive forces were, in our minds, diminished.Secondly, they had net cash on their balance sheet and intended to keep it that way, so we weren't worried about financial risk.We will be slow and patient. This is an example of our process patience.IBD: What else besides the housing rebound is driving Gibraltar Industries (ROCK)?Kotik: It sold off in the down market, and we added to it. It's rebounded more than 40% off its bottom.Gibraltar has started to make a strong transition in its business model to diversify its end markets.Its new CEO (Frank Heard) came from Illinois Tools Works (ITW) and brought ITW's tenets of focusing on the parts of the business that provide higher profits.It's a building products company. It sells things like mailboxes to Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Cos. (LOW). They have a large contract with the postal service for large-scale postal boxes. Apartment buildings need them because of ecommerce and the way consumers now buy products. Apartment managers can't figure out where to put all of this mail and packages. So Gibraltar came up with a plan for a new model.We own it because they use their capital extremely efficiently, and their cash flow is expanding. They're moving to a higher-margin mix of businesses.We look for company-specific drivers. Gibraltar benefits from the housing rebound. But we won't invest in companies that benefit just from volume and cyclical rebounds. We need a specific driver. For Gibraltar, it was about their transition to a more diversified business, driving higher quality profitability, rather than a focus on top-line growth.IBD: OK, what's the driver for Drew Industries (DW), a maker of components for recreational vehicles and manufactured homes?Kotik: The interest is that they've been adding dollar content on products to the RV and manufactured home industries. They've consistently improved their content dollars per vehicle.
"
856,MCD,"Their continued market share gains let them perform well even during tough times. But we're skeptical when everything is going right. We still hold it at an average weight, and we brought it down to capture profits.IBD: You own some stocks that sound like they're in non-sexy businesses. What's their appeal? What's the special catalyst? Start with RBC Bearings (ROLL), please.Bassett: They make highly specialized ball bearings, which range from pen-cap size to several feet. Those big ones go into huge industrial products and reactors.They focus on specialty areas where the ball bearings need to be designed into the product. That reduces competition, so they capture margin along the way. Their business is high-value-added, taking share in programs. They've thought about acquisitions but are being careful. Years down the road, there could be pressure on their aerospace business. We're mindful of the potential cyclicality.IBD: What about Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), an egg distributor?Bassett: They are slowly shifting away from the egg commodity part of their business. About one-quarter of their business is providing specialties like liquid eggs to McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN).They're increasing their organic eggs business. And a lot of customers want cage-free eggs. Few companies can afford to provide that. It takes capital for land and structures for organic eggs and cage-free eggs.So Cal-Maine not only picks up business, it consolidates as smaller farmers are forced out.IBD: What's the special driver for MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange?Bassett: Previously, a lot trades went through large investment banks with huge inventory. But MarketAxess can do it cheaper in smaller quantities, so if someone wants to sell several bonds rather than huge round lots, MarketAxess offers cheaper transaction costs than larger brokerages.And they focus on a relative niche market: corporate credit, which is not as huge a market as the Treasury market that large investment banks focus on.But Bloomberg has also tapped into this market, and it's hard for MarketAxess to gain share vs. Bloomberg.IBD: What's the catalyst for Prestige Brands (PBH), which markets health care and house-cleaning products?Bassett: By and large, you've heard of their products: Comet, Luden's cough drops, Monistat. When they acquire a brand, they invest in it so they can maintain or gain share, then they harvest the added cash flow.They don't manufacture. They do more branding, marketing, distribution. They are outsource manufacturers.Look at Procter & Gamble (PG), which is shrinking its portfolio of products and is refocusing. Maybe Prestige can take advantage.IBD: How important are competitive moats for companies?Kotik: Over the long term, in this marketplace, success is not about high momentum. People care about valuation, and they should. This will differentiate us.

858,MCD,"They're two fast-food staples with two different stock patterns. McDonald's (MCD), benefiting from its new All Day Breakfast service, was close to a possible breakout from a cup base. Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) is trying to claw its way out of a five-month consolidation but ended the week strong.""Given the 'fast money' playing MCD currently, we understand why maybe SBUX has underperformed,"" Jefferies said in a research note last week. But the investment firm noted that the valuation gap -- based on forward PE multiples -- between the two stocks is relatively small compared to recent years. Either way, here's a look at their charts.McDonald's, which has a buy point of 124.93, closed up 0.75% at 124.08 on Friday. The stock began its base in February. Shares dipped and wrapped around their key 50-day line through March 8 in mostly lower-than-average volume. They began climbing on March 9.Breakouts with higher-than-average volume are ideal. The base is second-stage. The earlier the stage, the likelier the stock is to still have something in the tank for future gains.Outside technicals, things look bright for the company's current quarter. A year prior, the stock suffered amid concerns that the fast-food giant wasn't adapting to a restaurant landscape that seemed to focus on healthy and fast-casual.But the fried-food behemoth seems to have eased those concerns by doubling down on what it already does, with its all-day breakfast service, launched last year, and value options helping push results higher. And investors, for now, have soured on fast-casual as more restaurants tried to cash in on the trend and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) tries to pick up the pieces following food-borne illness scares.""We believe business materially improved in Feb. as the company began re-emphasizing All Day Breakfast, weather was more favorable across the U.S., and the McPick campaign shifted to a '2 for $5' price point, which better combatted the other value-based meal platforms in the QSR (quick-service restaurant) space,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note this week.""We also think that this momentum has continued into March, and, were it to continue throughout the month, we believe the quarter’s results could prove our estimates conservative,"" he added.McDonald's stock rose from a flat base in October, and strong quarterly results have driven its 32% ascent since 2015.Stock action for Starbucks, the chain that has given Americans a reason to drink coffee at any time of the day, hasn’t been as healthy. The stock’s 50-day line has come close to slicing through its 200-day line, a bearish sign.Shares have closed up five out of the last six sessions and rose 0.25% at 59.70 on Friday in heavy volume, an encouraging sign after prior gains in weak volume. But they have a way to go before clearing the Oct. 30 record high of 64.""We suspect high expectations and strong performance in 2015 ... has not been a good recipe so far in ’16,"" Jefferies said in a research note last week.The company’s investments could more than double this year, following additional spending on higher wages in Q1, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a note last week.""This reinvestment, together with ongoing technology initiatives, delivery testing and FX drag ($0.05/share or 3pp headwind), may limit FY16 EPS growth to 18-20%,"" Palmer said. He added: ""However, we believe these investment areas are protecting the brand from the risks that befall many larger brands as Starbucks captures scale advantages through technology.""Mobile payments, one of those technology initiatives, accounted for 21% of orders last quarter, RBC said, and may have gained ""to the mid-20% range in the current quarter.""

"
869,MCD,"What do Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) have in common with the fertilizer giant Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (POT)?The short answer: At various points in history, all three met the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investment method.Of these seven characteristics of winning stocks, laid out by IBD founder William J. O’Neil, the N can be one of the more difficult to nail down. It stands for ""new"" and encompasses a lot of different aspects of a company. It's more than simply checking to see if a company can surpass purely quantitative thresholds.The N can stand for new products and services, such as Apple's launch of the iPod in Apple’s 2002 fiscal year. Sales of iPods accounted for 2.5% of revenue that year compared to the 79% of sales coming from Apple's Macintosh products. By 2006, Macintosh products shrank to 38.2% of revenue. The iPod? It shot up to 39.7%.That shift in revenue prompted then-CEO Steve Jobs to drop “computer” from the Apple Computer name in 2007, coinciding with the announcement of the new Apple TV and iPhone. The earnings growth fueled by these new products contributed to a move of over 7,000% from 2004 to 2015.When Alphabet made its debut as Google on August 19, 2004, it exhibited another aspect of the N: It was a new issue.Initial public offerings within the past eight to 15 years tend to be a hot spot of growth for stock market leaders. When Google went public, it already had an incredible record of profit and sales growth. They not only had a winning search engine, but also knew how to monetize it.McDonald's (MCD) had its IPO on April 21, 1965, launching a phenomenal run. But with over 36,000 locations in 100 countries in 2015, what could McDonalds offer now that is new?McDonald's has new top management, which is often a catalyst for stock moves. Steve Easterbrook became CEO in March 2015, and since taking over, he has been instituting changes. All-day breakfast, more customization with burgers and healthier choices all led to a 20% move for the company since Easterbrook took over. Earnings have turned around from four consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year declines (-28%, -19%, -17% and -10%) to two consecutive quarters of double-digit gains.Which finally brings us to fertilizer companies like Potash. What could they offer that was new?In 2006, fertilizers saw a new condition in their industry. The huge populations of China, India and other emerging market economies were seeing a rising middle class and a change to a higher-protein diet rather than one dominated by starch. Significantly more crop production is required to feed the animals that are part of a higher animal protein-based diet. At the same time, rising oil prices were fueling greater demand for biofuels like ethanol, which in turn, also required more crops.By 2007, corn plantings surged to their highest level in 60 years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Corn, wheat and soy were selling at all-time highs, spurring farmers to try to increase production. But with only half the farm land available compared to the 1950s, production increases became heavily reliant on -- you guessed it, fertilizers. With limited supplies of potash, nitrogen and phosphate and high barriers to entry for mining costs, Potash cashed in on the limited supply and rising demand. The Canadian firm enjoyed a nearly 600% increase in its stock price from 2006 through 2008.The final aspect of N has to do with technical action. Look for stocks that are trading at or near new highs. This ensures you are looking at stocks that are truly in favor by large institutional investors. Leading stocks tend to trend, so the ones making new highs tend to go higher. IBD's New High list (today on page B1) will keep you on top of the major sectors of stocks producing new highs.

The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
886,MCD,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......
"
887,MCD,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.
"
888,MCD,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
889,MCD,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....
"
890,MCD,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......
"
891,MCD,"More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....
"
892,MCD,"European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing..... Will they increase their current 1 tril Euro QE program? My guess is - not yet......FTSE flat, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.37%, EUROSTOXX + 0.33%, SPAIN +0.36% and ITALY flat.
"
893,MCD,"US futures are up 7 pts at 2015...I suspect that with oil a bit higher and the dollar flat - as long as we get better earnings the market will hold steady here....Resistance still holds at 2035.....with short term support right here at 2015.....if that does not hold - then look for 1980 to be the next real support level.

Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting.....

"
924,MCD,"Ok...so what happened last night? All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....
"
925,MCD,"At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.
"
926,MCD,"Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:
"
927,MCD,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""
"
928,MCD,"James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:
"
929,MCD,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
930,MCD,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
931,MCD,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.
"
932,MCD,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.
"
933,MCD,"France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.
"
934,MCD,"This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.
"
935,MCD,"As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.
"
936,MCD,"NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.
"
937,MCD,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
938,MCD,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
939,MCD,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....

All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?Take good careKpYou can get better.

951,MCD,"Just one among a panel of 42 eminent, politically diverse economists surveyed by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business thinks that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020 will yield measurable gains in GDP.
"
952,MCD,"That's pretty amazing considering that those pushing minimum wage increases almost always assert that a higher wage floor will provide an economic boost.
"
953,MCD,"They argue that budget-stretched lower earners getting a raise are very likely to spend virtually all of their additional earnings. That would, in theory, more than offset the effect of price increases or thinner profit margins for business owners, who save a significant slice of their earnings.
"
954,MCD,"So why are economists so pessimistic — or rather, realistic — about net economic gains from raising the wage to $15? Simple: Just 24% disagree that low-wage employment ""will be substantially lower"" under a $15 wage than under the status quo. And at least some of those who disagreed do anticipate job losses.
"
955,MCD,"For example, Yale University economics professor William Nordhaus disagreed that employment would be substantially lower, but said he expects it to be down 1% to 2%. Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics and management professor Richard Schmalensee said employment would ""probably"" be lower but it's ""not clear at all"" if it'll be substantially lower.""
"
956,MCD,"MIT's David Autor: ""I don't think the evidence supports the bold prediction that employment will be substantially lower. Not impossible, but no strong evidence.""
"
957,MCD,"Why is there no strong evidence? As 2007 Nobel Prize winner Eric Maskin wisely explained, ""The total increase (to $15) is so big that I'm not sure previous studies tell us very much.""
"
958,MCD,"Still, the survey did seem to provide evidence that those pushing for a big increase in the minimum wage have tilted the debate in their direction.
"
959,MCD,"Back in 2013, when the Booth School asked their panel (comprising many of the same economists) whether a $9 federal minimum wage would make it ""noticeably harder"" for low-skilled workers to find jobs, 34% said yes. In the latest survey, just 26% said that a $15 wage would trigger a substantial drop in low-wage employment. While another 38% were uncertain, the economics profession seems to be getting more comfortable with the idea of a big minimum-wage hike, even as labor groups keep moving the target higher.
"
960,MCD,"A tighter labor market over the past two years may be lifting the market-clearing rate for low-wage jobs. Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and McDonald's (MCD) are among those announcing big wage hikes over the past year.
"
961,MCD,"In February 2014, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that a hike in the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would cost about a half-million jobs. : While the economy would get a fleeting lift from the wage hike, the longer-term effect would be to reduce economic output, CBO said. That earned a sharp rebuke from the White House, which dissed the CBO's estimates as ""not reflective of a consensus of the economics profession.""
"
962,MCD,"Yet one of the overlooked keys to the CBO's conclusion and to the whole minimum-wage debate was buried in a footnote: ObamaCare's employer mandate would magnify the negative impact of the minimum-wage hike.
"
963,MCD,"That additional cost ""further boosts the likelihood that employers' savings from reducing the size of their workforces would exceed their adjustment costs,"" such as the cost of investing in labor-saving technology.
"
964,MCD,"How much is that additional cost? There are a few different ways of calculating it, but here's one: The employer mandate penalty will be $2,160 per full-time worker in 2016. That after-tax penalty is equivalent to $3,547 in tax-deductible wages. For a full-time worker, the mandate can add $1.71 an hour to whatever minimum wage is on the table.

Meanwhile, food and labor costs are rising.Reviving growth and improving profitability will be tough, given diners' evolving tastes.Consumers are increasingly demanding healthier (or at least higher-quality) food. More expensive fast casual chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA), as well as upstart upscale burger chains such as Shake Shack (SHAK), have been cutting into the market share of traditional fast-food joints.$8 Menu UnlikelyMcDonald's, which jettisoned its popular Dollar Menu as franchisees complained of rising beef costs, has tried to move upscale with better quality meat such as an Angus burger.But it's unclear whether customers are willing to pay $8 for a McDonald's burger.""They're really struggling with trying to balance good quality with good prices,"" said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic, a research firm. ""It really is to some extent disruptive compared to the history of McDonald's, which has been fast food that's affordable and consistent.""Smaller burger chains such as Wendy's (WEN) and Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King have gone back to basics, offering burgers, fries and chicken nuggets instead of fancier fare. Wendy's North American same-store sales rose 3.2% in Q1 and 2.4% in Q2. Burger King's comps grew 4.6% in Q1 and 6.7% in Q2.Competition At DawnYum Brands (YUM) unit Taco Bell's new breakfast menu last year has upped the ante. Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN) and Starbucks (SBUX) also have emphasized breakfast, providing more choices for consumers weaned on Egg McMuffins.With competition fierce and barriers to moving upscale, fast-food chains have little scope to offset big hikes in the minimum wage, to as high as $15 per hour within a few years in Los Angeles, Seattle and some other big cities.""There are some people out there who naively say that these wages can simply be passed along in terms of price increases,"" said Wendy's CEO Emil Brolick said during the company's Q2 conference call. ""I don't think that the average franchisee believes that.""Raising the average fast-food wage — not the minimum — would require fast-food chains to hike prices by 11% or cut menu portions by 36%, according to an IBD analysis of data from a recent Purdue University study.While Chipotle has successfully hiked prices on its affluent clientele in San Francisco, neither choice is appetizing for fast-food chains or their customers.Labor costs account for roughly one-third of McDonald's expenses. But it has pledged to raise its hourly wages to one dollar above the local minimum wage at its company-owned stores.Kiosks Are No PanaceaSelf-serve kiosks like those at some McDonald's in the U.S., France and Australia should curb ordering mistakes — and may boost average tickets as some customers order, say, extra cheese without the silent judgment of others in line, analysts say.Wendy's top executives said that kiosks will likely replace employees as wage costs swell.Still, tech has limits. Minimum wage hikes may tilt the scales, but kiosks and computers are costly to install and maintain.McDonald's gets 70% of its sales from drive-through, which doesn't easily lend itself to touchscreens, according to Jennifer Bartashus, an intelligence analyst at Bloomberg.""Automation has potential to reduce employees marginally,"" she said. ""Generally you don't see all the registers open anyway.""Despite challenges in the fast food industry, McDonald's alone still saw $6.5 billion in Q2 sales.""When we look at the size of the market,"" Tristano said, ""it's easy to predict it's not going away.""Yet changing consumer tastes could mean that fast food's glory days are a thing of the past.""You're seeing a genuine shift happening where a chunk of people are moving away from fast food,"" Bartashus said, ""and it may become a permanent migration.""

"
1083,MCD,"If analysts are right, Buffalo Wild Wings will serve up results similar to Q1's.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q2 earnings to rise 2% vs. a year earlier to $1.27 a share. That would be the same growth rate that it saw in Q1 as higher chicken wing costs continued to hurt it.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Lynne Collier estimates that Buffalo Wild Wings' chicken wing costs were up over 40% in Q2.Analysts expect Q2 revenue to rise 17.45% to $429.87 million — slightly less than the 20% gain it saw in the prior quarter.However, analysts see earnings growth accelerating to 24% in Q3 and 49% in Q4.""Broadly, as far as earnings per share expectations for the second quarter, we and the Street are looking for relatively flat numbers from last year,"" Wunderlich Securities analyst Bob Derrington told IBD. ""(Q2 was) affected by tough sales comparisons and higher wing costs. However, we believe as we go deeper into the year and as the company completes the acquisition of 41 franchise restaurants, which we expect to be accretive to fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings, and given what we view as a relatively attractive valuation for Buffalo Wild Wings, we continue to rate the stock as buy.""Collier says that wing costs ""remain high,"" but she says that they're expected to decline year-over-year by Q4 of this year.Buffalo Wild Wings is a part of IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 87 out of a possible 99. The group also includes Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which has a Composite Rating of 96, and Starbucks (SBUX), which leads the group with a Composite Rating of 99.McDonald's (MCD) is the group's largest company by market cap.Starbucks reported frothy Q3 results Thursday afternoon.

1134,MCD,"Starbucks wouldn't comment on future plans for its stars currency or the possibility of licensing its technology beyond official statements.Starbucks sees its already-massive loyalty program expanding beyond its chain of ubiquitous coffee houses, as the green mermaid lures new customers with its own non-green currency.Its existing program, My Starbucks Rewards, allows customers to earn ""stars"" when they make purchases at Starbucks (SBUX), which can be redeemed for free food and drink at the coffee shop.Now Spotify, the New York Times (NYT) and Lyft have recently signed on to become Starbucks' first three ""expanded loyalty"" partners, allowing current rewards members to earn stars — not just from buying a latte but from making non-Starbucks purchases, like a Lyft ride.Partners also can buy Starbucks stars and use them to reward their own customers. The uninitiated must then become My Starbucks Rewards members to redeem those stars.The broader reach could be just the beginning of Starbucks' stars appearing in a growing array of daily transactions, involving companies that have nothing to do with coffee.Last week, CEO Howard Schultz hinted at his grand plan in a post-earnings call for a ""Starbucks Star-centric digital and loyalty ecosystem,"" intending to leverage the brand ""to create the foundation of a much broader external mobile digital and loyalty platform, one that would extend to purchases and experiences outside of the four walls of the Starbucks store.""Starbucks' new system is akin to American Express' (AXP) Plenti, a multicompany rewards program that allows consumers to, say, earn points for filling up their cars at an Exxon Mobile (XOM) gas station that can then be spent at a Macy's (M) store.But Schultz has made sure that all roads return to Starbucks and its loyalty program.Identifying More Partners""(W)e are offering a single currency, and that currency has to come back to Starbucks,"" he said. ""And we know that the value of a Starbucks store and the equity of our brand is very, very relevant to this kind of proposition.""He added that the company is examining customers' spending habits in order to identify more potential partners.Starbucks is also in the process of rolling out its order-ahead service, Mobile Order & Pay, nationwide. That too, can only be accessed through My Starbucks Rewards, which now has 10.4 million active members, up 28% from last year.An increasing number of loyalty members are learning to trust the coffee shop chain with regular currency as well — including precious credit card information.Mobile payments now account for 20% of all Starbucks in-store U.S. transactions, more than twice that of two years ago.

The Retail-Restaurants group is ranked an outstanding 12th on IBD's list of 197 industries.Cracker Barrel (CBRL), which doesn't even make the Small Cap Leaders menu, late last month reported outstanding earnings and sales growth that topped views, helped by lower gas prices that drove more diners to its highway locations.Wunderlich restaurant analyst Bob Derrington said in a recent report that with plunging fuel prices consumers are more inclined to treat themselves to a meal at their favorite restaurant.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) is No. 4 on the Small Cap Leaders list. Derrington raised his rating on the casual restaurant chain late last month. Citing improving sales and profit trends he raised his Q4 earnings-per-share estimate to $1.12 from $1.03 and reiterated a buy rating.The chain known for its buffalo wings and sports theme has been a steady performer, climbing 138% in the last two years.It formed a deep cup-with-handle base from late July to late November.

It was Nike's biggest quarterly revenue gain since the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Nike has logged double-digit revenue gains the past three quarters.Revenue climbed 25% in Western Europe, 12% in North America and 20% in greater China.Strong performance came from Nike's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through its website. Revenue increased 22%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and significantly higher Nike.com revenue.""In this current macro environment and given the size of the company, for Nike to be able to grow this quarter's revenue 15% with the expectation of 20% EPS growth for the full year, this early in the fiscal year, is nothing short of an outstanding performance, we think,"" wrote Nomura analyst Bob Drbul in a note following the results.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to climb 21% to $3.60 a share, roughly double the 10% gain it saw the prior year. They see a 15% gain in fiscal 2016 and a 14% rise in 2017.Nike Stock JumpsNike shares hit an all-time high on Friday. They have surged 17% since the company reported first-quarter results on Sept. 25, and more than 30% from a February low.""The reason Nike's stock is doing so well is their products are some of the only ones selling with strength globally,"" Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, told IBD. ""So they are not having to cut prices for their products.""Adds Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Svezia: ""They've executed pretty well. To some investors who need to look at big consumer discretionary names, Nike is doing well in the face of fiscal and global economic challenges vs. its consumer discretionary peers like McDonald's (MCD) and Coke (KO).""Basketball's Bank ShotThe basketball shoe category was among Nike's fastest growers and strongest performers in the quarter, with double-digit sales gains in North America.""Nike has always dominated the basketball business,"" said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a weekly newsletter. ""Clearly we're in a big basketball up-cycle (as) fashion. Nike has been through these up-cycles in basketball before and never has been able to sustain the up-cycle the way it has this one.""In this up-cycle, he adds, Nike's product development is much ""broader and deeper"" than it was before in terms of materials, colors and technology used in designing the shoes, and they're keeping the products new and fresh.He cites the point that Nike has continued to broaden the offerings in its Air Jordan franchise, which the company has ""kept bigger than ever, and it's been years since Michael Jordan played his last game.""Among the technologies he refers to is Flyknit, a special yarn and computer-controlled weaving method that lets footwear be ""engineered to provide a more precise fit for the specific needs of the foot,"" according to RunningShoesGuru.com.Nike's popular Flyknit athletic shoes are known for comfortable woven uppers that still provide support and come in bright colors and patterns.A Friend In The TrendNike is also benefiting from how athleticwear has become a go-to wardrobe for women and men to sport in most any casual setting. Power brand Under Armour (UA) is also cashing in on this trend.""Nike owns this business in theory,"" said analyst Svezia. ""It's the $30 billion gorilla in the market. They have significant market share and scale and have their weight behind them in terms of growing this business. They should do better than anyone else.""Drbul is upbeat about Nike's recent performance and prospects.""Overall, we think Nike has separated itself from the competition at the greatest level in the history of the company,"" he said. ""They are the creative machine and the innovation they have is second to none. They're hitting on all cylinders with growth in footwear, in apparel and in equipment. There's really very little weakness in its business.""In a report, Drbul said he was ""encouraged"" by Nike's ""robust"" direct-to-consumer performance in the first quarter, which was driven by a 70% increase in e-commerce and comp growth of 15%.He also noted that the company's efforts to ""reset the Chinese market are also clearly paying off.""He expects the Greater China region to grow at a low-mid teens rate for the full year.Sozzi expects Nike to be the ""winner"" in holiday season sales along with Under Armour and the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and Apple iPhone 6 Plus smartphones.Nike competes with sports apparel outfits such as Under Armour and yoga-inspired clothing company Lululemon (LULU). It's part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Retail Manufacturing group, which also includes highly-rated Skechers USA (SKX).

"
1248,MCD,"CEO Tim Cook spotlighted Apple's first foray into payments — a mobile app called Apple Pay — during the company's Sept. 9 iPhone 6 rollout.The tap-to-pay technology lets iPhone and Apple Watch users make purchases by tapping the devices at check-out registers in more than 20,000 participating stores. They include retail chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Macy's (M) and Staples (SPLS).Apple (AAPL) also got major credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP) to join its mobile payments network, though terms aren't known.Apple Pay is a sophisticated digital wallet that links consumers and merchants directly with credit-card companies and their supporting banks.Mercator Advisory Group described how Apple Pay works in the report ""A Sleeping Giant Awakes: How Apple Pay Works and What It Means for Payments.""Users of the Apple iPhone and Watch can use the credit cards that they have on file in their iTunes accounts and add them to the Passbook app on their devices to activate Apple Pay.Apple Pay can then be used at any participating store.No special acquiring network like PayPal is required, since the payment option runs over the existing payments network that includes credit-card companies and banks, as long as the merchant accepts payments through wireless near-field communication (NFC) technology set up at the merchant's checkout stands.Every iTunes user has given Apple a primary account number (PAN) for each iTunes purchase. Apple has these PANs on file.When users ask Apple to activate Apple Pay, Apple communicates the request to the bank that owns the users' credit cards.If the bank approves the request, the user's PAN is sent to the appropriate network (AmEx, MasterCard or Visa), and the network generates a digital ""token"" to represent the PAN.The network then works with Apple to insert the token into the ""Secure Element"" of the NFC chip on the user's iPhone or iWatch.The iPhone or Watch is then primed to make purchases at any merchant location that has a point-of-sale (POS) terminal that accepts NFC-enabled devices.Users bring their Apple device to the store and take their items to the checkout aisle.They tap or wave the device at the store's POS register using Apple's Touch ID technology feature.The token is transmitted wirelessly to the register. The register forwards the token and other purchase data from the merchant to the appropriate network run by the credit-card/payment provider and its issuing bank.The network receives the data, which includes the token; looks up the PAN with which the token is associated; and inserts the PAN into the authorization request, which is sent to the credit-card issuer.The issuer receives the authorization request and approves or denies the transaction.When an Apple customer walks into a store to make a purchase, the only information that his or her iPhone communicates to the merchant is the traditional card payment information, such as the customer's name. There is only the token where the card account number and other sensitive information used to be.While Apple might be notified that the customer's device has been activated to make a purchase, Apple doesn't see the retailer's name, the transaction amount or any other sales detail directly.But Mercator says that it is possible that some information could be derived from other iPhone sensors that track such data as location, date or time.

1251,MCD,"Restaurant industry sales rebounded in August from the weak showing of the past several months, a sign that better days could be ahead for the nation's eateries, according to a report from Wunderlich Securities analyst Robert Derrington.

The sports bar and eatery operator holds an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of a highest-possible 99. Another of Derrington's several picks is Jack In The Box (JACK), which gets an IBD Composite Rating of 86.

"
1254,MCD,"Late Tuesday, two key industry sales indexes were released, showing that August sales trends improved ""considerably"" from the very weak trend of the past several months, Derrington noted.
"
1255,MCD,"""While both the Knapp Track Casual Dining Index and Black Box Intelligence Sales indices have been especially volatile in recent months, the August improvement potentially could mark a period of improving industry sales possibly through next summer as the industry laps especially weak trends from last year,"" Derrington wrote. ""With the modestly improving macro economic backdrop, including improvements in consumer confidence and sentiment, these improved August industry trends could potentially usher in a period of improving industry SSS (same-store-sales) through summer 2015.""
"
1256,MCD,"Casual-dining restaurant operators Red Robin (RRGB) and Brinker International (EAT) are also among Derrington's favorite picks — he rates each a buy.
"
1257,MCD,"The Black Box Intelligence (BBI) overall Industry Index improved significantly for August, with same-store sales for the month's index up 2.1%, with traffic down 0.5%. Derrington says this was the strongest BBI industry same-store sales performance since February 2012. On a two-year basis, August same-store sales improved 230 basis point to +1.9% vs. the July two-year trend of -0.4%.
"
1258,MCD,"Derrington also points out: ""The BBI index, which collects a broader cross-section of industry sales data from fast-food, fast-casual, and casual dining restaurant companies, also faces relatively easy comparisons through June 2015, lapping relatively flat nominal SSS through next summer,"" Derrington said.
"
1259,MCD,"The improved industry trends follow ""very weak and volatile"" same-store-sales trends of both June and July, Derrington noted. He says the two months were believed to have been impacted by factors such as weak consumer spending, delayed school dismissals in June, and the much wetter and cooler weather in both June and July vs. last year's unusually hot summer.
"
1260,MCD,"""Aided by August's recent substantial improvement in consumer confidence, these better August industry SSS trends could mark a period of improving industry sales through next summer,"" he added.

1261,MCD,"On the casual dining front, which includes operators like Buffalo Wild Wings and Brinker, the Knapp Track (KT) Casual Dining (CD) index reported its first month of positive same-store sales since May 2013. August nominal same-store sales were up 0.5% and traffic was down 2.0%.

1263,MCD,"The improved industry showing in August came despite weakness from the industry's biggest player, McDonald's. On Tuesday, it reported its weakest monthly same-store sales results since March 2013, Derrington says. The disappointing showing sent McDonald's shares sliding Tuesday. The company's August same-store sales slipped 3.7% vs. a year earlier. U.S. same-store sales were down 2.8%.Restaurant industry sales rebounded in August from the weak showing of the past several months, a sign that better days could be ahead for the nation's eateries, according to a report from Wunderlich Securities analyst Robert Derrington.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) is among Derrington's favorite restaurant picks — he rates it a buy. The sports bar and eatery operator holds an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of a highest-possible 99. Another of Derrington's several picks is Jack In The Box (JACK), which gets an IBD Composite Rating of 86.IBD Leaderboard and IBD 50 stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has the highest Composite Rating of IBD's Retail-Restaurants group with a 98. The largest names in the group by market cap are McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX), followed by Yum Brands (YUM) and Chipotle.Late Tuesday, two key industry sales indexes were released, showing that August sales trends improved ""considerably"" from the very weak trend of the past several months, Derrington noted.""While both the Knapp Track Casual Dining Index and Black Box Intelligence Sales indices have been especially volatile in recent months, the August improvement potentially could mark a period of improving industry sales possibly through next summer as the industry laps especially weak trends from last year,"" Derrington wrote. ""With the modestly improving macro economic backdrop, including improvements in consumer confidence and sentiment, these improved August industry trends could potentially usher in a period of improving industry SSS (same-store-sales) through summer 2015.""Casual-dining restaurant operators Red Robin (RRGB) and Brinker International (EAT) are also among Derrington's favorite picks — he rates each a buy.The Black Box Intelligence (BBI) overall Industry Index improved significantly for August, with same-store sales for the month's index up 2.1%, with traffic down 0.5%. Derrington says this was the strongest BBI industry same-store sales performance since February 2012. On a two-year basis, August same-store sales improved 230 basis point to +1.9% vs. the July two-year trend of -0.4%.Derrington also points out: ""The BBI index, which collects a broader cross-section of industry sales data from fast-food, fast-casual, and casual dining restaurant companies, also faces relatively easy comparisons through June 2015, lapping relatively flat nominal SSS through next summer,"" Derrington said.The improved industry trends follow ""very weak and volatile"" same-store-sales trends of both June and July, Derrington noted. He says the two months were believed to have been impacted by factors such as weak consumer spending, delayed school dismissals in June, and the much wetter and cooler weather in both June and July vs. last year's unusually hot summer.""Aided by August's recent substantial improvement in consumer confidence, these better August industry SSS trends could mark a period of improving industry sales through next summer,"" he added.On the casual dining front, which includes operators like Buffalo Wild Wings and Brinker, the Knapp Track (KT) Casual Dining (CD) index reported its first month of positive same-store sales since May 2013.

1332,MCD,"The world's largest restaurant chain, McDonald's (MCD), is close to deciding what to do with its real estate holdings, amid calls for a spinoff of those assets into a real estate investment trust.Board member Miles White, who is chairman and CEO of diversified medical products maker Abbott Laboratories (ABT), told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that the fast-food giant has done a lot of due diligence but hasn't yet made a final decision.McDonald's shares changed little in extended-hours trading Thursday after rising 0.8% in the regular session on the stock market today.As customers have shifted away from McDonald's to fast-casual chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), some investors and analysts have pushed for a REIT.In fact, McDonald's has been mulling taking action on its real estate as part of a broad restructuring undertaken by new CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took the reins in March.In May, Easterbrook said that McDonald's would examine ""all opportunities"" and might look at spinning off real estate assets or creating a REIT structure.Other companies have faced similar calls to spin off their real estate. MGM Resorts International (MGM) has been under pressure from shareholder Land and Buildings Investment to sell real estate.Sears (SHLD) spun off its property into Seritage Growth Properties (SRG). And several hedge funds asked Macy's (M) to consider options for its real estate.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

1335,MCD,"What a week to go on vacation! The weather was great up on the Cape - and the ocean was the perfect temperature - but that did not stop the markets from convulsing for another week. By the end of last week - the markets suffered another loss - Friday saw the indices give back 1.5+% on the back of that 'stellar NFP report' - taking the S&P to 1921 and the Dow to 16,102…as traders and investors try to make sense out of the recent beating. Despite the volatile action in stocks last week, the selling has not taken prices anywhere near the recent sell-off lows of 1865 and the fact that the selling has not been nearly as bad in the microcap sector - suggests that traders and some investors are using the 'blue chips' as a source of cash, pressuring large cap asset managers to liquidate portions of some positions as the nervousness increases. For the week - the Dow tumbled 3.2%, the S&P was down by 3.4% and the Nasdaq lost 3%.
"
1336,MCD,"The selling was the same around the globe with Asian and European markets all under pressure. Mounting concerns over a weaker China, and an indecisive FED, weak energy prices, slowing global growth, weaker Europe, imploding emerging markets, a US gov't bond market under assault (as China sold nearly $100 bil in reserves - treasuries - as they deal with a 'destabilized Yuan and a slowing economy) add in that massive human tragedy out of the Middle East and you can see why global investors are concerned.
"
1337,MCD,"So why all the fuss? Most of this is not new news - China? The Fed? Weaker Oil?, Emerging Markets? We have been talking about these issues for months now and what it all may mean for markets....and yet the markets continued to push higher with the Dow making a new high in May, the S&P and Nasdaq making their new highs in July and the Russell ringing the bell in June. So what gives?
"
1338,MCD,"Many now point to the collapse in China's stock market which began in June - after an incredible 122% increase in 12 months....or a 53% increase ytd.... China's currency devaluation only exacerbated the concerns....in fact we can point to that event as the catalyst that lit the flame to ignite the fire and by most accounts many would agree.
"
1339,MCD,"We have heard all this talk about a slowing China - Current projections still have that economy growing at 7.3% this year or 2x that of the US. Could it be more that analysts and companies had become a bit too bullish on China? Did we put all our eggs in one basket? Was it the herd mentality that got us into trouble again? I'm just sayin.....
"
1340,MCD,"Concern over China's market action has dominated the news wires for weeks now....as their market has given back and then some all of their ytd gains.... The gov't - shell shocked - tried in vain to 'control' the action only adding to the angst....Threatening short sellers with a public caning, banning some investors from liquidating positions, imposing new rules on the fly, all while trying to convey a sense of normalcy....How'd that work out? Remember - this is an economy run by a communist gov't, an economy in transition, it is an 'emerging economy'. The imploding stock market - sending the message that they were in trouble - has caused a global rout as investors run for cover and every bear out there is calling for a massive global reset (again) - Think 2007/2010.

1341,MCD,"But we don't need to worry - because this weekend at the G20 summit in Turkey - PBoC (Peoples Bank of China) Governor Zhou Xiaochuan told the members that ""China's stock market has almost completed its correction""

"
1343,MCD,"Which brings us to our own issues..... If our gov't actually understood how to create a vibrant economy that benefits everyone they would employ FISCAL POLICY initiatives to complement the massive MONETARY POLICY initiatives to actually help our economy create long term, well-paying jobs which in turn will help our country and economy get back on track. But case in point - they don't have a clue - Congress and the current administration have done zero to create any real positive economic change. We've got a massive multi trillion deficit, higher taxes, burgeoning entitlement programs and a FED that is caught between a rock and a hard place because legislators have failed them and us. Maybe The Donald IS onto something!

1345,MCD,"Friday's NFP report could be used to argue either way....right? Some say it was downright disappointing - missing the projection by 47k - but once you add in the 'revisions' from June and July - then it's a wash……and unemployment - oh right that managed to move lower - 5.1% - as well - putting the country at 'full employment'- Even the analysts were surprised!

And speaking of MCD's - did you see their answer to the increase in the minimum wage? They are now installing ATM-like machines - that allow the customer to place their orders directly - no human interaction - and just go to the window and pick it up - eliminating even more jobs.... Pretty soon - there won't be a human being working in the joint...... I'm just sayin….think about what that does to their BOTTOM line!
"
1347,MCD,"And Inflation? Not happening...and the culprit? Weaker energy prices! Come on! In fact - at some point - weak oil has to be viewed as a boon to the economies - I mean you can't argue that expensive oil is bad for the economy AND cheap oil is bad for the economy - One of those arguments has to be wrong...... Cheap energy should cause everything to be cheaper - transportation is cheaper so that means that the goods that they move around should be less expensive, Airlines should feel the benefits of cheaper oil, Transportation companies should benefit, consumers should be getting a break at the pump, at the grocery store, and at the clothing store - businesses are getting a break on energy costs, homeowners are getting a break on heating costs etc….so when is cheaper oil viewed as a positive? Just think - the minute it starts to trade higher - then every analyst will tell us how higher prices are negatively affecting the economy!

1348,MCD,"So what about rates? Is September a Yay or Nay? Futures traders now have it at a 28% chance of a rate hike in September and are now betting on a November rate hike....and the coming eco reports over the next two weeks will only keep the volatility alive. There are also sure to be a number of speeches and articles by major Fed players as they test the market for investor angst....- so listen closely - Watch what they do vs. what they say.

1349,MCD,"Overnight Asian stocks moved in opposite directions.....China rallies 2.9% ( after being off another 1.5% in early trading) right after the gov't announced an $11 bil railway project.....this after their Aug trade data continues to paint a picture of a slowing economy - exports fell by 5.5% while imports plunged by 13.8%. Japan was down 2.4% giving back all of this year's gains - after they revealed that revised GDP was not as bad as previously thought! That market is now slightly negative on the year, Hong Kong +3.2% and ASX +1.6%.

1350,MCD,"In Europe - markets are all higher....seemingly able to ignore the latest weak Chinese data points.....M&A in the insurance sector is fueling today's advance in Euro markets. FTSE +1.9%, CAC 40 + 2.2%, DAX + 2.5%, EUROSTOXX + 2.3%, SPAIN +1.8% and ITALY +2.2%.

1351,MCD,"US Futures are screaming higher - currently up 37 pts or 2% - as they look to pierce the 1950 level here on the opening. The market is clearly trying to find its 'happy place'.....and action around 1950 seems to be it. Much of the action during the past two weeks has revolved around this level.....a move up and thru and a close above would be a better sign. But we remain in a volatile situation....Look for 1920 to be support as we search for near term resistance - which I think is at the 1970 level.

"
1361,MCD,"If there's one thing officials at Chipotle Mexican Grill want you to know, it's that it is not like other restaurant companies.Sure, Chipotle's (CMG) fast-casual Mexican eateries prepare food in kitchens and serve it to guests who pay money for the privilege, just like at other restaurants.And yes, business tends to pick up around lunch and dinner, when folks queue up to order the company's freshly prepared burritos, tacos and salads.And yes, Chipotle needs to keep food, labor and other costs in line if it wants to hit its margins and deliver the kind of profits that make investors tingle with joy.But that's where the similarities end — at least from Chipotle's point of view.""Our business is pretty different than others in the category in that we don't rely on some of the things others depend on, such as limited-time offers, merchandise ties and new menu items,"" said Chris Arnold, the company's communications director.No Smoke And MirrorsChipotle doesn't depend on ""gimmicks"" to drive customers through its doors, Arnold says. Instead, it relies on the company's ""food culture and people culture.""On the food side, Chipotle focuses on ""finding the best ingredients we can and preparing them using classic cooking techniques,"" Arnold told IBD.On the people side, the company looks to hire the right workers and develop them into managers.Ninety-eight percent of Chipotle's managers are hired internally from the company's rank-and-file crew, Arnold says. Last year it promoted more than 9,000 people into management positions.""This leads to a better customer-service experience and more operational efficiency,"" Arnold said.It's hard to argue with the results. Chipotle almost always churns out double-digit sales and profit growth and consistently ranks among the top stocks in the restaurant sector.Its financial might was on display during the second quarter, which Chipotle reported after the close on July 21.The company stomped all over earnings and sales estimates despite implementing its first price increase in three years to help cover higher food costs.The next day, Chipotle's stock price soared nearly 12% to 659.77 for the biggest single-day gain since last fall. Shares currently trade near 678.Chipotle logged earnings of $3.50 a share for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year and well ahead of estimates for $3.08 a share.Overall sales gained 29% to $1.05 billion, beating views for $989.55 million. It was the third straight quarter of accelerated top-line growth.Same-store sales climbed 17.3% vs. expectations for a 10.5% gain. Chipotle also raised its full-year same-store sales guidance to the midteens from its prior guidance of growth in the high single digits.""It's the best traffic number in the industry,"" Sterne Agee analyst Lynne Collier said after the earnings report. ""Rarely do you see numbers this high. Most of the companies we follow have recently put up flattish to slightly negative traffic numbers.""In a report, Citigroup analyst Gregory Badishkanian said there was ""no single driver"" of Chipotle's strong same-store sales performance, though he did point to a few key drivers.One was a bigger (though still small) contribution from Chipotle's catering business. It represented 1.6% of sales during the second quarter, up from 0.3% the prior year.Badishkanian also says Chipotle benefited from improved marketing during the quarter.Compared with other restaurant operators in the fast-casual and fast-food sectors, Chipotle doesn't spend a whole lot of money on marketing. While most companies spend 3% to 5% of their revenue on advertising, Chipotle spends 1.75%, Arnold says.""We are not pursuing the kinds of gimmicks that fast-food companies pursue, such as new products,"" he said. ""Those are very expensive; a lot of R&D goes into developing new menu items, then you have to spend a lot of money on marketing.""Instead, Chipotle focuses on non-traditional marketing efforts that range from producing Web videos and sponsoring food and music festivals to partnering with local farmer's markets.While marketing helps drive top-line growth, Chipotle looked to bolster its bottom line with a rare price increase during the second quarter to help offset rising costs of beef, avocados and cheese.""We generally try to hold the line on pricing and raise prices as a last resort,"" Arnold said. ""We just felt like we had to do it.""Badishkanian, who recently met with Chipotle management, noted after the meeting that the company is not seeing ""any impact"" from raising prices, and added that Chipotle still feels that its prices are too low in the Northeast.One reason customers aren't terribly concerned about the higher prices is they are confident in the quality and freshness of Chipotle's food, analysts say. That holds true not just for Chipotle, but also for other fast-casual chains such as Panera Bread (PNRA), Qdoba Mexican Grill — a division of Jack in the Box (JACK) — and Baja Fresh, according to a recent report from analysts at research firm Trefis.Top Of The LineFast-casual restaurants provide more ""freshly prepared and high-quality food than traditional quick-service restaurants (QSR), all in an upscale and inviting ambiance with meals ranging from $8 to $15,"" Trefis said, adding, ""Big QSR brands such as McDonald's (MCD), Subway and Starbucks (SBUX) have been facing a huge threat by the leading fast-casual restaurants, as the traffic growth in the latter segment surpassed that of every other segment for the fifth consecutive year (in 2013).""To help meet rising customer demand, Chipotle opened 45 new restaurants during the second quarter to bring the total to more than 1,600. That total includes 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S. and seven ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants.The company also has a stake in one Pizzeria Locale in Denver.In any given year, about 80% of its expansion is in existing markets, Arnold says.""We have a pretty good idea of what the returns will be in those markets,"" he said.

1443,MCD,"Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.McDonald's (MCD) reported a smaller-than-expected drop in May same-store sales, though comps have fallen for 12 straight months.The fast-food giant said global comps dipped 0.3% last month, less than the 0.9% drop analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix were expecting.U.S same-store sales were down 2.2%, but comps in Europe were up 2.3% on strong sales from the U.K. Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa same-store sales were down 3.2%,The company, which will stop reporting monthly sales after July, said it is working on enhancing the customer experience at its U.S. stores with limited-time menu and value options.McDonald's shares were up 0.6% to 96.14 in premarket trading in the stock market today.""Our goal is to be a modern, progressive burger company that is responsive to consumers' evolving preferences, provides a contemporary experience for our customers and drives long-term value for our system and our shareholders,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a release.In May, McDonald's announced a restructuring plan to help it compete with fast-causal restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA) .Easterbrook said in a video message that the current structure is too ""cumbersome"" with layers of bureaucracy. McDonald's aims to make more money from franchising fees, as it looks to have 90% of its restaurants franchised, up from 81% now.

1444,MCD,"Investors have had an insatiable appetite for fast-casual restaurant stocks, evident by a surge in initial public offerings in the past year and big first-day gains.
"
1445,MCD,"Another serving is coming. Chicken-wing king Wingstop (WING) is set for an IPO that begins trading Friday.
"
1446,MCD,"The Dallas-based company raised the estimated price of its offering Tuesday, suggesting investors are hungry for shares.
"
1447,MCD,"Wingstop fits into the popular fast-casual restaurant segment, a type of restaurant that does not offer full-table service but provides a higher quality of food with fewer frozen or processed ingredients.
"
1448,MCD,"According to research firm Technomic, annual sales in the fast-casual segment in 2014 increased at more than three times the rate of the total restaurant industry.
"
1449,MCD,"Technomic says the fast-casual field boosted annual sales approximately 13% last year to $39 billion.
"
1450,MCD,"While that is a small share of the total restaurant industry's $466 billion in annual sales, it compares with a growth rate of 3.8% for the entire restaurant business.
"
1451,MCD,"Wingstop follows the May 8 IPO of Bojangles (BOJA), a Southern-style chicken-and-biscuit chain that raised $147 million. Bojangles stock priced at 19 and now trades near 25.
"
1452,MCD,"Another is New York burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK), which raised $150 million in its Jan. 30 IPO. Shake Shack priced at 21, above its estimated range, and bolted 119% from there on its first day. It now trades near 74.
"
1453,MCD,"California-inspired burger joint Habit Restaurants (HABT) priced at 18, above the estimated range, and popped 120%, raising $90 million. It now trades near 34.
"
1454,MCD,"Another winner has been Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), up 166% from its April 2014 IPO.
"
1455,MCD,"Big first-day gains have been common, though not all have shown long-term momentum.
"
1456,MCD,"Potbelly (PBPB), the Chicago-based sandwich chain, surged 120% in its October 2013 IPO, ending the day at 30.77. It now trades near 14.
"
1457,MCD,"Other early winners in this category that have turned cold include Noodles & Co. (NDLS), which popped 104% in its June 2013 IPO but now trades below the offering price.
"
1458,MCD,"Wingstop looks to raise $99 million in its IPO, pricing 5.8 million shares with an estimated range of 16-18.
"
1459,MCD,"Restaurant valuations are high, which has attracted investors to the IPO field, hoping they can catch a ride on a fast-growing company, says Larry Miller, founder and CEO of restaurant industry research firm MillerPulse.
"
1460,MCD,"Those valuations are high because overall industry performance has been on an upward trend since 2013, thanks to a steadily improving economy.
"
1461,MCD,"""Same-store sales and traffic have continued to improve,"" said Miller. ""The restaurant IPO market is benefiting from improving fundamentals and good valuations.""
"
1462,MCD,"That's been broad-based, with the exception of McDonald's (MCD), he adds.
"
1463,MCD,"THE COMPANY
"
1464,MCD,"Founded in 1994, Wingstop says it pioneered the concept of wings as a center-of-the-plate feature. It claims to be the largest fast-casual chicken-wing focused restaurant chain, having sold approximately 4 billion wings in the past 20 years.
"
1465,MCD,"Wingstop has 745 restaurants in 37 states and six countries. Of those, 726, or 97%, are franchised, with just 19 company-owned stores. Its largest market presence is in Texas and California. It has 27 restaurants in Mexico. International locations also include Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia.
"
1466,MCD,"Wingstop offers three versions of chicken wings: boneless, bone-in and chicken strips, with 11 ""bold, distinctive and craveable flavors,"" including mango habanero, Cajun, Hawaiian, hickory-smoked BBQ and mild.
"
1467,MCD,"It also offers hand-cut, seasoned fries and sides made fresh daily.
"
1468,MCD,"Family packs are on the menu, the largest being a 100-piece package. Carry-out orders constitute approximately 75% of sales.
"
1469,MCD,"On top of all that is an online ordering service.
"
1470,MCD,"Restaurant industry magazine QSR listed Wingstop among its ""Best Franchise Deals"" of 2014.
"
1471,MCD,"Food & Wine magazine put Wingstop on its list of ""Best Chicken Wings"" in 2014.
"
1472,MCD,"""While other concepts include wings as add-on menu items or focus on wings in a bar or sports-centric setting, we are singularly focused on wings, fries and sides, which generate approximately 90% of our sales,"" the company said in its IPO prospectus filing.
"
1473,MCD,"The small menu that Wingstop offers sets it apart from Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), a giant in the field with sales last year of $1.6 billion. Sales at the sports bar and grill have climbed by double-digit percentages for 19 straight quarters. In addition to chicken wings, Buffalo Wild Wings has burgers, sandwiches, salads and beer — and much larger restaurants.
"
1474,MCD,"""Wingstop should not be considered to be another Buffalo Wild Wings,"" said John Gordon, principal at Pacific Management Consulting Group.
"
1475,MCD,"Wingstop says its customers are anchored by the sought-after demographic of 18-34-year-olds, which Wingstop says is a loyal group that dines at fast-casual restaurants more frequently.
"
1476,MCD,"RISK/CHALLENGES
"
1477,MCD,"The fast-casual restaurant arena is highly competitive.
"
1478,MCD,"The all-star in the group is Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which came public in January 2006. Chipotle annual sales have grown by double-digit percentages 14 years in a row, which partly explains the enthusiasm for stocks in the sector.
"
1479,MCD,"""There's a tremendous amount of interest among investors to find another Chipotle,"" said Gordon.
"
1480,MCD,"It won't be easy to replicate Chipotle's success, he notes.
"
1481,MCD,"The challenge all restaurants face is that the market is saturated. Gordon estimates 1 million restaurants are in America. The plate is overflowing.
"
1482,MCD,"""Restaurants have grown faster than the population has grown,"" said Gordon. ""There's a supply and demand imbalance.""
"
1483,MCD,"But chicken's popularity works in Wingstop's favor.
"
1484,MCD,"""Chicken consumption has been tearing the heck out of beef consumption,"" Gordon said, with chicken getting hot in 1999.
"
1485,MCD,"THE RESULTS
"
1486,MCD,"Wingstop's same-store sales growth, an important measure of company performance, has been positive for 11 quarters. Domestic same-stores sales rose 10.7% year over year in the first quarter and 12.5% in the fourth quarter.
"
1487,MCD,"Revenue of $19 million in the first quarter was up 14% from the year-ago period, with net income of $2.55 million.
"
1488,MCD,"Revenue of $67.5 million in 2014 was up 14%, with net income of $9 million. Royalty revenue and franchise fees accounted for 56% of revenue.
"
1489,MCD,"Wingstop estimates there is opportunity to grow to 2,500 restaurants across the U.S., with ""significant international growth opportunity,"" saying it has 310 international restaurant commitments.
"
1490,MCD,"PROCEEDS
"
1491,MCD,"Of the 5.8 million shares being offered, 3.65 million are from current stockholders. Wingstop will not receive any proceeds from that sale. Of the remaining 2.15 million shares, based on an assumed price of 17 per share, Wingstop expects to receive proceeds of $30.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other fees.

1504,MCD,"IBD's Retail-Restaurant group has been on shaky ground of late amid problems involving some of the bigger industry names, but one eatery that continues to produce solid financial and stock price growth is Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL), which is set to report fiscal third-quarter results on Tuesday.The Lebanon, Tenn.-based Cracker Barrel is due to report fiscal Q3 earnings before Tuesday's open. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.37 a share for the quarter, which ended in April. That's up 11% from the prior year and would mark the fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth, but would mark a slowdown from 24% in Q2. Revenue is seen climbing 6% to $680 million. That would snap a four-quarter string of gradually accelerating top-line growth.Cracker Barrel, which runs a chain of more than 630 family restaurants in 42 states, boasts a strong IBD Composite Rating of 90. The stock fell 0.9% to 141.08 on the stock market Friday, finding resistance at the 50-day moving average for a third straight session. Shares have been consolidating since peaking at 149.94 on March 20.Cracker Barrel remains one of the better stocks in a group that has fallen to No. 62 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD — down from No. 2 as recently as 13 weeks ago.The restaurant group has been rocked by problems plaguing industry giants such as McDonald's (MCD), which is undergoing a restructuring plan designed to help it return to growth mode; as well as former Wall Street darling Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which has seen shares sag recently amid sales that have failed to live up to historic rapid pace.There are still some tasty restaurant stocks out there, however, including highly rated Starbucks (SBUX), which touched a new high on Friday, as well as Sonic (SONC) and Papa John's Pizza (PZZA).

1538,MCD,"Attention shoppers: Apple on Tuesday unveiled tap-to-pay technology for using iPhones to buy things.
"
1539,MCD,"The company said ""Apple Pay"" will be available in October as a free update to its iOS 8 software.
"
1540,MCD,"Apple's (AAPL) push into mobile payments isn't expected to power earnings growth, analyst say. But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.
"
1541,MCD,"Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.
"
1542,MCD,"Apple is taking on Google (GOOGL), eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, retail consortium MCX, phone companies and others in mobile payments.
"
1543,MCD,"U.S. consumers have been slow to embrace digital wallets, partly over security concerns. Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others. Apple, stung by last week's celebrity-photo hacking scandal involving iCloud data storage, aims to win over shoppers, retailers and credit-card firms with its approach to protecting consumer financial data and limiting fraud.
"
1544,MCD,"""Security is at the core of (Apple) Pay, but so is privacy,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said at Apple's product unveiling event Tuesday, taking a shot at Google. ""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""
"
1545,MCD,"Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users. IPhones will generate single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers to store check-out systems. A ""secure element"" chip stores encrypted data.

1546,MCD,"NFC Rollout Will Get Boost
"
1547,MCD,"Apple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% to 20% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals, but Apple's push into mobile payments could speed NFC adoption.
"
1548,MCD,"Aside from its ability to build easy-to-use devices, one of Apple's strengths in the payments field is the more than 800 million credit cards on file in iTunes app store accounts. IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.

"
1556,MCD,"Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.
"
1557,MCD,"Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.
"
1558,MCD,"Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.
"
1559,MCD,"Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.
"
1560,MCD,"Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.
"
1561,MCD,"Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.
"
1562,MCD,"PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.
"
1563,MCD,"Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.

1577,MCD,"The stock market takes a lot of flak for being impersonal. Arguments for or against automated trading aside, stocks are bought and sold by people. People manage and staff publicly traded companies that sell goods and services to, you guessed it, other people.In the end, it's all very personal.Many times, successful investors are buying into visionary leaders as much as they are the actual companies. This is true for many when it comes to Facebook's (FB) Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla's (TSLA) Elon Musk or the omnipotent aura of Apple's (AAPL) Steve Jobs. In other cases, the leaders have less star power but carry a solid background with successful companies.That's why every investor's fundamental research regimen should include a look at a target company's executive management. It takes only a few minutes to get a general sense of who you are dealing with.Chase down a company's annual 10-K Securities & Exchange Commission filing. These forms, as well as profiles on the company's website, list executive management and detail their experience. If it's a young company, look for the 424b prospectus filed prior to the initial offering.Do quick searches of the executives by reading past articles in IBD's The New America and Internet & Technology sections. Get some sense of where the executives came from and what their accomplishments and failures are.A search for news on the Web is also important, because 10-Ks won't tell you an executive's failings.Brilliant inventors, creators and visionary thinkers often make lousy executives. In contrast, some of the best managers have climbed the ranks amid difficult circumstances. They understand a company and its markets from the customer level up.Are there any managers to watch today?Consider the new McDonald's (MCD) CEO, Steve Easterbrook. He took the management helm in March and announced a vast restructuring and turnaround strategy at the beginning of May.Easterbrook is a Brit who was an accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers before shifting to a management position with McDonald's in London in 1993. He earned the company's top management slot, first in the U.K., then in Europe. He left for several years to run London-based restaurant chains PizzaExpress and Wagamama.Easterbrook re-upped with McDonald's in 2013, earning the title of global chief brand officer.McDonald's shares jumped 5% in late January on news of Easterbrook's appointment, then rose another 8% over the next five weeks. They've been basing since early March as investors wait to see whether Easterbrook proves to be a genuine force for change.Yahoo's (YHOO) Marissa Mayer is not a brand-new CEO, but her task is no less Herculean.She joined Google (GOOGL) in 1999 as the company's 20th employee and first female engineer. She helped build the company, had ups and downs, and notched notable successes, but she had no real experience outside the Google cocoon or as the ultimate decider atop the management heap.Yahoo shares have risen 231% since Mayer took the CEO post in July 2012. But the stock is down 15% so far this year.

Broiler chickens are poultry raised for consumption.""Given the progress we've already made reducing antibiotics in our broilers, we believe it's realistic to shoot for zero by the end of our 2017 fiscal year,"" said Tyson Foods CEO Donnie Smith in a statement.""But we won't jeopardize animal well-being just to get there. We'll use the best available treatments to keep our chickens healthy, under veterinary supervision,"" he said.The company said it will create working groups with independent farmers in its meat supply chain to address ways to cut human antibiotic use in cattle, hog and turkey farms.In early March, McDonald's said that within the next two years it will use chickens raised only without human antibiotics. Costco told Reuters it is working toward eliminating shared-use antibiotics in animals.Restaurants, food processors and retailers are trying to keep pace with a growing consumer desire for more natural food. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on Monday said it has eliminated genetically modified food from its menu, fulfilling a Chipotle vow from earlier in the year. Chipotle has faced carnitas shortages this year as its seeks a pork supplier that meets its standards for animal treatment.Shares of Tyson rose 1.1% to 39.32 in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Its stock is closing back in on its 50-day line after breaking support in mid-April.Tyson said its antibiotics decision will not materially affect its financial performance.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.RELATED: Costco Eyes Sales Curbs Of Antibiotics-Treated MeatMcDonald's Seeks Chipotle Halo By Cutting Antibiotics.

1694,MCD,"Ray Kroc steered McDonald's to the top of fast food. His winning recipe? He was flexible, nurtured franchisee relationships and reacted to business challenges with an open mind.""Just as Henry Ford's idea was brought to reality through hard work, perseverance, just plain doggedness and above all faith, so McDonald's astounding success was achieved through those same qualities,"" Kroc wrote in a 1969 company newsletter. ""We can never rest on our laurels. We must always keep our ideal dream before us and work with faith so that we can accomplish ever more than we have.""Despite initial low profit, Kroc (1902-84) used an entrepreneurial spirit to grow McDonald's, revolutionizing the fast-food industry through a standardized approach to restaurant franchises and an openness to new ideas.Today, McDonald's (MCD) is still cooking. 2014 sales hit $27 billion, a 29% rise since 2006. Its stock has climbed 640% in the past 12 years.Kroc drove himself from the start. A high school dropout in Oak Park, Ill., he lied about his age in 1917 to sign up as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross as World War I raged in Europe.The war ended before his training did. So he steered to various jobs: piano player, paper cup salesman, milkshake machine salesman.Life Begins At 50Kroc was in his 50s during his milkshake mixer career, but he was just getting started.The big turn came in 1954, when a large order for Prince Castle Multimixers, which could mix five milkshakes at once, came from a San Bernardino, Calif., restaurant owned by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald.Kroc flew to California to meet the brothers and was amazed by their booming operation, which focused on a few key items — burgers, fries and drinks.The duo's emphasis on quality set them apart from competitors.Kroc was hooked. He shared with the brothers his vision of opening McDonald's restaurants all over the country. Then he cut a deal with the duo and started McDonald's Corp. in 1955.Now head of the operation, Kroc laid out the strategy: From its headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., the company would sell franchises to individual restaurant owners for the low price of $950 and in exchange receive 1.4% of all sales. Also in the mix, the McDonald brothers would receive 0.5%.In 1961, Kroc purchased the exclusive rights to the McDonald's name and bought out the duo for $2.7 million.Now running the operation, he initiated an enterprise that grew from that one restaurant into more than 7,700 at his death in 1984.Today, McDonald's is the world's leading global food-service retailer, with over 36,000 locations in over 100 countries.Paul Facella, a longtime consultant at McDonald's and the author of ""Everything I Learned About Business I Learned At McDonald's,"" notes that Kroc had a slogan that epitomized his unique relationship with the franchisees: ""You make the first buck, I'll make the second buck.""When Kroc first opened for business in 1955, contenders in the fast-food arena were A&W, Dairy Queen, Tastee-Freez and Big Boy.""Kroc took great pains to differentiate McDonald's from these players. ... The crucial difference between Kroc and his rivals was one of world view. He saw franchises as business partners, not mere customers,"" wrote Daniel Gross in ""Forbes Greatest Business Stories of all Time."" ""In his travels selling the multimixer, he had observed the way franchisers milked franchisees for profits without concern for their long-term viability. Kroc vowed not to fall into that lucrative, but ultimately unproductive, trap,"" wrote Gross.Facella added: ""Kroc understood the franchises were a long-term relationship. He wanted to make sure the franchises were successful, because the success of the franchise would ultimately make the company successful. In the beginning years, if a franchise was struggling, if he had to help, he would work with it. He realized it was to the company's advantage as opposed to saying, 'Hey you missed your franchisee payment.' ""Ultimately, Kroc left his competition in the dust as he expanded his operation while focusing on quality every step of the way.Three Legs, Sturdy CompanyKroc promoted a philosophy of a three-legged stool in which one leg was McDonald's, the second the franchisees and the third McDonald's suppliers and vendors.""He understood the need for all three to be strong. That principle was a hallmark of Ray Kroc,"" Facella told IBD.Mike Bullington, corporate archivist at McDonald's, said that Kroc stressed that the firm ""would only be as successful as its franchisees.""Being flexible was crucial in propelling Kroc toward mammoth success. In the early years, even though the number of restaurants expanded fast, company earnings were minimal due to the original deal of low franchising fees.""Through 1960, when the chain's restaurants raked up $75 million in sales, McDonald's earnings were a mere $159,000,"" wrote Gross.Shifting gears, Kroc began to focus on real estate as a potential profit center, with the idea that McDonald's could make money by leasing or buying restaurant sites.From that concept came Franchise Realty Corp., which bought or leased properties that it would then sublease to franchises at a 20%, and later 40%, markup.""Franchisees would then pay McDonald's either a minimum rate or a percentage of sales, whichever was greater,"" wrote Gross. ""As sales and prices inevitably rose over the years, the company would collect more and more rent as its costs remained virtually constant.""Quality FirstMcDonald's progress came with Kroc's commitment to quality, no matter how large the operation became, said Usha Haley, a West Virginia University professor of management. ""He reduced making a good burger to a common denominator that could be replicated everywhere,"" Haley said. ""Everything was put into an equation, including how many ounces goes into a burger.""Kroc pointed to QSCV, which stood for quality, service, cleanliness, value. ""This was the basic DNA building block of McDonald's,"" said Haley. ""He tried to make the product of a burger into a production line, but still had quality, service and cleanliness.""Barb Schmidt, who observed that Kroc approach while she ran six McDonald's restaurants in Florida, before selling them in 1996, said: ""He was so passionate about serving the customers the highest quality food in a reasonable amount of time at an affordable price. He wanted every customer to have the same experience each and every time they came to McDonald's. He always took great pride in the service, cleanliness and friendliness of his company. I believe that is what led to the extraordinary success of McDonald's — his consistent attitude of greatness.""Kroc instituted strict quality control and guidelines for franchisees. He also gave the restaurants a certain amount of autonomy, with the idea of lifting their entrepreneurial spirit. ""He was open to listening to franchisees' ideas,"" said Haley.Some of those concepts involved new products. ""Franchises came up with Filet-O-Fish, the Big Mac and Egg McMuffin,"" said Haley.Kroc liked such results rather than being hung up on resumes.""Ray never graduated from high school,"" said Facella. ""McDonald's was about meritocracy. It didn't matter if you went to college; it was about if you could make things happen. If you were very good at what you do, you could move up.""On top of all that was Kroc's humanity, said Schmidt: ""What I remember most about this amazing man was his ability to give you his full attention when he spoke with you. I felt like I was the only person in the room.""When Facella was a midlevel manager in New York City during his 34-year career at McDonald's, he met Kroc for the first time: ""He popped out of his limo and walks up to me: 'Hi Paul, how are you today?' I said, 'It is nice to meet you, Mr. Kroc,' and he looked at me and said, 'I'm Ray. Don't call me Mr. Kroc.'""From there, the two got into an old-style limousine with a flip seat. ""Naturally, I sat in the flip seat,"" recalled Facella. ""But Ray said, 'Paul, you are my guest; you sit in the comfortable seat.' There was humility about the man. He just cared about treating people right and making them feel good, which is part of his legacy. He is someone who is truly in the top five people I will ever meet in my life.""

1754,MCD,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance Report
"
1755,MCD,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
1756,MCD,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1757,MCD,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
1758,MCD,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
1759,MCD,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
1760,MCD,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
1761,MCD,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
1762,MCD,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
1763,MCD,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
1764,MCD,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
1765,MCD,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
1766,MCD,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
1767,MCD,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
1768,MCD,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
1769,MCD,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
1770,MCD,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
1771,MCD,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
1772,MCD,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
1773,MCD,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
1774,MCD,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
1775,MCD,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
1776,MCD,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
1777,MCD,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
1778,MCD,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
1779,MCD,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
1780,MCD,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
1781,MCD,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
1782,MCD,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
1783,MCD,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
1784,MCD,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
1785,MCD,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
1786,MCD,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
1787,MCD,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
1788,MCD,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
1789,MCD,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
1790,MCD,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
1791,MCD,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
1792,MCD,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
1793,MCD,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
1794,MCD,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
1795,MCD,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
1796,MCD,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
1797,MCD,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
1798,MCD,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
1799,MCD,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
1800,MCD,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
1801,MCD,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
1802,MCD,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
1803,MCD,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
1804,MCD,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
1805,MCD,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
1806,MCD,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
1807,MCD,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
1808,MCD,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
1809,MCD,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
1810,MCD,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
1811,MCD,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
1812,MCD,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"

1814,MCD,"How high can Starbucks (SBUX) go? Shares of the coffee-chain powerhouse are just 1% off their all-time high of 49.60 from March 19 and as of Monday afternoon were up more than 18% for the year.
"
1815,MCD,"""Starbucks remains one of a shrinking group of consumer large-cap growth stories,"" said David Palmer, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in a research note on Monday, which came with an ""outperform"" rating.

1816,MCD,"At $73 billion, Starbucks' market capitalization in the restaurant sector is second only to that of McDonald's (MCD), which has had a bumpier stock ride this year.
"
1817,MCD,"Based on most recent 12-week channel data, Starbucks has gained share in both packaged coffee and single-serve, Palmer notes. Its share of packaged coffee and K-cups rose to 10.9% and 15.9% from last year's 10.4% and 13.7%, respectively.
"

"
1848,MCD,"Dunkin' Brands Group (DNKN) delivered its lowest EPS growth in years last quarter and is expected to post only single-digit gains over the next three quarters — but investors still have reason to like the seller of doughnuts and coffee.
"
1849,MCD,"Dunkin' boasts a strong IBD Composite Rating of 93, has seen its share price rise about 15% since hitting a five-month low Dec. 19, and belongs to a Retail-Restaurant group that ranks No. 9 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.
"
1850,MCD,"Those positive signs come even amid slower earnings growth at the Canton, Mass.-based company, which ended a years-long run of double-digit EPS gains by posting a 7% year-over-year increase during its 2014 fourth quarter.
"
1851,MCD,"Here are three reasons to feel perky about Dunkin':
"
1852,MCD," Improving comps: In a new research note, analyst Stephen Anderson of Miller Tabak says that he expects Dunkin's same-restaurant sales to accelerate toward the high end of guidance in 2015.
"
1853,MCD,"He cites a slight rise in menu prices, the introduction of new products such as cold blended drinks, and increased enrollment in Dunkin's DDPerks rewards program — changes that Anderson estimates will add 50 to 75 basis points to 2015 same-restaurant sales.
"
1854,MCD,"""We also argue that continued job gains and, to a lesser extent, lower gasoline costs will fuel breakfast traffic for the industry,"" Anderson noted.
"
1855,MCD,"He reckons that Dunkin' can take market share away from rivals such as McDonald's (MCD), in part because the latter company has less wiggle room to offer heavy promotions on coffee and other breakfast and lunch items.
"
1856,MCD," Lower coffee costs: Even with recent volatility in coffee prices, Dunkin' executives expect year-over-year coffee costs to be flat to down slightly in 2015.
"
1857,MCD,"""Previously they had expected a slight headwind from coffee costs,"" Anderson noted.
"
1858,MCD,"Dunkin' doesn't get a direct bottom-line boost from lower coffee costs because almost all of its units are franchised, so the franchisees get the benefit.
"
1859,MCD,"However, Anderson said, ""We think there will be an indirect benefit as more profitable franchisees accelerate unit expansion.""
"
1860,MCD,"More units means more franchise revenue for Dunkin'.
"
1861,MCD," Dunkin' K-Cups: Dunkin' K-Cups' being rolled out in grocery and online channels should be an ""incremental catalyst"" for the company, Anderson said, though probably more for 2016 than 2015.
"
1862,MCD,"Dunkin' management will wait until the release of its first-quarter results to provide more specific details on expanded distribution of Dunkin' K-Cups, he said. For now, they are distributed exclusively at its Dunkin' Donuts restaurants nationally and at its Baskin-Robbins locations on the West Coast.
"
1863,MCD,"Dunkin' K-Cups currently contribute about $150 million in total sales for Dunkin', Anderson said: ""Although there is the risk of cannibalization at Dunkin' restaurants, we think there is the potential for DNKN to double K-Cup sales to $300 million through the grocery/retail and online channels.""
"
1864,MCD,"Meanwhile, coffee powerhouse Starbucks (SBUX) also made news during its annual shareholders meeting Wednesday when it announced a 2-for-1 stock split as well as plans to roll out a new delivery service later this year.

1953,MCD,"THE BUZZAmericans love their hamburgers and are about to be dished up a tasty IPO of fast-casual restaurant chain Shake Shack.Burger chains are the largest dine-out segment in the U.S., with more than $77 billion in 2014 sales, according to research firm Technomic. The burger industry is estimated to be twice the size of the pizza market, which is the next largest category.While McDonald's (MCD) and other international burger chains take the biggest bite out of sales, the fast-casual segment is booming, with annual sales growing at double-digit rates. Among the giants in the fast-casual space are Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA).Shake Shack (SHAK), which serves premium burgers, hot dogs, fries, shakes, frozen custard, beer and wine, is attracting lots of buzz with its upcoming IPO.On Wednesday it raised the initial public offering price to a range of 17 to 19 a share, up from 14 to 16. It plans to sell 5 million shares and raise about $90 million. The shares are set to price Thursday and begin trading Friday on the NYSE.Research firm IPOboutique said its channel checks indicate strong demand for Shake Shack stock among institutional investors.""It's a fast-growth story,"" said Jeff Zell, research analyst at IPOboutique. ""Almost all of the fast-casual restaurant deals in the past year have all popped above their offering price.""The latest IPO in the fast-casual space was Habit Restaurants (HABT). It soared 120% from an IPO price of 18 on its first trading day, Nov. 20, and raised $90 million. The stock hit a high of 44.20 on Dec. 12, but has since fallen to near 32.Another is El Pollo Loco (LOCO), which popped 60% from an IPO price of 15 on its first trading day, July 25, and is now near 25. One additional recently public name is Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), which now trades at more than double its early-April IPO price of 15.THE COMPANYShake Shack started out as a hot-dog cart in 2001 in New York City's Madison Square Park as the park was getting a revamp. The food was an instant hit, receiving widespread media attention and long lines of customers.The first official Shake Shack eatery then opened in 2004 as a kiosk in the park .The company started serving burgers and has since grown to 63 Shacks, of which 27 are licensed Shake Shack restaurants operating in offshore markets. Twenty operate in the Middle East. Shake Shack operates in 10 Eastern U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Fifteen of its restaurant locations are in New York.The company plans to open at least 10 new Shacks each year for the foreseeable future. Over the long-term it sees the market potential to operate least 450 Shake Shacks. On average, each store produces annual revenue of about $5 million.""Over the last decade, Shake Shack has become a beloved New York City institution that generates significant media attention, critical acclaim and a passionately devoted following,"" the company states in its IPO prospectus.In its IPO filing, Shake Shack continually describes creating an experience — a word often used in the prospectus to define its success.""We never stop looking for the best culinary ingredients and the best partners in order to exceed our guests' expectations in every aspect of their experience,"" it said, for example.Shake Shack, while passionate about providing customers a compelling experience, is equally dedicated to employees.""Through our leadership development program, The Shacksperience, we teach our team members the principles of Enlightened Hospitality and how to live and breathe our Shack Pact, the agreement that encompasses our value system and brand ethos,"" it said in the filing.RISKS/CHALLENGESThe restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with various regions having highly dedicated customers.""Some of our competitors, including some of our 'better burger' competitors, have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, and many of our competitors are well-established in markets in which we have existing Shacks or intend to locate new Shacks,"" Shake Shack said.The fast-casual dining segment has, on average, seen sales growth in the double-digit rates for the past 15 years, according to Technomic.The fast-casual restaurant segment in total took in revenue of about $38.5 billion in 2014. Sales in the burger category are around $3 billion.The largest competitor in the fast-casual space that focuses on hamburgers is Five Guys, which is based in Alexandria, Va. Five Guys has more than 1,000 shops and revenue of about $1 billion, said Darren Tristano, executive vice president at Technomic.In second is Denver-based Smashburger, with about 300 outlets.Shake Shack, which is small in comparison, faces a formidable group of competitors.""Shake Shack is late to game,"" said Tristano. ""Their customers say it's a great burger experience, but today there are a lot of good burgers.""He added: ""The burger market continues to do well, but it's also maturing. A lot more burger chains are opening up as we speak.""Shake Shack has been cautiously methodical in its expansion. ""We are still in the very nascent stage of our story,"" it said.THE RESULTSFor the 39-week period ended Sept. 24, Shake Shack reported revenue of $83.8 million, up 41% from the $59.5 million reported in the year-earlier period. Net income fell 20% to $3.54 million.Shake Shack reported revenue of $31.8 million in the third quarter, up 40% from the year-earlier period, and income from operations of $759,000.PROCEEDSShake Shack expects to receive $83.7 million in net proceeds and will use that to repay debt of $36 million. Another $44.7 million will be used for general corporate purposes, including the opening of new Shake Shacks and renovation of existing shops.MANAGEMENTDaniel MeyerChairmanMeyer, 56, has served as chairman since its formation.

1978,MCD,"Shake Shack expects to sell 5 million shares in its initial public offering for $14 to $16 apiece, potentially valuing the burger chain at $568 million as the latest fast-casual restaurant goes public.The $80 million in expected proceeds would nearly match its $82.5 million in sales during 2013, the most recent full-year figure available.The company will also offer as many as 750,000 additional shares of its Class A common stock to its underwriters. It plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""SHAK.""Shake Shack started in 2001 as a hot-dog cart in New York City, opening its first permanent location in 2004 and expanding to 63 locations in nine countries.In an SEC filing, the company touted its upscale dining experience — their locations offer beer and wine — and commitment to ""premium, sustainable ingredients"" and its higher-end dining experience.""With the majority of the burger restaurant segment comprised of quick service restaurant competitors, we believe that Shake Shack is well positioned to take market share, as we believe consumers will continue to trade up to higher quality offerings given an increasing consumer focus on responsible sourcing, ingredients and preparation,"" the company said in the filing. ""Additionally, we believe that consumers will continue to move away from the added time commitment and cost of traditional casual dining.""Shake Shack's announcement follows the recent IPOs of other restaurants, such as El Pollo Loco (LOCO), which debuted in July, and Habit Restaurants (HABT), which came public in November.Such fast-casual chains, which emphasize better ingredients and greater customization when ordering meals, have become more popular at the expense of traditional fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD). McDonald's, in turn, has vowed to adapt to shifting consumer sentiment.Shares of El Pollo Loco were down 2% on the stock market today. Habit, which runs the Habit Burger chain, ticked up 0.6%. McDonald's was down 0.7%. Fast-casual darling Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) dipped 0.4%.Shares of Habit and El Pollo Loco went on a tear after their debuts but have settled since.

2026,MCD,"A choppy start to the stock market in January may hold a taste of what lies ahead for ETF investors in 2015. In a word, volatility.

2029,MCD,"Against this backdrop, PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend (SPHD) outshone virtually every other diversified stock ETF. It's risen 1.93% so far in January.

2063,MCD,"It was February 1964, and Irvine Robbins was stumped.
"
2064,MCD,"A reporter from the Washington Post was on the phone asking how Robbins' firm, the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain, would celebrate the Beatles' arrival in a few days.
"
2065,MCD,"Problem was, Robbins had never heard of the Beatles.
"
2066,MCD,"But he thought fast and devised a new flavor: Beatle Nut.
"
2067,MCD,"It combined pistachio, chocolate and walnuts and was ready in days, according to a corporate history at BaskinRobbins.com.
"
2068,MCD,"From its humble beginnings as a handful of stores in Southern California to its current perch as a part of the global behemoth Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Baskin-Robbins' hold on American culture has endured thanks to Robbins' vision and creativity.
"
2069,MCD,"He is remembered and revered by Dunkin' executives, including Bill Mitchell, currently the president of Baskin-Robbins U.S. and Canada. ""Irv created many of the company practices and values still in play today,"" Mitchell told IBD.
"
2070,MCD,"His special talent, Mitchell said, was coming up with imaginative ways to use pop culture and current events to sell ice cream. Beyond the Beatles, examples included Lunar Cheesecake for the first moon landing of 1969 and Baseball Nut, which celebrated the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles in 1958.
"
2071,MCD,"""He was famous for saying, and we quote him often, 'We don't just sell ice cream; we sell fun,'"" said Mitchell.
"
2072,MCD,"Canadian Start
"
2073,MCD,"Robbins (1917-2008) was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. When he was five, his father, a Russian immigrant named Aaron, moved the family to Tacoma, Wash., and opened an ice-cream shop, where Irv worked as a young man. He then attended the University of Washington and joined the Army during World War II, serving as a staff sergeant in California.
"
2074,MCD,"When he left the service, Robbins aimed to go into business for himself and replicate the fun atmosphere of his father's store.
"
2075,MCD,"So he opened a shop called Snowbird in Glendale, Calif.
"
2076,MCD,"Ice cream had been delighting people for centuries before Robbins made it his mission.
"
2077,MCD,"Laura Weiss' book ""Ice Cream: A Global History"" traces the dessert from a liquidlike sherbet created by Arabs in medieval times to the frozen sorbetto beloved by Italians in the 17th century.
"
2078,MCD,"American colonists were familiar with ice cream, and Thomas Jefferson had a particular taste for it.
"
2079,MCD,"In 1852, a Philadelphia woman named Nancy Johnson received a patent for a mechanical ice cream maker, and a decade later Baltimore native Jacob Fussell became the first to produce ice cream on a big scale, with factories scattered along the East Coast.
"
2080,MCD,"Americans continued to push the ice-cream envelope, coming up with cones, sundaes and frozen novelties, such as ice cream sandwiches.
"
2081,MCD,"But some things didn't change, Weiss wrote, despite the effort of Howard Johnson. The entrepreneur glumly told the New York Times that he'd developed ""scores of flavors, and yet most people still say, 'I'll take vanilla.'""
"
2082,MCD,"Robbins, who wanted to change that, offered 21 flavors at Snowbird. He then teamed up with Burt Baskin, who'd married Irv's sister Shirley. Baskin owned Burton's Ice Cream Shop in Pasadena.
"
2083,MCD,"By 1949, they had over 40 stores between them and four years later changed the company title to Baskin-Robbins. The name order was determined by a coin flip.
"
2084,MCD,"With the help of advertising agency Carson/Roberts, they devised an image full of color — brown and pink for chocolate and cherries — and polka dots that evoked the circus. A 31 was added to the logo to remind customers they could choose one unique flavor for every day of the month. The marketing of Baskin-Robbins ""connected ice cream with happiness. It reinforced the message that ice cream was all about pleasure and fun,"" said Weiss.
"
2085,MCD,"Baskin-Robbins tapped into several trends in American society, Weiss added: After World War II, customers had ""bottled-up demand"" for ice cream. During the war, ice cream had been reserved for troops. Once the shooting stopped, sales of the treat, along with cones and novelties, went ""through the roof.""
"
2086,MCD,"As the company grew, Robbins was one of the first to recognize how powerful a tool franchising could be, Mitchell said.
"
2087,MCD,"""Sure, they were focused on the fun, but they approached it with an attitude of 'The more ice cream we sell, the more money we make,' "" he said. ""That was the message to the franchisees.""
"
2088,MCD,"Baskin-Robbins wasn't the first restaurant chain to franchise. But the firm's success with the model inspired others, including Ray Kroc of McDonald's (MCD).
"
2089,MCD,"Robbins brought his own touch to the method by signing agreements with dairy providers such as Alpenrose Dairy in the Northwest and Klinke Bros. Ice Cream Co. in the South. The pacts governed such details as the delivery-truck temperatures and the thickness of the truck walls, which Robbins would personally inspect, Mitchell says.
"
2090,MCD,"On Top Of It
"
2091,MCD,"Robbins is lauded for his creativity with flavors, Mitchell notes, but his obsession with quality, especially for suppliers, was also paramount.
"
2092,MCD,"One such supplier, John Klinke, was a Tennessee dairyman in the 1960s when a friend told him about a cool company called Baskin-Robbins. It was Robbins' personality and drive that convinced Klinke, then a part of a buying group called Dixie's Dairy, to sign on.
"
2093,MCD,"Robbins grasped that the only way Baskin-Robbins could make it big was to bolster the franchises, Klinke told IBD. ""The main thing was to take care of every franchisee and see that they're profitable,"" he said.
"
2094,MCD,"The supplier Klinke Bros. and franchisees have stuck for decades with Baskin-Robbins, whose stores are 100% owned by their operators, says Mitchell.
"
2095,MCD,"Robbins believed that local franchises helped customers develop a personal connection to the stores, just as coming up with of-the-moment flavors connected the ice cream to what was going on in their lives. And franchisees' stake in the success of their stores flowed back to the corporation.
"
2096,MCD,"Many of them were motivated by work ethic at the top, said Mitchell. Robbins was an example of ""that interesting breed of having a passion for what you do, and you don't look at the watch to get it done.""
"
2097,MCD,"Applause
"
2098,MCD,"Entrepreneur magazine has frequently put Baskin-Robbins on its list of the top franchises in America.
"
2099,MCD,"Robbins exhibited another trait that kept franchisees loyal: integrity. Said Klinke: ""He was just so honest, and he was just a really good man. He was happy doing what he was doing, making people happy. I'm proud to have known him.""
"
2100,MCD,"In a 1976 profile in People magazine, Robbins downplayed his feats: ""If I've done anything to be successful, it's that I had the ability to listen to the right people.""
"
2101,MCD,"By 1967, when Robbins and Baskin decided to sell the chain to United Fruit for $12 million, they had 500 stores. Being part of a global corporation let Baskin-Robbins go international, and in 1970 stores opened in Japan, Saudi Arabia, Korea and Australia.
"
2102,MCD,"Today, Baskin-Robbins has more than 6,700 locations around the world, according to the corporate website.
"
2103,MCD,"Burt Baskin died just months after the partners sold the chain. Robbins remained an active part of Baskin-Robbins for many years. He was chairman of the board in the 1970s and continued to help develop and test flavors.
"
2104,MCD,"Some duds came along the way, but that'll happen when you develop 1,200 flavors, notes Mitchell.
"
2105,MCD,"In 1979, Robbins told the San Francisco Chronicle that people chased after him, even when he was driving, to pitch flavor ideas. His license plate read ""31 BR.""
"
2106,MCD,"Robbins, who was married with three children, died at age 90.
"
2107,MCD,"Another of Baskin-Robbins' accomplishments was paving the way for other iconic ice cream brands, like Ben & Jerry's, says Weiss. Robbins and Baskin were savvy businessmen in the thick of a postwar full of Americans with extra discretionary money, leisure time and booming baby births.
"
2108,MCD,"""It was a great time for ice cream,"" she said. ""Not that there's ever a bad time for ice cream.""It was February 1964, and Irvine Robbins was stumped.A reporter from the Washington Post was on the phone asking how Robbins' firm, the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain, would celebrate the Beatles' arrival in a few days.Problem was, Robbins had never heard of the Beatles.But he thought fast and devised a new flavor: Beatle Nut.It combined pistachio, chocolate and walnuts and was ready in days, according to a corporate history at BaskinRobbins.com.From its humble beginnings as a handful of stores in Southern California to its current perch as a part of the global behemoth Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Baskin-Robbins' hold on American culture has endured thanks to Robbins' vision and creativity.He is remembered and revered by Dunkin' executives, including Bill Mitchell, currently the president of Baskin-Robbins U.S. and Canada.

2109,MCD,"It was February 1964, and Irvine Robbins was stumped.
"
2110,MCD,"A reporter from the Washington Post was on the phone asking how Robbins' firm, the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain, would celebrate the Beatles' arrival in a few days.
"
2111,MCD,"Problem was, Robbins had never heard of the Beatles.
"
2112,MCD,"But he thought fast and devised a new flavor: Beatle Nut.
"
2113,MCD,"It combined pistachio, chocolate and walnuts and was ready in days, according to a corporate history at BaskinRobbins.com.
"
2114,MCD,"From its humble beginnings as a handful of stores in Southern California to its current perch as a part of the global behemoth Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), Baskin-Robbins' hold on American culture has endured thanks to Robbins' vision and creativity.
"
2115,MCD,"He is remembered and revered by Dunkin' executives, including Bill Mitchell, currently the president of Baskin-Robbins U.S. and Canada. ""Irv created many of the company practices and values still in play today,"" Mitchell told IBD.
"
2116,MCD,"His special talent, Mitchell said, was coming up with imaginative ways to use pop culture and current events to sell ice cream. Beyond the Beatles, examples included Lunar Cheesecake for the first moon landing of 1969 and Baseball Nut, which celebrated the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles in 1958.
"
2117,MCD,"""He was famous for saying, and we quote him often, 'We don't just sell ice cream; we sell fun,'"" said Mitchell.
"
2118,MCD,"Canadian Start
"
2119,MCD,"Robbins (1917-2008) was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. When he was five, his father, a Russian immigrant named Aaron, moved the family to Tacoma, Wash., and opened an ice-cream shop, where Irv worked as a young man. He then attended the University of Washington and joined the Army during World War II, serving as a staff sergeant in California.
"
2120,MCD,"When he left the service, Robbins aimed to go into business for himself and replicate the fun atmosphere of his father's store.
"
2121,MCD,"So he opened a shop called Snowbird in Glendale, Calif.
"
2122,MCD,"Ice cream had been delighting people for centuries before Robbins made it his mission.
"
2123,MCD,"Laura Weiss' book ""Ice Cream: A Global History"" traces the dessert from a liquidlike sherbet created by Arabs in medieval times to the frozen sorbetto beloved by Italians in the 17th century.
"
2124,MCD,"American colonists were familiar with ice cream, and Thomas Jefferson had a particular taste for it.
"
2125,MCD,"In 1852, a Philadelphia woman named Nancy Johnson received a patent for a mechanical ice cream maker, and a decade later Baltimore native Jacob Fussell became the first to produce ice cream on a big scale, with factories scattered along the East Coast.
"
2126,MCD,"Americans continued to push the ice-cream envelope, coming up with cones, sundaes and frozen novelties, such as ice cream sandwiches.
"
2127,MCD,"But some things didn't change, Weiss wrote, despite the effort of Howard Johnson. The entrepreneur glumly told the New York Times that he'd developed ""scores of flavors, and yet most people still say, 'I'll take vanilla.'""
"
2128,MCD,"Robbins, who wanted to change that, offered 21 flavors at Snowbird. He then teamed up with Burt Baskin, who'd married Irv's sister Shirley. Baskin owned Burton's Ice Cream Shop in Pasadena.
"
2129,MCD,"By 1949, they had over 40 stores between them and four years later changed the company title to Baskin-Robbins. The name order was determined by a coin flip.
"
2130,MCD,"With the help of advertising agency Carson/Roberts, they devised an image full of color — brown and pink for chocolate and cherries — and polka dots that evoked the circus. A 31 was added to the logo to remind customers they could choose one unique flavor for every day of the month. The marketing of Baskin-Robbins ""connected ice cream with happiness. It reinforced the message that ice cream was all about pleasure and fun,"" said Weiss.
"
2131,MCD,"Baskin-Robbins tapped into several trends in American society, Weiss added: After World War II, customers had ""bottled-up demand"" for ice cream. During the war, ice cream had been reserved for troops. Once the shooting stopped, sales of the treat, along with cones and novelties, went ""through the roof.""
"
2132,MCD,"As the company grew, Robbins was one of the first to recognize how powerful a tool franchising could be, Mitchell said.
"
2133,MCD,"""Sure, they were focused on the fun, but they approached it with an attitude of 'The more ice cream we sell, the more money we make,' "" he said. ""That was the message to the franchisees.""
"
2134,MCD,"Baskin-Robbins wasn't the first restaurant chain to franchise. But the firm's success with the model inspired others, including Ray Kroc of McDonald's (MCD).
"
2135,MCD,"Robbins brought his own touch to the method by signing agreements with dairy providers such as Alpenrose Dairy in the Northwest and Klinke Bros. Ice Cream Co. in the South. The pacts governed such details as the delivery-truck temperatures and the thickness of the truck walls, which Robbins would personally inspect, Mitchell says.
"
2136,MCD,"On Top Of It
"
2137,MCD,"Robbins is lauded for his creativity with flavors, Mitchell notes, but his obsession with quality, especially for suppliers, was also paramount.
"
2138,MCD,"One such supplier, John Klinke, was a Tennessee dairyman in the 1960s when a friend told him about a cool company called Baskin-Robbins. It was Robbins' personality and drive that convinced Klinke, then a part of a buying group called Dixie's Dairy, to sign on.
"
2139,MCD,"Robbins grasped that the only way Baskin-Robbins could make it big was to bolster the franchises, Klinke told IBD. ""The main thing was to take care of every franchisee and see that they're profitable,"" he said.
"
2140,MCD,"The supplier Klinke Bros. and franchisees have stuck for decades with Baskin-Robbins, whose stores are 100% owned by their operators, says Mitchell.
"
2141,MCD,"Robbins believed that local franchises helped customers develop a personal connection to the stores, just as coming up with of-the-moment flavors connected the ice cream to what was going on in their lives. And franchisees' stake in the success of their stores flowed back to the corporation.
"
2142,MCD,"Many of them were motivated by work ethic at the top, said Mitchell. Robbins was an example of ""that interesting breed of having a passion for what you do, and you don't look at the watch to get it done.""
"
2143,MCD,"Applause
"
2144,MCD,"Entrepreneur magazine has frequently put Baskin-Robbins on its list of the top franchises in America.
"
2145,MCD,"Robbins exhibited another trait that kept franchisees loyal: integrity. Said Klinke: ""He was just so honest, and he was just a really good man. He was happy doing what he was doing, making people happy. I'm proud to have known him.""
"
2146,MCD,"In a 1976 profile in People magazine, Robbins downplayed his feats: ""If I've done anything to be successful, it's that I had the ability to listen to the right people.""

2243,MCD,"Let the gobbling begin. Turkey Day signals tasty sales, and service with a smile sticks to shoppers' ribs.• Wine and dine.  Capturing consumer interest isn't enough. Businesses must offer a great experience to keep them coming back.That's one takeaway from a recent survey by Tenet Partners, a brand innovation and marketing consultancy. ""More than half of consumers surveyed said they stopped using a brand because of poor service,"" Tenet CEO Hampton Bridwell told IBD.• Be gracious. The study looked at brand performance for Apple (AAPL) Best Buy (BBY), J.C. Penney (JCP), McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Target (TGT), Verizon (VZ) and Wendy's (WEN).It takes time, money and effort to build a good name, ""but it's all wasted whenever a customer encounters bad service,"" Bridwell said.Being helpful, knowledgeable and caring increases a brand's value to consumers. ""This is especially important to keep in mind during the holiday season, as employees and customers are stressed and impatient,"" Bridwell said.• Serve it up. There's no more harried day than Black Friday.""Many shoppers set up their day as a mission,"" said Kevin Leifer, vice president with customer service consultancy ICC/Decision Services. Make it easier by putting deals front and center, instead of burying them in the store's back.• Fill the table. More retailers are slashing prices beyond Black Friday. Those planning door-buster specials are wise to offer alternatives for items in short supply. Some big boxes like Wal-Mart (WMT) guarantee product availability during specific sale times, and offer to ship the product for free when on-site supplies run out. Not every retailer can follow through like that, but ""let's have a prepared list of options,"" Leifer said.• Manage expectations. If quantities are limited, say so in ads.You might make a few customers happy with a rare deal, but ""you're disappointing far more than you're satisfying,"" Leifer said.• Make it clear. Be precise about pricing. Customers get annoyed trying to guess what the deal is — or finding out the numbers are different at the register. ""You want to be completely transparent for your customers,"" Leifer said.• Mind manners. Teach employees — especially newbies helping out at holidays time — how to treat shoppers. ""You can't forget the basics of customer interaction,"" Leifer said. ""Every one of those touch points, that is the brand.""• Keep good company.  Smart retailers employ the cream of the crop. ""You're hiring for attitude, not skills. If an applicant doesn't smile during the job interview, don't hire him."" So advised John Tschohl, customer service expert and author of ""Moving Up.""• Chat them up. ""This is your chance to make a hell of a first impression,"" said Tschohl.Teach workers to introduce themselves and address customers by name. Doing so makes the experience more personable.""You cannot own the customer only on price. There are too many options out there,"" he said. ""People buy relationships.""• Solve sticky situations. Give frontline workers tools to keep cool when tempers flare. ""Most employees have never been trained to handle irate customers,"" Tschohl said. Empower staff to make decisions in the moment.Then back them up.""The number one reason people will not use empowerment is because they know in their hearts they will lose their jobs,"" Tschohl said.• End with gratitude. ""It does not take extra time,"" said Tschohl, ""to smile and say: 'Thank you for coming.'""

It also means the company competes with a host of other burger chains, from fast food giants such as McDonald's (MCD) and Burger King Worldwide (BKW) to regional chains like In-N-Out Burger, Whataburger and Five Guys.
"
2261,MCD,"""There are a lot of different burger chains out there — you can find a burger every place you turn,"" said analyst Robert Derrington, who follows the restaurant industry for Wunderlich Securities. ""Do we have too many restaurants? Absolutely. Do we have the right types of restaurants? I would say no.""

2262,MCD,"Habit may be the right type of restaurant, he says, for a few reasons.
"
2263,MCD,"""They seem to be a very viable and differentiated player,"" Derrington told IBD. ""They have reasonable price points.

"
2267,MCD,"Habit looks to differentiate itself from the rest of the field by ""combining the quality, convenience and hospitality commonly associated with our casual dining and fast casual competitors at a price point that is below the low end of the average range of the fast casual segment.""
"
2268,MCD,"Habit's average customer spent $7.56 for the 52 weeks ended Sept. 30. In contrast, Chipotle has an average check of $13 to $15, according to news and industry reports.
"
2269,MCD,"Habit would not say how rising food costs might affect its prices.
"
2270,MCD,"Instead, it noted that as a percentage of revenue, food and paper costs rose from 32.4% in the 26 weeks ended June 25, 2013, to 33% in the corresponding period a year earlier.
"
2271,MCD,"""This increase was primarily driven by food cost inflation, with increases in protein and dairy costs, and was partially offset by lower produce costs,"" Habit said.
"
2272,MCD,"The company logged revenue of $120 million in 2013, up from $84 million the prior year and $28 million as recently as 2009. According to its S-1 filing, it recorded net income of $5.8 million in 2013, a gain of 88% from a year earlier.
"
2273,MCD,"Much of the company's growth is due to its rapid expansion. At the end of 2009, it had 26 restaurants in three California markets. As of Aug. 25, it had 98 restaurants in 10 markets in four states.
"
2274,MCD,"Habit opened 22 restaurants in 2013 and expects this year's openings will total between 23 and 25. In 2015, it expects to open 26 to 28 new restaurants.
"
2275,MCD,"""We plan to balance our growth between existing and new markets, with the majority of new restaurants expected to open in existing markets in 2014 and 2015,"" the company said.
"
2276,MCD,"In August, Habit opened its first location on the East Coast with a restaurant in New Jersey. The company said it is in the ""early stages of our growth story, and estimate(s), based on our internal analysis, a total restaurant potential in the U.S. in excess of 2,000 locations.""
"
2277,MCD,"That's a pretty big leap from the current lineup. But analyst Derrington says Habit is off to a good start under the leadership of CEO Russell Bendel.

2278,MCD,"""They have a pretty good track record of building traffic,"" Derrington said. ""I can see how this management team could continue to grow and evolve the business.""It's not like the U.S. has a shortage of burger joints. Walk a few blocks in any direction, and you'll probably stumble across one.That doesn't necessarily mean there are too many. If there were, Habit Restaurants (HABT) might not have made such a big splash on Wall Street last week with its initial public offering.Habit operates fast casual restaurants under the Habit Burger Grill name, mostly in California. It specializes in freshly prepared, made-to-order char-grilled burgers, sandwiches, salads, shakes and malts.The IPO priced at 18, above the expected range of 14 to 16. The stock raced out of the gate in its first day of trading Thursday, opening on the Nasdaq at 30 and closing up 32% at 39.54 — though it has given back some gains amid profit-taking and currently trades near 30.Habit sold 5.75 million shares and raised $92.4 million in the IPO, which included full exercise of an underwriter overallotment option of 750,000 shares, it said Tuesday.The Habit IPO amounted to another impressive stock market debut involving fast casual chains after El Pollo Loco Holdings (LOCO) and Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES) earlier this year.What Do Investors Crave?One difference is that while Habit is known for its burgers, the others specialize in different fare — Mediterranean food for Zoe's and Mexican for El Pollo Loco. They join other fast casual chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) (tacos and burritos) and Panera Bread (PNRA) (sandwiches, salads and soup) that specialize in something other than burgers.Habit's focus on burgers doesn't just put it up against other fast-casual chains.

"
2307,MCD,"It has embraced technology by offering high-speed Internet service in its stores and mobile payment apps. It incorporated music retailing into its coffee shops with its Hear Music brand. It developed ancillary products that include everything from coffee makers and bean grinders to flavored syrups.

2338,MCD,"The world looked a bit flat from a market standpoint early Tuesday, with global markets and commodities largely unmoved and stock futures steering the U.S. market toward a mixed open.Dow futures were down 65.4 points, with IBM (IBM) pulling hard to the downside. S&P 500 futures were off a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 5.4 points.The focal point of the stock market today. Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo (YHOO) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also report after the close, as do a number of leading stocks, including Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Illumina (ILMN) and GoPro (GPRO).The economic calendar is blank Tuesday, but big names in motion after early earnings reports included Verizon (VZ) (down 2%), Travelers (TRV) (up 2%), Lockheed Martin (LMT) (unchanged) and United Technologies (UTX) (down 4%).IBM dragged 5% lower after reporting its Q2 earnings beat but revenue fell slightly more than analysts had expected. It was the tech giant's 13th straight quarter of declining revenue, and profit margins in its software division — the source of about half the company's profit — narrowed during the quarter. IBM shares have been in a gradual uptrend since January, fighting to climb out of a 10-month consolidation.Tesla Motors (TSLA) slumped nearly 4% ahead of the open. The stock may have been nicked by a UBS downgrade to sell, in a note that reportedly questioned the company's battery storage and auto delivery targets. Shares rose almost 3% in strong trade Monday. The stock is extended after a rebound from 10-week support and above a 258.85 cup-with-handle buy point.India-based software engineer Infosys (INFY) surged 12%. The country's second largest software developer reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year revenue guidance above consensus expectations.Management said the company signed six contracts during the quarter with a total value of $688 million. Infosys has been consolidating sine February and battling to retake its 10-week line of support for the past five weeks.The dollar was mixed and commodities were generally flat. Mining stocks, which had dragged hard on the S&P 500 on Monday, were rebounding, with Agnico Eagle (AEM), Barrick Gold (ABX), Yamana Gold (AUY) and Newmont Mining (NEM) posting solid premarket gains.

2339,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to post another quarter of strong financial growth when it reports Q1 results before the open Thursday, as the fast-casual restaurant chain continues to wow Wall Street with its ability to expand rapidly while still cooking up robust returns.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Denver-based company to report EPS of $2.85, up 21% from the prior year. If that happens, it would continue a years-long run of double-digit increases on the bottom line.Sales for the quarter are seen rising 20% to $873.08 million, which would also continue a years-long run of double-digit gains.Chipotle has managed to deliver consistently strong financial gains even as it executes an aggressive expansion strategy that saw it open 185 restaurants in 2013, bringing its year-end total to 1,595.It plans to open another 180 to 195 locations this year. The vast majority of stores are in the U.S., though Chipotle also has a smattering of locations in Europe and Canada.The company has said it has plenty of room to add more Chipotles in the U.S. Still, it has looked for other growth opportunities as well via its ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen concept and its investment in Pizzeria Locale, a fast-casual pizza business.During its 2013 fourth quarter, Chipotle logged earnings of $2.53 a share, up 30% from a year earlier and a penny above estimates. Sales rose 21% to $844.1 million, also above views.Same-store sales climbed a whopping 9.3%, far oupacing other leading restaurant stocks.Among other big names, McDonald's (MCD) reported a 1.4% decline in Q4 comps at U.S. stores. Starbucks (SBUX) logged a 5% global same-store sales gain for its fiscal first quarter ended in December, while Panera Bread (PNRA) reported a systemwide gain of 1.1% in comparable net bakery-cafe sales during its Q4.Chipotle shares fell slightly to 566.30 in early trading in the stock market.

2342,MCD,"A new report on the restaurant industry shows a sharp rise in the number of Americans dining out vs. prior years and a slight increase in customer satisfaction, with eateries run by Darden Restaurants (DRI) and others rating high in their respective categories.
"
2343,MCD,"According to the 2014 American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) report, released today, Tuesday, Americans ate out an average of four meals per week last year, a 60% increase since the end of the Great Recession.

2359,MCD,"Now you see it, now you don't.
"
2360,MCD,"The main feature of Snapchat is that the photos you send to friends through the app disappear 10 seconds after they're received. That makes people more comfortable sending shots they might not want friends, family or others to keep.
"
2361,MCD,"Many people see it as a more private alternative to a site like Facebook (FB) or Facebook-owned photo-sharing app Instagram.
"
2362,MCD,"Snapchat became better known after it rejected a reported $3 billion buyout bid by Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, in November. Just three months later, Facebook reached a deal to buy text-messaging service WhatsApp for an astounding $19 billion.
"
2363,MCD,"Venice, Calif.-based Snapchat's chutzpah in rejecting Facebook's offer is being put to the test. Incidents over the past few months have put the privacy of Snapchat in question. These include:
"
2364,MCD,"A mid-November child pornography scandal in Montreal, in which teenage boys reportedly were snapping pictures of 13- to 15-year-old girls in sexual poses, and telling them the pictures would disappear. Instead, the boys took screenshots of the photos and transmitted the photos to others.
"
2365,MCD," A New Year's Eve incident in which, reportedly, hackers broke into Snapchat's servers and gathered more than 4 million phone numbers and user names.
"
2366,MCD," A recent vulnerability uncovered by a Spanish researcher, who showed a Los Angeles Times reporter how the Snapchat app can be used by hackers to slow, or even freeze, activity on users' phones.
"
2367,MCD,"Snapchat responded to two of these incidents. A week after the New Year's leak, the company rolled out a security fix that lets users opt out of its ""Find Friends"" feature, which was how these data could be collected. It apologized.
"
2368,MCD,"On the phone-freeze incident, Snapchat spokeswoman Mary Ritti says the firm implemented a fix when it learned of the problem.
"
2369,MCD,"""We believe this has resolved the issue. To the best of our knowledge no users were impacted,"" she said.
"
2370,MCD,"The first incident was reported shortly after news surfaced of Snapchat's Facebook offer and rejection. It also was widely reported that Google (GOOG) offered $4 billion for the firm. Snapchat and Google declined comment on the reports.
"
2371,MCD,"Snapchat is popular among teens and young adults, a group that seems to be leaving Facebook.
"
2372,MCD,"Research firm iStrategyLabs has found that since 2011, Facebook has lost more than 25% of its audience in the 13-17 age range and 7.5% of its 18-24 audience. Facebook CFO David Ebersman, in an October earnings conference call with analysts, acknowledged a drop in daily use among teens.
"
2373,MCD,"Mira Silveira, a California 13-year-old who uses Snapchat, backs up this survey. ""My friends don't use Facebook,"" she said. ""Only old people use Facebook; you know, people who are 30-plus.""
"
2374,MCD,"Snapchat doesn't release its user data, but an October survey by Pew Research Center found that 26% of respondents age 18 to 29 reported using Snapchat, compared with just 5% for respondents age 30 to 49, 3% 50-64 and 2% 65-plus.
"
2375,MCD,"Whether Facebook has instead found a way into the teen market with its WhatsApp purchase is unclear. WhatsApp doesn't have demographic data on its users.
"
2376,MCD,"Snapchat was founded in 2011, originally as Picaboo. The Pew study indicates that 9% of U.S. cellphone owners are using Snapchat, which translates to nearly 30 million users. By contrast, 18% of respondents in the Pew survey said they used Instagram.
"
2377,MCD,"Snapchat confirms that its customers share 400 million messages daily through the app. Instagram says 55 million photos are shared per day on the site. So, while Instagram has more users, people on Snapchat seem to be sharing more photos, at least in the U.S.
"
2378,MCD,"Facebook Offer 'Way Too High'
"
2379,MCD,"But some observers question whether Snapchat will continue to attract users in the wake of the privacy and hacking incidents, and whether it was worth the $3 billion Facebook offered.
"
2380,MCD,"""Before the scandals, I thought the valuation was way too high,"" says marketing professor Larry Chiagouris of Pace University in New York. ""Now there's no doubt in my mind it was too high.

2381,MCD,"""There are other issues besides privacy, not the least of which is the business model. How do they end up providing some value-added service to advertisers?""
"
2382,MCD,"Some big brands are using Snapchat, for free. They include McDonald's (MCD), Taco Bell, Acura, Seventeen Magazine, Mashable, Intel (INTC) and sports teams. NBC's ""The Voice"" this month unveiled Chris Martin as its new judge exclusively on Snapchat, a company spokeswoman says. But the firm doesn't charge for ads.
"
2383,MCD,"The brands are trying to strengthen their presence among Snapchat users, often on a part of the app called Snapchat Stories. This feature lets users share collections of photos, which remain available for 24 hours, not just 10 seconds.
"
2384,MCD,"""Basically, it is very difficult for brands to get users to download their own branded app and engage on a regular basis,"" said Forrester Research analyst Julie Ask. ""Brands need to advertise and engage consumers on third-party platforms like Snapchat, WeChat, WhatsApp, LINE and KakaoTalk, places where consumers spend a lot of minutes each week.

"
2386,MCD,"Snapchat has attracted investors, raising more than $123 million since launching in 2011.

"
2392,MCD,"THE BUZZ
"
2393,MCD,"Busy lifestyles among U.S. diners have boosted the appeal of home delivery or quick pickup food orders. With little time to cook at home or even dine out, consumers are looking for a broader and more diversified choice of cuisine and menu items.
"
2394,MCD,"This has made online food ordering platforms such as GrubHub (GRUB) all the more attractive.
"
2395,MCD,"GrubHub provides a Web and mobile platform for restaurant pickup and delivery orders. The company charges the restaurant a per-order commission.
"
2396,MCD,"GrubHub not only helps satisfy consumer taste, but also lets independent restaurants boost revenue and compete more effectively against large chains.
"
2397,MCD,"GrubHub on Tuesday raised the proposed deal size for its upcoming IPO. The Chicago-based company would raise $176 million by offering 7 million shares if it prices at the high end of the new range of 23 to 25. The previous price range was 20 to 22. At the midpoint of the updated range, the offering would raise $169 million and value the company at $1.88 billion.
"
2398,MCD,"THE COMPANY
"
2399,MCD,"GrubHub was founded in 2004 and merged with rival Seamless in August 2013. Using GrubHub.com or the firm's Apple (AAPL) iPhone or Google (GOOG) Android mobile apps, diners enter their delivery address and are presented with menus of restaurants that provide takeout.
"
2400,MCD,"The interface can also show which menu items are particularly popular. Once customers place an order through the website or app, GrubHub transmits that to the restaurant through an online process.
"
2401,MCD,"GrubHub says it has created the largest transaction marketplace for independent restaurants to boost their pickup and delivery sales without their making significant upfront investments.
"
2402,MCD,"""We connect local restaurants with hungry diners in more than 600 cities across the United States and are focused on transforming the takeout experience,"" the company said in its S-1 IPO prospectus filing.
"
2403,MCD,"GrubHub says its platform provides diners with a direct line into the kitchen, avoiding the inefficiencies, inaccuracies and frustrations associated with paper menus and phone orders.
"
2404,MCD,"OpenTable (OPEN) similarly streamlined the process of making restaurant reservations, using an online platform. That company went public five years ago at 20 a share and now trades near 77.
"
2405,MCD,"GrubHub is used mainly by independent restaurants, which account for 61% of the U.S. market, according to Euromonitor International. The research firm says Americans spent $204 billion in 2012 at those 350,000 independent restaurants, which total 350,000.
"
2406,MCD,"GrubHub estimates that $67 billion was spent on takeout at those establishments in 2012.
"
2407,MCD,"As of last December, 28,800 restaurants used the GrubHub platform. Its primary markets are Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
"
2408,MCD,"Elizabeth Friend, a food service analyst with Euromonitor, said in a report on GrubHub this month that its prospects are strong.
"
2409,MCD,"""Domestic interest in delivery is still growing, and the company has a very long way to go before nearing saturation, even in key cities,"" she wrote.
"
2410,MCD,"RISK/CHALLENGES
"
2411,MCD,"The online food ordering business is increasingly competitive. GrubHub rivals include Eat24, Delivery.com and DoorDash.
"
2412,MCD,"In her GrubHub report, Friend said, ""Even fast food is finally recognizing the potential for delivery demand in the U.S., with Burger King (BKW) testing the service in 2013 and McDonald's (MCD) reportedly considering adding it in the future.""
"
2413,MCD,"GrubHub, in its prospectus, said risks include failing to retain its existing restaurants and diners or to add more restaurants and diners in a cost-effective way. The growth of its business depends on maintaining a strong brand identity. In addition, any failure by restaurants to maintain their service levels could harm its business.
"
2414,MCD,"THE RESULTS
"
2415,MCD,"GrubHub generates revenue primarily when diners place an order on its platform. Restaurants pay a commission, typically a percentage of the transaction.
"
2416,MCD,"For 2013, GrubHub reported revenue of $137.1 million, up 67% from 2012, with net income of $6.7 million. In Q4 of 2013, it reported revenue of $49 million, up 125% from the same quarter a year earlier .
"
2417,MCD,"GrubHub says it has the largest takeout platform, with $1.3 billion in combined gross food sales ordered through it in 2013, up from $871 million in 2012.
"
2418,MCD,"It says 3.4 million active diners on its platform place about 135,000 orders per day. That's up from 2.3 million active users and 93,600 orders placed daily in 2012.
"
2419,MCD,"USE OF PROCEEDS
"

2440,MCD,"Ticker: GRUBTHE BUZZBusy lifestyles among U.S. diners have boosted the appeal of home delivery or quick pickup food orders. With little time to cook at home or even dine out, consumers are looking for a broader and more diversified choice of cuisine and menu items.This has made online food ordering platforms such as GrubHub (GRUB) all the more attractive.GrubHub provides a Web and mobile platform for restaurant pickup and delivery orders. The company charges the restaurant a per-order commission.GrubHub not only helps satisfy consumer taste, but also lets independent restaurants boost revenue and compete more effectively against large chains.GrubHub on Tuesday raised the proposed deal size for its upcoming IPO. The Chicago-based company would raise $176 million by offering 7 million shares if it prices at the high end of the new range of 23 to 25. The previous price range was 20 to 22. At the midpoint of the updated range, the offering would raise $169 million and value the company at $1.88 billion.THE COMPANYGrubHub was founded in 2004 and merged with rival Seamless in August 2013. Using GrubHub.com or the firm's Apple (AAPL) iPhone or Google (GOOG) Android mobile apps, diners enter their delivery address and are presented with menus of restaurants that provide takeout.The interface can also show which menu items are particularly popular. Once customers place an order through the website or app, GrubHub transmits that to the restaurant through an online process.GrubHub says it has created the largest transaction marketplace for independent restaurants to boost their pickup and delivery sales without their making significant upfront investments.""We connect local restaurants with hungry diners in more than 600 cities across the United States and are focused on transforming the takeout experience,"" the company said in its S-1 IPO prospectus filing.GrubHub says its platform provides diners with a direct line into the kitchen, avoiding the inefficiencies, inaccuracies and frustrations associated with paper menus and phone orders.OpenTable (OPEN) similarly streamlined the process of making restaurant reservations, using an online platform. That company went public five years ago at 20 a share and now trades near 77.GrubHub is used mainly by independent restaurants, which account for 61% of the U.S. market, according to Euromonitor International. The research firm says Americans spent $204 billion in 2012 at those 350,000 independent restaurants, which total 350,000.GrubHub estimates that $67 billion was spent on takeout at those establishments in 2012.As of last December, 28,800 restaurants used the GrubHub platform. Its primary markets are Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.Elizabeth Friend, a food service analyst with Euromonitor, said in a report on GrubHub this month that its prospects are strong.""Domestic interest in delivery is still growing, and the company has a very long way to go before nearing saturation, even in key cities,"" she wrote.RISK/CHALLENGESThe online food ordering business is increasingly competitive. GrubHub rivals include Eat24, Delivery.com and DoorDash.In her GrubHub report, Friend said, ""Even fast food is finally recognizing the potential for delivery demand in the U.S., with Burger King (BKW) testing the service in 2013 and McDonald's (MCD) reportedly considering adding it in the future.""GrubHub, in its prospectus, said risks include failing to retain its existing restaurants and diners or to add more restaurants and diners in a cost-effective way. The growth of its business depends on maintaining a strong brand identity. In addition, any failure by restaurants to maintain their service levels could harm its business.THE RESULTSGrubHub generates revenue primarily when diners place an order on its platform. Restaurants pay a commission, typically a percentage of the transaction.For 2013, GrubHub reported revenue of $137.1 million, up 67% from 2012, with net income of $6.7 million. In Q4 of 2013, it reported revenue of $49 million, up 125% from the same quarter a year earlier .GrubHub says it has the largest takeout platform, with $1.3 billion in combined gross food sales ordered through it in 2013, up from $871 million in 2012.It says 3.4 million active diners on its platform place about 135,000 orders per day. That's up from 2.3 million active users and 93,600 orders placed daily in 2012.USE OF PROCEEDSGrubHub expects to receive net proceeds from its IPO of $87.3 million, based on an IPO price of 24 per share, the midpoint of the price range.If the underwriters exercise an option to purchase additional shares in full, GrubHub estimates net proceeds would be $105 million.

2441,MCD,"Shares of fast food giant Yum Brands (YUM) were down Wednesday after Wells Fargo lowered its price target to $73-$75 from $75-$78, citing a resurgence of avian flu in China.The parent of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell sold off hard last year amid an outbreak of avian flu that caused fears among Chinese consumers of tainted chicken at KFC outlets.Yum gets more than 50% of its revenue from China, and the stock had already taken a pounding this month after its Pizza Hut division's same-store sales fell in December.Prospects for recovery brightened when it was upgraded by RBC Capital Markets to ""top pick,"" a notch above ""outperform,"" on Jan. 7. RBC also raised its price target to $87 from $85, saying it expected sales in China to rise in the second half of the year as avian flu fears subsided.But Wells Fargo said in its client note Wednesday that recent reports indicated at least 95 cases of the H7N9 avian flu strain had been found in China this month vs. 144 for all of 2013.The note projected ""at least a modest avian flu head wind"" impacting Yum earnings results, but the analysts kept their market perform rating on the stock.The report may also raise red flags for McDonald's (MCD), which sells chicken products at outlets in China.Yum, which will release Q4 results Feb. 3, saw its shares drop 2.6% on the stock market today. McDonald's was off 1%.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

2442,MCD,"Shares of Del Frisco's Restaurant Group (DFRG) set another new high in the stock market today, continuing a run-up that has seen the operator of upscale steakhouses and other eateries rise by nearly half over the past five months.Del Frisco, based in Southlake, Texas, operates restaurants under the Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, Sullivan's Steakhouse and Del Frisco's Grille names. Its stock price climbed to a record high of 27.15 in Wednesday afternoon trading, after setting an all-time closing high of 26.75 on Tuesday.The company has run off nine straight quarters of double-digit revenue growth, though its bottom-line performance has been a little shakier. Over the last five quarters, Del Frisco has reported lower EPS three times and flat EPS once.The company did produce a decent gain during the 2013 fourth quarter — growing year-over-year earnings 16% to 36 cents a share — though that was below views for 38 cents.""Quarterly results fell short of our expectations due to a combination of factors — inefficiencies at four newly opened Grille restaurants, slightly later new restaurant openings within the quarter, lower operating leverage on the 17th week than we had anticipated, and weather issues during our very profitable holiday season,"" CEO Mark Mednansky said in a release.On the upside, revenue for the quarter climbed 21% to $97.5 million, the biggest gain since the March 2012 quarter. Comparable restaurant sales increased 2.8%.At the end of 2013, Del Frisco's owned and operated 40 restaurants in 20 states and Washington, D.C. These included 10 Del Frisco's units, 19 Sullivan's units, and 11 Del Frisco's Grille locations.Analysts expect the company to grow its restaurant count substantially in coming years.""We see DFRG as an under-the-radar unit growth story that should receive a more appropriate valuation as new units continue to outperform and the company's exposure to a higher end consumer produces steady results,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh noted in a report.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Del Frisco's to grow annual earnings 11% this year and 21% in 2015.The company has a high IBD Composite Rating of 96, out of a possible 99. It is part of IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, which ranks No. 48 among 197 industries tracked by IBD. The only two higher-rated names in the group are fast-casual Mexican restaurant operators Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI).Not a lot of the stocks in the group cater to the upscale dining space. One of them that does — Ruth's Hospitality Group (RUTH), owner of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain — has delivered robust EPS growth in recent quarters, though sales growth has decelerated or been flat the last four quarters.The group's largest name by market cap is McDonald's (MCD).

BMO Capital Markets on Tuesday downgraded its rating from outperform (buy) to market perform (neutral). The bank cited what it considers Tyson's high valuation. Tyson stock has risen about 56% from a low of 27.33 on Nov. 4.On the company's first-quarter earnings call in late January, CEO Donnie Smith cautioned that Tyson faces headwinds this year.Smith told analysts that although consumers are becoming less defensive in spending, ""I don't know of anyone who thinks that consumers will go back to their pre-2008 spending habits any time soon.""Investors will look for clues on current pricing trends in the company's earnings report.""Record high beef prices should continue through 2014,"" offsetting lower consumption, Smith said earlier this year. ""Pork prices will also remain high due to lower supply. Chicken should continue to be the winner.""Allianz Global Investors analyst Bryan Agbabian said in a report Wednesday that Tyson is a solid play on the increase in demand for chickens in the U.S. and globally, especially in China, the world's largest consumer market.""Tyson is developing an in-country, in-China integrated production of chicken so that Tyson can then sell to not only the local market there, but also to the U.S.-based restaurants that are doing business there such as (Yum Brands (YUM)-owned) Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's (MCD),"" Agbabian said in the report.Tyson shares were up nearly 1% in Friday afternoon trading in the stock market.

2489,MCD,"Although investors worry about less-robust growth in China, several U.S. corporate giants hailed Q1 demand in the world's second-largest economy.China has proven to be a strong engine for Apple (AAPL), with its new partner China Mobile (CHL) helping push fiscal Q2 iPhone sales to more than 43 million, far more than expected. The $9.2 billion that China added to Apple's coffers comprised nearly 25% of the company's total quarterly revenue, up 13% from a year earlier.Caterpillar (CAT), the giant construction-equipment manufacturer, has struggled with a global commodity slump that's hit mining-equipment demand. Overall sales were flat — actually ending a five-quarter decline.But China sales rose 30% vs. a year earlier. CEO Doug Oberhelman credits increased dealer deliveries and the favorable impact of dealer inventory changes.Economic growth in China of around 7.5% this year ""should support improvements in the machine industry and increase commodity demand.""Yum! Brands (YUM), parent of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurant chains, says that its China-division sales grew 17% year over year, with restaurant margins increasingly almost 7% and operating profit up 80%. Yum adds that it expects to open at least 700 restaurants in China this year.The company is seeing improvement from a year earlier, when a chicken health scare scared jittery diners and investors. CEO David Novak cited KFC in China as ""the most significant driver"" of Yum's strong bounce back in the first quarter.Global casino giant Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped Q1 forecasts Thursday, with strong growth in earnings and revenue driven in part by Sands Macau, its majority-owned unit in China's gaming mecca. Sands Macau revenue climbed 35%, and net income rose 66%. More than 17 million visits to its Macau facilities during Q1 delivered a record $939.8 million of adjusted property EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), said CEO Sheldon Adelson in a statement.Starbucks (SBUX) saw net revenues in its China/Asia-Pacific region grow 24% year over year to $265.3 million during its fiscal Q2, driven in part by nearly 700 stores opening over the past year. Comparable store sales were up 7%.United Technologies (UTX) says that new equipment orders at its Otis Elevator unit increased 9% from Q1 '13, led by 27% growth in China.McDonald's (MCD), which reports lackluster Q1 earnings — blamed on lower U.S. same-store sales and unusually severe winter weather throughout much of the United States — still reports solid sales in China. Comparable sales grew 6.6% for the first quarter, and McDonald's plans to open 300 new restaurants there this year.

2490,MCD,"Bucking the trend of a stagnant industry, fast-casual restaurants are sizzling with tasty food, growing sales, customers and locations.

The entire restaurant sector is expected to grow barely, less than 1% annually during the next nine years. But…
"
2491,MCD,"Saucer bases and cup bases have as much in common as, well, saucers and cups.The saucer is usually longer and shallower than the cup, correcting about 12% to 30% and forming over a period of seven weeks to a year or more. Cups can run as deep as 40%-50% in bear markets and can also take a year or more to form, though most are much shorter and less deep. Both patterns can also form handles.Saucers are often shaped by big-cap stocks, which tend to be slower moving and less volatile than their smaller, high-growth counterparts. Saucers can also form during periods when the general market moves sideways. Their longer, shallower profile makes them difficult to recognize.In some cases, saucer bases can be so long that they're only visible on a weekly or monthly chart.Regardless of the size, investors should focus on stocks with strong fundamental and technical characteristics — with one exception: While top stocks should have Relative Price Strength Ratings of 85 or higher at the breakout, a saucer base's RS Rating can be much weaker. The RS Rating tracks a stock's price progress over 12 months, which penalizes those that form long bases.Investors tracking a stock forming a saucer base must have patience, because it takes longer to shake out the weak holders. By contrast, cup bases shake out weak investors more quickly because the correction is shorter and tends to feel sharper.Those who wait out a saucer base have to stay vigilant. When the pattern is completed and the market shifts into a confirmed uptrend, a strong dose of buying can send the stock out of the saucer and produce a powerful breakout. Stocks should clear their buy points in volume that's at least 40% above normal.Mega-cap stock McDonald's (MCD) formed a 20-week saucer with handle starting in early December 2010. The correction ran 11% deep. The buy point was 78.51, or 10 cents above the narrow handle's 78.41 high. It cleared the buy point in higher weekly trade. Another valid entry came when it exceeded the left side's high of 80.94 in mid-May.Its Relative Strength Rating was just 43, but its EPS Rating was a respectable 84. Profit and sales growth were accelerating at the time of the breakout.McDonald's rose 32% to 102.22 by mid-January 2012 before correcting to form a new base.

"
2518,MCD,"2014: A Look Back And AheadThe top of Chipotle Mexican Grill 's (CMG) menu could easily headline a tasty strategy:Keep it simple.Such is the way co-CEO Monty Moran steers his firm to the top of the fast-casual restaurant segment.""It's simple, really,"" he told IBD. ""Better-quality food tastes better, and really great people make better food and provide a better customer experience.""Its menu is simple. So is its restaurant format, making it easy for patrons to get served fast when lines stretch out the door.It's hard to believe that Chipotle is still in the early stages of growth, but that's exactly the case. It operates about 1,600 restaurants in America, with a small presence internationally — in Canada, England, France and Germany.That domestic focus will continue in 2014, with the firm planning to open 180 to 195 units. ""There's room for thousands more restaurants in the U.S.,"" Moran said.Moran is looking at 2014 the same way he's looked at every year since he was appointed to the post by founder and co-CEO Steve Ells in January 2009.""There's a sense of increased optimism,"" Moran, 47, said. ""While I can't predict exactly what the economy is going to do in 2014, I know that we have loyal customers. This, along with great food and a sound unit economic model, will keep us on track regardless of what the economy is doing.""Moran has proved he's committed to changing food culture — while he's overseen a 1,000% stock shot the past five years, including a 79% advance in 2013.Digging InChipotle has shown it can execute during tough economic times. Moran pointed out that during the depths of the recession in 2008-09, the chain was the last to succumb to economic weakness and the first to benefit when the economy started to improve.""Our comps held up longer than anyone's during the last recession,"" Moran said. ""And they got stronger earlier coming out.""In 2008, when most other firms showed annual earnings declines, annual profit at Chipotle rose 11% from 2007. In 2009, annual earnings jumped 67%.In 2014, the company is expected to open more ShopHouse SouthEast Asian Kitchen locations. It now operates six — three in Washington, D.C., three in Los Angeles.Then there's pizza. Expect Chipotle to make noise in that arena after its recently announced partnership with Pizzeria Locale in Denver, where Chipotle is headquartered.CEOs are necessarily fixated on the bottom line, but Moran learned early on that worrying about profit doesn't generate profit.""You'll never hear me talking about profits or getting sales up,"" Moran said. ""We tell people to make great burritos and provide great restaurant experiences. The rest will take care of itself.""Chipotle's food costs are high — usually a drag for restaurants — but in 2012 annual pretax margin hit an all-time high of 16.8%.Robust sales have a lot to do with it. In October, Chipotle reported a 6.2% increase in same-store sales, beating analysts' expectations of 4.8% same-store sales growth. The company's restaurants open for at least a year average $2.1 million in sales per year.R.J. Hottovy, a senior restaurant analyst at Morningstar, thinks the fast-casual space could have another solid year in 2014: ""Chipotle is one of the more intriguing concepts to emerge out of the restaurant space over the last decade. They've pioneered and perfected the fast-casual concept, which has become the sweet spot in the industry. It's more cost-efficient to run than a casual dining location.""As Chipotle cooks up more ideas for 2014, Moran again keeps it simple: ""If you look at innovation as new menu items, new dollar menu items and value meals, we're the least innovative."" The way his company improves is via better raw ingredients, sharp cooking methods and making sure restaurant teams are the best they can be. ""The goal is to empower top-performing people to achieve high standards.""In sports, athletes' greatness is measured by how they make teammates better. So it is with Chipotle's people culture. Individual store managers, called restaurateurs, are the most important employees, said Moran: ""We evaluate our leaders based on how powerfully they make the people around them better. It's not good enough at Chipotle to be good at what you do. You have to make people better too. The goal is to create a situation where employees feel confident in their abilities and encouraged by their circumstances so they feel like they can be at their best.""Moran's way of communicating came in part from studying communications at the University of Colorado, where he graduated in 1988.Then it was on to law school at Pepperdine University in Southern California, where he graduated in 1993. Wanting to be a trial lawyer, he joined Morris Polich & Purdy in Los Angeles and zeroed in on small cases so he could develop into a prime attorney.Three years later he moved back to Colorado and joined Messner Reeves.In the meantime, Moran walked down the aisle. He and Kathy have been married 17 years and have three children.Moran rose through the Messner Reeves ranks fast, becoming a partner in just two years and CEO soon thereafter.Much of Chipotle's culture comes from Moran's experience at Messner Reeves. He was all about delegating, which helped create a stable of empowered lawyers who worked hard to satisfy clients.So how does a trial lawyer ascend to co-chief executive at one of the world's most robust restaurants?Moran and Ells were high school classmates and became friendlier during Monty's college days. Moran would catch dinner at Ells' house, where Steve served up gourmet, scrumptious food.One night he had the pleasure of trying an Ells burrito. Monty was stunned at how delicious it was and heard from his pal that he planned to open a restaurant and serve them.Moran didn't need convincing. He started doing legal work for Chipotle in the mid-1990s in the early stages of the company's expansion, mostly working on leases.On BoardChipotle was so impressive, McDonald's (MCD) expressed an interest in buying it in 1998.After making an investment in the Denver-based chain, the Big Mac team sent its general counsel, Jeff Kindler, to review Messner Reeves' legal work.Kindler and Moran hit it off. The counsel could see Moran's passion for his work and promptly sent a memo up the McDonald's chain with this recommendation: Retain Messner Reeves for all Chipotle legal work.Moran didn't forget. After Kindler's run as CEO of Pfizer (PFE), he eventually joined Chipotle's board.Finally, in March 2005, Moran accepted a position as president and chief operating officer with Ells' company and became co-CEO on Jan. 1, 2009. ""I told Steve I wasn't sure how I was qualified to be CEO,"" Moran said.Ells' answer: The position was more about Moran than the title and that he'd figure it out.Said Moran: ""I remember Steve telling me, 'Monty, the thing you're best at is leading people. The lawyer part is secondary. You lead a successful law firm with 50-60 employees. What about coming to a place with 8,000 employees?'""The challenge appealed to Moran, who shares this lesson: ""I realized that leadership was a more valuable trait than being a top-notch trial lawyer.""

"
2553,MCD,"That year he married Ethel Flemming. Marilyn was born in 1924. Kroc had two more wives, marrying Jane Green in 1963 and, six years later, Joan Beverly, who ran the Padres after he died and was a noted philanthropist.
"
2554,MCD,"By 1937, Kroc had started a company that sold the Multi-Mixers.

"
2557,MCD,"Tom Spiel, a longtime franchisee who knew Kroc for two decades, said: ""He was a man of his word. You didn't need a (big) contract to get something accomplished with Ray.""
"
2558,MCD,"Kroc put his franchisees at the forefront of his plans as he constantly asked himself, ""How can I help build their business?""
"
2559,MCD,"One way: In 1961 he stepped up training by opening Hamburger University at a prototype McDonald's in Elk Grove Village, Ill. Franchisees and operators learned the methods, policies and procedures of running a moneymaking outlet. Some 80,000 people have graduated from the program.

"
2565,MCD,"To be an entrepreneur, Kroc said, ""you have to have a large ego, enormous pride and an ability to inspire others to follow your lead.""Ray Kroc was 52 and knew this:He was just getting started.And was doing well enough. Married with a family, he was a top salesman, first of paper cups, then by exclusively distributing Multi-Mixer milkshake machines.But Kroc (1902-84) always had his business antenna up for his next big opportunity.He found it in San Bernardino, Calif., where brothers Dick and Maurice McDonald operated their popular restaurant, McDonald's.Kroc leapt — and became the founder and visionary of McDonald's Corp. (MCD)His leadership turned that one restaurant into more than 7,700 by the time of his death and made it part of the American landscape.Neck-and-neck with Subway as the biggest restaurant in the world — with more than 34,000 outlets — McDonald's had sales of $28 billion last year, with its stock on a 600% run since 2003.Kroc was so titanic, Time magazine included him in its 100 most influential people of the 20th century.""Ray Kroc's obsession with Quality, Service, Cleanliness and Value — the unwavering mission of McDonald's ... gave people a simple, casual and identifiable restaurant with friendly service, low prices, no waiting,"" wrote French chef Jacques Pepin for Time's article.In The MixAlways curious and motivated, Kroc set his sights on McDonald's in 1954. He heard the restaurant was bustling with its Multi-Mixers, so he flew out from Chicago to see what was driving their food and shake demand.Arriving in his rental car, Kroc soon saw a crowd gathering in anticipation of McDonald's 11 a.m. opening. One patron told him it was the best hamburger around, and just 15 cents.Kroc agreed as soon as he tasted one — while taking note how clean, organized and efficient the entire operation was.After a full day of observation, he sat down with the McDonald brothers. Kroc wrote in his autobiography, ""Grinding It Out,"" ""I was fascinated by the simplicity and effectiveness of the system they described ... each step in producing the limited menu (of hamburgers, fries, shakes) as stripped down to its essence and accomplished with a minimum of effort. ... The simplicity of the (procedures) allowed the McDonalds to concentrate on quality in every step.""That night in his hotel room, he wrote, ""visions of McDonald's restaurants dotting crossroads all over the country paraded through my brain.""He mostly was seeing massive milkshake machine sales, so after waking up he suggested to the McDonald duo they open a series of stores: ""It would be a gold mine for you and for me, because everyone would boost my Multi-Mixer sales.

The fast food giant provides an annualized yield of about 3%, and it's made a breakout from a base.You could view McDonald's action since January 2012 as a long saucer-shaped consolidation. The stock tacked on a handle to this chart pattern in February this year, resulting in a buy point at 96.42.

It has achieved three-year and five-year EPS Stability Factors of 3.

Same-store sales fell 1.5% for the month, better than the 1.6% drop that analysts had expected.Adjusting for February 2012's extra leap-year day, comparable sales rose 1.7%.Analysts at Credit Suisse cited the February news as evidence that McDonald's is taking market share from competitors.In a research note, they said rivals cited gasoline prices, the higher payroll tax and other macroeconomic factors in explaining slowdowns in February.But McDonald's ""did not see any meaningful trend within that to suggest it was feeling the same macro pressures.""

2644,MCD,"McDonald's (MCD) latest correction has deepened, but the stock still has some positive characteristics going for it.Last week, the stock found support at its 40-week moving average. That's McDonald's first test of the long-term support line in just over a year. The stock had been in a strong uptrend before retreating from an all-time high in January.Turnover in the current pullback took place in heavy volume, which is not ideal.On a brighter note, even though McDonald's undercut its March low last week, its Relative Strength line failed to confirm the move. This nonconfirmation can be a good thing.And despite the latest down leg, McDonald's Accumulation-Distribution Rating has slightly improved from a worst-possible E earlier this month.Last week, the world's largest burger chain reported first-quarter earnings that rose 7% to $1.23 a share. Sales climbed 7% to nearly $6.55 billion. Results were helped by warm weather and new menu items such as its Chicken McBites.But McDonald's does see challenges ahead in Europe, which is facing uncertain economic hardship in a number of EU countries. The restaurant giant also noted slowing growth in China and a rising interest rate environment in Australia as possible hurdles.Like other restaurant operators, McDonald's continues to face increasing food costs. Its commodity prices in the U.S. climbed 7% in the first quarter, mostly due to higher prices for beef.The company has delivered rising profits each year since 2003. It has a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1, indicating a rock-steady stream of profits.McDonald's first paid a cash dividend in 1976 and has raised its payout each year since. McDonald's last hiked its dividend by 15% to its current quarterly rate of 70 cents a share in September. Its dividend has nearly doubled in the past four years.On an annualized basis, the company pays $2.80 a share, for a current yield of 2.8%. McDonald's has one of the highest yields among the 19 dividend-paying stocks in the Retail-Restaurants group.

Unlike other IBD ratings, a lower stability figure is better.Thanks to its Dollar Menu, McDonald's earnings grew 27% and 8%, respectively, during tough economic times in 2008 and 2009.While hamburgers and french fries remain among its core items, McDonald's has also attracted customers with promotions and new menu offerings.Last month, McDonald's reported a 5.3% increase in January global comparable sales, beating views for a 4.5% increase. Demand for its breakfast items, McCafe coffee drinks and Chicken McNuggets contributed to its results. The introduction of its Fruit & Maple oatmeal, aimed at more-health-conscious consumers, also helped.McDonald's January results were especially strong overseas. In Europe sales jumped 7%, while sales climbed 5.2% in its APMEA (Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa) segment. But its U.S. sales lagged, rising 3.1%.Earlier this week, McDonald's followed up with a 3.9% rise in February global comparable sales. That was slightly above analysts' estimates for a 3.8% increase. Once again, sales overseas outpaced results at home.Besides serving patrons, McDonald's has served owners for a long time. It first paid shareholders cash dividends in 1976 and has raised the payout each year since. The company last boosted its dividend in September by 11% to 61 cents a share.Last year, McDonald's returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.On an annual basis, McDonald's pays $2.44 a share for a current yield of 3.2%. It has the second-highest yield among the 15 dividend-paying companies in the Retail-Restaurants group.

2690,MCD,"THE TAKE-AWAY: What is the Dow Jones industrial average? It gauges the stock performance of 30 really big, household-name U.S. companies deemed to be representative of the U.S. economy.If you watch the news, perhaps you know that the Dow Jones industrial average, or the Dow, is a thing that rises, falls, swoons, surges, plunges, rallies or tanks. When it tanks, it's very bad and very important. It drives men in decorated sport coats, the vibe of which is somewhere between executive and airline captain, to bury their heads in their hands and leave paper all over the floor.You'd be forgiven for not knowing the finer points of what the Dow Jones industrial average actually is. The Dow Jones industrial average is an index that gauges the stock performance of 30 large, well-known companies. A stock index is a compilation of any number of stocks — with different prices, moving in different directions — represented by a single number.You already know many of the stocks that are part of the Dow. Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) are part of the Dow. General Electric (GE), the last original member, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on June 26, 2018.Created in 1896 to bring more transparency to the stock market, the Dow intends to offer a big-picture view of how the economic, business and political climate might affect big companies seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow is not a physical place, like a trading floor, where people go to buy or sell stocks. When you see pictures of traders pointing, yelling or despairing, they're probably on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.The ""Dow"" in ""Dow Jones"" is also completely different Dow from the Dow in the chemical giant DowDuPont. However, DowDuPont (DOW) is a Dow Jones Industrial Average stock.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.There are no explicit numerical requirements that companies must meet for their stocks to become part of the index. But there are broader, qualitative benchmarks for Dow companies, according to Jamie Farmer, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.A company needs to have a strong reputation, have a history of weathering economic storms, and its shares need to be widely owned by investors, he said. Companies on the Dow also need to get a lot of their sales from the U.S. — at least a plurality, Farmer said. The companies also generally have to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.""Dow"" is for Charles Dow. ""Jones"" is for Edward Jones. The two were journalists who founded Dow Jones & Co. in 1882, along with another reporter, Charles Bergstresser. In 1889, they created the Wall Street Journal. On May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones industrial average began measuring stocks — at first, only 12.""Its initial purpose was really just kind of an editorial function,"" Farmer said. ""They wanted a way to describe what was going on in the stock market on a daily basis.""That wasn't always easy in the U.S. stock market's early days.As Charles Geisst's book ""Wall Street: A History"" describes, prices for transactions on the New York Stock and Exchange Board, founded in 1817, weren't always public, let alone available to the area's newspapers.Regulations were also flimsy. Markets were easily manipulated. The 1800s were marked by cycles of wild speculation, panic and bank implosions that swallowed the economy — a process that played out multiple times over the century. Predatory tactics abounded.The daily publication of the Dow Jones industrial average numbers helped investors follow stock market movements more clearly, easing some investor fears, Geisst writes.And just what is the Dow Jones industrial average's justification for being ""industrial"" and an ""average""? That's a little more complicated.When the Dow Jones industrial average first launched, the 12 companies that it tracked were companies in the industrial sector: American Tobacco, Tennessee Coal & Iron, U.S. Leather, U.S. Rubber. General Electric was on there too, initially, before it was removed from the index and later restored in 1907, before ultimately getting removed again in 2018.Many of those companies were broken up, absorbed by others, or morphed into different businesses over time.In the beginning, the Dow was a pure ""average"" of the stocks in it. The prices of those 12 stocks were added up, divided by 12, and then you got the singular price for the whole thing.Today, that's not the case. The Dow uses a mechanism called a ""divisor"" to help calculate that singular, representative price of the index's stocks. The divisor is there to smooth out the bumps in price that come from things like stock splits or the addition or removal of stocks from the index. The Dow is also price weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have a bigger influence on the index than lower-priced ones.Over the decades, the Dow has become less ""industrial,"" per se, though it includes big names like GE, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX). But the index has evolved to include large tech and financial-services players, which are more representative of the economy today.In the prior tweak, DowDuPont replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC); Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up; and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is The Stock Market And How Does It Work?

2712,MCD,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) effective sales-boosting initiatives and synergies from Cheddar’s acquisition put the company on growth trajectory. However, high costs related to restaurant operations and stiff competition remain major concerns.Last month, the company reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Earnings and revenues not only surpassed analysts’ expectation but also grew 17.8% and 10.3%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by sales growth across every brand. Notably, the quarter marked the 15th consecutive earnings beat for the company.Darden’s shares have rallied 23.3% in the past year, outpacing its industry’s collective growth of 1%. Earnings estimates for the current fiscal have also climbed 2.4% over the past month. This reflects ongoing optimism in the stock. Given management’s progress on improving core operating fundamentals, the stock is anticipated to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Positive Synergies to be Realized From Cheddar’s IntegrationDarden’s acquisition of the small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's) in April 2017 added an undisputed casual dining value to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands. It also helped Darden to further enhance its scale. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, total sales were favored by 8.1% growth from the integration of Cheddar’s into the other segment.Apart from making significant progress with the integration of Cheddar’s, the company seems to gain more confidence of its outcome. In fiscal 2018, management realized roughly $10 million of cost synergies and expects to realize the same in the range of $22-$27 million by the end of fiscal 2019. Over the current fiscal, Darden plans to make significant non-guest facing changes that are expected to have an impact on restaurant-level execution. Moving forward, Darden expects Cheddar to bring in incredible opportunity for long-term growth. Given the brand is already delivering higher growth rate compared with Olive Garden, Darden expects Cheddar’s integration to add to the company’s overall growth.High Costs & Intense Competition HurtDarden’s non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs onto the franchisee. Total operating costs and expenses increased 7.9% year over year in the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion. This was caused by an overall increase in food, beverage and marketing costs, as well as restaurant labor and expenses. As a result, operating margin in the quarter contracted 198 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The retail restaurant space is highly competitive as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. Amid such stiff competition, Darden is missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing. We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Currently, Darden carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2713,MCD,"It was only a couple of years ago that fast casual dining was the biggest trend in the restaurant industry. The dramatic shift to fast casual restaurants was mainly pushed by an increased interest, especially from millennials, in healthier food options that don’t break the bank.This style of dining, which is a mix between traditional fast food restaurants and fine dining, saw its sales grow at a high rate of 10 to 11 percent annually from 2011 to 2016, according to research provider Euromonitor International. Riding off the highs of being at the center of the restaurant industry, a great amount of fast casual restaurants went public or saw share prices soar between 2013 and 2015, including Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report), Habit Restaurants (HABT  -  Free Report), Potbelly (PBPB  -  Free Report), Noodles & Company (NDLS  -  Free Report), Zoe’s Kitchen , El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report), and Panera Bread.At the forefront of this trend was Mexican chain Chipotle, the perfect answer to the younger generation’s desire for higher-quality ingredients with the same convenience of fast food. At its peak the company’s stock was at $758.61 per share on Aug 5, 2015 and looked to be destined to take over the entire restaurant industry—until disaster struck.An E.coli outbreak in 2015 caused shares of the company to drastically fall and struggle to recover, with the stock closing 2017 at just $289.03.Recent performance hasn’t looked that good for other fast casual restaurants either, as other main leaders, such as Noodles & Company, have struggled as well.  The restaurant which specializes in pastas, salads, and soups priced its IPO at $18 per share and ended that day at $36.75. Now, the company trades at only around $11, a 70% drop from its first day’s closing price. In 2017, the company reported a net loss of $37.5 million.Drivers of the DownfallAlthough food-borne illnesses were a major reason for Chipotle’s fall, there were other underlying factors that led to the steady demise of the company and the fast casual industry as a whole. Primarily, the fast food industry, once proclaimed dead by experts, has been able to fight back and again begin to take over the restaurant industry.Typical fast food giants like McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) have been able to respond to by providing new premium  and higher quality menu options, while still serving meals at a slightly lower cost than fast casual restaurants typically do.The move by fast food restaurants to cater to new dining trends has made fast casual establishments lose much of their cultural significance, which is what drove most of their success initially. Fast food giants have also further countered and improved their relevance with younger generations through social media marketing.An example is another classic fast food staple, Wendy’s (WEN  -  Free Report), and the company’s frequent and popular use of Twitter responses to generate publicity.How Fast Casual Can ReboundThe restaurants that were once all the hype can’t afford to simply depend on better ingredients anymore. New strategies need to be implemented that differentiate this style of dining from their fast food counterparts. The leader of the fast casual revolution, Chipotle, has already made steps towards that goal.Newly appointed CEO Brian Niccol, who was previously the CEO of rival Taco Bell, recently stated goals of becoming not just a food brand but a “purpose-driven lifestyle brand”. In addition, Niccol aims to slowly start rolling in new menu options, increased mobile ordering, and a stronger social media presence.The new CEO understands that the company can’t be stagnant in a market that is full of innovation.  All of the changes are meant to bring Chipotle back to center of attention for consumers, just as it was about three years ago.Bottom LineAs the battle for the restaurant industry continues, investors should continue to wait to see what moves the leaders in the fast casual trend decide to make. This helps explain some of why Chipotle and Noodles & Company are both currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).There is clearly potential, as the Chipotle stock has risen more than 40% since Niccol took over on March 5. Its Q2 earnings report, which will be released on July 26, will be a vital indicator as to where the stock will go in the future and if Niccol’s strategic initiatives are truly paying off. Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company’s Q2 earnings are expected to move to $2.78 per share, a 19.8% surge from the year-ago period.Make sure to check back here for more on Chipotle’s earnings outlook and the rest of the fast casual industry! More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2714,MCD,"Starbucks’ (SBUX  -  Free Report) Americas segment, comprising 70% of its total revenues, is expected to witness softer comps growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, when it reports on Thursday, Apr 26.A Look at Starbucks’ Americas Performance in Q1Net revenues in this flagship segment (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America) were up 7% year over year to $4.3 billion in the preceding quarter. Comps grew 2% in the quarter, softer than 3% growth witnessed in Q4. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 2% increase in average ticket. In fiscal 2017, Starbucks’ Americas segment posted 3% comps growth, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period. In fact, transactions remained unchanged year over year and ticket grew 4%. This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and an increase of 1% in ticket in fiscal 2016.In Q1, membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks, and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 31% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 27% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 100 basis points to 23%, as strong sales leverage was more than offset by food-related mix shift.Q2 ExpectationsStarbucks’ Americas segment revenues (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America, comprising 70% of its total revenues) are expected to witness 6.9% growth year over year but 6.9% decline sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, the company expects the first half of the year in Americas comps to be a little below the average for the year, and the second half to be a little bit above.The company’s segment is likely to experience higher revenues year over year courtesy of additional store openings, Starbucks’ mobile order/pay along with significant innovation in beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty, and e-Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams to boost its top line.Apart from the Americas segment, Starbucks’ Channel Development business also needs special mention. Although the business is small (in terms of its revenue contribution), it generates impressive operating margins owing to its cost structure. Hence, the Channel Development segment represents a significant profitable growth opportunity. Channel Development is expected to report revenues of $479 million, higher than $461 million in the year-ago quarter but lower than $560 million in the preceding one.Revenues in the China-Asia-Pacific segment are likely to witness 47% year-over-year and 34.1% sequential growth. Additionally, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment revenues of $254 million indicates an increase from $232 million in the year-ago quarter but a decrease from $284 million in the prior quarter.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 53 cents reflects 17.8% growth from the prior-year quarter’s profit of 45 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $5.91 billion indicates a 11.5% increase on a year-over-year basis.Starbucks’ operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. Again, digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. Internationally, the company’s focus on China/Asia expansion is another positive.Meanwhile, change in the product mix (as food, tea and cold beverages will become an increasing part of the product mix), focus on the use of loyalty cards and mobile order, and pay technology to boost sales and profits are added tailwinds. Finally, Starbucks’ endeavor to boost its presence in premium coffee consumed at home through K-cups and with ready-to-drink beverages needs special attention.Overall, apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. That said, headwinds, especially in the labor front, are a cause of concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

2715,MCD,"The Dow enjoyed a week of strong gains as trade war and Syria related fears receded. President Trump indicated that trade disputes should be resolved through discussions. Meanwhile, China’s President Xi Jinping pledged to open up China’s economy further. Trump also indicated that a military strike on Syria was not imminent. As a result, investors chose to focus on upcoming bank earnings as financials gained.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined 2.3% on last Friday as increasing worries of a trade war brewing between the United States and China led to a huge selloff. Moreover, equities hit their session lows in the final two hours of trading after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank would keep increasing interest rates to curb inflation.The Dow tanked 0.7% over last week on escalating trade war related tensions between U.S. and China. The volatile week started on a low as China announced tariffs of $3 billion on U.S. goods including pork, apples and dry fruit. Markets gained traction after White House gave an indication that the U.S. government would not want to enter into a trade war with China.Notably, Thursday was also the first day on NYSE since March 2013 when new 52-week highs outnumbered 52-week lows. Powell’s statement that the U.S. bank would keep increasing interest rates to keep inflation in control once again made investors jittery.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.2% on Monday as trade war tensions eased to some extent after officials from President Trump’s administration said trade disputes with China could be resolved through discussion. Such comments helped stocks rally almost throughout the trading session.However, stocks pared most of the day’s gains shortly before the market closed on news of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raiding the office of Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.The index increased 1.8% on Tuesday after Chinese President Xi promised to take measures to open the country’s economy and cut import tariffs. Investors’ confidence rebounded as fears of a trade war eased to some extent, which saw stocks rallying almost throughout the trading session.Moreover, shares of Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) too jumped after the company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of the Congress following news of a data misuse scandal involving millions of users.The index declined 0.9% on Wednesday following President Donald Trump’s tweet warning Russia of a possible military strike on Syria. Escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia saw investors taking a defensive stance, with U.S. stocks tumbling and safe havens rallying.The decline was led by bank stocks such as Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). However, shares of Facebook increased as the company’s CEO continued his testimony in front of Congress for the second day.The index gained 1.2% on Thursday after investors ignored geopolitical tensions and chose to focus on the upcoming earnings season. Investor concerns receded after Trump tweeted saying that a military strike on Syria was unlikely in the near future. Financials were the best performers of the day as investors focused on upcoming bank earnings.Components Moving the Index The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors. The dividend will be paid on or after May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Apr 20, 2018. The new figure will add up to an annual dividend of $2.8688 per share.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) P&G is considered to be one of the dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 Index, given its consistent increase in dividends each year in its span of operations of more than 100 years in business. This, along with a dividend yield of more than 3% (3.53% as of Apr 10, 2018) helped P&G to attain the position.

Apple has a Zacks Rank #4.Reportedly, the company has labeled the devices with same price tags as other regular models, which are $699 for iPhone 8 and $799 for 8 Plus. The new device is expected to offset weakness arising from lackluster sales of the premium iPhone X.iPhone, since its launch in 2007, has been the mainstay of the tech giant’s revenues. However, the spurt in revenues from iPhone in the last quarter was owing to higher iPhone average selling price when total shipments witnessed a decline. Lower-than-expected sales of iPhone X have been a dampener for the company. Ever since, analysts have been slashing sales estimate for the product.

2716,MCD,"Jack in the Box Inc.’s (JACK  -  Free Report) premium and value offerings, along with the increased focus on menu innovation, franchising and delivery are key growth drivers. The strategic sell-out of the Qdoba brand is also expected to reap benefits, going forward.However, decelerating comps growth, rising costs, along with the stiff competition in breakfast and lunch day parts raise caution. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company’s earnings and revenues not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined 7% and 21.1%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. Also, system wide comps declined 0.1% in the first quarter while franchise comps dipped 0.2%.Moreover, shares of Jack in the Box have declined 23.7% in the past year, widely underperforming the industry’s growth of 1.3%. Earnings estimates have also been revised downward over the past month, reflecting analysts’ concern surrounding the future earnings potential of the company.Innovation in Menu & Delivery Services to Drive SalesJack in the Box, being one of the largest hamburger chains, makes regular menu innovations and also provides limited period offers (LPO) to drive long-term customer loyalty. With focused menu inventions around premium products like Buttery Jack Burgers, the company witnessed increased comps in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. At its restaurants, the company continues to combat heightened competitive activity around breakfast day part, and carry out aggressive value deals across the industry by menu innovations and value offerings.The company is also increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is a growing area for the industry. Given the high demand for this service, management has undertaken third-party delivery channels to boost transactions and sales. Currently, two-third of the restaurant system is served by major delivery companies like DoorDash and Grubhub. Jack in the Box is currently testing a mobile application in a few markets that support order-ahead functionality and payment. Management is reaping benefits in terms of higher ticket from the mobile orders.Gains From Franchising & Qdoba Sell-OutJack in the Box restaurants are currently 90% franchised and the company plans to increase the number to around 95% by the end of fiscal 2018. We believe, franchising a large chunk of its system will lower its general and administrative expenses, and thereby boost earnings. Moreover, over the long term, it would generate a higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements. This would also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing its shareholders’ return.  Notably, the company believes that the majority of Jack in the Box’s new unit growth will be through franchise restaurants. In fact, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company sold 53 Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees. Management has roughly 17 restaurants with signed LOIs, having a current 93% franchise mix.Also, with the strategic sell-out of the Qdoba brand, management is expecting to gradually witness a reduction in SG&A in the second half of the fiscal. The Qdoba brand had become more of a drag in the past few quarters, given the poor restaurant-level execution and a choppy sales environment. In fact, it generated a net loss of $0.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 against net earnings of $1.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Limited International Presence & Stiff Competition Raise ConcernsThe American dining brands are keen on expanding in the fast-growing emerging markets. While several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets; Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front. Thus, limited international presence might be a big disadvantage for the company and hurt its competitive position. Moreover, the company is experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts, as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.The company operates in the retail restaurant space that is highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending. Consumers’ propensity to spend largely depends on the overall macro-economic scenario. Although higher disposable income and increased wages are favoring the industry right now, it can change with the slightest disruption in the economy. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, therefore, is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending. If it does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains, it has high chances of fading out like many other restaurant retailers.

2717,MCD,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MCD due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.McDonald's Q1 Earnings Top, Comps Continue to ImpressMcDonald's reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.79 surpassed the consensus mark of $1.67 by 7.2% and improved 22% from the year-ago quarter (16% in constant currencies). The upside reflects stronger operating performance.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a positive impact of 8 cents per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, adjusted earnings exclude the impact of a net tax cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.Revenues Decline But Global Comps ImproveRevenues of $ 5,138.9 million outpaced the consensus mark of $4,915 million by 4.5% but declined 9% year over year. The downturn reflects the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative.Revenues at company-operated restaurants were down 26% year over year to $2,535.6 million. However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants increased 15% to $2,603.3 million.Global comps grew 5.5% supported by encouraging guest count across segments. This marked the eleventh consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Meanwhile, comps rise was similar to growth in the fourth-quarter 2017.Solid Comps Across SegmentsU.S.: Comps grew 2.9% in the first quarter owing to increase in average check resulting from rise in menu price as well as product mix shift. Comps growth, however, was lower than the prior-quarter rise of 4.5%.Segment operating income increased 5% backed by higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars and increase in sales from restaurant businesses, partially offset by lower company-operated margin dollars.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 7.8% year over year, higher than a 6% rise witnessed in the last reported quarter. Robust sales in the United Kingdom and Germany along with upbeat results across all other markets drove comps.Operating income was up 21%, including the impact of foreign currency translation. At constant currency, the figure was up 9% primarily on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars.High-Growth Markets: Comps grew 4.7%, which was higher than the prior-quarter’s increase of 4%. The uptick can be attributed to strong performance in China and Italy as well as positive results across majority of the segments, partially offset by continual challenges in South Korea.Foundational Markets: Comps in Foundational Markets grew 8.7% on the back of positive sales performance across all geographic regions. Moreover, the figure came in higher than 8% growth in the last reported quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to five lower.McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus  McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus | McDonald's Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MCD has an average Growth Score of C and a grade with the same score on the momentum front. The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, MCD has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

2718,MCD,"The Dow endured another volatile week marked by key geopolitical developments. At the beginning of the week, the U.S. Treasury Secretary made encouraging remarks about the progress of trade negotiations with China. However, later in the week, President Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of trade talks. He also cancelled his much awaited summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un. As a result, stocks gained and lost on alternate sessions.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 1.1 points on last Friday, closing the session nearly unchanged. Trade negotiations between the United States and China continued to weigh on investor sentiment after President Donald Trump said that he doubted that negotiations would have a positive outcome. Also, bond yields reached their highest level since 2011 last week.The index declined 0.5% over last week.  Trade talks between the United States and China remained in focus this week, which continued to weigh on investor sentiment. Moreover, high interest rates too pushed stocks lower this week.The 10-year note yield crossed the 3.1% mark for the first time since 2011, denting investors’ confidence. This saw investors panicking, as yield hitting the psychological 3% level triggered fears that equities could become less appealing.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 1.2% or nearly 300 points on Monday. The Dow also closed above the 25,000 mark for the first time since March 12. Trade tensions between the United States and China declined after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said: “We are putting the trade war on hold.”Industrials were the biggest gainers as they would stand to benefit the most if a trade war is averted. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) jumped 3.6%, 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively.The index declined 0.7% on Tuesday, erasing early gains, after President Trump said that he wasn’t satisfied with the progress of United States-China trade talks. Moreover, Trump also said that the highly awaited summit between the United States and North Korea might not happen at all.Meanwhile, the White House said that in order to get into any fresh nuclear deal with the United States, Iran needs to stop enriching uranium and withdraw support to militant groups in the Middle East. This statement caused stocks to plummet further.The index gained 0.2% on Wednesday, led by led by a rally in shares of Boeing, which gained 1.2%. Shares of McDonald’s MCD surged 1.4%. Stocks gained after minutes of Fed’s meeting concluded earlier this month hinted that policy makers aren’t worried about inflation briefly running above the target level.Further, such an occurrence would not result in faster interest rate hikes. Rate sensitive stocks rallied on the news. The broader market was able to pare earlier losses resulting from geopolitical tensions and close in the black.The index declined 0.3% on Thursday after President Trump scrapped his summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un scheduled for next month. This would have been the maiden face-to-face encounter between a North Korean Leader and a sitting U.S. President.Energy stocks emerged as the biggest losers of the day after U.S. oil prices declined following an unexpected increase in domestic crude inventories. Share of Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) declined 0.8% and 1.6%, respectively, leading the blue-chip index to finish in the red.Components Moving the Index General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) recently entered into a definitive agreement with Wabtec Corporation (WAB  -  Free Report) — a leading manufacturer of rail equipment — for $11.1 billion. Per the agreement, the company will merge its operating segment, GE Transportation, with Wabtec.On completion of the synergistic deal, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) General Electric will obtain $2.9 billion in cash, whereas the company and its shareholders will own a 50.1% ownership interest in the combined company. The remaining 49.9% of stake of the combined company will be retained by Wabtec shareholders. Notably, the deal is likely to close in early 2019.The latest move will combine GE Transportation’s digital solutions for railroad, marine, drilling, wind and mining industries with Wabtec’s extensive range electronic solutions. As a result, their market capabilities will be stronger, adding a momentum to the development and implementation of innovative solutions in key markets. This will help to improve the safety, efficiency and productivity of their offerings.Notably, the combined company will have a large global installed base, with more than 23,000 locomotives that would create significant opportunities for aftermarket services growth.

Over the last five trading days, the Dow has declined 0.7%.Next Week’s OutlookComments from President Trump have guided markets lower on more than one occasion this week. Only the nature of the Fed minutes has proved to be encouraging to investors. Otherwise, in the absence of major earnings reports, geopolitical events have weighed heavily on investor sentiment.Given this backdrop, it would only be natural for investors to turn to economic reports for encouragement. Several key pieces of data are lined up for released next week including the all-important GDP report. If most of these are encouraging in nature, stocks could soon return to their winning ways.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2719,MCD,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia is nearing its climax, with the final set to kick off this Sunday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). And although the final matchup isn’t set and the victorious nation has not hoisted the trophy, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) already beat its rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) at the World Cup.When the tournament began on June 14, Adidas held the early lead over Nike. Not only is the German sportswear giant one of just seven official FIFA partners along with Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways, the company also edged out Nike in terms of total team sponsorships.JerseysAdidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970, and will be the official ball of the world’s biggest sporting even until at least 2030. The company also sponsored 12 of the 32 teams at this year’s tournament, including three favorites Germany, Spain, and Argentina. But, Germany didn’t make it out of the group stage and Spain and Argentina were eliminated in the round of 16.Oregon-based Nike spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. Since then, Nike has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world. Nike began the 2018 World Cup with 10 teams sporting its iconic swoosh, including Brazil.More importantly, three out of the four teams that made it to the semi-finals of the World Cup were Nike teams. Furthermore, France defeated Belgium, the lone Adidas team, in the first semi-final game Tuesday. Now, even before England play Croatia on Wednesday in the second semi-final, the World Cup winners are guaranteed to be wearing Nike—all of whom are currently on the front page of Nike’s website.This is great exposure for Nike, especially since Adidas pays millions to be an official FIFA partner, which according to The Telegraph costs between $25 million and $50 million annually.Stars Although the three most famous soccer stars on the planet, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar, are all out of the World Cup, there are certainly some big names left.Adidas’ only remaining star is France’s Paul Pogba, who sports a Nike kit for France. The third biggest team sponsor, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list, was Puma. The German sportswear company’s biggest individual star, Antoine Griezmann also happens to play for France (also listen to: A Sportswear Industry Overview Amid Puma's Basketball Push).Meanwhile, two of Nike’s rising soccer stars are England’s Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe of France, both also play for Nike-sponsored club teams. Nike tweeted from its main Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account for the first time in a month to congratulate Mbappe on Tuesday.Nike noted that Kane’s Tottenham and the World Cup were two of the big places the company spent money. “Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25% primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA, brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup,” CFO Andy Campion said on Nike’s recent quarterly earnings call.Bottom LineSome people might say that sports sponsorships don’t matter, and maybe they are less quantifiable to Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) or McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), which are official 2018 World Cup sponsors. But for sportswear companies such as Nike, they are important, especially since the company is actively expanding its reach in the sport. Investors should also note that Nike’s overall soccer revenues climbed 8% to $2.15 billion during its recently completed fiscal year, trailing only sportswear and basketball in terms of growth.The World Cup also offers the chance to reach billions of people around the world, as well as across social media channels such as Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) in highlights that will live for years to come. The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil reached 3.2 billion people total, with one billion reportedly tuned into the final. And while Americans might not love the sport, 60% of Nike’s revenues come from outside of its domestic market.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2720,MCD,"Shares of Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) surged over 2% on Monday following two significant pieces of news regarding the recently-struggling coffee powerhouse, including a possible Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) partnership to help boost growth in China.ChinaDeparting Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told reporters at a roundtable discussion at the company’s flagship roastery store in Shanghai on Monday that a potential Chinese slowdown is a ""false narrative."" Schultz made it clear that Starbucks would continue its growth in the world’s second-largest economy after the company said last month that same-store sales in China would be flat to slightly negative in the June quarter, compared to impressive 7% comps growth in the year-ago period.""It's a very short-term number that Wall Street uses, it's not a number we're concerned about,"" Schultz said. ""I will say, unequivocally, that anyone who is betting against Starbucks in China is dead wrong.""Investors should note that Chinese comps climbed 4% last quarter, with overall revenues for the China/Asia Pacific segment up 54% to $1.19 billion. The company also opened 216 new stores in the region. Meanwhile, same-store sales grew by 2% in the Americas and the U.S.—which still accounts for roughly 70% of total revenues.Schultz then went on to discuss the possibility of joining forces with Chinese e-commerce giant and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) rival Alibaba in order to bolster sales. The outgoing Starbucks chief executive also spoke openly about his relationship with Alibaba's billionaire founder Jack Ma.“There's no doubt that no brick-and-mortar retailer anywhere in the world, let alone China, can exist as a stand-alone business without having a significant, integrated e-commerce mobile application,"" Schultz said. “I have been very dear and close friends with Jack Ma for many, many years... and suffice to say there will be news coming that will relate to our plans for accelerating and integrating mobile commerce at a higher level into our core business.”Looking ahead, Starbucks thinks that China can overtake the U.S. as its top market. Starbucks plans to add 600 new stores per year in Mainland China through 2022 in order to double its locations to 6,000 total stores in 230 cities. Straw WarsInvestors should also note that Starbucks announced that it plans to stop using plastic straws at all of its locations within two years, pointing directly to the environmental threat to the oceans. Starbucks’ move comes amid increased coverage about how much plastic waste—with straws playing a significant role—ends up in oceans.The company also became the largest food and beverage company to make such a commitment, which comes a week after its home base of Seattle banned plastic drinking straws and utensils. Going forward, Starbucks will begin to use straws made from biodegradable materials such as paper and specially designed lids, some of which are already offered in Seattle.Starbucks' announcement could put more pressure on fellow coffee giant Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN  -  Free Report) to make more environmentally friendly moves. Dunkin' did announce in February that it plans to eliminate polystyrene foam cups from its stores by 2020.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) recently said that it would switch to paper straws in the UK and test alternatives to plastic straws at some U.S. locations.*A previous version of this article mentioned that investors were present when CEO Howard Schultz spoke in China. This has been corrected becuase only Starbucks partners (employees) and media were in attendance *Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2721,MCD,"Shares of McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) were up more than 1.1% in morning trading Thursday, but the stock surrendered its daily gains after reports surfaced that health officials were investigating a restaurant for possible hepatitis A exposure.The case involves an employee who was infected with hepatitis A while working at a McDonald’s location in Madison County, Kentucky. Local CBS affiliate WKYT reported that the county’s health department is investigating the matter and suggests people who ate at the location on Mar 23 be on the lookout for symptoms.Hepatitis A is characterized by symptoms of fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored stools, join pain, and jaundice. The infection can be prevented with a vaccination.The Madison County Health Department said that McDonald’s has fully cooperated with its investigation, according to WKYT. The restaurant reportedly scored a 100 on its most-recent health score.Following reports of the hepatitis A scare, McDonald’s quickly surged to become the top trending ticket on popular investing forum StockTwits. Investors appear concerned that food safety troubles could hurt the brand—just as they did to Chipotle (CMG) over the past few years.However, this particular case appears to be an isolated incident, whereas Chipotle’s headache was linked to foodborne illness outbreaks at a number of its restaurants.McDonald’s shares have gained nearly 25% over the past year, but the stock has dropped more than 8% from its late-January highs as analyst sentiment toward the company has cooled. Within the past 60 days, McDonald’s has witnessed six revisions to its full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the downside.This negative revision activity has earned MCD a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Nevertheless, cost-cutting initiatives appear to be paying off, and despite the company’s worsening outlook, it is still expected to witness EPS growth of nearly 14% in 2018.Want more market analysis from this author?

2722,MCD,"Per media report, McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) is likely to open 200 restaurants in the Nordic region over the next decade, in a bid to attract customers. Notably, it is the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain, with presence in more than 100 countries. In fact, with an almost 10% share of the global informal-eating-out market there is ample scope for the company to grow in the future.Meanwhile, McDonald’s seems to be increasingly focusing on delivery services in order to cater to its customers' needs in a better way. It is expected to begin home delivery in the Nordic region from this year. In Sweden and Finland, McDonald’s will start home delivery services from May onwards, while in Denmark and Norway in the latter half of 2018. In Denmark, Sweden, Norway as well as Finland the company serves 150 million customers a year and has nearly 430 restaurants in the region.These recent plans indicate that the company is targeting to regain its market share from its competitors. McDonald’s has been reporting weak traffic trends in certain major markets for quite some time now.Expansion Plans to Drive Traffic & SalesIncreasing guest counts remain the company’s top priority and it intends to regain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value. Moreover, McDonald’s expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth over the long term. We believe that the company’s decision to open restaurants in Nordic regions will not only boost sales and traffic but will also pave way for long-term growth.Stock PerformanceIn the past three months, shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 6.2%, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.8%.Also, McDonald’s margins have been under pressure from worldwide wage increases recently. This apart, additional health care costs related to Obamacare in the United States led to a rise in labor costs. Further, costs associated with brand positioning in all key markets as well as ongoing investments in initiatives are expected to continue weighing on margins, at least in the near term. Increased commodity costs might further pressurize margins.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the same space are Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (ARCO  -  Free Report), Dine Brands Global, Inc.

2724,MCD,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The month-long tournament is expected to attract billions of viewers from over 200 countries, making it a marketing dream. The likes of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) will all be heavily featured, but Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) are the only companies competing against each other. So let’s take a look to see which sportswear company seems poised to come out on top at the 2018 World Cup.According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor. German giant Adidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970. The company also signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030.Therefore, right off the bat, Adidas might get more overall shine with their classic “three stripes” logo plastered on in-stadium signage, official game balls, and more. But this is just the start.JerseysNike has spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse around the world since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. The Oregon-based company has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world, including Europe’s top five leagues. Adidas, which has been a soccer giant for decades, has cultivated and maintained similar relationships and sponsorship deals.Adidas sponsors 12 of the 32 national teams competing at this year’s World Cup. This list includes some of the favorites: Germany, Spain, and Argentina.Nike, in a move that reshaped soccer sponsorships, spent millions of dollar in 1996 to outfit the Brazilian national team. Brazil, who has won the most ever World Cups, with five, is also the top favorite this year. Overall, Nike’s Swoosh logo will appear on 10 different jerseys, including France.Although it is nearly neck and neck, the slight edge has to go to Adidas. (Side Note: Puma sponsors four teams, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list)Stars Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Lionel Messi (Argentina), and Neymar (Brazil) are three of the most famous people on the planet. The three soccer stars ranked number one, three, and four, respectively, on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list. They also all landed in the top five of Forbes’ highest paid athletes rankings. Ronaldo boasts over 202 million followers on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) combined, with the other two resting closely behind.Ronaldo has been with Nike since 2003, while Messi signed with Adidas in 2006—both players are currently on “lifetime” deals with their sportswear companies. Neymar tips the balance slightly in Nike’s favor, with the Brazilian superstar currently under a massive, incentive-laden contract with the American company.Cleats/BootsWith the team sponsorships and some of the biggest stars covered, let’s take a look at what a majority of the players will be wearing on their feet. ESPN ranked their top 50 players at the World Cup and also recently highlighted what boots they will wear when they take the field. The publication noted that 49 of their 50 best players in Russia will sport Nike, Adidas, or Puma—with New Balance as the one outlier.Nike takes the top spot here, with 26 of the 50 set to play in Nike cleats, while Adidas claims 20. However, Adidas noted that 60% of all the players will be wearing Adidas footwear at the World Cup. With that said, the slight edge still has to go to Nike.Stock Performance With the fight between Nike and Adidas still a little too close to call, let’s dive into their stock price performance to help determine a winner.Clearly, Adidas stock has crushed Nike since the end of the 2014 World Cup. Therefore, coupled with its slight edge in the jersey department, and its standing as an official FIFA partner, Adidas appears to be the winner in the 2018 sportswear World Cup.But, this could change depending on how individual players and teams perform on the world’s biggest stage. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2726,MCD,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup kicks off this week in Russia. As 32 teams fight it out for the coveted trophy over a period of one month, FIFA will be banking on its sponsors for the much-needed stimulus after a poor financial showing for two consecutive years.Goes without saying, FIFA World Cup will turn out to be biggest playground for both FIFA and the tournament’s sponsors for helping each other make the most of opportunity. And it’s not only the event’s sponsors but also a number of others brands that are set to gain from this global extravaganza.Sponsors Ready for the Flag Off The warmup to the finals is already underway with every sponsor designing ads around the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Barring a few, FIFA has managed to rope in most of its long-time partners for this year’s tournament. The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report), VISA Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) continue to be FIFA’s loyal sponsors.In 2016, FIFA incurred a loss of $368 million, followed by a loss of $192 million in 2017. This does not however take anything away from the spectacle and FIFA is hugely anticipating profits this year. According to marketing agency, Zenith, this edition of the world cup will add $2.4 billion to the global advertisement market.Expectedly, sponsors are not hesitating to shell out generously on making their brands visible over the next 30 days. Coca-Cola has spent more than two years in designing its Being Ready campaign. Visa is banking on the popularity of Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic to promote its contactless payment cards. Visa has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Adidas too has roped in a start-studded cast comprising sporting heroes, musicians and a host of pop icons for its Crete the Answer campaign.Sponsors to Gain From Brand VisibilitySponsors will be focusing on brand visibility with the aim of reaching out to more buyers. Given that world cup football is a summer affair, Coca-Cola will try to cash in on this opportunity. Adidas too has its hopes high, being the jersey and kit sponsor of 12 of the participating teams. Budwiser and McDonald’s are typically the food and beverage associated with any sporting event.According to Morgan Stanley, beer sales volume get a 2-3% boost in host countries. Moreover, Anheuser-Busch recently said that it expects annual sales volumes to increase between 0.5-1% in the finalists Brazil and Argentina.Similarly, Adidas, which introduces new balls every year, will be flaunting its latest brand Telstar 18 this time. Visa, on the other hand, will be stressing more on enhancing the overall football-watching experience. Visa account holders will be getting benefits of exclusive access to tickets via Visa-sponsored pre-sale events.From the Galleries    It’s not only that the FIFA World Cup sponsors stand to gain from the tournament. Those on the side bench too will get a chance to make their presence felt on the field. Nike, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) is the kit and jersey sponsor of 10 of the 32 participating countries including big names like Brazil, France and England. This will certainly give the company enough brand visibility.Carlsberg A/S (CABGY  -  Free Report) is the market leader in beers in Russia and will try to take this opportunity to score high this time. Another big winner will be the broadcasters. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Fox Sports is the official broadcaster, while Telemundo, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will be airing the matches in South America.Besides, streaming media players too will play an important role in this year’s world cup.

2727,MCD,"It has been a volatile year for the Retail-Food & Restaurants industry so far. Year to date, the industry has declined 4% against the S&P 500’s 1.7% gain. Under such circumstances, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report), which has witnessed its shares rise more than 670% in the last 10 years, is trading sideways in 2018. Even though the company looks promising on its efficient cost-saving initiatives, higher labor costs and expenses related to various sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on its margins.Also, Cracker Barrel loses out on international front despite having a substantial domestic presence. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion strategies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak in this regard.Read on to find out the company’s strategic initiatives to revive its past glory.Menu Innovations & Expansion EffortsCracker Barrel is continuously focusing on rejuvenating its menu, which serves as the backbone of the company’s riveting growth potential. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s in-store menu featured Fried Chicken Benedict bowl, a Ham n' Maple Bacon bowl and a Sausage, Grits Cakes and Green Tomato Gravy bowl.  In April, Cracker Barrel also completed the rollout of crafted coffee. The company believes that the platform will complement the strength of its breakfast all day offering and will drive check favorability. By focusing on menu innovation, Cracker Barrel is trying to increase its traffic and in turn sales. Also, the company’s continuous expansion strategies act as a key catalyst. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Cracker Barrel opened four company-owned restaurants including the first California location. Again, it opened one Holler & Dash location in Charlotte, North Carolina. So far this year, the company has expanded its footprint by opening eight restaurants in total.Digitalization & Sales Building InitiativesIn a bid to offset the challenges of the competitive restaurant industry, Cracker Barrel has undertaken extensive marketing efforts that are mainly focused on the brand’s differentiation, menu offering and its value. Currently, it makes use of national cable along with local Spanish television for advertising. This, in turn, is increasing the company’s market coverage and brand awareness.Furthermore, Cracker Barrel relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited-time offers to boost its top-line performance as they are appealing to both regular users and less-frequent guests. In fiscal 2018, the company intends to meet consumers' needs for convenience via its off-premise business growth. Meanwhile, management will continue investing in its product line-up for improving guest experience and employee training to support long-term plans within this space. Multiple delivery options will also be tested this fiscal year. In the third quarter, the company made significant progress with its To Go sales by offering a new range of menu.Cost Saving InitiativesCracker Barrel has an effective cost-cutting mechanism in place. Impressively, it undertakes various measures to keep costs under control. For fiscal 2018, the company expects to deliver annual cost savings in the $7-$8 million range. Currently, the company is carrying out its cost savings plan through its two prime initiatives — food waste and labor management.Additionally, the company changed the structure in its retail sales and service functions, and now cross-trains its retail sales associate and cashier positions. This system-wide change allows it to deploy fewer associates during the outlet’s low volume hours, thus reducing store hourly labor by 25-30 hours per week. Cracker Barrel believes that this initiative will be a significant contributor to its cost savings.Cracker Barrel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2729,MCD,"Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.’s (PLAY  -  Free Report) unique business model, rigorous sales building initiatives and relentless expansion plans are encouraging. However, high costs, a tricky consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with the company’s limited international presence raise concerns.Recently, the company posted decent results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues met the same. Adjusted earnings of 61 cents surpassed the consensus estimate of 59 cents by 3.4%. Earnings, however, declined 3.2% year over year.Although Dave & Buster’s continues to perform well on the back of unique customizable experience that it offers across its four platforms, “Eat, Drink, Play and Watch”, high operating costs might have led earnings to fall in the past few quarters.The company’s shares have also lost 30.3% in the past year against its industry’s growth of 10.8%.Distinct Business Model Favors Revenues Dave & Buster’s exclusive business model focuses on the company’s entertainment business, alongside its food and beverage offerings. This dual model helps the company generate favorable store economics and strong return.In fiscal 2017, amusement and other revenues accounted for 56.6% of total revenues and grew 16.6% year over year. This is because, increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company from the headwinds of consumer discretionary spending that characterizes the restaurant industry and is in turn driving market share and comps. Also, the shift toward increased focus on amusement is driving Dave & Buster’s earnings, given its higher-margin business.In fact, the company has a proven track record of identifying operational efficiencies for the past five fiscal years and adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 720 bps in the same time period. It is in fact this unique model that sets it apart and we expect the company’s entertainment business to carry the growth story forward.Rapid Store Openings Bode WellDave & Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets, given the broad appeal of its brand. Management believes that it can grow the concept to more than 200 units in North America over time. Currently, the company has eight stores under construction, and plans to further ride on new store growth in 2019 and early 2020.In fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to open 14 to 15 new stores, including two of the latest 17-K format stores, and achieve 13-14% annual unit growth rate, including the combination of eight stores in new markets for D&B, with the remaining stores located in markets where the brand is already established.Meanwhile, in addition to the growth potential that exists in North America, management is positive about the brand’s significant appeal in certain international markets. Notably, the first international opening outside of Canada is anticipated in 2018.High Costs Amid a Competitive Industry Hurt Dave & Buster’sHigher labor costs due to increased wages and those incurred due to implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure. This means that restaurant operators such as Dave & Buster’s that has numerous company-owned units and laborers will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs, which in turn will hurt margins.Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster’s, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs onto the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Moreover, the retail restaurant space is highly competitive, as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. These initiatives involve high costs. Dave & Buster’s is also bearing the brunt of higher operating cost from these sales building initiatives. In fact, in fiscal 2017, total operating costs increased 14% from the prior-year quarter.Amid such stiff competition, Dave & Buster’s is also missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing.We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Zacks RankDave & Buster’s carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2730,MCD,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) effective sales-boosting initiatives, Brand Renaissance Plan and synergies from Cheddar’s acquisition put the company on growth trajectory. However, high costs related to restaurant operations and stiff competition in the industry remain major concerns.Last month, Darden posted mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same. Also, both earnings and revenues in the last reported quarter grew 29.5% and 13.3%, respectively, from the prior-year quarter.The company’s relentless efforts in improving the basic operating factors of the business — food, service and atmosphere — remain the key growth driver.Notably, shares of Darden have rallied 7.4% in the past six months, outperforming its industry’s gain of 3.8%.Cheddar's Acquisition Drives Top LineDarden’s acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in April 2017, added an undisputed casual dining value to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands. It also helped Darden to further enhance its scale.In the fiscal third quarter, total sales were favored by 11.3% from the addition of 154 Cheddar’s and 34 other new restaurants. Segmental sales also improved owing to Cheddar’s integration in the Other Business segment, which jumped 71.4% year over year to $438 million in the last reported quarter.Brand Renaissance Plan for Olive Garden & Other Sales-Building Efforts Boost CompsDarden implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand. These include simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments.Also, the brand is focusing on remodeling and bar refreshes. The revamped restaurants are already generating high same-restaurant sales and returns. In fact, the remodeling program has gained momentum in the last couple of quarters and the company intends to continue investing in remodeling for optimal returns. In fact, supported by these initiatives, Olive Garden posted the 14th consecutive quarter of positive comps in third-quarter fiscal 2018.Meanwhile, Darden is also focusing on technology-driven initiatives like the system-wide rollout of tablets, in order to capitalize on the digital wave that has hit the U.S. fast-casual restaurant sector. This initiative has boosted sales for the past few quarters. Sales of the company have also picked up momentum with the launch of mobile ordering in November 2014.High Costs Pose ConcernHigher labor costs due to increased wages and those incurred on implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue keeping Darden’s profits under pressure.Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden, so instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, total operating costs and expenses increased 14.4% year over year.Competitive Industry Puts Pressure on DardenDarden operates in the retail restaurant space that is highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending. Although higher disposable income and increased wages are favoring the industry right now, it can change with the slightest disruption in the economy. Darden, therefore, is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending. If the company does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains, it has high chances of fading out like many other retailers. In fact, for the restaurant industry as a whole, the fourth quarter comps were up by a meager 0.4% after seven consecutive quarter of declining comps.Moreover, the retail restaurant space is highly competitive as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. These initiatives involve high costs. Darden also is bearing the brunt of higher operating cost from these sales building initiatives. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, total operating costs and expenses increased 14.4% year-over-year. Amid such stiff competition, Darden is also missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing.We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Zacks RankDarden carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2732,MCD,"The knockout stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Saturday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Telemundo. With half of the original 32 teams eliminated and ratings up, World Cup drama is really just beginning. So let’s see how some of the biggest FIFA and World Cup sponsors have performed, along with a quick look at the TV ratings.RatingsThe early World Cup ratings on Fox were down 44% compared to the 2014 tournament on ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), saw a comparable drop. This downward trend then quickly flipped.Germany’s June 23 stoppage-time victory grabbed 5.4 million viewers on Fox, which made it the most-watched non-U.S. men’s group stage game on English-language TV in 28 years. Other games also grabbed big numbers, with viewership on Day 14 up 34% compared to 2014.Fox noted that its overall group stage viewership was up 1%, compared to the average of the last four World Cups. This might not sound like much, but many expected Fox’s ratings to suffer since the U.S. did not qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986.Meanwhile, overall TV ratings are down, including the NFL’s. So with that said, let’s quickly look at how these integral parts of the tournament in the U.S. have performed on the stock market.Fox & TelemundoFox and Telemundo won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the United States, paying roughly $1 billion combined. Clearly, both Fox and Telemundo’s parent company Comcast have performed rather well since the two companies signed their massive World Cup deals back in 2011. Both networks also own rights to the 2026 World Cup that will be held in North America.Sponsors Now let’s move onto some official FIFA partners and World Cup sponsors, which reportedly pay between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.There are currently seven FIFA partners for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup cycle. This list includes Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways. Meanwhile, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), along with a few others, are official 2018 World Cup sponsors.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has been associated with FIFA since 1974. The company signed a signed a 16-year extension with FIFA in 2005, which takes it through the 2022 World Cup—a deal the beverage giant made before it even knew where the 2018 and 2022 tournaments would be held. Investors will note that Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 since it signed its latest extension. More recently, KO stock has done dramatically worse than the index, up just 8.4% over the last five years against the index’s nearly 82% climb.Adidas The German sportswear powerhouse has been a FIFA partner since 1970. In November 2013, Adidas signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030. Adidas stock has performed rather well since it signed its new FIFA deal. However, it is worth noting that the company’s surge currently lags rival Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) climb, which is also a major player at the World Cup in terms of team and player sponsorships.  Make sure to come back to Zacks for more 2018 World Cup business updates.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2733,MCD,"Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.’s (PLAY  -  Free Report) unique business model, rigorous sales-building initiatives and relentless expansion plans are encouraging. However, high cost of operations and the company’s limited international presence raise concerns.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company reported better-than-expected results, wherein both the top and bottom lines increased year over year. Results were aided by solid revenues generated from the Food and Beverage, as well as the Amusement and Other segments.Dave & Buster’s continues to perform well on the back of unique customizable experience that it offers across four platforms, “Eat, Drink, Play and Watch”. Backed by this exclusive experience, shares of the company have gained 22.8% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 3.8%.Distinct Business Model Favors RevenuesDave & Buster’s exclusive business model focuses on entertainment business, alongside food and beverage offerings. This dual model helps the company generate favorable store economics and strong return.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, amusement and other revenues accounted for 57.9% of total revenues, proving a major reason for its success. In fact, the segment’s revenues grew 10.4% year over year. This is because, increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company from the headwinds of consumer-discretionary spending that characterizes the restaurant industry, and is in turn driving market share and comps. Also, the shift toward increased focus on amusement is driving Dave & Buster’s earnings, given its higher-margin business. In fact, this unique model sets it apart and we expect the company’s entertainment business to carry the growth story forward.Rapid Store Openings Bode WellDave & Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined store-growth strategy in both new and existing markets, given the broad appeal of its brand. Management believes that it can roll out the concept to more than 200 units in North America over time. In the first quarter of 2018, the company opened 6 stores. Also, out of the 112 stores it currently operates, 26 stores are new. So far this year, the company already opened nine stores and has five under construction. It plans to further ride on new store growth in 2019 and early 2020.In fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to open 14-15 new stores, including two latest 17-K format stores, a combination of eight stores in the new markets for D&B, with the remaining located in markets where the brand is already established. With these new store openings, it intends to achieve a 13-14% annual unit growth rate.Meanwhile, in addition to North America’s growth potential, management is positive about the brand’s significant appeal in certain international markets. Notably, the company’s first international opening outside Canada is anticipated in 2018.High Costs Amid a Competitive Industry Hurt Dave & Buster’sHigher labor costs due to increased wages and those incurred due to implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure. This means that restaurant operators such as Dave & Buster’s that has numerous company-owned units and laborers will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs, which in turn will hurt margins.Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses.

2734,MCD,"Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 3, after market close.A unique business model with customizable guest experience across platforms gives the company a competitive edge. Dave & Buster’s also generates favorable store economics and strong returns as it offers a wide range of recreational options like games, live sports and other televised events alongside restaurant operations, as part of sales building. These are likely to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter’s sales.However, high costs associated with restaurant operations might have dented fourth-quarter earnings.Also, in a press release on Jan 8, 2018, the company revealed that it had a slower-than-expected start to the fourth quarter. Generally, restaurant sales witness an uplift in the month of December, but Dave & Buster’s trends in the month softened. This has led to management lowering the fiscal 2017 outlook.Notably, shares of the company have lost 31.1% over the last year, substantially underperforming 9.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Let’s look at how the company’s fourth-quarter results will shape up.Distinct Business Style & Sales-Building Initiatives to Aid Top LineApart from food and beverages, Dave & Buster’s entertainment business has been driving growth. In fact, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, amusement and other accounted for 55.6% of total revenues, and grew 17.1% year over year. This is because, increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company from the headwinds, pressurizing the broader restaurant industry of late, and is in turn driving market share and comps. The upward trend in sales is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $304.6 million, mirroring 12.7% year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, menu innovation is another key attributor of the riveting growth potential of the restaurant. Dave & Buster’s also drives traffic by enhancing in-store and out-of-store customer experience, via digital and mobile strategic initiatives.Rising Costs Likely to Affect MarginsLike most other restaurant operators, Dave & Buster’s has been bearing the brunt of increased labor costs from Obamacare. Further, the company’s non-franchised model makes it susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster's, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs on the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Moreover, pre-opening costs of outlets, given the company’s unit expansion plans and expenses related to sales initiatives are adding to the costs, and likely to hurt profits. Total operating costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 increased 13.1% and is expected to further rise in the to-be-reported quarter. This in turn is likely to affect margins and earnings.Subsequently, the consensus estimate for earnings in the fourth quarter is pegged at 61 cents, reflecting a 3.2% year-over-year decline.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatDave & Buster’s does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.38%.

2735,MCD,"El Pollo Loco, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of its latest restaurant.  Located at 1400 E. Beltline Rd., this marks the first restaurant to be opened in Richardson.The 2,660 square foot restaurant will be accommodating roughly 64 guests and serve the company’s signature Mexican-inspired entrees.Notably, shares of the company have lost 19.4% in the past six months against the industry’s gain of 9.3%.Continued Focus on ‘Vision Design’The new restaurant is part of El Pollo Loco’s ‘Vision Design’ initiative. Restaurants under this program offer authentic Mexican-inspired atmosphere that includes El Pollo Loco’s menu and brand identity. The restaurants also have an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of the signature dish. The company believes that its vision model will position it better in the quick-service restaurant space. According to El Polo Loco, it is witnessing encouraging results from the implementation of this model in various company-owned and franchised restaurants. The company also aims to reduce costs and drive sales through this initiative.For 2018, the El Polo Loco targets to open six to eight company-owned restaurants and six to eight new franchise locations, all of which will feature the Vision Design.Limited Expansion Poses ConcernAlthough the latest move emphasizes the company’s rigorous expansion strategy, it also shows that the company is only expanding within its domestic periphery. While other restaurant operators like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion, El Pollo Loco is losing out in terms of international presence.Wrapping UpThe move underscores El Pollo Loco’s strategies for reaching out to a greater number of customers. The distinguished menu that is served in the restaurant also shows the company’s focus on enriching guest experience to drive foot traffic and sales.El Pollo Loco’s aggressive sales building efforts like relentless focus on providing excellent service, reasonable pricing and advertising campaigns are encouraging. However, high costs related to the execution of various sales-building initiatives have kept profits under pressure.Zacks RankEl Pollo Loco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2736,MCD,"BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of its sixth restaurant in Maryland. Located in Hagerstown, the restaurant seats roughly 230 guests and features wide-ranging menu. Notably, this is the second unit opening in 2018 and the company also has plans to open its third outlet in June at Albany.Notably, for quite some time now, BJ’s Restaurants is trying to fend off competition and a difficult sales environment by focusing more on sales-building initiatives. To this end, the company had decided to put off new openings for some time but did not completely refrain from it, as a slowdown in unit growth can potentially dent the restaurant’s sales.Slowdown in Unit Growth to Aid Margins but Dent RevenuesAfter reducing the number of restaurant openings to 10 in fiscal 2017 compared with 17 in fiscal 2016, the company plans to open just four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018. The reduction in new openings is due to the company’s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives.We believe that this particular strategy of slowing down its unit growth may turn out to be favorable for the company, as it would provide some margin momentum and maximize its free cash flow. These when combined with the company’s conservative balance sheet would provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases, going forward.However, the slowdown in the company’s development plan might somewhat dent its sales growth. As it is, the company’s expanse in the global market is limited. While several other restaurant bigwigs like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) are capitalizing on the emerging market potential, BJ’s Restaurants seems to be slow on this front. We believe that the company needs to spread its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cutthroat competition in the saturated domestic market.What's the Key Growth Driver?BJ’s Restaurants implemented several major sales building initiatives that have contributed positively to the company’s first-quarter sales. With increased focus on productivity and efficiency, along with a plan of balanced restaurant opening, the company is further heading toward near and long-term operating success.The company’s key needle-moving initiatives continued to drive substantial revenues in the first quarter of 2018. In 2017, the restaurant crew mastered advanced cooking methods and also became skillful in taking orders via hand-held ordering tablets. In fact, results from these initiatives have been positive so far.Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2017, off-premise sales increased to 7% of the company’s revenues compared with its industry average of nearly 10-11%. Further, in the first quarter of 2018, BJ’s Restaurants’ off-premise business grew more than 30%, constituting 7.5% of the company’s revenues and is 150 basis points (bps) higher than the prior-year quarter. Looking at this trend, management believes that there is a tremendous opportunity for further building the off-premise part of business.Meanwhile, BJ’s Restaurants’ extensive focus on refining and streamlining its menu is the key driver for improved traffic. The company’s slow-roasted menu, launched in 2017, has become a huge success. It has significantly boosted average check, with high incident rates.Owing to such efforts, BJ’s Restaurants’ shares have returned 13.7% over the past year, outpacing the industry’s rally of 1.5%.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2737,MCD,"In an effort to restructure its U.S. business, McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) is planning a fresh round of layoff. Per The Wall Street Journal, the company has conveyed this decision to its U.S. employees, suppliers and franchisees via an email. However, McDonald's has not disclosed the exact number of layoffs. Following the news, the company’s shares increased 4.4% yesterday. In a year’s time, the stock has gained 11.9% compared with the industry’s 3.5% upside.The retrenchment — part of the restaurant’s initiatives to reduce costs by $500 million — is expected to be achieved by the end of 2019.  McDonald’s spokesperson, Terri Hickey said “We are putting into place a new U.S. field structure that will better support our franchisees and will ensure McDonald’s continues on a path to being more dynamic, nimble and competitive. These planned actions are consistent with our previously announced $500M G&A targeted savings, which we expect to achieve by the end of 2019”.McDonald’s is likely to reveal more details on this matter on Jun 12. Through this restructuring initiative the quick service restaurant targets to improve its profitability. Of late, McDonald’s margins have been under pressure due to wage increases globally. This apart, additional health care costs related to ‘Obamacare’ in the United States led to an increase in labor costs.Furthermore, costs related to brand positioning in all key markets and ongoing investments would continue to weigh on margins at least in the near term. Increased commodity costs may further pressurize margins. In the first quarter of, consolidated margins contracted 150 bps to 16% due to China/Hong Kong transaction in 2017 and wage increase.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is consistently trying to regain consumer confidence and revive sales in all its served markets through menu innovations and promotions.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Wingstop Inc.

2738,MCD,"Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR  -  Free Report) has been undertaking various sales-boosting initiatives that should continue to drive the company’s top line.However, intense competition and tricky consumer demand continue to be potential headwinds. The company’s shares have lost 7% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 1.8%. Moreover, downward estimate revisions for the current quarter reflect ongoing pessimism in the stock’s prospects. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have gone down 6% over the past month.Sales-Building Efforts to Drive Top-Line GrowthRestaurant Brands continues to focus on improving its level of service through comprehensive training, improved restaurant operations, reimaging efforts and attractive menu options to enhance overall guest satisfaction, and thereby drive comps. It believes that new product development is a key driver of long-term success for its brands, and will continue to be in focus in 2018 and beyond.This is expected to drive traffic of the company by expanding its customer base, spreading out into new dayparts, and continuing to build brand leadership in food quality and taste.The company has unwavering focus on its goal to drive traffic and revenues at its restaurants through core product platforms, continual focus on a balanced menu design, expansion of delivery business, promotional offerings, efforts to grow breakfast daypart and product launches. Growth across each of its breakfast, lunch and dinner dayparts, supported by new products, is driving incremental sales at Tim Hortons restaurants. Its coffee, cold beverage, wraps and breakfast sandwich platforms, particularly continue to reflect strength.In 2017, the company launched espresso-based beverages in all Tim Hortons restaurants across Canada. Management expects this platform to continue growing, given the meaningful innovation it can introduce around its base products.Restaurant Brands is also taking initiatives to re-image its restaurants to a more modern décor. In March 2018, Restaurant Brands announced a new Tim Hortons restaurant design called the welcome image, which entails a redesign of Tim Hortons restaurants. The company plans to re-image a majority of its restaurants across Canada over the next four years.Franchised Model Safeguards Earnings but Limits OperationsGiven that almost 100% of Restaurant Brands’ current system-wide restaurants are franchised, its expenses are considerably low. Since the company signs franchise agreements for all its restaurants instead of operating them itself, this puts the cost burden on the franchisees that operate the businesses.Thus, the reduced capital requirements are expected to facilitate earnings growth and ROE expansion for the company. Notably, Restaurant Brands have witnessed year-over-year earnings growth in each of the trailing four quarters.However, despite such positives, a fully-franchised model has its share of drawbacks and risks. Under this business model, the company’s prospects depend on its ability to attract new franchisees for all its brands, and the willingness of the franchisees to open restaurants in the existing and new markets. The company has a limited influence over its franchisees, as a result of which its ability to control its restaurants’ operations, and implement operational initiatives and business strategies is restricted.Cutthroat Competition Remains a HeadwindIntense competition among fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, food quality, service, location and concept, which may in turn impact Restaurant Brands’ revenues. The company is increasingly facing competitive pressure from restaurant bigwigs like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino's (DPZ  -  Free Report) and YUM! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report).If this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains, it has high chances of fading out like many other restaurant retailers.

2739,MCD,"Shares of integration software maker MuleSoft  soared more than 20% in early afternoon trading Tuesday after news reports suggested that it was in advanced talks to be acquired by cloud computing giant Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report).Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters said Tuesday that Salesforce is interested in buying MuleSoft in order to bolster its offerings beyond customer relations software. The deal could be worth up to $6 billion and would represent Salesforce’s largest acquisition ever, the report said.Reuters also mentioned that the move would underscore Chief Executive March Benioff’s desire to supplement his company’s cloud-based solutions with new technology. The publication’s sources said that the deal could be announced as soon as this week, although an agreement is not yet certain.What Is MuleSoft?MuleSoft designs platforms for connecting applications, data, and devices. The company’s “Anypoint” technology was described as a “disruptive” force within the enterprise software market in a recent note from analysts at Nomura.“With a large potential TAM and product capabilities well ahead of the competition, MULE is poised to continue to gain share against the legacy incumbents in the integration software market,” the analysts said.Based in San Francisco, MuleSoft has already attracted interest from Salesforce in the past. Salesforce Ventures, the cloud firm’s venture capital wing, led a $128 million funding round for the software company back in 2015.MuleSoft claims more than 1,000 customers, including major clients like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), and Spotify. MuleSoft’s solutions help companies’ own networks run faster, making them ideal for businesses that are not yet prepared for a full transition to the cloud.Why Does It Matter?Salesforce currently claims about 18% of the global CRM software market, but the company likely senses that its strongest growth potential lies outside of its current area of expertise. As companies of all shapes and sizes prepare for the next generation of technology, firms like MuleSoft—which promise to make this evolution more painless—should be extremely beneficial.Want more market analysis from this author?

Currently, the program has 8 million members including 2 million that were added in 2017.Also, it is encouraging customers to use the DD Card and enroll as Perks members so that they can benefit from the convenience offered by the On-the-Go platform. This makes it easier for the company to retain customers. It is using speed of service as a key differentiator against competition to ensure comps growth and store level profitability.Moreover, re-franchising a large chunk of its system reduces Dunkin' Brands’ capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Meanwhile, free cash flow continues to grow, facilitating reinvestment to increase brand recognition and shareholders’ return. Notably, since a major portion of its business is re-franchised, Dunkin’ Brands is less affected by food cost inflation compared to its peers.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.

In addition, companies like Jack in the Box (JACK  -  Free Report) and McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) are gaining traction with their breakfast platter, which in turn is weighing on Dunkin' Brands breakfast segment revenues.Over the past few quarters, weak traffic due to soft consumer demand and sluggish comps growth in restaurants have also affected the company’s performance.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Earnings also declined 22.2% year over year.

2743,MCD,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is set to report its first-quarter 2018 financial numbers on Apr 30, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 7.6%. Also, McDonald's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.6%.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether McDonald's will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $1.67, higher than $1.47 in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company’s witnessed earnings growth of 19% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $4,915 million, down more than 13% from the prior-year quarter.  Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up this earnings season.Comps Growth to ContinueMcDonald’s, which has reported comparable sales growth for 10 straight quarters, is likely to continue the uptrend in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, the company has been increasingly focusing on growing guest traffic in a bid to boost comps growth. In this regard, McDonald’s is striving to achieve operational excellence, innovate, offer a value menu and roll out more limited-time offerings. Also, the company expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth over the long term.Meanwhile, McDonald’s is consistently trying to improve its performance in the International Lead Markets, which include Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK. The company intends to drive comps growth in these markets through introduction of value meals, customizing the menu to local customer tastes, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery.McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteRevenue Woes to LingerDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, a challenging restaurant environment might lead to a decline in revenues at the U.S. segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at this segment is pegged at $1.81 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 5.8%.Also, revenues from High-Growth Markets are likely to witness a sharp decline of 42% to $891 million. Political and economic unrest are likely hurt sales. Coming to international lead market, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.64 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 0.4%.At the company-operated restaurants, revenues are likely to continue decreasing in the to-be-reported quarter. In fourth- and third-quarter 2017, revenues from the same have witnessed a sharp decline of 26.8% and 23%, respectively. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.45 billion for the quarter under review, mirroring a year-over-year decline of 27.3%.Re-franchising Strategy Safeguards EarningsManagement’s re-franchising strategy involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants. The reduction in ownership, i.e. re-franchising, weighs on near-term revenues as it replaces company-operated sales by franchised sales. However, over the long term, McDonald’s is expected to reduce the company’s capital requirements and facilitate earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. In fact, owing to re-franchising and stringent spending, the company expects to achieve approximately $500 million of net annual savings on SG&A expenses by 2019, of which $300 million has been realized in 2017.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that McDonald’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   McDonald’s has an Earnings ESP of -0.10%.

QuoteDetailed Revenue Discussion by SegmentsRestaurant Brands operates through three segments — Tim Hortons, Burger King and Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen.Tim Hortons reported revenues of $763.5 million, reflecting a rise of 4.1% from the prior-year quarter, primarily owing to greater franchise and property revenues. Under the previous standards of accounting, total revenues declined 3% year over year, primarily reflecting a decrease in supply chain-related revenues, partially offset by a favorable impact of FX movements.System-wide sales increased 2.1% on the back of net restaurant growth. Comps at this segment declined 0.3% in the quarter versus 0.1% decrease in the prior-year quarter and 0.1% increase in the preceding quarter.

Considering the previous accounting standard, total revenues in the quarter grew 9.7%.System-wide sales rose 11.3%, higher than 6.2% growth in the year-ago comparable period and 12.3% increase in the preceding quarter. System-wide sales growth can be attributed to net restaurant growth of 6.9% and positive comps growth.Comps grew 3.8% in the quarter under review versus 0.1% decline in the prior-year quarter and 4.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The upside was driven by U.S. comps growth of 4.2%.Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen, which was acquired on Mar 27, 2017, reported revenues of $100.4 million in the quarter.System-wide sales rose 10.9%, owing to net restaurant growth of 6.7% and comps growth of 3.2%.

Segment wise, Tim Hortons EBITDA fell 2.2% (6.1% on an FX neutral basis) year over year due to a decline in revenues. Burger King’s EBITDA was up 14.9% (11.5% on an FX neutral basis) year over year, driven primarily by revenue growth and cost control. Popeye’s EBITDA grew 80.5% (on both actual and organic count) on revenue growth.Cash and Capital The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $852.4 million under the new accounting standard. Accounts and notes receivable balance was $467.6 million and inventories were $74.6 million.

2745,MCD,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017.Pro-forma earnings of 11 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents by 10%. Earnings, however, fell 8.3% from the year-ago level, partly due to high expenses related to the impairment of assets.Total revenues increased 2.9% year over year to $95.2 million and surpassed the consensus estimate of $95 million. The revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in company-operated restaurants sales.The company’s aggressive sales building efforts like relentless focus on providing excellent service, reasonable pricing and advertising campaigns have favored the top-line growth.

However, five restaurants were closed down during the same time period that somewhat affected the company-operated restaurant revenues.Comps at the company-operated restaurants increased 0.9% in the quarter, driven by 1.9% growth in average check, partially offset by 1% decline in transactions.Fourth-quarter franchise revenues decreased 1.5% year over year to $5.9 million due to a fall in franchise and development agreement fees but was partially offset by the contribution from 14 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016. A 1.9% increase in franchise comps also positively affected franchise revenues.System-wide comps increased 1.4% from the prior-year quarter.Expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and Net IncomeTotal expenses in the fourth quarter amounted to $104.9 million, up 15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The rise in expenses was largely due to 23% increase in general and administrative expenses.Also, during the quarter, the company recorded a $16.4 million expense related to the impairment of the assets of 11 restaurants in Texas and one in Arizona, net of closed-store reserve.Adjusted EBITDA (Expense Before Interest Tax Depreciation Amortization) in the quarter came in at $13.4 million, a 6.3% year-over-year decline.Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $38 thousand against net income of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Dec 27, 2017 totaled $8.6 million, up from $2.2 million as of Dec 28, 2016.

2746,MCD,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) has been grappling with declining sales for quite some time. A challenging sales environment in the U.S. restaurant space has resulted in constant deceleration of comps whereas high costs associated with restaurant operations have been potential headwinds for the company.However, Jack in the Box recently reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16% and increased nearly 15% year over year on margin improvement, driven by refranchising.Notably, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past year. While the industry gained 13.1%, Jack in the Box’s shares fell 7.6%. Moreover, earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 have gone down 11.2% over the past two months, reflecting ongoing pessimism in the stock’s prospects.Declining Comps Pose ConcernOwing to soft consumer demand, the company’s sales have come under pressure. Comps at Jack in the Box company stores inched up 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s rise of 0.6%. Same-store sales at franchised stores dipped 0.3%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 3.9% in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, system-wide same-store sales fell 0.2% against a rise of 3.1% in the comparable period last year.Qdoba generated a net loss of $0.6 million in the quarter against net earnings of $1.4 million in the prior-year quarter.High Costs Amid Stiff Competition is ChallengingJack in the Box has been bearing the brunt of high costs associated with restaurant operations. Costs related to marketing initiatives, unit expansion and opening of catering call centers are keeping the company’s profits under pressure. Moreover, the company is also shouldering higher labor costs due to the implementation of The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which is expected to have an adverse impact on margins, going forward.Meanwhile, American dining brands are keen on expanding in the fast-growing emerging markets. While several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened outlets in the emerging markets; Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front.Thus, limited international presence might be a big disadvantage for the company and hurt its competitive position. Moreover, the company is experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.Franchise Business & Strategic Sell Out of Qdoba are RespitesJack in the Box restaurants are currently 89% franchised, which the company plans to increase to around 95% by the end of fiscal 2018. We believe, franchising a large chunk of its system will lower its general and administrative expenses and thereby boost earnings. Moreover, over the long term, it would generate a higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements. This would also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholder return.Also, given poor restaurant level execution at the company’s legendary Qdoba chain, management made a strategic decision to sell the brand. In the fiscal first quarter, the company signed an agreement to sell Qdoba to Apollo Global Management, LLC. The transaction, however, is expected to close by April 2018.We believe that by selling the brand, the company will free itself from the burden of operating under two business models, which have been more of a drag in the recent past.Zacks RankJack in the Box carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

2747,MCD,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) has been bearing the brunt of high costs and soft consumer demand that is currently characterizing the U.S. restaurant space. In order to counter these challenges, the company has undertaken various sales driving and cost cutting initiatives that seem encouraging.Recently, this burger giant reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, where adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents by 41.8% and jumped a significant 122.9% year over year. The company has a good track record of earnings surprises in the recent past, wherein reported earnings have beat/met consensus estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 23.17%.Also, Red Robin’s shares have increased 18.6% in the past year, outpacing the industry’s gain of 11.9%. Given its prudent growth initiatives, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company should keep performing well in the quarters ahead. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Initiatives to Increase Traffic & Sales EncouragingWith a viable business strategy, Red Robin has seen an uptick in revenues over the past few years. Despite a sluggish economic environment, the company has been posting year-over-year revenue growth since 2013.This is attributable to the company’s various traffic and sales building efforts, which also include consistent digital initiatives. In fact, owing to menu innovation, value offerings, increasing service speed, effective marketing strategy, remodeling programs and online ordering business, the company witnessed 17.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. To drive traffic and sales, Red Robin has improved its seating efficiency and lowered guests’ waiting times. Moreover, it has rolled out its Kitchen Display System (KDS) that is linked to table management software. This is expected to result in annual sales growth of approximately $50 million as kitchens can handle higher peak volumes.The company’s remodeling initiatives are expected to boost its potential as a brand as well as improve guest experience, which in turn should drive revenues. Among the brand revitalization initiatives, the company is focused on menu innovation, operational improvement and making a better customer service platform.In addition, Red Robin focuses on promotional and limited-time offers to increase revenues. Moreover, key long-term growth driver for the company is its guest loyalty program — Red Robin Royalty — initiated in 2011 with a goal to increase guest count. The company engages its guests through this program with offers designed to increase frequency of visits.Furthermore, the company is set to grow its off-premise, online-ordering business via carry-out, delivery and catering. The growing demand for off-premise orders are resulting in higher traffic. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Red Robin delivered 8.3% mix in off-premise, up 45% year over year.On the delivery front, the company has partnerships with Amazon, DoorDash and GrubHub. In fact, it is working with each provider to better integrate into its POS and KDS systems and ease the intricacy in operations teams. Also, curbside delivery is now available at more than 60% of its locations. The company is thus moving smartly on new revenue streams and expects off-premise orders to become growth engine in the long run as it begins to actively promote the new offerings, reach more guests, thereby driving improved profitability.Strategic Moves to Counter High CostsRed Robin witnessed rising costs and expenses throughout the majority of 2017, mainly due to higher labor costs. The company is also investing heavily in several sales building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades, which will result in elevated costs. Remodeling and restaurant maintenance also add to the already rising expenses.In order to cut these high costs and improve margins, Red Robin outlined a go-forward plan known as RED2. The primary objective of this initiative is doubling the company’s EBITDA by 2020. The company is focusing on new supply chain management software, replacing its older manual system. This would result in improved control of waste and cost of goods, significantly reducing inventory levels at the restaurants.Notably, in the last reported quarter, restaurant-level operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) to 20.5% due to controlled expenses under the company’s strategic plans.Limited International Presence & Domestic Contraction Pose ConcernsAmerican dining brands are keen to expand in the fast-growing emerging markets outside the United States. While several other restaurateurs, including Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report), have opened their outlets in the emerging markets; Red Robin seems to be weak on this front. Also, due to insufficient profit generation, the company has given up on its Burger Works fast-casual concept, a small non-traditional prototype with limited menu and services.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2748,MCD,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.’s (CBRL  -  Free Report) multiple sales boosting and cost-cutting initiatives are impressive. However, rising labor costs amid a tepid sales environment along with limited geographical presence remain potent headwinds for the company.Recently, Cracker Barrel posted strong second-quarter fiscal 2018 results wherein both the top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this quarter marked the 27th successive earnings beat. However, the company reported lower-than-expected revenues in 11 of the last 12 quarters.Sales Boosting and Cost-Cutting Initiatives are Major TailwindsCracker Barrel uses seasonal promotions and limited time offers to boost its top-line performance by attracting both regular users and less-frequent guests. Moving ahead, the company aims to continue investing in new product news that will drive business frequency.In fiscal 2018, Cracker Barrel aims to meet consumers' needs for convenience via growth in its off-premise business. Also, the company plans to enhance its off-premise platform by introducing new catering menu offering and the in-store training of hourly employees. In fiscal 2017, Cracker Barrel tested and enhanced off-premise platform in roughly 100 stores and completed its system-wide rollout of the off-premise platform by fiscal first-quarter of 2018. Apart from new product offering, the test featured value messaging across four weeks of local television and in-store advertising. Further, it intends to extend the test with additional markets and television weeks from January to March.Coming to menu innovation, the company recently introduced a coffee platform in approximately 40 stores. It believes that the platform will complement the strength of its breakfast all day offering, drive check favorability and promote guest perceptions of menu variety. The rollout of the crafted coffee program at all stores is expected to be complete by the end of fiscal third quarter.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Quote Additionally, Cracker Barrel has an effective cost-cutting mechanism in place. In fact, the company undertakes various measures to keep costs under control. In the beginning of fiscal 2017, the company targeted to reduce annual operating cost by $15 million to $20 million. It delivered 15% above the high end of its fiscal-year target and achieved its three-year strategic goal of removing $50 million in annual cost from the business by fiscal 2017-end. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to deliver between $7 million and $8 million in annual cost savings.Rising Cost and Limited Geographic Diversity Remain OverhangsDespite the company’s efficient cost-saving methods, higher labor costs and expenses related to various sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on its margins. Subsequently, Cracker Barrel’s shares have gained just 1.2% in a year’s time, significantly underperforming the 11.5% gain of the industry it belongs to. Although Cracker Barrel has a substantial domestic presence, it loses out on international front. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion strategies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak on this front.Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic. Also, Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been negatively impacted by challenges in the retail industry. Thus, the company’s top line is likely to remain under pressure.Cracker Barrel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2749,MCD,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) announced three strategic initiatives in order to accelerate growth and drive its shareholders’ value in the long run, which are also expected to favor both the top and bottom lines of the company.However, shares declined 1.3% in after-hours trading as the company revealed plans of shutting down a few stores in the United States. The company’s U.S. market is currently over-penetrated and stores are cannibalizing each other. Hence, Starbucks is trying to optimize its store in the United States.Let’s take a detailed look at the company’s announced streamline strategies.Strengthening Brand FootprintUnder these initiatives, the company is primarily focusing on increasing its growth rate in the United States and China. Additionally, through Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle, Starbucks plans to expand its footprint in Consumer-Packaged Goods (“CPG”) and Foodservice, adding opportunity for another 5 million points in 189 countries. The company is also focusing on increasing its shareholders’ value.Restructuration of U.S. Store PortfolioGauging its recent decelerating performance in the United States, the company has decided to augment its U.S. store portfolio in fiscal 2019. Management’s strategies will include shifting of new company-operated stores to underpenetrated markets and a slowdown in licensed store growth. Starbucks announced that it would close 150 U.S. stores in the densely penetrated markets in fiscal 2019. This would be nearly triple the number it usually shutters annually. The overall number of stores will continue to increase, but their growth will somewhat slow down.  Moreover, the company’s Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues), posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Americas segment posted 2% comps growth, down from 3% in the year-ago period. Consequently, over the past year, the company’s shares have lost 4.6% against the industry’s rally of 5.3%.Innovation in Product & Digital Capabilities to Drive Top-Line GrowthStarbucks continues to prioritize product innovation across core beverages while leveraging the strength of its tea and refreshment category, demanded by health-conscious customers. Additionally, under its strategic priorities, the company is digging deeper into its digital capabilities to connect with existing and new customers. The company announced the addition of 5 million new digitally registered customers since April 2018 and 2 million active Starbucks Rewards members. The company’s loyalty membership had reached 15 million in April, up 13% year over year.As it is, Starbucks holds a leading position in digital, card, loyalty and mobile capabilities. The company’s mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used means of mobile payment in the United States. Strengthening of such digital initiatives is expected to quicken service, increase convenience and enhance customer loyalty, thereby driving mobile payment transactions and spurring traffic.In fact, the company mentioned that it expects digital initiatives to contribute one to two points of comps growth in the United States in fiscal 2019. Also, the company expects 1% comps growth globally in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Efforts to Enhance Profitability & Shareholders’ ReturnThe company believes that the above-mentioned initiatives would help it generate enhanced returns. Management expects to return roughly $25 billion in cash to its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020, up $10 billion from the previously announced cash return in November 2017.Starbucks’ Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the company’s regular quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of 36 cents per share payable on Aug 24, 2018, to its shareholders of record as of Aug 9, 2018. This represents the eighth annual increase in the company’s regular quarterly dividend.The company is also trying to improve G&A efficiency by consulting third parties to figure out the growing areas of opportunity.Our TakeWhile Starbucks’ increased focus on innovation and shareholder-friendly approach encourages us, it is yet to be seen if the company’s decision of shutting down stores will bring any long-term synergies or not. Moreover, increasing competition from both upscale coffee houses, and lower-priced fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN  -  Free Report) has been a potential threat to the company’s top line.Also, Starbucks is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending. Therefore, the company’s strategic priorities are the need of the hour so that it can tread back on growth trajectory.Starbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the restaurant space include Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report). Carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Domino’s earnings for 2018 are expected to grow 52.2%.

2750,MCD,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia is less than a week away, with the first game between the host country and Saudi Arabia scheduled to kick off at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, June 14 on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). Now that World Cup fever has started to truly set in, let’s take a look at how some of the biggest FIFA and World Cup sponsors have performed.FIFA, which stands for the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, currently offers companies the chance to become official partners, World Cup sponsors, or regional sponsors. It is unclear exactly how much these official FIFA partners pay, but the federation reportedly grabbed $1.58 billion in marketing dollars alone for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.There are currently seven FIFA partners for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup cycle. This list includes Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways. Meanwhile, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), along with a few others, are official 2018 World Cup sponsors.FIFA’s pitch is simple: “The World Cup is the most effective international marketing platform, reaching millions of people in over 200 countries throughout the world.” So, with all that said, let’s take a look at how some of FIFA’s biggest publicly traded marketing and advertising sponsors are doing.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has been associated with FIFA since 1974. The company signed a 16-year extension with FIFA in 2005, which takes it through the 2022 World Cup—a deal the beverage giant made before it even knew where the 2018 and 2022 tournaments would be held. Investors will note that Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 since it signed its latest extension. More recently, KO stock has done dramatically worse than the index, up just 5.5% over the last five years against the index’s nearly 73% climb. Over the last year, Coca-Cola stock is down 3.7% as consumers’ drinking habits shift.VisaMoving on, Visa landed a deal with FIFA in 2007 that gave it the rights to become an official sponsor starting in 2010, replacing Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). The credit card giant is now a partner and has signed on through 2022.Unlike Coca-Cola, Visa stock has soared since it became a FIFA sponsor. Clearly, there are many other factors involved, but it is interesting all the same, and also highlights why many question the real value of sports sponsorships.Adidas The German sportswear powerhouse has been a FIFA partner since 1970. In November 2013, Adidas signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030. Adidas stock has performed rather well since the 2014 World Cup. It is also worth noting that the company’s surge outpaces rival Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) roughly 95% climb. Fox & TelemundoLastly, let’s look at two of the integral parts of the tournament, Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two giants won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the United States, paying roughly $1 billion combined. Fox reportedly agreed to pay more than $400 million, with Telemundo dropping $600 million. Clearly, both Fox and Telemundo’s parent company Comcast have performed rather well since the two companies signed their massive World Cup deals back in 2011. It will also certainly be fun to see how Fox’s World Cup coverage performs, especially since the U.S. men’s team didn’t qualify for the first time since 1986.Make sure to come back to Zacks for more 2018 World Cup business updates. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2751,MCD,"Yum China Holdings, Inc. (YUMC  -  Free Report), the largest restaurant company in China, is gaining solid momentum backed by a strong brand recognition. Following the separation from its parent company, Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), Yum China has been leveraging the power of its two most important brands — KFC and Pizza Hut — to drive long-term growth.The company’s shares have gained 0.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.3%.  Earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have also gone up 20.7% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the future earnings potential of the company. Also, Yum China surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 6.74%.However, increased costs from labor, rent and operational initiatives may hurt the company’s margins. Also, a limited franchised business model remains a concern.Initiatives to Drive the Top LineYum China is focused on relentless unit growth of its restaurants in order to drive incremental sales. In the first quarter of 2018, the company opened 203 new restaurants and remodeled 125. The company currently possesses five restaurants per one million people in China, which is expected to grow to 15 stores per million.Moreover, there is ample potential to grow the restaurant base to triple its current size, given the continued growth of the middle-class discretionary spending. In fact, the company increased its new store-opening target from the range of 550-600 to the band of 600-650 in 2018, reflecting 9% unit growth.Another riveting growth potential of Yum China resides in its continual menu innovation to encourage top-line growth. KFCs extraordinary performance is attributable to greater sales of menu offerings like crayfish burger, stuffed chicken wing and spicy chicken burger. Apart from such consumer-preferred food items, the company also offers signature menus for Chinese New Year.Yum China is also serving coffee across its restaurants and expanding the dessert category. In the first quarter of 2018, Matcha chocolate ice cream was launched and more new flavors are lined up for launch this year.Yum China holds a leadership position in the Chinese restaurant space when it comes to delivery, mobile order and pay, and loyalty membership. The company is increasingly shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand its customer base.In the first quarter of 2018, delivery represented 14% of the sales, up 39% year over year. More than 3,300 stores across 917 cities offer delivery services. The company also expanded its delivery for breakfast and late-night dayparts. Meanwhile, the KFC Prime delivery, launched in the fourth quarter of 2017, is expected to reap additional benefits. The service offers its members with unlimited free delivery for 30 days at a subscription fee of 18 yen.Coming to loyalty membership, Yum Brands created a robust loyalty program that has more than 120 million members combining both the brands. Backed by delivery and digital sales, the company’s loyalty membership increased at a high double digit year over year for both the brands in the first quarter of 2018.Increasing Costs & Lesser Focus on Franchising HurtYum China is facing structural high cost of labor and rentals. Apart from wage inflation, the company is also bearing additional costs stemming from promotion, menu innovation and technological novelty. In order to curb labor cost, the company is increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is again expected to curb its margins in the near term. Also, costs related to transactions and franchises are expected to gear up in the near future.Notably, in the first quarter of 2018, total costs and expenses increased 12% year over year, due to a 20% increase in restaurant expenses, 18% rise in general and administrative expenses and 12% hike in franchise expenses. Restaurant margin in the quarter came in at 17.9%, reflecting a 250-basis point decline from the year-ago quarter. The fall in restaurant margin was due to the investment in product upgrades, and promotions at Pizza Hut and its sales deleverage.Also, unlike its major peers like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report), the majority of Yum China restaurants are company owned. This makes the restaurants susceptible to increased expenses. Hence, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, by not signing enough franchise agreements, is unable to put the burden of costs onto the franchisees and is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.

2752,MCD,"Investors in McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 8, 2018 $115 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for McDonald's shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, McDonald's is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Restaurants industry that ranks in the Bottom 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.93 per share to $1.94 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about McDonald's right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2753,MCD,"Shares of McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) climbed over 1.80% on Monday, just one trading day after a significant downgrade led to a relatively large sell-off and extended the stock’s slump. Even with today’s gains, MCD is down about 15% over the last month and a half.RBC Capital Market analysts lowered their McDonald's price target to $170 per share from $190 per share on Friday. The analysts also reduced their fiscal 2018 EPS forecast by $0.17 per share, and lowered their first-quarter U.S. same-store sales growth outlook to 1% from 3.5%.“We significantly lower our US SSS (same-store sales) expectations due to deteriorating industry conditions and a disappointing early sales impact from the $1, $2, $3 value menu,"" analyst David Palmer wrote in a note to clients.Despite RBC’s negative short-term outlook, the firm still has long-term faith in the fast-food giant, noting that it believes “the chain has ample opportunities to course correct and re-accelerate SSS growth in the coming quarters.”Credit Suisse analysts backed up this positive long-term sentiment on Monday. Analysts reaffirmed their $191 per share McDonald's price target, which represents a roughly 29% upside from Friday's closing price.Credit Suisse analysts also don’t seem to be reading too much into McDonald’s subdued early first-quarter sales results. The firm compared McDonald’s new low-cost menu with the original Dollar Menu’s initial slow traction.On top of that, Credit Suisse noted that it believes McDonald’s can deliver solid same-store sales growth this year.“The last time MCD traded at these valuation levels was in ~late 2016 as investors feared a slowdown in US SSS,” analyst Jason West wrote in a note to clients Monday. “We believe the business is in a much better place than it was a few years ago, so the current correction seems overly punitive if it's due to short-term sales concerns.”Other Fundamentals Along with its new $1, $2, $3 value menu, McDonalds has another big plan to boost sales. The restaurant chain’s “Better Chicken” project aims to increase its chicken-related offerings, with a focus on better quality food in order to fend off competition from Chick-fil-A and others.On the promotional front, McDonald’s announced a new multi-year Happy Meal collaboration with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) at the end of February. The deal centers around a commitment to improve nutritional standards and will include toy releases from Pixar, Disney Live Action, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm. This new partnership is set to kick off in June with Incredibles 2 promotions.McDonald’s is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and analyst sentiment has been on the rise recently. McDonald’s has earned significant earnings estimate revisions with 100% agreement to the upside for the company’s current quarter, the following quarter, the current fiscal year, and the following year.The fast-food power is projected to see its Q1 earnings surge by 14.29%, based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate. MCD’s full-year 2018 earnings are expected to surge nearly 15% year-over-year. Looking to fiscal 2019, the company is projected to see its EPS figure hit $8.31 per share, which would mark an additional 8.61% climb over our current 2018 projections.McDonald’s is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 9% over the next three to five years, which is strong for a company of its size and age that has been forced to adapt amid changing consumer habits.Lastly, as the recent Credit Suisse analyst report alluded to, McDonald’s stock price currently sits roughly 18% below its 52-week high, which means now might be a good time to consider buying MCD on the dip.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2754,MCD,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened more than 200 points lower on Friday morning, adding to the previous session’s 400-point loss and bringing the index down about 3% over the past week. Investors continue to show concern about President Trump’s plans to implement new steel and aluminum tariffs, while Dow fixture McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) sunk on the back of a cautious analyst note.RBC Capital lowered its price target for MCD to $170 per share from $190, citing disappointing early sales from the restaurant chain’s new value menu items.“We significantly lower our US SSS expectations due to deteriorating industry conditions and a disappointing early sales impact from the $1, $2, $3 menu,” wrote RBC analyst David Palmer.Nevertheless, RBC Capital’s updated call still represents a nearly 10% upside from Thursday’s close, and the firm maintains its “Outperform” rating for the fast-foot behemoth.MCD opened at $148.91 per share, down about 5%. That sluggish open made it the worst morning performer in the Dow, although the index is bleeding from many directions on Friday. Other significant losers include Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), which lost about 3% in early trading, and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), which shed nearly 2%.The markets continue to react after President Trump said Thursday that the U.S. will implement tariffs on steel and aluminum imports next week, causing many investors to fear an impending trade war.“That could really spook the market,” Chaikin Analytics CEO Marc Chaikin told CNBC. “The biggest wildcard would be a trade war and nobody should be excited for that.”Want more market analysis from this author?

2755,MCD,"Market futures are generously in the green in the first pre-market trading day of the week, even with no major national economic data or quarterly earnings reports from marquee names on the S&P 500. Yet talk over this past weekend from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — that offsetting tariffs between the U.S. and China are being put on hold — looks to have generated a pleasant sigh of relief from traders early today.In fact, Mnuchin said the tariff dispute was never a “trade war,” as some have glibly named it — it’s only ever been a “trade dispute.” And, for now, both sides have decided to postpone enacting tariffs on each other’s goods, which removes one dark cloud from the economic landscape, at least in the present. U.S. farmers, as well as American companies that do lots of business in China, like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report), all look toward a near-term benefit in share prices.At this hour, we are seeing implied opens on our main indexes in solid green territory: the Dow has an implied open of +230, the Nasdaq +50 and the S&P 500 +15. That said, with a real dearth of economic indicators for the rest of the day — indeed, we don’t even get the latest PMI data (Manufacturing and Services) until Wednesday of this week — any further news on this front or elsewhere may have an opportunity to shift investor focus one direction or the other. Should Mnuchin’s comforting words remain the principle narrative today, we don’t really see much drag on current index valuations.This morning’s Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) report for April was released this morning, with a slight beat sequentially and higher than expectations. Growth of 0.34% eked out a narrow margin over March’s 0.32%, whereas analyst had been looking for 0.25%. The index is a survey taking into account 85 separate national indicators concerning things like production, employment and consumption. As such, it is an economic metric like many others we track, and again we see modest growth without much strain from inflation.We hope the newsworthiness of market activity picks up this week, in order to better serve our readers in making sound investment decisions. in the meantime, please check out Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank’s latest Global Week Ahead article: More Populism and More Inexperience

2756,MCD,"McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) consistent efforts to improve sales and digital initiatives, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States are likely to boost its performance.In 2017, the company’s stock has gained 8.6% compared with the industry’s increase of 1.7%. However, dwindling top line and higher labor costs might dent its performance. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystsMcDonald’s reported better-than-expected earnings for the 15th straight quarter, when it posted first-quarter 2018 results. Moreover, in the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.5%. Robust operating performance drove McDonald’s earnings during the first quarter.Further, the company’s sales boosting initiatives are resulting in increased global comparable sales (comps). In first-quarter 2018, comps grew 5.5% and marked its 11th straight quarter of positive comps. Also, guest counts rose by 0.8%. Notably, the first quarter marked McDonald’s fifth straight quarter, wherein the company’s global guest counts improved on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, U.S comps were up 2.9% in the same period.We are impressed with this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s digital initiatives to better serve customers, with nearly all of its U.S. restaurants using digital menu boards. Additionally, McDonald’s continues to roll out mobile order and pay with a new curbside check-in option. Currently, it has launched the option in nearly all 20,000 U.S. restaurants. The company is increasingly focusing on delivery for customers' benefit as well.In fact, McDonald’s is the world’s largest chain of fast-food restaurants, with presence in more than 100 countries. Its offerings have reached the billion-dollar brand status through sustained product innovation and geographic expansion. With an almost 10% share of the global informal-eating-out market, there is ample scope for the company to grow in the future as it boasts a scale advantage compared with its peers.Moreover, increasing guest counts remains the company’s top priority. McDonald’s also intends to regain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value. ConcernsMcDonald’s revenues have been declining for quite some time. In the first quarter, the metric decreased  9% year over year, following a respective decline of 11.4%, 13%, 7% and 4.7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarter of 2017. The downturn reflects the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative. Also, revenues at company-operated restaurants were down 26% year over year to $2,535.6 million. However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants increased 15% to $2,603.3 million.Further, higher labor costs might keep the company’s margins under pressure. In the first quarter, consolidated margins contracted 150 bps to 16% due to China/Hong Kong transaction in 2017 and wage increase. Moreover, with about 40% of McDonald’s operating income coming from the international lead segment and over 10% from the high-growth markets, its earnings remain vulnerable to negative currency translation.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Wingstop Inc. (WING  -  Free Report), Dine Brands Global, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report) and Denny's Corporation (DENN  -  Free Report). While Wingstop sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Dine Brands and Denny's carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wingstop has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 19.5%.Dine Brands Global has reported better-than-expected earnings in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 7.8%.Denny's has reported better-than-expected earnings in the preceding two quarters.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2757,MCD,"Welcome to the latest episode of the of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. With the 2018 FIFA World Cup underway, Ben Rains dives into why it is so important that the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America. Rains then discusses all of the latest happenings in the sports betting world, as more companies get in on the action.The U.S. didn’t make the World Cup for the first time since 1986, which will likely impact Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) coverage this summer. However, the company also holds the rights to the 2022 and 2026 World Cups, along with Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The 2026 bid was a little shady and upset the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and others—helping FIFA live up to its somewhat poor reputation.But with the United States set to host 60 games in 2026—many of which are likely to be in primetime—in what will be the first 48-team World Cup, Fox and Telemundo look to be the clear winners. More matches, more teams, and primetime games will likely attract many more companies on top of the major players Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY, and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Moving onto sports betting, a small soccer related partnership between William Hill WIMHY and Las Vegas Lights FC, of the United Soccer League USL, will see the betting company become the soccer team’s official sports book. The deal will allow fans to make live in-game bets through William Hill’s mobile app—partnerships like this are sure to become more commonplace as legalized sports betting becomes more popular.Sports gambling is now up and running in Delaware and New Jersey. Daily fantasy giant DraftKings has already applied for a sports betting license in New Jersey, which could kick off a wave of established companies, including Wynn (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM (MGM  -  Free Report), rolling out sports betting locations and platforms throughout the country.Meanwhile, investors should pay attention to tech companies, like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and even Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), to see if they utilize their infrastructure to get in on the massive mobile sports betting scene. It will also be worth keeping an eye out for any sports betting acquisitions, as startups are sure to pop up. As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

2758,MCD,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday without team USA for the first time since 1986, which is a huge disappointment for first time broadcast partner Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). But American soccer fans woke up Wednesday to news that North America won the rights to host the 2026 World Cup, beating out Morocco. Here is everything you need to know about the bid, its economic impact, and what companies stand to benefit. Hint: Fox is already celebrating.North America FIFA announced, in a 134 to 65 vote, to award the 2026 World Cup to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico’s joint bid. The reasons here are pretty simple: money. North America is expected generate $14 billion in revenue and $11 billion in profits for FIFA, which is huge for an organization that makes 90% of its money from the World Cup—Morocco reportedly couldn’t offer half of that figure. Soccer’s largest governing body was also under pressure after awarding the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to more controversial hosts, Russia and Qatar.The North American bid included 23 host city candidates, including three from Canada, three from Mexico, with the rest spread out throughout the U.S. Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York/New Jersey are the three cities vying for the rights to host the final.Under the current plan, the U.S. is set to host 60 matches, with Canada and Mexico each set to hold 10. If that number seems a little off to some soccer fans, it’s because the 2026 World Cup will see the world’s biggest sporting event expand its field for the first time to 48 teams up from 32, for a total of 80 matches—up from 64 under the current format.The North American bid noted that it expects the top six games, which would mean the opening games in all three countries, along with the two semifinals, and the final, to compare favorably to Super Bowl ticket sales as well as overall hospitality figures. The committee projects the overall economic impact will be roughly $5 billion, with $5.8 billion worth of ticket sales expected.Companies The clear winner of the 2026 World Cup bid is Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two broadcast powers won the U.S. television rights for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments for roughly $1 billion combined back in 2011. Then, somewhat quietly in 2015, FIFA awarded Fox and Telemundo the rights to the 2026 World Cup without opening up the bidding. The move sparked outrage from ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and other networks..@FOXSports President and COO Eric Shanks on North America winning the bid for #WorldCup 2026: ""It's a tremendous day, a lot of hard has paid off."" https://t.co/nbcpI3ZFCB pic.twitter.com/ysVfKbOTrR— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) June 13, 2018Fox reportedly only paid 10% more than in its current $425 million contract. On its face, this was a somewhat crazy move because Fox had not even broadcast its first World Cup game at the time, and no one knew what country would host the 2026 tournament. Diving a little deeper, the answer is somewhat clear. FIFA didn’t want any legal trouble from Fox, since, in a shocking move, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be hosted in the fall or winter due to heat concerns, which directly conflicts with the NFL season and other programming.Fox and Telemundo now own the rights to the world’s biggest sporting event on home soil. And this means live games in primetime, which is a trully amazing opportunity that likely has Fox, Telemundo, and FIFA’s marketing partners giddy. In a media landscape driven more and more by the Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) of the world, a month of adverting live in primetime is almost invaluable. Current FIFA and World Cup sponsors, which spend upwards of $50 million a year, include Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY and more. With that said, major U.S.-based companies now have even more incentive to get in on the World Cup.Aside from big opportunities for staples like Nike NKE, it could be a chance for Under Armour UAA to break into the World Cup scene via a team-based sponsorship, while everyone from YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report) to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other tech companies could work their way in somehow. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and other giants are current official sponsors of U.S. Soccer. Bottom Line Soccer has been the supposed sport of the future in the U.S. since it hosted the 1994 World Cup. Today, the world’s most popular sport sits just behind baseball and basketball as Americans’ favorite sport, according to a Gallup poll (basketball was favored by 11%, with baseball at 9%).Meanwhile, soccer jumped up to 7%—its highest spot ever on the annual poll. And a lot can change in eight years, especially as money pours into the MLS and the NFL’s ratings decline.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2759,MCD,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), with 32 nations set to compete in a 64-match tournament over the next month. Billions of people from over 200 countries are expected to watch, which means, for many, the stars are likely the main attraction. And there are few more well-known and revered athletes—or people—in the world than Lionel Messi. This means the Argentinian superstar makes a lot of money off the field, so let’s take a look at how to invest in one of soccer’s biggest stars.The World Cup is a big-budget marketing dream, attracting the likes of Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and many more to spend millions of dollars to promote and attach their brands to FIFA. Meanwhile, Messi himself is linked to one of the World Cup’s biggest partners and other powerhouse companies.Sponsors Messi made his debut for FC Barcelona—one of the richest and most famous clubs in the world—in 2004. The 5-foot-7 inch soccer giant made his first appearance for Argentina in 2005 and played in his first World Cup the following year in Germany. Since then, he has transformed into one of the best soccer players ever and a major brand ambassador. The German sportswear powerhouse Adidas signed Messi to a contract in 2006. Today, he is one of the faces of the brand and signed a “lifetime” deal with Adidas last year—similar to Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) deal with LeBron James. Messi’s Adidas deal helps contribute to the $27 million in sponsorship money he made over the last year. These off-the-field earnings lifted Messi’s overall earnings to $111 million—boosted by his massive new Barcelona contract—landing him second on Forbes’ list of the world’s highest-paid athletes.Messi is an Adidas man, but he also generates millions of dollars for rival Nike because Barcelona is sponsored by the Oregon-based company. In fact, Messi reportedly generated $111 million in value for Nike over the past 12 months through social media—with rival and Nike star Cristiano Ronaldo doing the same thing for Adidas since his club side, Real Madrid, is sponsored by Adidas. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on May 30, 2018 at 12:02pm PDTCleary, investors will note just how impactful one of Messi’s sponsored Adidas posts can be on Instagram, where he boasts 93 million followers—among the most on the platform. He also has over 88 million Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) followers, and his own dedicated YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) page—he notably does not have a Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account.His social media reach helped him land the number three spot on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list, behind only Ronaldo and James. This is also part of the reason why he is a valuable partner to a slew of other companies aside from Adidas.The 30-year-old is also a pitchman for Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), through Gatorade, Lays, and Pepsi, as well as wireless company Ooredoo, and many more. So now let’s take a look to see how the companies Messi is directly involved with have performed since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where Messi and Argentina lost in the final to Germany. Clearly, Adidas stock has surged over the last four years. Meanwhile, Mastercard stock is up big since the last World Cup, while Pepsi has trailed the S&P 500, as consumers’ eating and drinking habits rapidly shift.Messi is one of a few players who is able to have an outsized impact on his team and his brand partners.In Russia, Argentina is once again one of the favorites to win the World Cup. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates and to see what impact Messi might have on Fox’s and Telemundo’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2761,MCD,"Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) posted mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same.Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share missed the consensus estimate of 68 cents by 4.4%. The bottom line also fell 6% from the year-ago quarter due to weak operating results.Revenues of $467.6 million surpassed the consensus estimate of $461.9 million by 1.2% and increased 6.4% year over year. The upside was driven by higher International sales owing to 2.6% growth in comps and higher North America commissary sales on increased commodity prices. Foreign currency also favorably impacted the quarter’s revenues.Papa John's International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Papa John's International, Inc.

2767,MCD,"As the fresh food fad turned into a fully-fledged, multibillion dollar market, many began to call for the death of the fast-food industry. But while more people eat healthier than ever today, the fast-food market is still thriving.On the grocery side of things, nearly everyone knows that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) spurred further competition in the fresh food market with its purchase of Whole Foods. Meanwhile, grocery delivery upstarts like Instacart quickly secured deals with Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), and other large chains, leading to talks of a possible IPO.This competition has, in many cases, led to greater access to healthy eating options. Yet, for the most part, the cost is still far too high for a large percentage of the population to make healthy food a viable option.What’s more, fast-food chains remain a popular option for on-the-go eaters and low-income families. Restaurants and grocery stores are obviously not the same thing, but it has been interesting to watch fast-food giants continue to grow while access to healthier groceries became the norm.With that said, let’s take a look at three fast-food stocks investors might want to consider scooping up.1.       McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report)This historic fast-food burger chain can be found throughout the world, and it even tried to offer more healthy options along the way to expand its reach. Two weeks ago, McDonald’s reported that its full-year and Q4 2017 comparable store sales both climbed over 5.3%, which marked its best comps performance in six years. The company noted that this growth was driven, in part, by “tremendous progress” in its delivery and mobile order and pay business.McDonald’s is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is now projected to see its Q1 earnings surge by 14.29%, based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate. McDonald’s is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of  9% over the next three to five years.2.       Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report)This pizza chain’s ability to constantly adapt to changing consumer habits, while also bolstering its online and mobile ordering, helped Domino's expand into one of the world’s biggest fast-food chains, now boasting 14,400 stores in over 85 international markets. Domino’s is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports “B” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Investors should also note that Domino’s is expected to see its Q4 sales pop by over 10% to hit $903.2 million when it reports next Tuesday, Feb. 20. On top of that, the chain is projected to see its earnings soar 31.08% to reach $1.94 per share, based on our current estimates.Domino’s has met or topped earnings estimates in the trailing six quarters, and this streak seems poised to continue. The company’s current Earnings ESP is 1.06%, and paired with its high Zacks Rank, this means it is highly likely to beat Q4 estimates, as analysts seem to be more confident in Domino’s recently (also read: Earnings Season Ain't Over: 3 Stocks Likely to Beat Estimates This Week).3.       Sonic Corp. (SONC  -  Free Report)Sonic hardly holds a candle to the size of either McDonald’s or Domino’s, but this fast-food chain saw its first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings surge 25% last month. Sonic is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is now projected to see its earnings climb by 22.40% for the full year to reach $1.53 per share.Sonic is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 14.70% over the next three to five years. As a possible sign of further health at this growing fast-food chain, Sonic recently noted that it plans to open 70 to 80 new franchise drive-in locations in fiscal 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

However, the bottom line increased 37.5% year over year, favored by lower share count.Quarterly revenues of $309.2 million lagged the consensus estimate of $315.3 million by 1.9%. The top line marginally declined year over year driven by lower sales at company-operated restaurants, partially offset by higher franchise royalty revenues, fees and rental income. Meanwhile, comps at North America system restaurants were up 1.3%, compared with an increase of 2% in the previous quarter and 0.8% in third-quarter 2016.Wendy's Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wendy's Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wendy's Company (The) QuoteWendy’s system optimization initiatives, and Buy and Flip transactions have facilitated the company’s profit margin. However, fewer company-operated restaurants have affected the top line.Notably, shares of Wendy’s declined 3.8% in after-hours trading on Feb 21.

System-wide sales for the International segment amounted $0.12 million in the quarter, compared with $0.11 million in fourth-quarter 2016.Operating HighlightsCompany-operated restaurant margin came in at 17.5% in the quarter, compared with 18.8% in the year-ago quarter. The 130-basis points (bps) decline was primarily caused by higher commodity and labor costs, partially offset by lower other operating costs.General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $51.9 million, down 15.2% from $61.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline reflected the company’s cost savings associated with system optimization initiatives and lower professional fees.Fourth-quarter operating profit amounted to $66.6 million, a 15.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $79.2 million. Operating profit dropped due to a year-over-year decrease in gains from the system optimization initiative.Net income of $159.3 million increased a whopping 451.3% compared with $28.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net income massively gained from the recent U.S. tax regulation.Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.2% year over year primarily due to higher franchise fees (as a result of system optimization, and Buy and Flip transactions) as well as a year-over-year increase in G&A savings. Also, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 420 bps to 33.6% on the back of positive impact of Wendy's system optimization initiative.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017 was $0.17 billion, compared with nearly $0.19 billion as of Jan 1, 2017. Inventories at the end of 2017 amounted to $3.2 million, up from $2.9 million at the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017.Long-term debt totaled $2.26 billion at the end of 2017, compared with $2.27 billion as of Jan 1, 2017.

Company-operated restaurant margin was 17.6%, down 150 bps from the prior-year quarter, due to higher labor and commodity costs, partially offset by lower other operating costs.Net income was $194 million in 2017 compared with net income of $129.6 million in 2016. Adjusted EPS was 43 cents in the year, up 7.5% year over year.2018 OutlookFor 2018, the company expects North America comps growth in the range of 2-2.5%, with commodity and labor inflation in the range of 1-2% and 3-4%, respectively.Company-operated restaurant margin is expected to increase 17-18%.

Brands raised its quarterly dividend despite a 33% year-over-year decline in net income in the first nine months of 2017. This underscores management’s plan to lure investors with attractive returns. In fact, over the next three years, the company is committed to returning an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.Refranchising to Enhance Shareholders’ ValueThe company has adopted a de-risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising. This reduces capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Refranchising also boosts free cash flow, facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholders’ return.In third-quarter 2017, Yum! Brands increased its franchise ownership to 95% and is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised. In fact, it expects to possess less than 1,000 company-owned restaurants by the end of 2018.Management expects to cut capex to about $100 million by 2019, increase free cash flow conversion to 100% and also reduce General and Administrative (G&A) expenditure by approximately $300 million (or 1.7% of system sales).

2773,MCD,"Despite strong quarterly earnings results from industry heavyweights last week, stocks fell by midday Monday. With that said, this week once again features some big-name companies that might have to really impress in order to move the needle.Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) all posted strong quarterly earnings results last week. Yet none of them have been able to sustain any real post-earnings momentum. This week,  Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) are all scheduled to report their quarterly financials (also read: Upcoming Earnings Reports to Watch: MCD, AAPL, TSLA).Yet while these industry giants are set to grab a lot of attention, other recognizable companies are also scheduled to report their quarterly earnings results. Therefore, investors should look for stocks that are expected to report better-than-expected earnings while avoiding any companies that could disappoint.  Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these weak stocks in order to help them identify the high-risk companies ahead of their upcoming earnings reports.Check them out now:1.      Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report)Fitbit stock surged on Monday after the company announced a new healthcare-focused partnership with Alphabet's (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google. Prior to today’s gains, shares of Fitbit had climbed nearly 4% over the last month in a sign that investors might expect the struggling fitness wearable giant to turn things around. Our current consensus estimates don’t support this optimism. Fitbit’s quarterly revenues are expected to fall by over 17.5% to hit $246.08 million. The company is also projected to report an adjusted quarterly loss of $0.20 per share, which would mark a 33.3% decline.Meanwhile, Fitbit’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for an adjusted loss $0.21 per share, which is 1 cent worse than our current consensus estimate. Fitbit is also currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and sports an Earnings ESP of -6.33%. This means Fitbit is a stock that could fall short of earnings estimates when it reports after market close on Wednesday, May 2.2.       Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report)Shares of Yum Brands have climbed nearly 32% over the last year and have managed to experience gains over the last few months while many other stocks have experienced at least a marginal decline. Looking ahead, Yum’s quarterly earnings are expected to pop by 4.6% to reach $0.68 per share.However, investors will be disappointed to note that the owner of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken is projected to see its Q1 revenues sink by 23.9% to hit $1.08 billion. Yum is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an Earnings ESP of -1.18%. Yum’s negative ESP figure comes from the fact that its Most Accurate Estimate falls 1 cent below our current consensus estimates. Therefore, investors might want to avoid Yum before it reports its Q1 earnings on Wednesday morning.  3.       Square (SQ  -  Free Report)Square stock sunk 2.8% through early afternoon trading on Monday just two days before it is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results, which might mean that investors are apprehensive. Square's Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 35.1% to reach $623.75 million. On the other end of the income statement, Square is expected to report quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share, which is exactly the same figure it posted in the year-ago period. With that said, Square is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that rocks an Earnings ESP of -0.44%. This means that Square might be poised to miss earnings estimates, meaning investors should be cautious about the stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2774,MCD,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 by 16%. The bottom line also increased nearly 15% year over year on margin improvement driven by refranchising.Revenues of $294.5 million exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $285.9 million by 3%. However, the top line fell 16.6% on a year-over-year basis owing to lower comps.Jack In The Box Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Jack In The Box Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Jack In The Box Inc. Quote Following its earnings release on Feb 21, shares of the company rose 2.2% in after-hours trading. However, Jack in the Box lost 10% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 10.5%.Notably, the company’s refranchising strategies are effectively improving margins despite pressure from higher labor and maintenance costs and commodity inflation.Jack in the Box Comps DiscussionComps at Jack in the Box company stores increased 0.2%, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s rise of 0.6%, but better than last quarter’s decline of 2%. The comps growth was driven by average check growth of 2.6%, partially offset by a 2.4% decline in transactions.Same-store sales at franchised stores declined 0.3%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 3.9% in the year-ago quarter, but improved from a loss of 0.7% in the previous quarter. System-wide same-store sales fell 0.2% against a rise of 3.1% in the comparable period last year and the prior-quarter’s comps decline of 1%.Qdoba ScenarioIn the fiscal first quarter, the company signed an agreement to sell Qdoba to Apollo Global Management, LLC. The transaction, however, is expected to close by April 2018. Therefore, the company did not allocate any general and administrative shared services expenses to discontinued operations that incorporate Qdoba’s operating results.Qdoba generated net loss of $0.6 million in the quarter against net earnings of $1.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Operating HighlightsThe company’s consolidated restaurant operating margin was 22.2%, up 60 basis points (bps) year over year.Restaurant-level EBITDA increased 20 bps from the year-ago quarter to 26%. The increase was driven by the benefit of refranchising, but was partially offset by an increase in food and packaging costs resulting from commodity inflation, higher repairs and maintenance costs, wage inflation and higher costs for workers' compensation insurance.Franchise operating margin was 52.6%, down 30 bps year over year. Franchise EBITDA was 60.9% in the quarter, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 10 bps. The downside was due to reduced royalties from some restaurants sold to franchisees in 2017, and a decrease in franchise-operated restaurant comps in the current quarter. This was, however, partially offset by an uptick in franchise fees of $0.8 million from the refranchising of 22 restaurants in the first quarter.Balance SheetAs of Jan 21, 2018, Cash totaled $3.8 million compared with $4.5 million as of Oct 1, 2017 (end of fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017). Inventories in the first quarter amounted to $3.3 million, down from $3.4 million at the end of fiscal 2017.Long-term debt was $1.03 billion as of Jan 21, 2018 compared with $1.07 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Cash flows from operating activities declined to $53.7 million in the first quarter, compared with $69.8 million as of Oct 1, 2017.The company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2018. However, its board of directors announced a cash dividend of 40 cents per share on the company's common stock which is payable on Mar 16, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Mar 5, 2018.Second-quarter Fiscal 2018 GuidanceComps are expected in the range of -1% to 1% at Jack in the Box system restaurants, compared with a 0.8% decline in the year-ago quarter.Fiscal 2018 OutlookComps at Jack in the Box system restaurants are expected to increase 1% to 2%. Restaurant operating margin is anticipated in the range of 22-23%, while Restaurant-Level EBITDA is projected within 26-27%.Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $260-$270 million is expected in the fiscal year.

The uptick was primarily owing to strong comps from international stores. Excluding foreign currency impact, global retail sales increased 9.9%.In the quarter under review, the company’s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) comps improved 4.2%.

However, the increase was partially offset by rise in net interest expenses on higher net debt levels.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $35.8 million down from $42.8 million as of Jan 1, 2017.

However, in the past three months, the stock has declined 7.5% compared with industry’s decrease of 1.6%.Revenues Decline But Global Comps ImproveRevenues of $ 5,138.9 million outpaced the consensus mark of $4,915 million by 4.5% but declined 9% year over year.

This marked the eleventh consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Meanwhile, comps rise was similar to growth in the fourth-quarter 2017.Solid Comps Across SegmentsU.S.: Comps grew 2.9% in the first quarter owing to increase in average check resulting from rise in menu price as well as product mix shift. Comps growth, however, was lower than the prior-quarter rise of 4.5%.Segment operating income increased 5% backed by higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars and increase in sales from restaurant businesses, partially offset by lower company-operated margin dollars.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 7.8% year over year, higher than a 6% rise witnessed in the last reported quarter.

2779,MCD,"The long-awaited merger between T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint (S  -  Free Report) has finally been inked, now proposed to create a Big 3 in U.S. telecommunications firms. It remains to be seen if regulators will allow the merger to complete, but if they do, these two companies’ strengths — Sprint’s coverage and T-Mobile’s growth — look to create plenty of synergies.The deal is in all stocks, worth roughly $26 billion. Every one share on TMUS would beget 9.75 S shares. However, pre-market activity to kick off the week is not exactly going gangbusters for this merger: T-Mobile U.S. shares are currently down 2.3%, while Sprint is trading down ahead of the opening bell by 13%.New Purchasing Income & Spending results for the month of March hit the tape this morning, as well, with Purchasing up 0.3% and Spending +0.4%. Analyst estimates for both were for growth of 0.4%, so we’re more or less in-line with this result. Real Spending was also up 0.4%, with the Personal Consumption Deflator month over month at a zero balance. Core year over year was +0.2%.All of these numbers indicate a slow, steady climb in particular inflation metrics — nothing frighteningly unruly, nor stuck in the mud. Though these are not among the most scrutinized economic indicators to be released each month, by market analysts, economists and most importantly members of the Federal Open Market Committee, they nevertheless suggest our Goldilocks environment has persisted through the first quarter of 2018.After Monday’s closing bell, we expect to see another healthy portion of Q1 earnings results. But as the company names indicate — Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report), Tenet Healthcare (THC  -  Free Report) and NutriSystems (NTRI  -  Free Report) among them — this is not an earnings day with lots of marquee names.Ahead of today’s open, we have results from McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) Q1, with the global quick-service restaurant and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated stock easily beating estimates from the Zacks consensus: earnings of $1.79 per share topped the $1.67 expected, whereas revenues of $5.14 billion surpassed the $4.93 billion analysts had been looking for.

2782,MCD,"With the Dow breezing past the 25,000 milestone, President Trump believes even 30,000 is possible. The blue-chip index has relentlessly soared to record highs in the past year and has nearly quadrupled in value from the financial crisis in 2009. Enthusiasm over the Republican-led tax cut, which can boost corporate profits this year, and a series of strong economic reports helped the index move north by leaps and bounds.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks seems tempting at the moment. Such companies are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Bursts through the 25,000 Point MarkThe Dow kicked off 2018 with sizeable gains. The 30-stock index topped the coveted 25,000 mark and notched its biggest weekly gain since the period ended Dec 1, 2017. It just took 35 calendar days for the Dow to jump from 24,000 to 25,000, its fastest 1,000-point climb.The Dow has now extended its last year’s gain of 25%, helping the Bull Run that began in 2009, to post its second-longest run in Wall Street history. In fact, the index hit 71 record closing highs last year, the highest since the blue-chip index’s creation in 1896.Several gurus, who until recently called for a stock market correction, are now turning super bullish. They are predicting the Dow to hit 30,000 in the near term. Also, Trump said, “I guess our new number is 30,000.” He has already taken credit for Dow 25,000 and has become the first ever President in the history to have spoken so much about the U.S. equity market.Is Dow 30,000 Possible in Trump’s First Term?The recent tax code overhaul and a strengthening economy could certainly help the Dow breeze past 30,000 and help American blue-chip companies make more money.Republican-Backed Tax Package Republicans efficaciously defied opposition from Democrats to pass the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code that will trim corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue-chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back overseas cash pile will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. The tax bill, in the meanwhile, will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. This in turn will increase discretionary income that may give a boost to the demand for consumer goods and services (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Strong Economic GrowthU.S. manufacturing surged in December, touching the second-highest reading of 2017. Increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricane and a general uptick in the economy gave a boost to manufacturing activities. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.Economic recovery worldwide also gave a boost to profitability of American blue-chip companies, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Some pessimists may argue that job addition numbers last month came in below expectations. However, the average over the past few months continues to show that the labor market remains strong, while workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from Dec 2016 to Dec 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month. The National Employment Law Project, in fact, showed that minimum wage is poised to increase in 18 states and around 20 cities in the United States. This will result in inching employees wage closer to $15 an hour, which is known as “living wage.”5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Ride Dow’s Stellar RunThanks to the aforesaid bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks. This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of this bullish run. We have, thus, zeroed in on five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2783,MCD,"Monday, April 30, 2018The long-awaited merger between T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint (S  -  Free Report) has finally been inked, now proposed to create a Big 3 in U.S. telecommunications firms. It remains to be seen if regulators will allow the merger to complete, but if they do, these two companies’ strengths — Sprint’s coverage and T-Mobile’s growth — look to create plenty of synergies.The deal is in all stocks, worth roughly $26 billion. Every one share on TMUS would beget 9.75 S shares. However, pre-market activity to kick off the week is not exactly going gangbusters for this merger: T-Mobile U.S. shares are currently down 2.3%, while Sprint is trading down ahead of the opening bell by 13%.New Purchasing Income & Spending results for the month of March hit the tape this morning, as well, with Purchasing up 0.3% and Spending +0.4%. Analyst estimates for both were for growth of 0.4%, so we’re more or less in-line with this result. Real Spending was also up 0.4%, with the Personal Consumption Deflator month over month at a zero balance. Core year over year was +0.2%All of these numbers indicate a slow, steady climb in particular inflation metrics — nothing frighteningly unruly, nor stuck in the mud. Though these are not among the most scrutinized economic indicators to be released each month, by market analysts, economists and most importantly members of the Federal Open Market Committee, they nevertheless suggest our Goldilocks environment has persisted through the first quarter of 2018.After Monday’s closing bell, we expect to see another healthy portion of Q1 earnings results. But as the company names indicate — Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report), Tenet Healthcare (THC  -  Free Report) and NutriSystems (NTRI  -  Free Report) among them — this is not an earnings day with lots of marquee names.Ahead of today’s open, we have results from McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) Q1, with the global quick-service restaurant and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated stock easily beating estimates from the Zacks consensus: earnings of $1.79 per share topped the $1.67 expected, whereas revenues of $5.14 billion surpassed the $4.93 billion analysts had been looking for. Global comps reached 5.5% in the quarter, well past the 3.7% expected and now the 11th straight quarter of growing comps for the company.

Led by its insurance segment — the also publicly traded CNA Financial’s (CNA  -  Free Report) $1.03 per share vs. the 90 cents in the Zacks consensus, as well as a narrower loss per share at Diamond Offshore (DO), -$0.16 per share against the -$0.19 anticipated.For more on L’s earnings, click here.For more on CNA’s earnings, click here.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

The company aims to continuously build its brand by adapting to changing consumer preference.McDonald’s comps have improved in its key regions over the last few quarters on the back of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales. It has been focusing on operational excellence, product innovation, undertaking efficient marketing and promotions, offering a value menu, and rolling out more limited-time offerings to improve guest count – which remains the company’s top priority – and drive the top line.Meanwhile, efforts to enhance digital capabilities, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should further drive growth.However, a slowdown in emerging markets and soft industry growth has been hurting sales while high costs along with negative currency translation is denting the company’s profitability.Investors should note that over the past month, 5 estimates have gone higher for McDonald’s while 3 have gone lower in the same time period. Meanwhile, MCD’s earnings have been strong over the past few quarters.

2785,MCD,"The euphoria over the Republican-led tax overhaul policy helped the Dow persistently hit record highs and book back-to-back weekly gains. This epic Dow rally is likely to get a boost from a stellar Q4 earnings season. Strong guidance and an upbeat economic scenario are cited to be some of the primary reasons that will help earnings pick up steam.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip stocks that are likely to make the most of the Q4 earnings season seems judicious. Such stocks, moreover, are positioned to report promising earnings results as they have strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.Dow Jones to Hit Record High Post HolidayDow futures soared triple digits on Jan 15, when the U.S. stock market was closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Dow has already booked two straight weekly gains, as well as registered seven positive weeks in the last eight. The Dow jumped almost 4.4% and posted its best start to a year since the first nine trading sessions of 2003.The 30-stock index demonstrated mostly nothing in the way of gyration or market pullbacks. In fact, the broader market shrugged off uncertainty over the past 12 months. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), quiet remarkably, registered 47 lowest closings last year, out of a total of 56 since its inception in 1990.Tax Package: A Boon for Blue ChipsThe enthusiasm over tax cuts fueled a strong rally in blue-chip stocks. The corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Q4 Earnings Growth Expected to be StrongerSuch blue-chip stocks’ stupendous start could get even more wings as the Q4 earnings season kicks off. Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 9.2% from the same period last year on 7% higher revenues. This would follow 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues (read more: JPMorgan's Positive Kick-off to Bank Earnings).Q4 earnings estimates for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil and gas output is expected to benefit the energy sector, while an increase in sales from housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Tech, in the meanwhile, will make headway from substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (read more: 5 Best Stocks to Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings Season).Healthy Economic DataA sound economy is further likely to support earnings growth. Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), a diversified financial services company, has predicted that the U.S. economy will expand an average 2.5% each quarter this year and the next.The unemployment rate, in the meanwhile, is at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high set in November 2017. Lest we forget, workers’ pay has also increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month.Such low jobless level, rise in income and more confident consumers increased spending further at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores and restaurants (read more: Retailers Cap a Robust Holiday-Shopping Season: 5 Must Buys).4 Blue Chips to Buy NowThanks to the bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp run up in the 120-year-old index of 30 stocks. This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of the Q4 Earnings season. They have a positive Earnings ESP — our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We have, thus, zeroed in on four such stocks that also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified technology company worldwide. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 25. 3M has an Earnings ESP of +4.37%. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 11.5%, better than the industry’s expected gain of 8%.Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) manufactures and sells construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 25. Caterpillar has an Earnings ESP of +6.11%. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 88.9%, better than the industry’s expected gain of 34%.McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants in the United States and internationally. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 30. McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +0.11%. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 14.6%, better than the industry’s projected gain of 1.2%.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) provides branded consumer packaged goods to consumers in the United States and internationally. The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending December 2017 on Jan 23. Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of +0.87%. The stock, which is part of the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, is expected to post a solid earnings growth rate of 6.9% in the current year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2786,MCD,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of its latest location in Yuba City, CA.Owned and operated by the company’s franchise partner, V S Pollo King, Inc., the restaurant is located at 1212 Colusa Hwy. The 2,273-square foot restaurant can accommodate 66 guests.Continued Focus on ‘Vision Design’Notably, the new restaurant is part of El Pollo Loco’s ‘Vision Design’ initiative. Restaurants under this program offer an authentic, Mexican-inspired atmosphere, includes El Pollo Loco’s menu and brand identity, and has an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of its signature dish. The company believes that its vision model will position it better in the quick-service restaurant space. El Polo Loco is seeing encouraging results from the implementation of this model in various company-owned and franchised restaurants. The company also aims to reduce costs and drive sales through this initiative.For 2018, the company targets to complete 20 company-owned and 30 franchised remodels, all of which will feature the Vision Design.Sales-Boosting EffortsThe latest Yuba outlet reflects the company’s efforts to strengthen its franchise partnerships. V S Pollo, which has been El Pollo Loco’s franchise partner for over two decades, brought the company’s brand back to Yuba City. The latest launch is expected to boost the company’s franchise revenues, which have increase 1.6% year over year in the third quarter as well.Management is focused on maintaining its existing franchise relations as well as develop new ones. The franchise business model helps the company expand its footprint in various cities, which in turn is expected to drive traffic and overall sales.The company also expects to boost growth through advertising and providing excellent service at reasonable price. Banking on menu innovation, limited time offers and a strong brand position, the company witnessed traffic growth in the third quarter of 2017. Management believes that these sales-building efforts will pay off in the upcoming quarters as well.Limited Expansion & Macro WoesAlthough the latest move underscores the company’s rigorous expansion strategy, it also shows that the company is only expanding within its domestic periphery. While other restaurant operators like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion, El Pollo Loco is losing out in terms of international presence.Moreover, the U.S. restaurant space has been challenging for quite some time now. Soft consumer spending has led to declining traffic and sales. El Pollo Loco has also been bearing the brunt of a soft industry environment, where consumer preference toward spending on dine-out services has been volatile.Shares of the company have lost 23.1% in the past six months as against the industry’s gain of 7.2%.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2787,MCD,"Fastenal Company (FAST  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 17, before the opening bell.Increased installation of industrial vending machines is expected to boost sales and profits in the to-be-reported quarter as it is one of the primary growth drivers. Sales through its vending machines continued to grow at or near a double-digit pace in each of the first three quarters of 2017. Fastenal signed 15,089 vending machines during the first nine months of 2017, reflecting an increase of 5.5% from the prior-year quarter.Notably, the average daily sales growth rate of 15.4% in November was higher than the 13.8% increase in October 2017. However, average daily sales growth rate of 13.8% in October was lower than the 15.3% increase in September 2017.Moreover, a continual increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to expand Fastenal’s market share and contribute to the quarterly numbers. The company signed 213 new onsite locations during the first nine months of 2017 and had 555 active sites as on Sep 30, 2017, reflecting an increase of 47.6% year over year. The company aims to achieve 275-300 onsite signings in 2017, compared with 176 signings in 2016.We are also encouraged by Fastenal’s acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor — Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) — in March 2017. This ensures Fastenal’s presence in markets where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past. Mansco contributed 130 basis points (bps) to total sales growth of 11.8% in the last reported quarter and is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Based on sustained strength in most of its end markets and strong momentum in vending machines installations and onsite locations, the company is confident about reporting solid top-line growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.08 billion, implying 14.2% year over year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at 45 cents, reflecting a 12.5% year-over-year increase.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal’s changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now. Gross margin of 49.4% in the first nine months of 2017 dropped 10 bps from the prior-year quarter.Also, foreign exchange headwinds may dampen prospects. Unfavorable currency impacted sales by 0.5% in October and 0.4% in November 2017.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Fastenal has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Fastenal is +6.08%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise  Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise | Fastenal Company Quote Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.11% and a Zacks Rank #2.

However, Cracker Barrel’s shares have rallied 7.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.9%.While the company’s sales-building initiatives favored comps growth and the overall top line, expenses related to implementation of these initiatives and commodity inflation remain a concern.Let’s delve deeper into the numbers.Comps DetailsComparable store restaurant sales increased 1.1% in the quarter, including a 2% increase in average check, partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in store traffic. The figure compared favorably with 0.2% increase in first-quarter fiscal 2018.

Resultantly, operating margin in the reported quarter was 9.7%, down 100 basis points (bps) from 10.7% a year ago.Net income was $91.1 million in the quarter, reflecting a 72.9% increase from the prior-year quarter’s net income of $52.7 million.Balance SheetAs of Jan 26, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $168.8 million, up from $161 million as of Jul 28, 2017 (end of fiscal 2017 fourth-quarter).

The guidance was lifted on account of benefits from the change in tax rate.Total revenues of roughly $3.1 billion are expected, reflecting the anticipated opening of eight or nine new Cracker Barrel stores and three new Holler & Dash Biscuit House restaurants. The company maintained its revenue guidance.The guidance also takes into consideration a projected increase in comparable store restaurant sales of 1% to 2% (lower than the previously guided range of 2% to 3%). Comparable store retail sales are expected to remain flat as before.Operating margin as a percentage of revenues is expected to be within 9.5-10%, down from previously guided 10.5%.

2789,MCD,"With yields on the 10-year Treasury note reaching 3% for the first time in four years earlier this week, investors knew they would be fighting an uphill battle to extend the bull market through earnings season—despite the promise of strong profits and nearly double-digit revenue growth across the broader market.The primary challenge facing reporting companies is that this growth has, in large part, already been baked in to share prices. But if this week’s marquee earnings announcements are any indication, better-than-expected results and impressive guidance might be enough to restore optimism.Tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) crushed estimates, while semiconductor giants such as AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Intel  guided favorably and consumer brands—including Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report)—underscored the recent economic surge.Now, investors will look ahead to another busy week of earnings reports for even more bullishness. With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of April 30.1. McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report)Fast-food chain McDonald’s is slated to release its latest quarterly financial results before the market opens on April 30. The stock has been volatile since its previous earnings season, with shares dropping more than 12% since late January. Investors will hope strong results this time around can help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) start to generate momentum.Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect McDonald’s to report earnings of $1.67 per share and revenue of $4.93 billion. These results would represent year-over-year movement of +13.6% and -13.2%, respectively. Analysts have moved MCD’s EPS estimate about eight cents higher over the course of the quarter, although there has not been strong agreement to the upside among these revisions. 2. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)Consumer technology behemoth Apple is scheduled to announce its most recent quarterly financial results after the closing bell on May 1. Apple shares are in a rare correction period after shedding more than 10% from their latest highs, and tech investors might use this report as an indicator of the overall sector’s health. AAPL is holding a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) heading into the announcement.According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts expect Apple to report adjusted earnings of $2.69 per share and total revenue of $61.10 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 28.10% and 15.5%, respectively. Notably, the stock is trading at a discounted 14.5x forward 12-month earnings right now. 3. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report)Electric vehicle maker Tesla is slated to release its latest quarterly financial report after the market closes on May 2. Sluggish deliveries and mounting debt issues have dragged TSLA more than 20% lower over the past two months, but the stock is clinging to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as we approach its report week.The Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Tesla to post adjusted earnings of -$3.26 per share and revenue of $3.14 billion. These results would mark year-over-year movement of -145% and +16.5%, respectively. Tesla already said that it delivered 9,766 Model 3 vehicles during the first quarter, lagging its goal of 10,000. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2790,MCD,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the second-quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s results benefited from an improved performance in the Americas segment (mainly in the United States), the ongoing momentum in China (following the takeover of East China) and strongest comps growth in Japan in five quarters.However, Starbucks’ shares declined 2.2% in the after-hour trading session following the earnings release on Apr 26, possibly in response to stagnant comps growth in the Americas division that constitutes 70% of total revenues.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 53 cents met the consensus mark but grew 17.8% year over year.Total sales of $6.03 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $5.9 billion by 2.3% and increased 13.9% from the year-ago level. Notably, the acquisition of the East China business as well as other portfolio reshuffling activities lent a 3% net benefit to its top line. These activities include the closure of the Teavana mall store in the quarter, the Tazo divestiture in December, and the conversion of certain international retail operations from company-owned to licensed models. Meanwhile, currency translation had a 2% positive impact on revenues.The year-over-year performance was also driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,103 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher global comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 3%, better than the 2% increase in the fourth quarter. Transactions were down by 1% against no growth in the preceding quarter. The company opened 468 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,209 across 76 markets. It also closed 298 Teavana stores in the quarter.Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteMargin DownOperating margin decreased 490 basis points (bps) year over year to 12.8% in the quarter due to a product mix shift, largely toward food and restructuring costs associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations. Again, higher spending in its store partners (employees) along with the impact of its ownership change in East China added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 170 bps to 16.2%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 8% year over year to $4 billion.Comps rise of 2% in the quarter (same as the preceding quarter) comprised a 3% increase in average ticket. U.S. comps also grew 2% albeit less than the 3% increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Importantly, this is second consecutive quarter of 2% comps growth in Americas, mirroring concerns that its increased promotions somehow failed to attract a huge number of customers.Food comps were more than 1% and food has consistently contributed in the 1% to 2% comps range for many years now. This momentum continued in the quarter with food's share of total U.S. sales being 22%, up 100 bps from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, iced beverages contributed almost 40% to overall revenue growth.Membership increased 12% year over year to 14.9 million in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 12% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 8% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 220 bps to 20% as a strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of a food-related mix shift and higher spending in its store partners.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 54% to $1.2 billion on the back of higher revenues from the acquisition of east China operations, new store openings and comps growth.Comps grew 3%, higher than 1% in the previous quarter. China continued to post impressive comps growth, with 4% improvement in the quarter (softer than 6% in the preceding quarter). The softer sequential growth was attributed to a shift in the timing of the Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, Japan delivered its first quarter of positive comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2017, buoyed by a strong beverage lineup.However, operating margin at the CAP segment contracted 570 bps year over year to 17.2% in the quarter, owing to the impact of its ownership change in East China.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were up 15% year over year at $266.1 million in the segment. The improvement was prompted by higher revenues from the addition of new stores and a positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 1% (against a 2% decline in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 1,360 bps due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to the Switzerland retail business and sales deleverage on company-operated stores.Channel Development: Net revenues improved 8% to $500.2 million. The growth was driven by higher sales of premium single-serve products.Operating margin improved 100 bps to 43%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve Coffee and Roastery businesses, and Teavana-branded stores. Revenues at the segment decreased 32% to $75.6 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks expects global comps growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance of 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in in the high single digits.The company expects its GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32-$3.36.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, it excludes the impact of its previously announced plan to close more than 8,000 company-owned stores in the United States on May 29, 2018 to conduct racial-bias training for all partners (employees) in the United States.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2792,MCD,"McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) exhibited outstanding price performance in 2017. In the last year, the stock has returned a whopping 45.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 20.8%.Given its increased focus on delivery, enhancement of digital capabilities, and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States, we believe that the stock has decent upside potential.Let’s see what the New Year holds in store for McDonald's.Sales Efforts for its Largest MarketIn order to boost comps in the United States that represents about 40% of the company’s business, McDonald’s aims to increase its focus on growing guest traffic. In this regard, the company is focusing on operational excellence, product innovation; offering a value menu and rolling out more limited-time offerings. The company’s endeavors are boosting comparable guest count growth and the trend is expected to continue in 2018.Particularly, the popularity of the company’s national value platform – McPick 2 – is likely to continue, aiding top-line growth this year. Also, McDonald’s is leaving no stone unturned to revitalize its McCafe brand. In this regard, the company is focusing on new cafe-quality espresso beverages, extended retail offerings and a branding overhaul to gain ground in the battle for the nation's coffee drinkers.In addition, the company is undertaking digital initiatives to better serve customers, with nearly all its U.S. restaurants now using digital menu boards. Also, McDonald’s continues to roll out mobile order and pay with a new curbside check-in option.Meanwhile, to provide augmented convenience to customers, McDonald’s is increasingly focusing on delivery. In fact, it has already scaled this initiative by introducing delivery at more than 3,700 restaurants in the United States via its partnership with UberEATS. This number is expected to increase significantly in 2018.At the same time, the company is accelerating Experience of the Future (EOTF) deployment in the United States, building on its success in markets around the world. By elevating the customer experience at McDonald's, this initiative represents one of the greatest opportunities to build on business momentum and increase guest count. Currently, McDonald’s Experience of the Future is deployed in 13% of the restaurants and that number is expected to increase significantly in the next couple of years, with a goal of converting most of the traditional restaurants in the U.S. system by 2020.Guest Count Expected to GrowGrowing guest count remains the company’s top priority and we expect it continue its efforts to gain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value through 2018. Moreover, McDonald’s expects its velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery to drive growth over the long term. With an almost 10% share of the global informal-eating-out market, there is ample scope for it to grow in the future as it boasts a scale advantage compared to its peers.Attracting Customers in International Lead & High Growth MarketsMcDonald’s is consistently trying to improve its performance in the International Lead Markets, which include Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK. The company intends to drive comps growth in these markets through introduction of value meals, customizing the menu to local customer tastes, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery. These efforts are expected to continue in 2018.With the rollout of self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service, and the mobile app, customers have more choices and flexibility as the company progresses toward its Experience of the Future initiative, which is based on adding technology to its eateries. Notably, the converted restaurants are now seeing even stronger financial results than those who have not yet made the switch. Meanwhile, management notes that changes in the layout of restaurant dining rooms and service areas are creating better customer flow and giving them the ability to enhance their McCafé and dessert business.Coming to the High-Growth Markets, the company continues to experience positive results across majority of its markets. Focus on new products, alongside growth across the delivery, value and breakfast platforms has started yielding results and the momentum is expected to continue through 2018.McDonald's Corporation Net Income (TTM) McDonald's Corporation Net Income (TTM) | McDonald's Corporation QuoteRe-franchising Strategy Protects EarningsThough re-franchising weighs on near-term revenues, over the long term, it will reduce the company’s capital requirements and facilitate earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Going forward, the company aims to continue optimizing its ownership mix by refranchising restaurants in some of its large mature markets like the United States. Also, it will carry on evaluating other markets to determine whether a developmental license model is an apt one to grow in these markets.In fact, owing to re-franchising and stringent spending, the company expects to achieve approximately $500 million of net annual savings on SG&A expenses by 2018. Further, it expects to trim another 5 to 10% from its remaining cost base by the end of 2019. Alongside, free cash flow will continue to grow, allowing reinvestment for increasing brand recognition and shareholder return.Regular Returns to ShareholdersMcDonald’s has been regularly rewarding its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and that will continue through 2018. The company expects to return between $22 and $24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019 via dividends and share repurchases. We appreciate McDonald's efforts to consistently enhance shareholder returns, despite the sluggish economy across some of its major international markets. This reflects the company’s business strength and sustainability of its significant cash flows.Upward Estimate Revisions for 2018Analysts have increased their estimates for the company for 2018, which makes the earnings picture favorable. Over the past 60 days, five estimates have gone up compared with no downward revision for the next year. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend higher, going from $6.94 a share 60 days ago to its current level of $7.01 for the next year.Zacks Rank and Growth ScoreThe company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B indicating that it is an impressive choice for growth investors.Other PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are Famous Dave's of America, Inc. , Restaurant Brands International Inc.

2793,MCD,"The Finish Line, Inc.  is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 21. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this specialty retailer of athletic footwear, activewear and accessories will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Finish Line delivered a 9.1% beat in the previous quarter. However, the company’s bottom-line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, by an average of 13.2%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 37 cents, which is wider than a loss of 24 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $360.9 million, down 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.The Finish Line, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Finish Line, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Finish Line, Inc. QuoteNotably, Finish Line has outperformed the broader industry in the past month, reflecting a positive investor sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have gained 28%, compared with the industry’s growth of 18.8%.Factors at PlayWhile Finish Line’s earnings topped the Zacks estimate in second-quarter fiscal 2018, it declined more than five folds compared with the prior-year figure. The company is not immune to the intense promotions in the athletic space along with the shift of most retailers to digital and differentiated retailing. This shift has thwarted Finish Line’s strategy of cutting on prices to sustain competition from big names in the industry. Further, the increased promotions have been considerably weighing upon the company’s margins for quite a while now.Further, the company’s outlook for the second half and fiscal 2018 displays a dismal picture. The company anticipates comparable sales to decline 3-5% in the third and fourth quarter, as well as fiscal 2018. Moreover, it expects adjusted loss of 32-40 cents per share in the third quarter and earnings of 50-58 cents per share in the fourth quarter. Consequently, it also lowered earnings view for fiscal 2018 to range between 50-60 cents per share, way below the previous forecast of $1.12-$1.23 per share.While Finish Line remains committed toward effective inventory and expense management, and developing omni-channel capacities, the aforementioned hurdles make us apprehensive about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Finish Line is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Finish Line currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.06.  However, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which when combined with the company’s positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2794,MCD,"We expect NIKE Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 21. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.8%.Moreover, the company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for over three years now, delivering positive earnings surprises for 21 straight quarters. For the trailing four quarters, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 22.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether this leading sports apparel retailer will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 39 cents, reflecting year-over year decline of 22.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has been stable in the past 30 days. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8.4 billion, reflecting a jump of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Nike, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nike, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nike, Inc. QuoteNIKE has outperformed the Consumer Discretionary sector in the last three months. The company’s shares have surged 15.7%, compared with the sector’s jump of 4.1%.Factors at PlayNIKE’s robust growth and innovation efforts have been reflected in its robust earnings surprise trend. Additionally, persistent growth at international locations and global NIKE Direct business along with solid demand for the NIKE brand has been providing a boost to the top line. Going forward, the company remains confident of growth drivers like efficient supply chain, enhanced sync between the digital and physical experiences, constant innovations and strategic investments, all of which are likely to bolster long-term shareholder value.While NIKE sees itself well positioned to gain from the rise in digital era, it remains focused on strengthening its leadership position and driving growth through the next phase. To do this, the company remains aggressively focused on its “triple-double” strategy.Additionally, NIKE has been focused on Consumer Direct Offense plan. Driven by its Triple Double strategy, this restructuring plan focuses on using digital methods for rapid innovation and product development, along with strengthening consumer relations by operating through core regions. This has also aided the company’s positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.However, lackluster sales trend in the company’s key North American market remains a headwind. Soft sales in North America are attributed to the lackluster product assortments, increased promotions due to growth of e-commerce and intensified competition. Moreover, the company’s wholesale business in the region has been impacted due to increased focus on online sales. Moreover, we believe the overall environment is likely to remain promotional in North America, hurting the results in this segment.Furthermore, the company anticipates near-term results to be impacted by the tough retail environment, which led to a bleak second-quarter view. For fiscal 2018, reported revenues for the fiscal are still anticipated to increase in the mid-single digits. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects reported revenue in the low-single digit range. The company expects decline in North America and in the Converse segment to be partly mitigated by strength in international business.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.49% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 41 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. This along with the company’s Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Costco Wholesale Corp.

However, the ticker symbol remains unchanged.Adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents by 15.6%. However, the bottom line declined 46% from the prior-year quarter. Decline in the company’s gross profit has affected earnings but was partially offset by fewer weighted average diluted shares outstanding.Total revenues in the quarter came in at $148.8 million, a decline of 3.5% year over year. However, revenues marginally surpassed the consensus estimate of $148 million. Revenues were affected by closing down of a few restaurants and non-collectible franchise royalties from Applebee.DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DineEquity, Inc Quote Shares moved 0.5% in after-hours trading following the earnings release on Feb 20. Meanwhile, Dine Brands’ shares have gained 56.6% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.8%.The company’s brand revitalization strategies reflect slightly in the fourth-quarter comps performance. The company expects these strategies to pay off in the first quarter of 2018. However, Applebee’s bad debt expense has put pressure on gross profit, which in turn has dented the bottom line.Let’s delve deeper into the numbers.Brand Performances by CompsApplebee's domestic system-wide comps increased 1.3%. This compares favorably with the third quarter’s decrease of 3.2% and the prior-year quarter’s decline of 7.2%.IHOP’s domestic system-wide comps were down 0.4%, comparing favorably with the last quarter’s decline of 7.7% and the prior-year quarter’s fall of 2.1%.Cost, Gross Profit & Net Income Total cost of revenues in the quarter increased 13.2% year over year to $71.6 million. Subsequently, gross profit in the quarter came in at $77.2 million, down 15.1% from the year-ago quarter.General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter increased 8.1% year over year to $40 million.

Long-term debt at the end of 2017 totaled $1.27 billion, down from $1.28 billion at the end of 2016. Goodwill as of Dec 31, 2017 was $339.2 million, down from $697.5 million in the prior year.Cash flow from operating activities totaled $65.7 million as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with $118.1 million as of Dec 31, 2016.Management announced a cash dividend of 63 cents per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend will be payable on Apr 6, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 19, 2018.2017 HighlightsAdjusted earnings in the year came in at $4.15 per share, a decline of 30.9% year over year. The deterioration in adjusted net income was mainly due to lower gross profit and an increase in general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $165.7 million in 2017 compared with $148.9 million in 2016. Applebee's domestic system-wide comps declined 5.3% in 2017, whereas IHOP's domestic system-wide comps fell 1.9%.2018 GuidanceBoth Applebee and IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are expected in the range of flat to up 3%.

2796,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) recently reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagging the same.Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were $1.34, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.32 by 1.5%. Including the 21-cent positive impact from the U.S. tax law, earnings came in at $1.55. Earnings also grew 143.6% year over year on lower costs and higher revenues.Despite the earnings beat, revenue miss, weak 2018 comps guidance and slowdown in planned store openings probably have made investors apprehensive about Chipotle’s sales growth in the near term, resulting in a 5.4% plunge in share price in after-hours trading.Also, the company’s shares have lost 25.2% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 13.5%.Chipotle has been bearing the brunt of a challenging restaurant operating environment and has been particularly plagued by negative publicity related to food-borne illnesses, which had surfaced toward 2015-end. In order to regain reputation and drive sales, the company has been trying to streamline operations and enhance guest experience.Toward this end, Chipotle is focusing on digital innovation. In fact, in the fourth quarter, the company hit new records as its digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales while two of the company’s regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. Chipotle is also reinvesting in existing restaurants and trying to improve their appearances and functions.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteRevenues and Comparable Restaurant SalesQuarterly revenues of $1.11 billion lagged the consensus estimate of $1.12 billion by 0.9% but grew 7.3% year over year. The revenue growth is primarily attributable to restaurant openings. The company opened 38 new restaurants in the fourth quarter and relocated an additional four restaurants, reaching the total restaurant count to 2,408.The rise in comps somewhat partially favored revenues. Comps in the quarter increased 0.9% which includes a 0.6% reduction related to deferred revenues recognized during the year-ago quarter due to the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comps were driven by an increase in average check, including a 2.4% impact from menu price increase in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by a decline in transactions.Costs, Operating Highlights & Net IncomeFood costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 110 basis points (bps) to 34.2% driven by cost savings in paper and packaging usage as well as higher menu prices.

While 64.9% of these companies have beaten estimates on both counts, 80.5% surpassed earnings estimates and 78.1% exceeded top-line expectations.Restaurant Players Have Impressed So FarWe note that performance of restaurant players has been decent so far this earnings season. Among the restaurant stocks that have already reported, McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) posted robust fourth-quarter 2017 and fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, respectively, beating earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) posted mixed second-quarter fiscal 2018, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagging the same.The year 2017 saw the space grappling with rising costs, weak comps, higher restaurant prices, consumer spending uncertainty on dining out, decline in at-home food costs, market saturation and shifting preference of consumers.However, the industry remains steady, thanks to the counter-strategies of some innovative operators. These include various sales building and cost cutting efforts, franchisee-based business models, loyalty programs and most importantly increased usage of technology.The Broader Sector Looks StrongThe restaurant industry belongs to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, which is expected to deliver strong performance this earnings season. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are expected to be up 6.6% year over year, with revenues anticipated to rise 8.8%.Given this backdrop, let’s see what’s in store for three industry players slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Buffalo Wild Wings’  for earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.56 per share and $543 million, respectively.

The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 63 cents, reflecting 1.6% declinefrom the year-ago quarter’s actual figure.We expect the company’s top line to benefit from system-wide sales growth backed by franchise fees and royalty income, and strong rental income. License fees related to Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods and ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, along with increased transfer fee income are also expected to strengthen the top line.The bottom line, however, is likely to stay under pressure as the company anticipates roughly $6 million of incremental interest expense from a recent debt deal and a higher effective tax rate resulting from reserve of foreign tax credit carry-forwards in the third quarter.

2799,MCD,"McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) is currently a well-performing restaurant stock. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run.Shares of the company have returned 44.1% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20.8%.The outperformance has been backed by upward revision in earnings estimates for 2018. This reflects analysts’ unwavering confidence in the stock. Over the past 60 days, consensus estimate for 2018 earnings rose 0.4%. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.21%.Per our VGM Score, which identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, McDonald’s has a Growth Score of B. This reflects robust growth rate and potential of the stock.Let us delve deeper into the other factors that make this stock a lucrative pick.Sales Building Efforts to Drive Traffic Amid CompetitionMcDonald’s has always been focused on driving guest traffic. Toward this end, the company is emphasizing on operational excellence, product innovation, offering value menu and rolling out more limited period offers. In fact, the company’s endeavors have started bearing fruit and the third quarter of 2017 marked the third consecutive quarter of comparable guest count growth.In addition, the company is undertaking digital initiatives to enhance customer experience, with nearly all of its U.S. restaurants now using digital menu boards. Meanwhile, to provide augmented convenience to customers, McDonald’s is increasingly focusing on delivery. In fact, it has already scaled this initiative by introducing delivery at more than 3,700 restaurants in the United States via its partnership with UberEATS.McDonald’s believes that consistent menu innovation can lend it a competitive edge over the likes of Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report). In line with this, the company started the year with the introduction of Dollar Menu.Franchised Model Safeguards EarningsConsidering that 91% of the company’s system-wide restaurants are franchised and is expected to reach 95%, the company gain from reduced ownership. Although re-franchising weighs on near-term revenues as it replaces company-operated sales with franchised sales, over the long term, it will reduce the company’s capital requirements and drive earnings.Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). In 2018, McDonald’s earnings per share are expected to grow 6.9%.Refranchising Drives Net MarginMcDonald’s refranchising and stringent spending makes the company optimistic about achieving approximately $500 million of net annual savings on SG&A expenses by 2018. Further, it expects to trim another 5 to 10% from its remaining cost base by the end of 2019.Despite high labor costs and expenses related with brand positioning and ongoing initiatives, the company has been able to achieve higher net margins. We note that McDonald’s trailing 12-month net margin is 24.2% as compared with the industry’s gain of 3.3%.Regular Returns to ShareholdersMcDonald’s has been regularly rewarding its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company has a history of increasing dividend almost every year since the inception of its dividend payout policy in 1976. Last September, the company raised its dividend by 7.4%. Moreover, per its cash return target, the company returned $30.0 billion to shareholders over a three-year period from 2014 to 2016 via dividends and share repurchases. Meanwhile, the company expects to return between $22 billion and $24 billion to shareholders in the three-year period ending 2019.We appreciate McDonald's’ efforts to consistently enhance shareholder returns despite the sluggish economic conditions in some of its major international markets. This reflects the company’s business strength and sustainability of cash flow.McDonald’s carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2801,MCD,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $15.0 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year.

2805,MCD,"Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the restaurant space and a rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run.Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.Why an Attractive Pick?Price Performance: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the last year. Domino's has returned 24.2%, which compares favorably with the industry’s gain of 19.9%.The price surge seems to the result of strong investor optimism around the stock, given Domino’s brand recognition, and it continues to ride on various sales boosting and digital initiatives.Domino’s ranks as the second-largest pizza chain in the world. It is the market leader in the delivery segment in the United States and ranks second in the carry-out segment. Domino’s posted the 26th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales domestically in the third quarter of 2017. The company has enhanced its brand strength through marketing affiliations with the likes of The Coca-Cola Company and others.Domino’s continues to boost sales through regular limited time offers (LTO), new product launches and remodeling efforts. It is also investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives to drive sales. These initiatives include the company’s digital loyalty program -- Piece of the Pie Rewards, various ordering apps and platforms (Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter) and anywhere ordering platform innovation, to name a few.Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) Domino's Pizza Inc Revenue (TTM) | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteThe company continues to ramp up its worldwide digital participation with 25 markets now utilizing its global online ordering platform and more than 70% of stores outside the United States using its proprietary point-of-sale system – Domino's PULSE. Digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas.Solid Rank & VGM Score: Domino's carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: Four estimates for 2018 moved north over the past 60 days versus no southward revisions, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 increased 3%. This  is encouraging ahead of the earnings season.We believe that the company’s refranchising strategy will continue to facilitate earnings per share growth by reducing capital requirements. In addition, free cash flow continues to grow, thus allowing reinvestment for increasing brand recognition and shareholder return. Domino’s has a wide franchise network, both domestically and internationally that helps it reduce ownership of restaurants and focus more on re-franchising.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Domino's has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 6.11%.In fact, the company’s earnings have surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the last 13 quarters. Given the various initiatives to boost growth, the stock seems to have  a decent upside potential.Strong Growth Prospects: Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of $7.16 reflects year-over-year growth of 23.9%. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 14.5%.This strong earnings growth prospect is justified given that the company’s international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets, driven by exceptional unit level economics.Other PicksSome other stocks in the restaurant space worth considering include Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report), Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report) and McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 .

2806,MCD,"The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has opened its 500th international restaurant in Guatemala City.The outlet was opened through the company’s franchise organization, Alimentos Corporativos Coralsa, which operates 13 restaurants in Guatemala and employs more than 400 Wendy staff.Wendy's president and CEO Todd Penegor stated, ""this is a great achievement that we attribute to the strength of our brand and partnerships with exceptional and dedicated franchisees who are committed to developing Wendy's abroad.""We observe that shares of Wendy's have rallied 28.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20.1%.Leveraging Opportunities in Less Saturated Emerging MarketsThe move that followed recent openings in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil and Chile is part of the company’s consistent efforts to build a strong international presence by expanding in less saturated emerging markets.These markets offer significant opportunities to companies like Wendy’s to expand due to their relatively low per-capita consumption and rising income levels of the middle class that has led to an increase in demand for convenience food and beverages.Wendy’s remains on track to achieve its goal of 7,500 global restaurants by 2020.Boosting Earnings and Cash Flow Through Franchisee Based ModelThe move is just another example of how well Wendy’s is focused on boosting its franchisee related revenues. Franchising a large chunk of its system lowers its general and administrative expenses, thereby boosting earnings.Moreover, over the long term, it will generate higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements. This will also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholder returns. Besides adding to the top line in the form of royalty and rental income, it will allow the company to penetrate the market more quickly. The company targets to monetize 70% of its owned real estate by 2017 to further enhance earnings. It expects 80% of its earnings to come from royalty and rental income.Wendy's Company (The) Net Income (TTM) Wendy's Company (The) Net Income (TTM) | Wendy's Company (The) QuoteLast Words Wendy's revenues have been declining over the past few quarters due to reduced number of company-operated restaurants. Though transition to a franchise-based business model is expected to lower the company’s G&A expenses and boost earnings, it may continue to weigh on its revenues.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWendy's carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the restaurant space are Darden Restaurants, Inc.

2807,MCD,"In a bid to capitalize on the growing demand for espresso beverages, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has launched a mild version of espresso — Starbucks Blonde Espresso. This is the first core espresso alternative to be launched by the company in the United States in more than 40 years.Coffee lovers can now choose from two espresso varieties — Signature or Blonde. The Signature espresso is essentially dark and rich while the latest Blonde espresso is citrusy and mild. The coffee beans for Blonde Espresso are sourced from Latin America and East Africa.The company has already been offering a second espresso option in few international markets since 2013 and has also introduced it in Canada last year. Owing to the success of this method of offering an alternative option, this Seattle-based coffee chain giant has decided to add this to its core espresso menu in the United States. The item will be a permanent one on the menu.Blonde Espresso is also available in pods for the Verismo System of Starbucks and joins its portfolio of lighter roast offerings, which were introduced as whole bean packaged coffee and brewed options in 2012.Starbucks has been strengthening its portfolio with innovation in beverages and core food offerings. Beverage innovation has been a significant contributor to comps for Starbucks over the years. According to National Coffee Association, demand for espresso beverages is on the rise with nearly 25% of past-day daily coffee drinkers choosing espresso in 2017. With this new espresso alternative, Starbucks is expected to cash in on this growing demand and entice coffee drinkers who are not familiar to strong and bold coffee flavors.Also, given the decelerating performance in the United States, menu innovation becomes pertinent for driving comps. The company’s Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues) posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, considerably down from 6% growth in fiscal 2016. In fact, transactions remained unchanged year over year and ticket grew 4%. This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and 1% increase in ticket in fiscal 2016.Meanwhile, Starbucks’ shares have gained only 1.9% in the last year, comparing unfavorably with 19.7% growth of its industry. However, the trend in fiscal 2018 earnings estimate revisions is encouraging, as it moved 2.2% north over the past 60 days. This signals at analyst optimism surrounding this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s performance in the near term.  Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Famous Dave's of America, Inc. , McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Good Times Restaurants Inc.

2810,MCD,"The Retail-Wholesale sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been bearing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The first and foremost reason for the same is that retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of capital toward multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, and developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers. Further, the retailers are renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers and implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system.Another reason for the same is the latest tax reform that has resulted in lowering the corporate tax rate to as much as 21%, and retailers will be the beneficiary of the same. Analysts believe that a lower tax burden is likely to allow them to channelize the surplus money to best possible options. They may go for a dividend hike, or reduce debt load, or create a corpus to fund acquisitions, or invest in enhancing omni-channel capabilities, new product launches and any other innovations.The last factor that has also played a major role in grabbing investors’ attention to the sector is the blissful holiday season. Per MasterCard SpendingPulse report, retail sales during the holiday period jumped 4.9%, marking the biggest year-over-year uptick in holiday spending since 2011. Retailers such as Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s Corp. (KSS  -  Free Report) registered sales growth of 3.6% and 6.9%, respectively, during the November-December period, while both J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) recorded comparable store sales growth of 3.4%.How Is the Sector Placed?The sector, which currently occupies the top 19% (3 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, has advanced 33% in a year and comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s gain of 21.5%. We believe that given the favorable economic indicators the sector holds promise for 2018.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, fall in the unemployment rate to 17-year low, and improving housing and manufacturing sectors signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers. Steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration boost consumer confidence. Although consumer confidence dipped to 122.1 in December from November’s revised reading of 128.6, analysts believe that consumers remain optimistic about the economy.Consequently, adding a few stocks from the space would be a prudent decision at the current juncture. Here we have highlighted four Retail-Wholesale stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have been given a Strong Buy/Buy rating by 70% or more brokers.4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Conn's, Inc.

2811,MCD,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 14. In the preceding quarter, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping for a positive earnings surprise from Costco in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.35, reflecting a year-over-year increase of more than 15%. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by 3 cents in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $31,286 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter.Model Predicts Higher ProbabilityOur proven model shows that Costco is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Costco has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. This makes us reasonably confident that the bottom line is likely to outperform estimates.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayWe believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. The company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track as cash-strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low-cost necessities. However, stiff competition and cautious consumer spending remain causes of concern.Nevertheless, the hike in annual membership fees in the recent past and increased penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program will benefit the stock. We are also encouraged by Costco’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs and expanding e-commerce capabilities. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan.For the 12-week period ended on Nov 26, 2017, Costco reported 10.5% jump in comps, displaying an increase of 10.3%, 11.3% and 10.1% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations. Net sales for the period came in at $31.13 billion, an increase of 13.3% from the year-ago period. Comparable e-commerce sales for the period under review surged 43.6%.3 Stocks with High Probability to Beat EstimateHere are three other stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NIKE, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.49% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% and a Zacks Rank #3.Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +7.16% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

2812,MCD,"Stock market futures are down pretty deeply into the red this morning, after an average close on the main indexes of roughly half a percentage point. However, no blame can be placed on Q4 earnings season, which continues to bring about robust results from companies across the spectrum of industries. Asian markets were down slightly overnight, and later this evening we await President Trump’s initial State of the Union address. Later this week, beginning tomorrow, we start to see new data on January jobs numbers.Keeping with Q4 earnings results, here are 4 leaders in their respective spaces and how well they have performed relative to expectations, particularly the Zacks consensus estimates:McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted strong quarterly numbers both on top- and bottom-lines ahead of the opening bell today. Earnings of $1.71 per share easily outpaced the $1.59 expected. Revenues reached $5.34 billion in the company’s Q4, ahead of the $5.26 billion in the Zacks consensus.Beating estimates is nothing new for McDonald’s, whose previous average positive earnings surprise over the past 4 quarters was over 5%. In the quarter just reported, McDonald’s benefited from stronger comps, up 5.5% year over year. For more on MCD’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma player Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on both earnings and revenues, with 62 cents per share on $13.70 billion in sales topping the 56 cents and $13.61 billion expected, respectively. Earnings growth year over year was a nice 32%, while revenues were up 1%. Revenue guidance for full-year 2018 remains in range of the current Zacks consensus estimate, whereas earnings guidance of between $2.90-3.00 per share is out ahead of the $2.77 we had earlier expected. For more on PFE’s earnings, click here.Health insurance major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), on the other hand, posted mixed results for its Q4, with $1.23 per share surpassing the $1.18 we were looking for, but revenues of $14.74 billion lower than the $14.89 billion expected, and down further from the $15.72 billion a year ago. Enrollment is down as Congress continues to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, which was good for Aetna: the previous 4 quarters generated an average 23% positive earnings surprise. For more on AET’s earnings, click here.Global asset management firm T. Rowe Price (TROW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, also posted earnings and revenue beats for its Q4 report: $1.52 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, while the $1.29 billion in revenues did better than the $1.27 billion estimated and the $1.09 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The company aims to continuously build its brand by adapting to changing consumer preference.McDonald’s comps have improved in its key regions over the last few quarters on the back of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales. It has been focusing on operational excellence, product innovation, undertaking efficient marketing and promotions, offering a value menu, and rolling out more limited-time offerings to improve guest count – which remains the company’s top priority – and drive the top line.Meanwhile, efforts to enhance digital capabilities, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should further drive growth.However, a slowdown in emerging markets and soft industry growth has been hurting sales while high costs along with negative currency translation is denting the company’s profitability.McDonald's Corporation Price McDonald's Corporation Price | McDonald's Corporation QuoteInvestors should note that over the past month, 2 estimates have gone higher for McDonald’s while 1 has gone lower in the same time period.

2815,MCD,"The picture emerging from the Q4 earnings season is one of all around strength and momentum. Not only is an above average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations, but estimates for the current period are materially going up. With results from 26% of the S&P 500 members already out and another 24% on deck to report results this week, we will be at the halfway mark by the end of this week.It is still early going for the small-cap S&P 600 index, with results from only 14% of the index’s members out.Of the roughly 400 companies reporting results this week, including 121 S&P 500 members, the most notable reports are:McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) – The fast giant reports Q4 results before the market’s open on Tuesday January 30th. The company is expected to earn $1.59 per share on $5.26 billion in revenues, which compares to $1.44 in EPS and $6.03 billion in revenues in the year-earlier quarter. The company’s operating and stock-market performance has been very impressive lately, with the stock up a +46.4% in the past one year, outperforming the Zacks Restaurant industry’s +21.7% gain and the S&P 500 index’s +24.2% gain.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) – Boeing reports Q4 results before the market’s open on Wednesday, January 31st. The company is expected to earn $2.91 per share on $24.83 billion in revenues, up +17.8% and +6.6% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Boeing is a beneficiary of the strong global commercial aviation market as well as the expectation of increased U.S. government defense spending. The momentum in Boeing shares over the past year has been very strong, with the stock up +102.8%, and playing a major role in pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average into record territory.Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) – The social-media giant reports Q4 results after the market’s close on Wednesday, January 31st. The company is expected to earn $1.94 per share on $12.56 billion in revenues, up +37.6% and +42.6% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The company’s ever-growing tally of daily active users will be of as much importance to the market, as its top- and bottom-line results. The expectation is that the worldwide tally of daily active users increased to 1.414 billion, up from 1.227 billion in the year-earlier quarter and 1.368 billion in the preceding quarter. The impact of recent newsfeed changes on ad revenues will likely be of interest on the earnings call. The stock is up +7.7% since the start of the New year and +43.8% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Tec sector’s +28.1% gain over the past year.Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) – Alibaba reports before the market’s open on Thursday, February 1st, while Amazon reports after the market’s close that day. As impressive as Amazon’s stock market performance over the past year has been, Alibaba has done even better, with the stock up +101% over the past year, better than Amazon’s +67.7% gain. Amazon has long ‘trained’ the market on not to look for earnings performance in its quarterly results and that will likely be case this time around.The key factor will be overall revenues and performance of the company’s cloud business – Amazon Web Services (AWS). With respect to revenues, the current Zacks Consensus expectation is $59.98 billion, which represents +37.1% growth from the year-earlier level, while earnings of $1.85 per share would represent a +20.1% year-over-year gain.Apple (AAPL) - Apple reports Q4 results after the market’s close on Thursday, February 1st. The company is expected to earn $3.81 per share on $86 billion in revenues, up +13.4% and +9.8% from the year-earlier period, respectively. Apple makes plenty of products, but the most important product in its portfolio is the iPhone, whose unit sales are expected to have reached 79.8 million in the quarter, up from 78.29 million in the year-earlier quarter and 28.85 million in the preceding quarter. The stock has lost ground in recent days, but it is up +40.5% over the past year, handily outperforming the broader Tech sector.Alphabet (GOOGL) – Thursday evening is very busy on the reporting calendar, with Alphabet also coming out with its quarterly results at the same time as Apple and Amazon. The search giant is expected to earn $10.12 per share on $25.67 billion in revenues, up +8.12% and +20.99% from the year-earlier period, respectively.The stock has literally been on a tear in January, up +12.7% year-to-date, bring its performance of the past year to +40.6%.Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard (as of Friday, January 26, 2018)Total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +12.3% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 65.4%.To put these results in a historical context, the charts below compare the results thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 133 index members in other recent periods.Any way you look at these results, the Q4 earnings season is on track to be very good. Not only is growth tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 133 index members, but a record proportion are beating EPS and revenue estimates.The comparison charts below highlight the very strong revenue momentum that’s coming out of the Q4 earnings season, a truly impressive performance.Expectations for Q4 As a WholeTotal Q4 earnings are expected to be up +11.6% from the same period last year on +7.5% higher revenues. This would follow +6.7% earnings growth in 2017 Q3 on +5.9% growth in revenues.The table below shows the summary picture for Q4, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q3.The chart below shows Q4 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to pick up in Q4 after dipping in the preceding quarter and continue accelerating going forward.Estimates Keep Going HigherI want to touch on the favorable revisions trend for the current and coming quarters at present. Regular readers will recall that estimates for the Q4 earnings season had held up unusually better in the run up to the start of this earnings season. But what we are witnessing with estimates for the current and following quarters is extremely positive.The typical pattern over the last few years has been that estimates for the quarter will start coming down as we will get closer to the reporting season for that quarter. The opposite is the case with the current (and following) quarter(s), with estimates starting to go up in a notable way. You can clearly see this in the evolving earnings growth expectations for 2018 Q1, as depicted in the chart below.Taxes are a direct contributor to this positive revisions trend, but there appears to be favorable momentum on the revenue front as well, as the chart below shows.Mind the GapAs we have been pointing out all along, the one doubt over the ‘quality’ of the picture coming out of the Q4 earnings season is the extremely wide gap between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings.For the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported Q4 results already, as of Friday, January 26th, the magnitude of gap between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings is unlike anything we have seen over the last few years.On average, adjusted earnings were +12% higher than GAAP earnings over the preceding 16 quarters for these 133 S&P 500. But as you can see in the chart below, the gap is extremely wide for 2017 Q4 and likely to remain in record territory even as the reporting cycle moves beyond the Finance sector where the issue was very pronounced.A lot goes into ‘earnings quality’. But as a general rule, it is reasonable to be wary of big variance between adjusted and GAAP earnings. Going by this simple rule, you have to question the ‘quality’ of Q4 earnings reports, irrespective of the growth pace and proportion of positive surprises on the ‘adjusted’ earnings front.The Small-Cap ScorecardFor the S&P 600 index, we now have Q4 results from 84 index members or 14% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these 84 index members are up +15% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, with 61.9% beating EPS estimates and 59.5% beating revenue estimates.The charts below compare the results thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 84 index members in other recent periods.The table below shows the blended picture, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, for Q4 for the small-cap index.The chart below puts the small-cap index’s expected Q4 performance in the context of where growth has come from and where it is expected to go in the coming quarters.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

2816,MCD,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company also lifted its full-year profit outlook considering the new U.S. corporate tax cut.However, Starbucks’ shares declined 4.3% in the after-hour trading session following the news release on Jan 25, possibly in response to the weak comparable store sale or comps performance that overshadowed the raised profit guidance expected from a U.S. corporate tax cut. ""Holiday (limited-time offers) and merchandise did not resonate with our customers as planned,"" chief executive Kevin Johnson said on a conference call.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 65 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 14.5% and grew 25% year over year.Total sales of $6.07 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.14 billion by a small percentage but increased 6% from the year-ago level. Notably, Q1 revenues mark Starbucks’ first ever $6 billion quarterly revenues. The year-over-year performance was driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,305 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter, same as the previous quarter. Transactions were even during the quarter against 1% growth in the preceding quarter. The company opened 700 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,039 across 76 markets.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.4% in the quarter due to product mix shift, largely toward food and restructuring cost associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 80 bps to 19.2%.Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteQuarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 7% year over year to $4.3 billion.Comps rise of 2% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 3% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 2% increase in average ticket.Food comps were 2% and the company’s core beverage comp (excluding holiday limited time offerings) was 1%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 31% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 27% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 100 bps to 23% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of food-related mix shift.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 9% to $843.7 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 1%, softer than 2% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth, delivering 6% in the quarter (softer than 8% in the preceding quarter). Japan’s comp growth continues to be negatively impacted by softness in limited time offerings and Frappuccino limited-time offerings, in particular.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 210 bps year over year to 23.3% in the quarter, buoyed by strong sales leverage and positive currency effect.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were up 8% year over year at $283.9 million in the segment, as higher revenues from addition of new stores and positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 2% (against 1% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 300 bps to 13.8% due to softer performance in its company-owned stores.Channel Development (CPG): Channel Development's net revenues improved 1% to $560.3 million. The growth was driven by its foodservice, international and packaged coffee channels.Operating margin contracted 50 bps to 43.4%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 22% to $120 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks now expects global comp growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance at 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in in the high single digits.The company expects its GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.32-$3.36.Starbucks now expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, the raised view reflects net impact of the new U.S. tax law's federal statutory tax rate and related reinvestments.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2817,MCD,"Wingstop Restaurants Inc. (WING  -  Free Report) recently announced that its international restaurant count exceeded 100 in December.The 100th location was opened in Reynosa, Mexico. The restaurant opening marked the country’s 60th location. Notably, Mexico is the company’s first and the longest running international market that has helped it gain global traction.The company, which is known for its global expansion strategies, has established more than 1,000 locations worldwide, including the United States, Mexico, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.We note that shares of Wingstop have rallied 40% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20.8%. Expansion to to Boost Traffic & Sales The 100th location adds to Wingstop’s rapidly growing brand portfolio. Expansion and brand building seem to be the company’s primary strategies to drive growth. We believe that continual international development will strengthen Wingstop’s global brand presence that would eventually pave way for long-term growth.In the third quarter of 2017, the company announced 32 net restaurant openings, of which five were in international markets. In the said quarter, Wingstop forayed into Saudi Arabia which reached the company’s restaurants count to 94 in seven countries outside the United States.The company also signed two international development agreements for 110 restaurants across Australia and New Zealand over the next 10 years and more than 70 restaurants in France over the next 12 years. Continual global expansion is part of the company’s broader goal to achieve a position among the top ten global restaurant brands.Cash Generation to Enhance Shareholders’ ValueWingstop’s relentless global expansion is made possible by its franchisee business model that strengthens brand recognition and helps the company drive free cash flow.Solid cash balance gives management the flexibility to pursue opportunities in different markets as well as increase dividend payout. These are expected to continue enhancing Wingstops’ shareholders’ value.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWingstop has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the U.S. restaurant space are Famous Dave's of America, Inc. , Good Times Restaurants, Inc.

2818,MCD,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has been struggling with tepid comparable-store sales or comps growth in the United States for quite some time now. This is primarily due to persistent decline in the country’s restaurant sales. Soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains.This is evident from the company’s 2.9% increase in share price in the last year compared with 19.9% growth of the industry. Also, the trend in fiscal 2018 earnings estimate revisions is not satisfactory as it has moved down 0.4% in the last 60 days.Nonetheless, innovative operators like Starbucks with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strong operating fundamentals that includes successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings are somewhat helping the company to offset the headwinds. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Driving FactorsIn order to counter the soft consumption trend in the United States, management has successfully focused on expansion with plans of adding 900 net new stores in its Americas segment in fiscal 2018, split evenly between company owned and licensed.Apart from multiplying store count, the company is improving customer experience through innovative store designs, up-leveling product offerings and growing margins through process and supply chain efficiencies.Starbucks’ operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. The company’s digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. These initiatives should further drive profit in the long run.The company is also deploying money in the fastest growing market, China. Starbucks is testing its upscale and super-sized cafe concept in its fastest-growing market of China. Recently, it opened its largest shop ever with the new Reserve Roastery in Shanghai, in a bid to counter sluggish U.S. sales.Management believes that China and the Asia-Pacific region will drive more meaningful business growth over the next five years. supported by rapid unit growth, growing brand awareness, and increased usage of the digital/mobile/loyalty platforms. Starbucks currently (as of Oct 1, 2017) operates 7,479 stores across China-Asia-Pacific or CAP. The company remains on track to have roughly 11,000 locations in CAP (600 in China alone) in fiscal 2018.The company also practices investor-friendly moves. In its recently released earnings call, the company highlighted that dividends over the last six-year period increased an average 24% annually and earnings payout ratio was nearly 50%. They also promised to return $15 billion to shareholders over the next three years.Indeed, weak comps growth is a cause for concern for the coffee chain giant. In the wake of soft global comps growth, Starbucks lowered long-term financial targets during the fiscal fourth quarter conference call, cutting the annual earnings growth forecast to 12% versus the prior guidance for 15-20%. The company expects global comps of 3-5% and high single-digit net revenue growth (versus prior expectation of 10% or greater).That said, the company’s strong operating fundamental, successful innovations along with focus on the fastest growing market will help it in maintaining its stature in the coffee world.Other Key PicksInvestors can also consider stocks like Famous Dave's of America, Inc. , Good Times Restaurants Inc. (GTIM  -  Free Report) and McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report).Earnings estimates for Famous Dave's of America, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, have moved from a loss of 6 cents to earnings of 6 cents for 2018.Good Times Restaurants is likely to witness 33.3% earnings growth in the current fiscal year.McDonald's delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.21%.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

2819,MCD,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is set to report its fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Jan 30, before the bell.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 0.57%. In fact, McDonald's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 5.21%.Notably, shares of the company have returned 41.4% in the past year.McDonald's Corporation Price McDonald's Corporation Price | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWe expect the company’s solid comps growth to drive quarterly results. Meanwhile, though increased focus on refranchising is likely to boost earnings, it may have an adverse impact on revenue growth in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.59, representing a year-over-year increase of 10.4%. The same for revenues is projected to be $5.3 billion, down 12.8% from the prior-year quarter.Comps Growth Does Not Guarantee Revenue GrowthGlobal comps at McDonald’s have been positive for the last nine quarters, a trend that is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well. This appears to be the result of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales.In order to boost comps in the United States, McDonald’s has been increasingly focusing on growing guest traffic. In this regard, the company is striving to achieve operational excellence, innovate, offer a value menu and roll out more limited-time offerings.Despite these efforts, a challenging restaurant environment may cause a decline in revenues in the U.S. segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the U.S. segment revenues is pegged at $1.96 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 3.7%.Coming to High-Growth Markets, comprehensive focus on new products, alongside growth across the delivery, value and breakfast platforms are yielding results. However, political and economic unrest are likely to somewhat hurt sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in High-Growth Markets is pegged at $975 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 35.8%.The international lead segment may appear as an exception. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.82 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.5%.In International Lead Markets, McDonald’s is consistently trying to improve its performance and drive comps via introduction of value meals, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery.Also, McDonald’s is likely to witness a decline in sales by company-operated restaurants due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative, which, in turn, will lower the company’s revenues in the fourth quarter. Evidently, revenues at company-operated restaurants decreased 23% to $3.06 billion in the last quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.54 billion for the quarter under review, representing a year-over-year estimated decline of 30.4%.Our Model Suggests a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.McDonald’s has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.01%, a combination that suggests that the company is likely to beat estimates.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same space are Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), Dunkin' Brands Group (DNKN  -  Free Report) and Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report). While Darden and Dunkin' Brands sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Domino's carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Darden, Dunkin' Brands and Domino’s earnings are expected to improve 17.4%, 15.2% and 36.8%, respectively in 2018.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and an increase of 1% in ticket in fiscal 2016.In Q4, membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 25% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 390 basis points to 24%, as strong sales leverage was more than offset by hurricanes, higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.Q1 ExpectationThe company’s segment is likely to experience higher revenues with comps growth in the mid-single digits or more. The improvement is expected to be driven by additional store openings, Starbucks’ mobile order/pay along with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty, and e-Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams to boost its top line.Overall, Starbucks’ Americas segment revenues are expected to witness 8.3% growth year over year and 9.4% sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Again, operating margin will be driven by strong sales leverage that will be partly offset by higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.Apart from the Americas segment, Starbucks’ Channel Development business needs special mention. Although the business is small (in terms of its revenue contribution), it generates impressive operating margins, owing to its cost structure. Hence, the Channel Development segment represents a significant profitable growth opportunity.Overall Earnings & Revenues ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 57 cents reflects a 9.6% growth from the prior-year quarter profit of 52 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $6.15 billion indicates a 7.2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Starbucks’s operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. Again, digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. Internationally, the company’s focus on China/Asia expansion is another positive.Meanwhile, change in the product mix (as food, tea and cold beverages will become an increasing part of the product mix), focus on the use of loyalty cards and mobile order and pay technology to boost sales and profits are added tailwinds. Finally, Starbucks’ endeavor to boost its presence in premium coffee consumed at home through K-cups and with ready-to-drink beverages needs special attention.Overall, apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. That said, headwinds, especially in the labor front is a cause for concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

2822,MCD,"After a banner year for equities in 2017, with major bourses notching all-time highs, investors now mull over what 2018 might unfold. Many market pundits believe that this will be another solid year for U.S. stocks.  Benchmarks have already kicked off the New Year on a high note, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing above 7,000 for the first time.Investors are betting that lowering of corporate tax and solid economic growth will lead to strong earnings growth. Record end-of-year holiday sales, in the meanwhile, have given traditional retailers and department store chains a shot in the arm as Americans remain optimistic about their financial wealth.Given such bullish trends, investing in big-brand stocks seems prudent. They are well-established and financially stable enough to cash in on this uptrend. But, there are significant headwinds confronting this year as well. We shouldn’t forget that such bull runs that have sent the bourses to record highs may soon come crashing down. Valuation measures such as price-earnings ratios are raising caution. In the wake of adverse events as well, one can fall back on these stocks. After all, they have established business models and tend to draw consumers and investor attention even when the equity market is choppy.Winners From the Republican Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Also, the tax cut will be implemented next year instead of being delayed until 2019. Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax. Meanwhile, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help multinationals, including large tech majors, bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities.Banks also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, major banks will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20%.The tax bill, in the meanwhile, will provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. This in turn will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods, eventually helping retailers.Retail Stages a Solid ComebackRetailers also witnessed plenty of green in the holiday season. Total retail sales jumped 4.9% compared with the same period last year. This turned out to be the highest year-over-year rise since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report released on Dec 26.  The strong economy was a contributing factor but a pretty low unemployment rate encouraged investors to spend even more this holiday season. Moreover, consumers continue to feel confident about spending this year and beyond. As per the Conference Board, consumer confidence continues to hover near the 17-year high scaled last November.Pricey Stock MarketTwo-third of the money managers, in the meanwhile, finds the U.S. stock market’s recent record run unsettling. The gains in the current nine-year-old bull market are nearly 300%.This is the second-strongest bull run since World War II, trailing only to a massive 417% gain during October 1990 and March 2000, per data compiled by LPL Financial and FactSet Research Systems Inc.Time to Buy Big Brands: 5 Solid ChoicesWith the U.S. stock market incessantly hitting intraday and closing highs, investing in big-brand companies will be judicious. Such companies sell widely accepted products and services that can make most of the positive trends. But, if overvaluation fears pull the market down in the near term, these stocks will offer some respite as they boast stable cash flows. Needless to say, the value of brands is that they instantly convey to consumers information about quality, durability and consistency. These traits help such stocks counter market gyrations.We have thus selected five of the best big-brand American stocks that have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2823,MCD,"El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report) started the year with the introduction of four ‘Under 500 Calories’ menu items.This is in line with the company’s aim to introduce a differentiated menu to counter intense competition in the fast food space. ‘Under 500 Calories’ items will feature nutrient-packed ingredients combined with El Pollo Loco’s signature flavors and are a healthier alternative to typical fast food.We observe that El Pollo Loco’s stock has lost 26.6% in the past six months as against the industry’s gain of 4.3%.Menu Innovation to Drive Traffic & CompsGiven a challenging sales environment, it is imperative for restaurants to understand customers’ tastes and preferences. With consumers opting for healthier alternatives, the ‘Under 500 Calories’ is expected to meet consumer needs and improve overall traffic. This in turn is likely to drive comps.El Pollo Loco expects to boost comps through continuous innovation of popular menu items. Reasonable pricing and excellent customer service are other positives. The U.S. restaurant industry has been under the weather over the past few quarters as continued softness in consumer spending on dining out has dented sales. Resultantly, comps growth has been weak. Foot traffic also declined, denting profits at many restaurants.Meanwhile, in order to keep up with food giants like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), it is important for El Pollo Loco to continue improvising the menu, re-imaging stores and offering loyalty programs.In fact, menu innovation and a strong brand position helped drive traffic for the company in the last two quarters.Other Initiatives to Drive SalesEl Pollo Loco is known for its sales-building initiatives. The company’s relentless focus on providing excellent service through advertising campaigns is expected to boost comps further.In addition, El Pollo Loco has made significant progress with various technology initiatives, designed to provide convenience to loyalty customers. In June 2017, the company had initiated a partnership with Olo's Dispatch Delivery service, which covers 40% of El Polo Loco’s system-wide locations. The company expects technological and delivery initiatives to be major sales drivers in the quarters ahead.To ConcludeDespite the company’s sales-boosting efforts, high labor costs, pre-opening costs of outlets and expenses related to the execution of various initiatives are expected to keep profits under pressure.Nonetheless, continual menu improvisation and aggressive marketing are likely to drive sales.El Pollo Loco has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

2824,MCD,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) has been grappling with declining sales for quite some time.   Despite economic growth, consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out, which resulted in low consumption and decreased demand in the U.S. restaurant space.The company’s shares have lost 2% in the last six months as against the industry’s gain of 4.3%.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has moved down 10.6% and 7.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and full year 2018, respectively. This reflects bearish analyst sentiments.Let’s delve deeper into the company’s pressing concerns —Declining Sales Pose ConcernThe U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing for investors over the past few quarters as continued softness in consumer spending on dining out has dented sales. Resultantly, comps growth has been weak. Foot traffic also declined lowering profits at many restaurants. Resultantly, Jack in the Box’s sales are under pressure.The company recorded total revenues of $1.55 billion in fiscal 2017 as compared with $1.6 billion in fiscal 2016. Moreover, comps at the company-owned stores were down 1.1% in fiscal 2017, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year’s flat comps. Comps at company-owned Qdoba restaurants were down 3%, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year rise of 1.7%.We note that the consensus estimate for fiscal 2018 revenues is pegged at $1.3 billion, reflecting a 14.9% year-over-year decline.Sales Deleverage & Other ExpensesNotably, persistent decline in comps has dented Jack in the Box’s sales. Capital expenditure has also been high. Moreover, rise in labor wages and commodity inflation are also adding to the woes. This has reduced the company’s restaurant operating margin by 210 basis points (bps) in fiscal 2017.In order to drive margins, the company plans on shifting to a less capital-intensive business model and focus more on core operations to pay off debt under term loan. Toward this end, Jack in the Box recently sold its Qdoba subsidiary to a private equity firm. The company believes that the sale will help strengthen liquidity.However, sales deleverage from negative comps are expected to weigh on profits.Refranchising Yet to Pay OffIn order to drive margins, the company’s Jack in the Box brand has been refranchising company-owned restaurants for quite some time now. Jack in the Box restaurants are currently 88% franchised, which the company plans to increase to around 95%. The company believes that the refranchising will considerably lower the general and administrative expenses and in turn boost earnings. Moreover, over the long term, such measures will generate a higher return on equity (ROE) by lowering capital requirements. This will also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholders’ return. However, contrary to the desirable effects of refranchising, we note that the company’s trailing 12-month ROE is -30.5% as against the industry’s 6.9%. This reflects management’s inability to reinvest shareholder’s money effectively.Limited International Presence, Stiff CompetitionAmerican dining brands are keen on expanding in the fast-growing emerging markets. While several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report)and Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened outlets in emerging markets; Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front. Thus, limited international presence might be a big drag for the company and hurt its competitive position. Moreover, the company is experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.To conclude, we believe that a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the above reasons underscore the fact why you should steer clear of Jack in the Box.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

2825,MCD,"Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 5. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.4%.In fact, its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 13.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Constellation Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has declined in the last 30 days. The current estimate of $1.87 per share for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year decline of nearly 4.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.86 billion, which is 2.9% higher than the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have surged 14.3%, while the industry grew 3%.Factors at PlayConstellation Brands has been on a roll owing to strong brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and robust quarterly results. The company’s focus on brand building, strength in beer business and efforts to include new products in its wine and spirits portfolio are the key catalysts. Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, these factors assisted the company to showcase another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year-over-year and 11th straight positive surprise. Moreover, sales advanced while favorable pricing, volumes and lower cost of goods sold provided a boost to margins.Further, the company continues to gain from the recent buyouts and strength in the beer business, which encouraged management to raise fiscal 2018 earnings view. Management also hiked fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90-$8.10 per share. Operating income is now anticipated to grow 13-15% for the beer segment.The company is also on track with its Nava brewery expansion, while it also enhanced wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars. These factors make us optimistic about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Constellation Brands has an Earnings ESP of -0.07%. While the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

2826,MCD,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 3. The big question facing investors is whether this drug store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company reported loss per share of 1 cent, which was in line with estimates. Further, the company has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 20.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 2 cents per share, against earnings of 2 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.74 billion, down 4.4% from the prior-year quarter.Following the recent sale of 250 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), Rite Aid’s shares have shown some momentum. The company’s shares dipped 2.4% in the last three months, narrower than the industry’s decline of 7.1%.Factors at PlayAfter the aforementioned sale of stores to Walgreens, Rite Aid is poised to improve financial leverage and balance sheet using the funds from the transaction. To strengthen operations, Rite Aid remains focused on remodeling wellness stores. These newly renovated wellness stores tempt customers to spend more time on selecting their personal care products, consequently enabling the company to generate increased sales.In another move to enhance customer experience, Rite Aid started accepting payments via digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, as well as other tap and pay credit and debit cards. Recently, the company resorted to accepting Apple Pay online, as customers are using smartphones to make transactions. In fact, management stated that over half of its website visitors access www.riteaid.com from their mobiles, the most being iPhone users. This development is likely to provide customers with a more convenient and better shopping experience that in turn will attract more traffic.Additionally, the company has been undertaking a number of strategies to drive growth such as the expansion of its pharmacy and clinical services, along with the reduction of costs.  Rite Aid has utilized additional resources, such as the introduction of HealthSpot telehealth booths at its Ohio pharmacies, addition of RediClinics to its stores, its Wellness+ with Plenti program, as well as the Flu Immunization program to stimulate customer demand amid the soft macroeconomic scenario. The company also acquired EnvisionRx, which will enable it to offer cost-friendly health plans and solutions for employers, drive growth and bolster shareholder value.On the cost front, the company is focusing on generating cost savings through centralized indirect procurement of drugs and reduction in supply chain costs. We believe that these programs and initiatives will enable the company to increase customer base and facilitate the generation of long-term profitability as well.However, the company remains prone to competition from rivals. Rite Aid’s generic drug sales have been adversely affected by Wal-Mart’s strategy of entering the retail generic drug market. Due to Wal-Mart’s wide array of manufacturers in India, Israel, and the United States, the mass merchant offers generic drugs at a discounted price compared with its rival companies. Further, speculations about Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) entry in the drugstore business remain a threat.Nonetheless, let’s see if Rite Aid’s growth drivers can help counter the challenges this time around.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rite Aid is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2827,MCD,"The restaurant industry has been lacking zing over the past few quarters. Negative comps resulting from sluggish traffic, along with rising costs, continue to take the shine out of restaurant stocks.Nevertheless, some of the big names like McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) have done well on the back of strong fundamentals and innovative offerings.In fact, McDonald's and Yum! Brands are two companies that have adopted a de-risking strategy, dropping their ownership of restaurants through refranchising. This reduces capital requirements, boosts earnings per share growth and makes them less vulnerable to food inflation.In addition, growing free cash flow allows both the companies to make investments for increasing brand recognition and shareholder returns.With both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let’s find out which company is placed better with respect to some key parameters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Share Price MovementYear to date, McDonald's has had a more impressive run on the bourse with a return of 41.2% while Yum! Brands has gained 30.3% in the last year. Notably, both have outperformed the industry that has rallied 14.4% in the same time frame.Projected Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. Earnings growth is definitely necessary and it along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Both McDonald's and Yum! brands have their own initiatives in place to boost earnings. While McDonald's is keen on operational excellence, product innovation, offering a value menu and rolling out more limited-time offerings, Yum! Brands is working on a strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands. It is also shifting toward a single point-of-sale system in the United States.Yum! Brands is expected to see higher earnings growth than McDonald's in 2018. Its EPS is projected to grow 13.1% while that of McDonald's is expected to increase 6.8%.  So, Yum! Brands has an edge over McDonald's in this respect.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Both McDonald's and Yum! Brands have outperformed the industry year to date, which has a net margin TTM of 15.8%. However, McDonald's has a lead since its TTM net margin is higher at 22.4%, compared with Yum! Brands 16.1.Valuation The EV/EBITDA ratio offers a clear picture of a company’s valuation and its earnings potential. Typically, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. This signals that a stock is undervalued.Both McDonald's and Yum! Brands are overvalued relative to their broader industry that has an EV/EBIDA value of 13.8. However, McDonald's holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 16.1, compared to Yum! Brands’ 19.8.Earnings History, ESP and EstimatesBoth McDonald's and Yum! Brands have delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the prior four quarters. While McDonald's has an average earnings surprise of 5.2%, Yum! stands out with an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.However, McDonald's Earnings ESPof +0.54% lends it an edge over Yum! Brands, which has an Earnings ESP of -7.04%.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's full year has increased 0.15% over the last 30 days, it has remained unchanged in case of Yum! Brands over the same time frame.To ConcludeOur comparative analysis reveals that McDonald's has an edge over Yum! Brands in terms of share price movement, net margin, EV/EBITA ratio, Earnings ESP and estimate revisions. Yum! Brands, on the other hand, is better poised than McDonald's in terms of projected EPS and boasts a solid earnings surprise track record.So, with a lead in most of the evaluated metrics, McDonald's, appears to take precedence at the moment.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2828,MCD,"Like most U.S. restaurant chains, BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) is facing the brunt of soft consumer spending. The company believes that greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives will help it counter the challenging sales environment.         Although the company slowed down its expansion plans for 2017 and 2018, it has not entirely refrained from unit growth in the year.In regard to this, BJ’s Restaurants recently announced the opening of its first restaurant in Taylor, MI. Located at the Southland Center, the 7,500-square feet BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse seats approximately 230 guests and features a wide-ranging menu.The Taylor restaurant is the last store to be opened by the company this year, reaching the current-year restaurant count to 10.Efforts to Counter Challenging SalesThe company plans to open only four to six restaurants in 2018. The curtailment in openings might further dent the company’s sales in a space that is dominated by big names like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), among others.Notably, BJ’s Restaurants shares have lost 8.8% year to date, while its industry grew 14.3%.The company’s decision to slow down openings for some time and instead focus more on enterprise resources to drive sales might turn out to be favorable providing momentum to margins and free cash flow. When combined with the company’s conservative balance sheet, these measures are likely to provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases.BJ’s Restaurants is focused on sales building strategies that can help drive the top line. By implementing these strategies, the company aims to differentiate its food quality and uniqueness, improve speed of service and redefine its brand messaging and media strategies.Menu innovation continues to be the restaurant’s major traffic-building strategy. The company has developed a robust pipeline of menu items, including several new items focused on its EnLIGHTened menu category, featuring new super food options. Its slow roast menu also continues to drive healthy check growth.Moreover, given the fact that off-premise sales represent a considerable revenue growth opportunity, the company has been undertaking various efforts to enhance delivery and take-out services. In fact, it intends to leverage its high rated mobile app and website, along with new third-party delivery partners to drive growth in off-premise sales. Resultantly, off-premise sales grew roughly 17% in the third quarter and is further increasing on incremental sales and traffic.The company expanded its daily Brewhouse specials, which showcase several of its popular signature menu items at attractive prices.This is likely to drive traffic further for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

2829,MCD,"This has been a banner year for the broad U.S. stock market, with the major benchmarks scaling multiple highs in the final weeks. In particular, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved up 5,000 points this year — the biggest annual gain in its history — and is moving closer to another major milestone of 25,000.The index hit the mark of 20,000 on Jan 25, 21,000 on Mar 1, 22,000 on Aug 1, 23,000 on Oct 17 and 24,000 just three weeks ago. Additionally, the Dow Jones logged its 70th record close of the year, the highest-ever number of record closes in a calendar year. This suggests strong complacency in the stock market.Optimism over tax reform and higher chances of the plan being signed into law this Christmas has acted as the latest catalyst to the second-largest bull market. This is especially true, as a massive $1.4-trillion tax cut will lead to an economic surge, boosting job growth and reflation trade. It will further accelerate earnings, leading to increased dividend and buyback activities. Additionally, the tax repatriation will allow companies to bring the offshore cash back home, paving the way for increased mergers and acquisitions.Further, the dual tailwinds of strong corporate earnings and solid global economic growth, with most major countries growing simultaneously for the first time in years, are driving the rally throughout the year. The combination of other factors like a rise in oil price and higher interest rates are also fueling growth in the market.Given this, most of the stocks on the blue-chip index have delivered astounding returns. Below, we have highlighted five players that are leading the index this year and are likely to continue doing so heading into the New Year.Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Based in Chicago, IL, The Boeing Company is the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems.

2831,MCD,"U.S. equities have had a stellar run on strong growth and rising optimism around President Donald Trump’s tax reform. However, latest developments in the political landscape in the United States spell trouble for the Republicans.Positives for TrumpGDP growth for the United States was revised up to 3.3% in the third quarter compared with 3.1% in the previous quarter. The third quarter reading was revised from an initial reading of 3%. This was the strongest quarterly growth reading in three years. Non-farm payrolls increased 228,000 in November, per the Labor Department.Moreover, unemployment rate came in at 4.1%, a 17-year low. This comes as a positive for Trump, who seeks to brand himself as a leader of the masses.Risks InvolvedHowever, all’s not well for the Trump administration. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy S. Moore in the Senate election in Alabama, a deep red state which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the November 2016 Presidential election. Moore had been accused of sexual abuse and child molestation, which might have been a factor for the relatively low support he received.“We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,” Jones said. “This entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign has been about the rule of law,” he added.The GOP Senate majority has slimmed to 51-49 after Moore’s defeat. This might create difficulties for the Trump administration to pass its key legislations.Although the Senate passed the Republican tax reform, there are increased concerns around the differences in the versions of the House and Senate. Moreover, geopolitical risks weigh on the markets. Last month, North Korea launched a Hwasong-15 missile with improved technology that flew over Japan in a latest show of force.Owing to the high uncertainty in the markets, we believe it is best to opt for low volatility.

Revenues from this segment increased 4.1% year over year in the third quarter.Onboard and Other revenues will carry on the momentum of the third quarter (up 6.7% year over year), the segment is anticipated to record improvement in the quarter. Growth will be driven by the company’s ongoing initiatives to increase revenues.These include offering all-inclusive spa packages, beverage packages, and specialty restaurants and strengthening onboard bar and casino programs along with using various marketing and promotional tools. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for onboard and other segment revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.2%.Strength across all segments will contribute significantly toward year-over-year growth of Carnival’s total revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for which is currently pegged at $4.15 billion, representing an increase of 5.8%.Carnival Corporation Revenue (TTM) Carnival Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Carnival Corporation QuoteNet Revenue Yields to Benefit from Higher Net ticket, Net On-board and Other YieldsWhile ticket yields are likely to be driven by the Carnival’s deployment of North American brands in Caribbean, Europe and Alaska; net on-board and other yields will see strengths on both sides of the Atlantic.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenue yields is pegged at $165 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.8%.

2833,MCD,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report) renewed marketing efforts and cost-cutting initiatives seem encouraging.However, rising labor costs amid a tepid sales environment along with limited geographical presence remain potent headwinds for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recently, Cracker Barrel posted mixed first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line lagging the same. Notably, the last reported quarter marked the 26th successive earnings beat for the company. However, the company reported lower-than-expected revenues in 10 of the last 11 quarters. Key Growth DriversIn order to mitigate the choppy sales e U.S. restaurant sales environment, Cracker Barrel has been taking up several initiatives to drive top-line growth. The company heavily relies on marketing efforts that include expansion of its long-standing brand’s footprint in new and developing markets. Currently, there are 647 Cracker Barrel locations in the United States and the company expects to add eight or nine more stores in fiscal 2018.In addition, the company’s flagship fast casual concept, Holler & Dash Biscuit House, continues to gain momentum. Currently, there are eight Holler & Dash Biscuit House outlets in the United States and the company plans to open three more in fiscal 2018.In order to attract customers and boost the top line, the company relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited period offers.

Cracker Barrel plans to enhance its off-premise platform through the introduction of a catering menu and in-store training of hourly employees. In October, the company completed a system-wide rollout in all its off-premise platforms. Considering off-premise sales to be the primary component of full-year sales growth target, the company plans to support growth in off-premise through marketing efforts like social and digital messaging, geo-targeted consumer emails and in-store collateral.Coming to menu innovation, the company recently introduced a coffee platform in approximately 40 stores. Cracker Barrel believes that the platform will complement the strength of its offering, drive check favorability and promote guest perceptions of menu variety. The rollout of the crafted coffee program at all stores is expected to be complete by the end of fiscal third quarter.Apart from focusing on the top line, Cracker Barrel has adopted various cost-cutting initiatives to drive margins. Through a food management program and efficient cost saving in the utility front, the company has been able to drive cost favorability.In the beginning of fiscal 2017, the company planned to bring down annual operating costs by $15 million to $20 million. In fact, Cracker Barrel delivered 15% above the high end of its fiscal-year target and achieved its three-year strategic goal of reducing $50 million of annual costs by fiscal 2017-end. In fiscal 2018, the company expects to record $7 million to $8 million in annual cost savings.Notably, in order to enhance shareholder’s value, Cracker Barrel has been paying dividends since 2003 and has hiked it several times since then. Moreover, in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company declared additional special dividends of $3.50, $3.20 and $3.00 per share, respectively. A continuous increase in quarterly dividends and declaration of a special dividend affirm the company’s optimistic outlook and prospects.In fact, the company delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 35.1% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 6.9%. This supports its growth potential and also reinstates our faith in the company’s fundamentals and cash flow position.ConcernsDespite the company’s efficient cost-saving methods, higher labor costs and expenses related to various sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on margins. Subsequently, Cracker Barrel’s shares have declined 2.8% year to date, against 14.6% growth of the industry it belongs to.This performance is further aggravated by downward estimate revisions. Over the last 30 days, current-year earnings estimates have moved down by 0.2%, reflecting analysts’ pessimism surrounding the stock. Notably, despite its substantial domestic presence, Cracker Barrel loses out in terms of international presence. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion strategies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak on this front.Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic. Meanwhile, management notes that Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been affected by challenges in the retail industry, as a whole. Thus, given the persistent challenges in the restaurant and retail industry, the company’s top line is likely to remain under pressure.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2834,MCD,"Tuesday, October 24, 2017We’ve already got a busy day of Q3 earnings reports to sift through, and market participants should take heart that, by and large, most major companies reporting before the opening bell have outperformed expectations — in some cases by a wide margin. After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%. Caterpillar has also upped full-year guidance to around $6.25 per share; $5.26 was the previous Zacks consensus estimate. CAT also carries a Zacks Style Score of A.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) also outperformed expectations this morning: its $1.32 per share easily outperformed the $1.07 expected — though results are still down more than 20% year over year — on quarterly sales of $33.62 billion — well beyond the $31.6 billion we had been looking for. GM looks to bring two electric cars to market in the next year and a half. It also has posted a positive earnings surprise for at least the past five straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of 14.7%. Shares of GM are up 3% at this point in today’s pre-market.Defense and aerospace major United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations on earnings, revenues and guidance. This is the third straight earnings beat for the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, Otis Elevators, and many other companies: $1.73 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, whereas the top-line actual of $15.1 billion outperformed the $14.9 billion we had been looking for. Full-year guidance was also raised from $6.45 - 6.60 per share to $6.58 - 6.63.Industrial supply giant 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) also beat top and bottom-line estimates prior to Tuesday’s open, with earnings of $2.33 per share and revenues of $8.17 billion surprising the $2.21 per share and $7.91 billion expected. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up notably, from the previous Zacks consensus estimate of $8.95 per share to $9.00 - 9.15 as of its Q3 report. Shares of 3M are up 1.6% thus far in today’s pre-market.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 earnings report this morning, beating earnings estimates by a penny to $1.76 per share on $5.76 billion, which was a bit shy of the $5.80 billion expected. The Zacks ESP called this one-cent beat exactly, even as the negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit same-store sales in Texas and Florida from Q3 2016. In fact, U.S. comps were up 4.1% in the quarter, and International was up 6%. Shares are currently up 1.3% in early trading.Other companies this morning to have surpassed expectations and also raised full-year guidance are Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Polaris (PII  -  Free Report).

The company aims to continuously build its brand by adapting to changing consumer preference.McDonald’s comps have improved in its key regions over the last few quarters on the back of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales. It has been focusing on operational excellence, product innovation, undertaking efficient marketing and promotions, offering a value menu, and rolling out more limited-time offerings to improve guest count – which remains the company’s top priority – and drive the top line.Meanwhile, efforts to enhance digital capabilities, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should further drive growth.However, a slowdown in emerging markets and soft industry growth has been hurting sales while high costs along with negative currency translation is denting the company’s profitability.Investors should note that the consensus estimate for MCD has been moving slightly upwards over the last 60 days.

2836,MCD,"Burger giant, McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), is set to report its third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 24, before the opening bell.We expect the company’s solid comps growth on the back of various sales and digital initiatives to drive top- and bottom-line results in the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, though increased focus on refranchising is likely to boost earnings, it may hamper the quarter’s revenue growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.74, representing a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. The same for revenues is projected to be $5.7 billion, down 11.5% from the prior-year quarter. McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteVarious Initiatives to Boost Comps: Key CatalystGlobal comps at McDonald’s have been positive for the last eight quarters, marking a trend that is likely to continue in the third quarter as well. This appears to be the result of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales.Markedly, in order to boost comps in the United States that represent about 40% of the company’s business, McDonald’s has been increasingly focusing on growing guest traffic. In this regard, the company is accentuating on operational excellence, product innovation, offering a value menu and rolling out more limited-time offerings.Meanwhile, efforts to enhance digital capabilities, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States might further propel the quarter’s results.However, given the prevailing challenging restaurant environment in the domestic space, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the U.S. segment is currently pegged at nearly $2 billion, reflecting a decline of nearly 3% year over year.In International Lead Markets, McDonald’s is consistently trying to improve its performance and drive comps via introduction of value meals, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service and increased convenience via delivery. Coming to High-Growth Markets, comprehensive focus around new products, alongside growth across the delivery, value and breakfast platforms has started yielding results.However, political and economic unrest in key operating regions are likely to somewhat hurt sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.82 billion and $1.47 billion for International Lead Markets and High-Growth Markets, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 1% and 8.5%, respectively.Also, McDonald’s is likely to witness a decline in sales by company-owned restaurants due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative, which, in turn, will lower the company’s revenues in the third quarter. Evidently, revenues at company-operated restaurants decreased 8.9% to $3.57 billion in the last quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.07 billion for the quarter under review, representing a year-over-year estimated decline of nearly 21%.Meanwhile, higher labor costs along with currency headwinds might dent the quarter’s profits.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McDonald's is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +1.23%. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McDonald's carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of McDonald's favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks, which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +9.86% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc.

2837,MCD,"A challenging industry backdrop has been hampering the performance of most restaurant chains, The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE  -  Free Report) being no exception.Nonetheless, Cheesecake Factory has been expanding in the domestic as well as international markets despite a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space. The company is focused on opening restaurants at high grade sites to meet the targeted returns.Recently, the company announced the opening of a restaurant in Minnetonka, MN.Featuring more than 250 menu options, including nearly 50 lower calorie dishes and more than 50 signature desserts and cheesecakes, the company constantly introduces changes to its menu. Moreover, in keeping with consumer preference for healthy food, the company introduced a category called Super Foods in 2015. The new restaurant will also be featuring Super Foods section.Notably, Cheesecake Factory currently operates 209 full-service, casual dining restaurants. In addition to the domestic market, the company of late has been foraying into international markets. This is in line with the company’s strategy to keep up with industry giants like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report). In 2017, the company plans to open eight company-owned restaurants along with four international restaurants under licensing agreements.Notably, over the past few quarters, the U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing for investors. Consequently, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic has also been weak. In fact, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby making the mood somber.Cheesecake Factory’s sales have also come under pressure. In fact, after posting 29 consecutive quarters of positive comps at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the company posted a comps decline in second-quarter 2017.Continued consumer spending uncertainty might continue to weigh on the company’s comps and in turn sales. Nevertheless, increased focus on improving its speed of service and training its servers so that they render higher level of service along with various technology-enabled initiatives to boost comps bode well.Meanwhile, despite various cost-saving efforts, high labor costs, pre-opening costs of outlets given the company’s unit expansion plans and expenses related to sales initiatives are raising expenses and are likely to hurt profits. In fact, the company expects a year-over-year decline in operating margins in 2017 given the labor cost pressure and a less favorable commodity environment.Even so, we expect the company’s continuous expansion plans to add to the top line and boost its overall performance.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2838,MCD,"Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand further in Sacramento, CA. To this end, the company has inked multi-unit store development agreements with two franchisees to build nine restaurants in the region over the next several years.The first agreement is with existing franchisee, Shiva Developments, which is expected to develop four new Dunkin' Donuts restaurants. The second agreement is with a new franchisee group, NorCal Grub, which plans to develop five new outlets. Notably, the first restaurant under each of these agreements is slated to open in 2019.Currently, Dunkin’ Donuts possesses more than 50 locations in California and is continuing to recruit franchisees in the Sacramento area. These agreements are thus in sync with the company’s plan to drive growth in the region.Apart from foraying into domestic markets, the company is also looking to expand its footprint internationally, especially in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Globally, the company has more than 12,400 Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants in 46 countries and is on track to achieve its long-term goal of opening 17,000 restaurants in the United States.In the last three months, Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have outperformed its industry. While the stock rallied 16.7%, the industry gained 8.1% in the same period.However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been weak over the last few years at both its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from food & beverages companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) might continue to exert pressure on revenues.Nevertheless, we are positive on the company’s continued expansion strategies along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include product launches, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, the ongoing loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to draw customers and drive earnings as well as revenue growth.Dunkin' Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2839,MCD,"Shares of McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) gained more than 1.6% in morning trading Tuesday after analysts from Jeffries upgraded the stock. Today’s gains were enough to send McDonald’s to a new all-time high, although the company owes its current peak to a year-long rally fueled by optimism surrounding its new-age initiatives.“We find the combination of digital, remodels and delivery (with UberEats) will make a +3 percent U.S. same-store sales result very visible with potential upside depending on how quickly initiatives gain traction,” wrote Jefferies analyst Andy Barish.Barish’s firm upgraded MCD to a “Buy” rating and set a price target of $200 for the stock. This bullish call represents a 17.2% upside from Monday’s closing price and is the currently the highest analyst price target for McDonald’s.Jeffries is right to credit McDonald’s for its digital and delivery-related innovation. These new efforts have been a catalyst for the company’s current rally, which has witnessed its stock climb by a staggering 45% over the past year.McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteBarish estimates that McDonald’s will feature delivery services at 5,000 restaurants by the end of the year. In 2018, the analysts expects an additional 2,000 stores will add delivery, with the company eventually reaching a total of 10,000 locations with delivery options by the end of 2019.And what some investors might underestimate is the fast-food behemoth’s unique ability to execute its strategies on an international level. As Barish highlights in his recent note, McDonald’s is already doing about $1 billion worth of delivery sales in the Middle East and Asia. About 75% of American citizens live within three miles of a McDonald’s, so that vision should easily translate in the United States.McDonald’s is working exclusively with UberEats on its delivery mission. The food delivery wing of ride-hailing giant Uber charges a $4.99 fee per order, plus a commission from McDonald’s.Barish estimates that delivery will contribute 0.5% to the company’s same-store sales this year. In 2018 and 2019, the analyst expects McDonald’s to post 3% same-store sales growth, thanks in large part to its delivery initiatives.Our current consensus estimates are calling for McDonald’s to report earnings of $6.94 per share and revenues of $20.39 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. Total sales are expected to slump about 10% from 2017’s projected total, but earnings per share figures are expected to expand by an additional 6.4%.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2840,MCD,"A fair share of the buoyancy in Wall Street this year can be attributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The blue-chip index has been continually hitting record highs, with the latest being the 23,000-mark touched on Oct 17. The index actually set out on an astounding rally since Trump’s win and crossed a “new 1,000-point threshold for the fourth time this year.”It topped 19,000 for the first time in its 120-year history on Nov 22, 2016. And apart from some occasional dips on Trump’s policy-related uncertainty, there was no looking back. This year itself, the index hit more than 20 record highs. As a result, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) is up 15.3% this year (as of Oct 17, 2017).Instrumental StocksStocks that acted as tailwinds in the last six months were the likes of Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report).On Oct 17, 2017, International Business Machines Corp (IBM  -  Free Report), another major component of DIA, posted a beat on both lines. JNJ too beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. UnitedHealth comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its membership growth led to the outperformance. UNH and JNJ were up 5.5% and 3.4% on Oct 17 while IBM added more than 5% after hours.Trump’s Tax Reform Proposal  At the end of September, Trump revealed his much talked-about tax plan, suggesting comprehensive tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Some of the key suggestions are a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% and slashing of the number of individual tax brackets to three from seven.Goldman sees 2018 earnings for the S&P 500 companies to get a boost of 12% while Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that the new rate would benefit earnings by about 11% in 2018. Quite expectedly, Dow Jones exhibited a nice stretch on hopes of tax reform (read: ETFs to Benefit from Trump Tax Plan).Upswing in the Manufacturing SectorDomestic factory activity jumped to a more than 13-year high in September thanks to higher new orders. An uptick in manufacturing numbers can act as a strong tailwind to Dow Jones Industrial Average’s forward growth, in our opinion. After all, Dow Jones-based ETF DIA invests about 20% weight, the highest allocation, in the industrial sector (read: 3 ETFs to Play Upbeat Global Manufacturing).Good News from Oil Patch Furthermore, it has been noticed lately that Dow Jones shares a deep relationship with oil price movement.Though energy sector rally spreads optimism over the broader market as a whole, in most cases, on a particular day of oil surge, the spurt in the Dow Jones is steeper than that of the S&P 500, or vice versa.In such a scenario, the American Petroleum Institute (API) recorded a steep drawdown of 7.130 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories, against the S&P Platts’ analyst survey that expected stockpiles to fall by 3.9 million barrels for the week ending Oct 13.ETFs That Were Benefited Other Than DIAInvestors should note that leveraged Dow ETF plays favored investors for obvious reasons. Two choices are ProShares Ultra Dow30 (DDM  -  Free Report) and ProShares UltraPro Dow30 (UDOW  -  Free Report). All these Dow Jones-related funds outperformed the S&P 500-based fund (SPY) in the last six months (read: 10-Minute Guide to 10 Most Popular Leveraged ETFs).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

2841,MCD,"BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) has partnered with leading online and mobile food-ordering company in the United States — GrubHub Inc. (GRUB  -  Free Report) — to offer turnkey delivery and corporate catering at 100 BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse locations in California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia.Markedly, guests can now order their favorite dishes from BJ’s Restaurants easily via GrubHub's online and mobile platforms. In fact, GrubHub currently works with roughly 75,000 restaurant partners in more than 1,200 U.S. cities and London,Given GrubHub’s constant efforts to elevate food ordering through inventive restaurant technology, user-friendly platforms and an enhanced delivery experience, this new partnership is liley to aid Bj’s Restaurants to reach out to new guests.Currently, BJ’s Restaurants operates 195 casual dining restaurants across 25 states in the United States, under its brand names – BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse, BJ’s Restaurant & Brewery, BJ’s Pizza & Grill and BJ’s Grill.So far this year, the company’s shares have declined 21.1%, as against the industry’s growth of 9.6%.Soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space has hurt BJ's Restaurants comps growth and put sales under pressure. The recent hurricanes have further dealt a blow to the company’s top-line growth. The company is thus implementing several major sales building initiatives to navigate the challenging macro environment.In sync with these initiatives, this casual dining chain has completed the installation of new slow roasting ovens and server hand-held ordering tablets in all of its restaurants. In fact, the initial results from these two initiatives have been positive. While the new slow roasted menu items have boosted average check with high incident rates, the handheld rollout improved its order times.Meanwhile, off-premise sales represent roughly 5% of the company’s revenues compared to an industry average of nearly 10-11%. Thus, the company believes that there is a tremendous opportunity for it to build this part of its business. In fact, BJ’s Restaurants intends to leverage its highly rated mobile app and website along with new third-party delivery partners to drive growth in off-premise sales, given its considerable revenue growth opportunity.To this end, BJ’s Restaurants partnered with technology company DoorDash in July to initially launch door-to-door delivery at select BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse locations. The recent partnership with GrubHub should further enable it to cash in on the tremendously growing popularity of these services.Though an uncertain sales environment and a slowdown in the company’s 2017 development plan remain concerns, we expect increased focus on growing off-premise, online-ordering business via delivery, take-out and catering to result in increased convenience for customers and add to BJ’s Restaurants top line, going forward.BJ’s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in this sector include McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the trailing four quarters, McDonald’s and Restaurant Brands pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 7.44% and 6.46%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2842,MCD,"BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 18.  The recent hurricanes are likely to impact results for restaurant companies in the third quarter. Shares of a number restaurant companies including BJ’s Restaurants plummeted after the storms hit the United States. In the third quarter of 2017, the company’s shares lost 18.3%.Apart from recent hurricane woes, consumer behavior has been volatile and their willingness to spend on most goods, especially eating out, is showing signs of decline over the past few quarters. Most of the restaurateurs are thus bearing the brunt of soft comps and traffic trends. Particularly, negative comps, given sluggish traffic along with rising costs, are taking the sheen out of restaurateurs.BJ’s Restaurants’ comp sales have also been down for quite some time now. Comps in the second quarter declined 1.4%, a wider decline than the prior quarter’s 1.3% and the year-ago quarter’s 0.2%. The company expects a 30-basis point negative impact on comp sales in the third quarter.Again, higher labor costs and expenses involved with the execution of the initiatives are expected to keep profits under pressure. In fact, per BJ’s Restaurants’ second-quarter 2017 conference call, management expects increased food and labor costs in the to-be-reported quarter, resulting in cost of sales of around 26% or below.Moreover, pre-opening costs, higher marketing expenses as well as costs related to sales-boosting initiatives might dent margins.

2844,MCD,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on the casual dining restaurant chain, Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report).Cheddar’s Acquisition a Key PositiveIn Apr 2017, Darden completed the acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in an all-cash deal worth $780 million. Excluding certain expenses, it anticipates the transaction to be accretive to its adjusted per share in fiscal 2018 by roughly 12 cents per share.Darden believes that this addition will allow it to further fortify two of its most vital competitive advantages – considerable scale as well as wide-ranging data and insights – going ahead.In fact, as the company progresses with the integration of Cheddar’s, it gains more confidence in its synergy estimates. Management now expects to realize synergies of $22 million to $27 million by the end of fiscal 2019 (up from previously projected range of $20 million to $25 million).Efforts Taken at Other Brands to Boost SalesIn order to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand, the company has implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan. These include simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments.Also, the brand is focusing on remodeling, bar refreshes as well as technology-driven initiatives. These initiatives include the system wide rollout of tablets, launch of mobile ordering, the To Go business as well as catering in the U.S, and are expected to add to its top line.At LongHorn, Darden strives to attract guests by focusing on core menu, culinary innovation and providing regional flavors. It is also working on its marketing strategy to improve execution; customer relationship management and digital advertising as well as a strong promotional pipeline that leverages the segment’s expertise.Cost Saving Endeavors Bode WellThe company is focusing on an aggressive cost management plan, under which it has been able to significantly cut operating costs. This would help it boost profits and gain financial flexibility amid a soft consumer spending environment.In fact, for fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings.Moreover, Darden plans to reinvest any incremental savings into pricing and long-term growth drivers for the business, particularly emphasizing on enhancing quality to drive market share gains.Some Headwinds Still PersistOver the last few quarters, the U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing. Evidently, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood. As a result, the company’s sales have come under pressure.It should also be noted that while several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Darden seems to be slow on this front.In addition, the collapse of the Republican-led bill, which was intended to replace Obamacare, means that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay. This implies that the restaurant operator will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs, which in turn will hurt margins. Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses.Bottom LineDespite the prevalent headwinds, most of Darden’s brands have been witnessing growth for the last few quarters, given various sales initiatives like operational excellence, menu innovation along with technology-driven moves.Moreover, the acquisition of Cheddar's has added an undisputed casual dining value leader to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands, which might further drive comps and resultantly sales.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

However, the figure decreased 18.2% from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.59. The fall was primarily due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits.Total revenue of $155.2 million declined 3.2% year over year due to lower franchise and restaurant, rental as well as financing revenues. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $156.4 million by 0.8%.Currently, the company operates under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands.Notably, DineEquity continues to invest in the empowerment of its brands by enhancing overall franchisee financial health, closing underperforming restaurants and improving the supply chain.  Consequently, the company’s shares were up more than 4% in yesterday’s trading session, reflecting investors’ optimism regarding the initiatives undertaken to drive growth at both the brands.DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DineEquity, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DineEquity, Inc QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersIHOP's domestic system-wide comps declined 2.6%.

Despite witnessing soft sales in the last few quarters, the company believes that the IHOP brand remains on solid ground.Moreover, initiatives to improve guest satisfaction via online ordering as well as testing of delivery services and development of an IHOP mobile application are expected to create improved revenue channels.Applebee's domestic system-wide comps decreased 6.2% comparing favorably with the last quarter’s comps decline of 7.9% but unfavourably with the prior-year quarter’s decline of 4.2%. Notably, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick service restaurants. Also, consumers are favoring ordering in meals over going to brick-and-mortar retailers.Nonetheless, DineEquity believes that fiscal 2017 will be a transitional year for Applebee's, and steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, consumer satisfaction and marketing are expected to drive comps over the long term, with an improvement likely 2018 onwards.Fiscal 2017 Outlook SlashedFor fiscal 2017, Applebee's domestic system-wide comps are now expected to decrease in the range of 6–8% (a decline of 4% to 8%, expected earlier).IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are expected to be down in the range of 1% to 3% (earlier, flat to up 3%).DineEquity now expects general and administrative expenses to range between $166 million and $172 million ($170–$177 million, expected previously).Meanwhile, the company expects capital expenditure to be roughly $12 million in fiscal 2017, up from $12 million, anticipated earlier.Currently, DineEquity carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust third-quarter 2017 results, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, shares of the company declined nearly 4% in yesterday’s trading session reflecting investors’ concerns regarding decelerating comps growth.Performance in DetailAdjusted earnings of $1.27 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 by 4.1%. Further, the bottom line climbed 32.3% year over year on strong sales and a lower share count.Meanwhile, adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation have reduced tax expenses and added as much as 7 cents to Domino's earnings in the reported quarter.Quarterly revenues jumped 13.6% year over year to $643.6 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630.8 million by over 2%. The improvement was on the back of higher supply chain revenues as well as increased same store sales, and store count growth at both domestic and international markets.CompsGlobal retail sales (including total sales of franchise and company-owned units) were up 14.5% year over year. The uptick was primarily owing to strong comps from international stores. Excluding foreign currency impact, global retail sales increased 14.2%.During the quarter, the company’s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) comps increased 8.4%. This compared unfavorably with 13% growth in the year-ago quarter and 9.5% growth in the previous quarter.The company experienced year-over-year comps growth of 8.4% at domestic company-owned stores, lower than 13.8% comps growth in the year-ago quarter and 11.2% growth in the last quarter.

The rise in the company’s net income was primarily driven by an increase in comps growth and store count as well as higher supply chain volumes. The adoption of the new equity-based compensation accounting standard too drove net income.

2847,MCD,"Despite huge volatility, bitcoin is the hottest trade this year. After wild swings last week, the digital currency hit another record high of above $11,800, representing more than 30% surge from a low of $9,021.85 hit on Nov 30.The cryptocurrency topped the five-figure mark of 10,000 on Nov 28 and climbed another $1,000 in 24 hours. Then it dropped more than $1,000 in just a few hours.Bitcoin Futures Coming UpThe latest surge came as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the listing of bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report). CME will begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on Dec 18, while CBOE will be the first to begin bitcoin futures trading on Dec 10.The introduction of bitcoin derivatives will bring a great deal of liquidity and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It would give investors a way to buy and trade in the digital currency market, which is otherwise not readily available. The derivatives would upgrade the bitcoin status to a more-established asset class. A better and mature regulatory environment will be a huge boon to the digital currency, leading to increased investment in the booming cryptocurrency, with a growing number of retail investors.Further, Nasdaq plans to launch bitcoin futures as early as in the second quarter of 2018. In the race to bitcoin trading, the Tokyo Financial Exchange is also preparing to launch its own bitcoin derivatives futures product. All these will pave the way for further rally.Venezuela Cryptocurrency On the wayThe digital currency also got a boost from Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro’s announcement of starting the country’s own cryptocurrency called the “petro” to shore up its economy. The currency was backed by commodity reserves, including oil, gold, gas and diamonds.Bullish ViewsMany market watchers are optimistic about the future of the digital currency. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predicts bitcoin to hit $40,000 at the end of 2018. According to him, investors are pouring into cryptocurrencies due to lack of trust in financial institutions following the 2008 crash. Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas projects the cryptocurrency to hit $14,000 in 2018.A combination of other factors such as soaring demand and rising institutional investor interest are pushing up the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin Turning Bigger and BetterWith the latest surge, the digital currency is just a few percentages away from $12,000 and has become the world’s sixth most valuable circulating currency in the world, within eight years of its launch. Total value of all bitcoins in circulation has reached $190 billion.  The astronomical surge of more than 1000% this year has made bitcoin more valuable than some of the largest companies, namely PespsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) and Mc Donald (MCD  -  Free Report), with a market cap of $166.1 billion, $161.6 billion and $137.8 billion, respectively. The cryptocurrency is even more valuable than the combined world’s most influential banks Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report). Goldman has a market cap of $94.4 billion while UBS has $66.2 billion.If these weren’t enough, the cryptocurrency surpassed the estimated worth of some of the world’s top billionaires like $90 billion for Gates and $83 billion for Warren Buffet. Further, bitcoin is worth more than seven times an ounce of gold, which is traditionally seen as a safe haven amid turmoil.Moreover, bitcoin has been firing all cylinders, as Google searches for bitcoin have surpassed searches for President Donald Trump as well as stocks in the last few weeks. Google searches are indicative of mainstream investor interest in bitcoin.Bitcoin ETFs NextThe bitcoin futures would pave the way for bitcoin ETFs, some of which were already rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing lack of regulation of the bitcoin spot market and unavailability of bitcoin futures contracts.Earlier this year, the SEC denied various requests for the first proposed bitcoin ETF — Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN). The bitcoin ETF, proposed by SolidX Management, was also rejected in March. VanEck filed for an ETF that invests in bitcoin derivatives in mid-August but withdrew its application. REX also filed for two ETFs, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which will also invest in bitcoin-based derivatives.In late September, ProShares filed for two ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. These funds also intend to purchase derivative contracts for exposure, rather than actual bitcoins.As such, with the launch of bitcoin futures this month, bitcoin ETFs is not far from entering the market. Many analysts believe that the SEC will approve ETFs that trade bitcoin futures contracts in the near future.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2852,MCD,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) recently reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, with both earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, the company’s shares increased over 2% in afterhours trading on Aug 9, given improved sequential comparable-store sales (comps) at both the brands.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC continues to assist the board in its assessment of possible alternatives with respect to the Qdoba brand coupled with other ways to boost shareholder value.Notably, there is no guarantee that the evaluation process will result in any transaction and the company has also not set a timetable for conclusion of the evaluation process.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 99 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 by 5.7%. Further, the bottom line declined 7.5% year over year primarily due to lower revenues and restaurant operating margins.Revenues of $357.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360 million by 0.6%. Moreover, the top line fell 3% on a year-over-year basis on the back of lower company restaurant sales and franchise rental income, somewhat offset by higher franchises royalties and other revenues.Behind the Headline NumbersComparable-store sales (comps) at Jack in the Box company stores declined 1.6%, comparing unfavourably with the prior-year quarter fall of 0.2% but better than last quarter’s decline of 2.4%. Notably, a 4.4% decrease in transactions was partially offset by average check growth of 2.8%.Same store sales at franchised stores inched up 0.1%, comparing unfavorably with the gain of 1.5% in the year-ago quarter but better than 0.4% decline in the previous quarter. System same-store sales decreased 0.2% against rise of 1.1% in the comparable period last year, and prior-quarter comps decline of 0.8%.Comps at company-owned Qdoba restaurants were down 1.1%, reflecting 2.8% decrease in transactions, partially offset by growth in average check and catering sales. This decline compared favorably with prior-quarter decrease of 5.9% but unfavourably with the prior-year quarter rise of 1%.On the contrary, comps at franchised restaurants saw 2.3% increase during the quarter, which was better than the decline of 0.3% in the prior-quarter, and the year-ago comps growth of 0.1%.

Operating margin contracted 320 bps for the Jack in the Box company restaurants due to elevated labor costs, higher repairs and maintenance costs, an increase in food and packaging costs and sales deleverage, somewhat offset by the benefit of refranchising activities in 2017.Also, at the Qdoba restaurants operating margin contracted 420 bps. The reduction was due to costs associated with new restaurant openings, an increase in food and packaging costs, impact of wage inflation and sales deleverage, partially offset by lower workers’ compensation costs.SG&A expenses for the fiscal third quarter, as a percentage of revenues, were 10.7%. The reported figure was down 90 bps from the prior-year quarter. This reflects the impact of the company's restructuring activities, a decline in pension and postretirement benefits, reduced insurance costs as well as lower incentive compensation.Jack In The Box Inc.

2853,MCD,"Fast food giant Dunkin' Donuts, belonging to Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), had announced a partnership with Amtrak Corporation in the first quarter of 2017. Per the agreement, Dunkin’ Donuts’ hot coffee was offered to 3.4 million annual customers on Amtrak’s high-speed train – Acela Express.The partnership has now been expanded to offer Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend and Dunkin' Decaf hot coffee on Amtrak Northeast Regional trains as well. This will make Dunkin’ Donuts' signature beverage line available to a combined 12 million customers travelling on the trains each year. Dunkin’ Brands enjoys significant customer trust and brand loyalty which makes it easier for Dunkin’ Donuts to launch various innovative product lines.Notably, growing sales of the company’s Cold Brew coffee has opened up substantial opportunity for Dunkin' Brands in the beverage space. In fact, owing to its relentless focus on strengthening its beverage portfolio, the company launched ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee in February 2017 which was manufactured, distributed, marketed and sold by The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) nationwide.In addition to these sales initiatives, Dunkin' Brands is trying to drive revenues through a focused expansion strategy, both domestically and internationally.However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been suffering over the last few years at both the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Further, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from food and beverage companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) might impede revenue growth for the company.Meanwhile, Dunkin' Brands’ shares have underperformed its industry year-to-date. While the stock has gained 1.1%, the industry witnessed a rally of 7.9%.Nonetheless, the company is expected to sustain its momentum on a solid product pipeline and diligent expansion efforts.Dunkin' Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2854,MCD,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.McDonald's Tops Q3 Earnings on Solid Comps GrowthMcDonald's posted mixed results in the third quarter of 2017, wherein though the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line lagged the same.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.76 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 by 0.6% and improved 9% from the year-ago quarter. The upside reflects stronger operating performance and G&A savings. Notably, adjusted earnings exclude the impact of current-year non-recurring gains and these unrelated strategic charges.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 2 cents per share on earnings in the quarter. At constant currency, earnings grew 7% year over year.Revenues of $5.75 billion declined 10% year over year, mainly due to the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative. At constant currency, the figure declined 12%. Moreover, the same lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.80 billion by nearly 1%.Behind the Headlines NumbersIn the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 23% to $3.06 billion. However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants increased 10% to $2.69 billion.Global comps grew 6%, supported by positive guest counts across all the segments. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Meanwhile, comps growth was slightly lower than the last quarter’s increase of 6.6%.Segment DetailsEffective Jul 1, 2015, McDonald's began reporting results under four segments: U.S. (the company's largest segment), International Lead Markets (mature markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K.), High-Growth Markets (markets that have high restaurant expansion and franchising potential such as China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands) and Foundational Markets (the remaining markets in McDonald's system).U.S.: Comps grew 4.1% in the third quarter owing to the positive impact of the national beverage and McPick 2 value promotions and the continued success of the Signature Crafted premium sandwich platform. Markedly, this segment continues to build momentum as it executes strategic menu, value and convenience initiatives to attract customers. In fact, comps growth was better than the prior quarter rise of 3.9%.Segment operating income also increased 6% on the back of higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars and G&A savings.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 5.7%, lower than the 6.3% rise witnessed in the last quarter. Continued momentum in the U.K. and Canada along with upbeat results across all other markets drove comps.Operating income was up 21%, including the impact of foreign currency translation. At constant currency, the figure was up 17%, primarily on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars.High-Growth Markets: Comps grew 6.2%, slightly lower than the prior-quarter’s 7% increase, led by strong performance in China as well as positive results across majority of the segment.Markedly, the segment's operating income for the quarter included a gain of roughly $850 million associated to the refranchising of China and Hong Kong, partially offset by unrelated non-cash impairment charges. Excluding these items, the segment's operating income rose 7% (3% in constant currencies), reflecting higher sales-driven margin dollars.Foundational Markets: Comps in Foundational Markets grew 10.2% on the back of positive sales performance across all geographic regions. However, the figure came in lower than the 13% growth recorded in the last quarter.Meanwhile, operating income declined due to the company's refranchising initiatives and elevated restaurant technology spending, somewhat offset by the benefit from 7 prior year's strategic charges comparison.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter.McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus  McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus | McDonald's Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, McDonald's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our style scores.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock. The magnitude of these revisions also looks promising. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

2855,MCD,"Markets notched up record highs following release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes on Wednesday. The minutes clearly indicated a rate hike in December. Moreover, the minutes stated that a majority of the Fed officials voted in favor of the rate hike. Meanwhile, the Dow posted an all-time record close, supported by a rally in shares of Johnson and Johnson and McDonald’s.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,872.89, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.2% to close at 2,555.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,603.55, increasing 0.3%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,439 to 1,213. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by 1,414 to 1,228. The CBOE VIX decreased 0.9% to close at 9.99.Benchmarks Finished at Record HighsThe Dow gathered 42.21 points on Wednesday to notch up an all-time record close. Such gains were buoyed by a rally in shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), which gained 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. The blue-chip index has advanced 16% so far this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 amassed almost 5 points to hit a record close.

The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) advanced 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.Fed Minutes Confirm Rate Hike in DecemberMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), released Wednesday confirmed a rate hike in December, the third instance in 2017. Though, the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates, majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates. The ones debating against increasing rates reasoned that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2% — an indication of a healthy economy — might cause major setbacks to the U.S. economy.Such persistent disagreements among the Fed officials make it difficult for the investors to understand how the future of rate hikes would unfold. Meanwhile, a majority of the policymakers opined that the impact which hurricanes Harvey and Irma had on the U.S. economy would likely fade in a short time. Further, they also commented that inflation would soon hit the target rate of 2%.After the meeting ended, the Fed chose to leave the interest rates unchanged in the range of 1% - 1.25% and decided to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The much anticipated unwinding of the humungous balance sheet of the Fed was announced at the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee last month. The Fed is slated to begin the gradual unwinding process this month and plans to trim assets by $10 billion each month.However, the Fed panel announced one rate hike before 2017 ends and three further hikes in 2018. Experts therefore speculate that this would come in December when Fed meets for the final time before the year ends. Moreover, in a recent speech at Cleveland, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen cautioned against raising interest rates gradually. She reasoned that this might lead to overheating of the economy and also financial instability. Such claims by Yellen were seconded by Kansas City Fed President Esther George who said that waiting for the inflation rates to hit the 2% level could rather turn out to be a ‘mistake.’Stocks That Made HeadlinesAllegiant Raises Q3 Guidance Despite September Traffic FallAllegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) has reported traffic numbers for September.

2856,MCD,"Shares of quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains operator, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report), have declined 32.8% over the past six months compared with 8% growth of the industry it belongs to.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions of late, reflecting analysts’ pessimism on its growth prospects.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chipotle’s current-quarter earnings has slumped 8.7%, reflecting 12 downward revisions versus none upward. Also, its current-year earnings estimates have moved down 5%, due to nine downward revisions versus three upward revisions.This apart, Chipotle has a number of other aspects that make it an unattractive investment option at this point.Food-Safety IssuesThroughout 2016 Chipotle’s results continued to be affected by the negative publicity related to the food-borne illnesses, which surfaced toward 2015-end.Moreover, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Evidence of rodents was also found at a Dallas outlet that further added to the woes.Industry HeadwindsThe U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing for the last few quarters. Notably, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thus continuing the somber mood. Chipotle is no exception to the trend, and resultantly the company’s sales have also come under pressure.Rising Costs Putting Pressure on MarginsChipotle intends to continue using a mix of marketing programs designed to drive traffic and build loyalty with its customers. In fact, the company expects marketing and promo costs to account for nearly 3.1% of sales in the second half of 2017.Also, implementation of food safety practices has increased the amount of labor required to prepare and serve food, resulting in higher labor costs that may continue to keep profits under pressure. Alongside, rising avocado prices pose a threat to the restaurant chain's profitability as well.In fact, Chipotle has recorded trailing 12-month net margin of just 3.2% compared with the industry average of 15.1%. Given the continual rise in expenses, the trend is not expected to reverse for the company any time soon.Valuation Looks IrrationalChipotle seems overvalued when compared with the broader industry. Its current price-earnings (F1) and price-sales (P/S) ratios are higher than the respective industry averagesBottom LineDespite a solid start in 2017, a fresh round of food-safety fright has once again gripped the company in dilemma. Consequently, alarming questions have been raised over Chipotle’s turnaround in the near term.Notwithstanding various sales-building and strategic initiatives undertaken by the company, we particularly believe that a stretched valuation, negative estimates revision and renewed food-safety concerns limit the upside potential for the stock.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the same sector include McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report), Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR  -  Free Report) and Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2857,MCD,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies offering high dividends.JPMorgan U.S. Dividend ETF JDIV tracks the JP Morgan US Dividend Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility and yield. It has AUM of $25.2 million and seeks to provide exposure to higher-yielding equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to dividend-focused funds.CompetitionThe fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space.

2859,MCD,"Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) were up over 2% in afterhours trading on Aug 8, after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionRed Robin’s adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by 19.6%. However, the bottom line declined 18.7% year over year, due to lower margins.Revenues of $315.8 million came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $315 million by 0.3% and increased 3.3% year over year. This improvement was driven by higher restaurant revenues, somewhat offset by lower franchise royalties, fees and other revenues.Behind the Headline NumbersDuring the quarter, Red Robin’s restaurant revenues rose 3.4% year over year to nearly $312.4 million. The uptick was owing to new restaurant openings and higher comps, somewhat offset by loss of revenues from closed restaurants. Franchise royalties and fee revenues of $3.4 million were almost flat year over year.Company-owned restaurants comps inched up 0.5% year over year against the prior-quarter comps decline of 1.2%. The increase was led by a 1% rise in guest counts, partially offset by a 0.5% decline in average guest check. Notably, the decrease in average guest check comprised a 2.2% drop in menu mix, somewhat offset by a 1.7% increase in pricing.Despite lower occupancy costs, restaurant-level operating profit margin decreased 100 basis points (bps) to 19.9%, due to higher cost of sales, elevated labor costs and increase in other restaurant operating expenses.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased 3.6% to $32.3 million from $33.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at $2.89.Red Robin continues to expect total revenue growth in 2017 between 6% and 8%. This includes comparable restaurant revenue growth in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Additionally, the growth is expected to be driven by increased operating weeks associated with locations opened in 2016 and 2017, as well as the 53rd week in 2017.Cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, is projected to be in the range of down 25 bps to up 25 bps in 2017 compared with 2016, given the impact of higher beef and potato prices in the second half of the year.Restaurant labor costs, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, are expected to be flat to up 50 bps year over year, due to minimum wage increases in more highly penetrated markets, elevated benefit costs and restaurant manager bonuses, to some extent offset by the effect of pricing and improvements in labor productivity.Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 is likely to be in between $145 million and $155 million.Capital expenditures are expected to be roughly between $85 million and $95 million.Meanwhile, the company plans to open roughly 17 and close nine Red Robin locations in 2017.Currently, Red Robin has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Peer ReleasesMcDonald's Corp.

2861,MCD,"Troubles broiling in the U.S. restaurant industry over the past few quarters are known to all by now. Nevertheless, a gradually improving U.S. economy has reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment which is likely to encourage consumers to dine out more and thereby put a check on declining traffic.Thus, totally shying away from this space is not wise. In fact, there are a number of companies with a decent performance history and strong fundamentals that seem unperturbed, thereby signaling a profitable investment opportunity.One such company is McDonald’s Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) that continues to reflect strength in several areas and should make a value addition to your portfolio.Notably, shares of this burger giant have gained 31.9% year to date compared with 8.5% growth of the industry it belongs to.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.3%, reflecting eight upward revisions versus one downward, over the last 60 days. All these positive earnings estimate revision testifies to the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and substantiate the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Else Makes McDonald’s a Solid Pick?Earnings Growth & Surprise History: Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company in question. For the year, the company’s projected EPS growth is 14.3% compared with the industry average of 7.3%.Moreover, McDonald’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently over the last 12 consecutive quarters, with an average positive surprise of 7.44% in the trailing four quarters.Strong Brand Recognition: McDonald’s is the world’s largest fast-food chain, operating over 37,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. Its offerings have reached the billion-dollar brand status through sustained product innovation and geographic expansion. With an almost 10% share of the global informal-eating-out market, there is ample scope for it to grow in the future as it boasts a scale advantage compared to its peers.Efforts to Boost Sales: Increasing guest count remains the company’s top priority and it intends to regain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value.On the digital front, McDonald’s is set to launch the option in nearly all 14,000 U.S. restaurants and 6,000 others in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia and China by the end of this year, to better serve customers. Meanwhile, to provide augmented convenience, McDonald’s is increasingly focusing on expanding its delivery service. Also, it is accelerating Experience of the Future (EOTF) deployment in the United States which represents one of the greatest opportunities to build on business momentum, besides driving guest count.Notably, global comps at McDonald’s have been positive over the last eight consecutive quarters. Such moves are further expected to aid comps and maintain the momentum, going forward.Low Beta Stock: A stock with beta less than 1 suggests that its price movement is not highly correlated with the market. Since they are less volatile than the market, they are safer bets at the moment. McDonald’s has an impressive beta of 0.69. Therefore adding it to your portfolio will bring down overall beta, thereby reducing its risk.Our TakeDespite stiff competition from the likes of The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report), Restaurant Brands International Inc.’s (QSR  -  Free Report) Burger King and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report), various sales and digital initiatives undertaken by the company are likely to aid it in transforming itself to a contemporary burger company.This, in turn, should help McDonald’s in retaining and even escalating its market share and strengthening its competitive position.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2862,MCD,"We expect Fastenal Company (FAST  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 11, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%. Moreover, Fastenal surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, the average being 1.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at +0.60%. A positive Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise  Fastenal Company Price and EPS Surprise | Fastenal Company QuoteZacks Rank: Fastenal currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Fastenal’s Zacks Rank #3 and +0.60% ESP makes us reasonably confident about an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Increased installation of industrial vending machines is expected to boost sales and profits in the to-be-reported quarter as it is one of the primary growth drivers for Fastenal. Moreover, a continual increase in the number of on-site locations is likely to expand Fastenal’s market share and contribute to the quarterly numbers.We are also encouraged by Fastenal’s acquisition of certain assets of industrial and fastener supply distributor — Manufacturer's Supply Company (Mansco) — in March 2017. This ensures Fastenal’s presence in markets where it has not meaningfully contributed in the past. Mansco contributed 3.6% to fastener daily sales growth of 7.9% in the last reported quarter and is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, we are apprehensive about Fastenal’s changes in product and customer mix that have been hurting the gross margin for quite some time now. Also, sales in the quarter could be adversely affected owing to the impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 50 cents, reflecting a 13.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.13 billion, implying 11.1% growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Retail-Wholesale sector that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Comps compared favorably with prior-quarter comps decline of 2.5%, and unfavorably with the prior-year quarter rise of 4.3%.Notably, unfavorable weather conditions in the Northeast region that makes up a high percentage of the company’s sales have hurt comps.Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 50 basis points (bps) to 87.1% mainly on a 180 bps increase in labor costs, 30 bps rise in other operating expenses and 70 bps increase in depreciation expenses.However, these were somewhat offset by a decline of 70 bps and 100 bps in general and administrative expenses (G&A) and pre-opening costs, respectively.As a percentage of Shack sales, Shack-level operating profit margins decreased 200 bps to 28.8% primarily due to increased labor and related expenses.Adjusted EBITDA (earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) surged 36.4% to $19.4 million. However, as a percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins decreased roughly 20 bps to 21.2% from 21.4% in the year-ago quarter.2017 OutlookThe company continues to expect revenues in the range of $351 million to $355 million.Meanwhile, it projects Same-Shack sales to decrease between 2% and 3%, down from the previous expectation of comps being flat year over year. Notably, this includes roughly 1.5% to 2% of menu price increases taken at the end of Dec 2016.Shack-level operating profit margin is still guided between 26.5% and 27.5%, while general and administrative expenses are anticipated between $38 million and $40 million.The company continues to expect opening of 23 to 24 new domestic company-operated Shacks in 2017. Currently, it expects 15 net new licensed Shacks, up from 12 announced earlier.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesShake Shack currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2864,MCD,"A soft industry backdrop has been hampering the performance of most restaurant chains and BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) is no exception.In fact, the company, the company continues to believe that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives. Consequently, though BJ’s Restaurants’ has slowed down on its unit growth plan for 2017 and 2018, it has not completely refrained from it.Recently, the company announced the opening of its latest restaurant in Bowie, MD, on Nov 20. This 7,500 square feet restaurant is located on a free standing pad in front of Bowie Town Center and can accommodate nearly 230 guests.The outlet features BJ’s Restaurants’ extensive menu including its signature deep-dish pizza, award-winning hand-crafted beer and the famous Pizookie dessert. In addition, BJ’s unique contemporary décor creates an ideal environment for dining.In fact, this new outlet marks the brand’s fifth restaurant in the state of Maryland. Currently, the company operates 196 casual dining restaurants across 25 states in the United States, under its brand names — BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse, BJ’s Restaurant & Brewery, BJ’s Pizza & Grill and BJ’s Grill.The company has opened nine new restaurants year to date and is slated to open one more outlet this year, in line with its plans. The next opening in Taylor, MI, in mid-December, will mark the brand’s entry in the state. Also, it plans to open just four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018.Thus, the slowdown in company’s development plan may somewhat dent sales growth. Also, continued weakening consumer spending in the restaurant space, might hamper the company’s traffic and sales.Furthermore, we note that while several other restaurant chains including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are capitalizing on the emerging market potential, BJ’s Restaurants loses out in terms of international presence.Additionally, BJ’s Restaurants shares have declined 26.2% over the last six months, as against the industry’s growth of 0.6%.Nevertheless, the four strategic sales-building initiatives undertaken by the company are expected to boost the top line. Also, a deep pipeline of new menu items, loyalty program enhancements and other productivity and digital initiatives are likely to improve performance.Additionally, BJ’s Restaurants’ decision to slow down new openings for some time and instead focus even more of its enterprise resources on building sales might turn out to be favorable as it would provide some margin momentum and boost free cash flow. When combined with the company’s conservative balance sheet, these measures are likely to provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases, going forward.BJ’s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2865,MCD,"Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report)  is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 financial numbers on Sep 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.61%. In fact, Darden’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.54%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Darden Restaurants, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPositive comps growth and costs-saving initiatives are driving Darden’s bottom line and are expected to boost the fiscal first-quarter results as well. Notably, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last 11 consecutive quarters.Meanwhile, management has been focusing on improving core operating fundamentals with initiatives like simplifying kitchen systems, better in-restaurant execution to enhance guest experience, menu innovation, remodeling along with various technology-driven moves. In fact, most of Darden’s brands have been witnessing growth over the past few quarters backed by these initiatives. Thus, we expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, increased labor costs and a non-franchised business model may dent the company’s profits, while a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might restrict revenue growth.Notably, Darden completed its acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen on Apr 24. Now, it remains to be seen how the acquisition would impact the company’s performance in the fiscal first quarter as this would be the first full-quarterly result that includes Cheddar’s operations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Darden this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Darden has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 98 cents.

Fed also stated that this rate would be increased further by another $10 billion every three months to gradually reach a maximum of $50 billion a month.Such assets consist primarily of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, which the Fed accumulated in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis under its quantitative easing program. This was done in a bid to keep the mortgage rates low and provide liquidity to the economy.Fed Indicates a Possible Rate Hike in DecemberThe Fed kept the interest- rates unchanged as expected.

The Fed stated that it anticipates the interest rate to hover around 2.7% by the end of 2019, lower than the initial forecast of 2.9%.The Fed’s interest rate projections, known as the dot-plot, indicated that there might be one rate hike in December, three more in 2018 and two further rate hikes in 2019. The CME FedWatch now estimated the possibility of a rate hike in December to 70%.Such hawkish statements from the Fed led to a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield by 2.3%.

2867,MCD,"In order to capitalize on rising demand for their products, quite a few restaurant operators are focusing on growing their off-premise, online-ordering business via delivery, carry-out, and catering.Particularly, restaurant operators are concentrating on the delivery channel, which is a growing area for the industry, driven by ease of access. By driving incremental sales at the companies, delivery services might turn out to be a strong revenue growth driver in the long term, given huge demand for the same.Meanwhile, many restaurants are seeing an increase in their take-out business as customers are more willing to relax at home while enjoying their meal. Notably, both take-out and delivery increase a restaurant’s business without significantly raising its operational expenses or demanding an expansion of facility.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers & Brew, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is one such company that is moving smartly on new revenue streams. Going forward, the company expects the off-premise orders to become a growth engine in the latter half of the year as it begins to actively promote the new offerings, reach out to more guests, thus driving improved profitability.In sync with this, the company plans to expand its service to 198 locations from 118, with its current three third-party service providers like Amazon, DoorDash and GrubHub. By fourth-quarter 2017, Red Robin expects to put all corporate restaurants on the call center and have designated in-store pickup areas. In addition, the company anticipates roughly two-thirds of its units to have curbside delivery.Red Robin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) is also planning to provide augmented convenience to customers through increased focus on delivery. In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 company’s delivery service has now expanded to almost 8,000 restaurants across 47 countries. In this regard, McDonald's is also experimenting with different delivery models including partnering with third-party operators, like UberEATS.Another restaurant operator, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), has deployed an off-premise strategy at all three of its iconic brands. Evidently, Pizza Hut has developed a delivery network algorithm (DNA), which is a multi-faceted technology system that improves the accuracy and reliability of deliveries.YUM! Brands’ KFC division is also aggressively pursuing its global delivery initiative as a strategic growth opportunity. Currently, the division offers delivery out of over 6,000 restaurants and given the fact that it is the fastest growing channel in the business, the brand anticipates expanding its services around the world.The Taco Bell division follows the same strategy as well. In fact, nearly 20,000 restaurants across the entire Yum! Brands system offer delivery, which is almost 50% of the company’s total restaurants. YUM! Brands carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Taking things one step further, BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) has launched a pilot alcohol delivery program in partnership with DoorDash. Markedly, this initiative is in addition to the door-to-door delivery service that was launched earlier as an effort to boost off-premise sales.Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) Olive Garden division and Brinker International, Inc.’s (EAT  -  Free Report) Chili’s segment are concentrating on their To-Go business. While Olive Garden’s To-Go business increased 16% year over year in the last reported quarter, Chili’s has partnered with Olo – a mobile and online food ordering service – for its To-Go platform. Chili’s has also launched a digital curbside platform to ensure simpler, faster, effortless experience to take-out guests, which should ultimately translate to higher check. Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3.Further, Darden and Jack in the Box, Inc.’s (JACK  -  Free Report) Qdoba division have launched catering in the United States. In fact, catering remains a significant opportunity at Qdoba and the company plans to continue with this, which exceeded 11% of its sales in the fiscal third quarter. Moreover, the brand has prepared a new catering menu in a bid to expand this segment.Also, the company’s Jack in the Box segment has expanded its partnership with DoorDash, which is now delivering from roughly 37% of this division.Bottom LineIn addition to the ones mentioned above, there are many other restaurant operators like Starbucks, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cheesecake Factory, Dunkin’ Brands and Wendy’s that have indulged in growing their off-premise sales.Notably, the restaurant industry’s sales trends in recent quarters have been strained, given the soft consumer spending environment. Nevertheless, off-premise channels could be the tide that lifts all boats in the industry, moving it higher from its current position at the bottom 15% among more than 250 Zacks industries.On an average, off-premise sales represent about 10-11% of the industry’s total sales. Therefore, there lies a tremendous opportunity to grow the segment and earn good returns from it.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2868,MCD,"A soft industry backdrop has been hampering the performance of most restaurant chains and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is no exception.In fact, the decline in sales volume has begun to impact the returns on the company’s new restaurant openings due to the challenging operating environment. Consequently, Red Robin has slowed down on its unit growth plan for 2017 and 2018. However, it has not completely refrained from it.Recently, the company announced its plan to open a Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brew restaurant in Clarksville, IN, on Nov 27.The latest outlet will include its signature items like Royal Red Robin Burger, Bottomless Steak Fries, Smoke & Pepper Burger, and Red's Tavern Double on the menu along with Freckled Lemonade. Additionally, it will serve Black & Bleu Burger, The Marco Pollo, the Southern Charm Burger along with a variety of salads, entrees, soups and wraps.Currently, there are 570 Red Robin restaurants across the United States and Canada.Yet, the company loses out in terms of international presence. While several other restaurant chains including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Red Robin seems to be weak on this front.Additionally, higher labor, remodeling, restaurant maintenance and pre-opening costs may continue to hurt margins. Also, Red Robin is investing heavily in several sales building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades, which will result in elevated costs.In fact, the company’s shares have declined 12.2% year to date, as against the industry’s growth of 10.4%. Given an uncertain sales environment along with rising costs, we find the stock’s upside potential to be limited.  Nevertheless, Red Robin’s efforts to improve sales and regain market share via efficient menu innovation, operational improvement, effective marketing strategy and remodeling programs are encouraging.Particularly, its focus on value offerings along with a growing off-premise, online ordering business is expected to ensure that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company remains affordable for dine-in and carry-out guests alike.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

However, the figure declined 37.8% from the prior-year quarter earnings of $1.46 due to decrease in gross profits.Total revenues of $144.7 million fell 7.3% year over year due to lower franchise and restaurant, rental as well as financing revenues. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $146.5 million by over 1%.DineEquity currently operates under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands. It is focused on developing a strong performance-based culture, driving sustainable positive sales at both brands thereby bringing its growth story back on track.

This compares unfavorably with the fiscal second quarter’s comps decrease of 2.6% and the prior-year quarter’s comps decline of 0.1%. Despite witnessing soft sales in the last few quarters, the company believes that the IHOP brand remains on solid ground.Moreover, initiatives to improve guest satisfaction via remodelling efforts, growing its off-premise business that include online ordering and delivery, and development of an IHOP mobile application are expected to create improved revenue channels.Applebee's domestic system-wide comps were down 7.7% comparing unfavorably with the last quarter’s comps decline of 6.2% and the prior-year quarter’s fall of 5.2%. Notably, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick-service restaurants. Furthermore, consumers are favoring ordering in meals over going to brick-and-mortar retailers.Nonetheless, DineEquity believes that fiscal 2017 will be a transitional year for Applebee's. In fact, the steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, marketing efforts, simplification of restaurant operations and elevating the guest experience are expected to drive comps over the long term with an improvement likely 2018 onwards.Fiscal 2017 OutlookFor fiscal 2017, Applebee's domestic system-wide comps are now expected to decrease in the range of 5.5-6.5% (a decline of 6% to 8%, expected earlier).IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are still expected to be down in the band of 1% to 3%.Meanwhile, DineEquity continues to expect general and administrative expenses to range between $166 million and $172 million.Applebee's franchisees are still anticipated to develop between 20 and 30 new restaurants globally, the majority of which are likely to be international openings.

The bottom line also declined 18.2% year over year on the back of lower revenues.Total revenues of $308 million slightly lagged the consensus mark of $308.6 million and decreased 15.4% year over year. The decline reflects a reduction in the number of company-operated restaurants as a result of its system optimization initiative. It owned 249 fewer company-operated restaurants in the third quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. The decline was partly offset by higher franchise royalty revenue and fees and franchise rental income.Comps at North America system restaurants were up 2%, lower than an increase of 3.2% in the previous quarter but higher than a 1.4% growth in third-quarter 2016.Wendy's Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wendy's Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wendy's Company (The) QuoteProfit DiscussionNorth America company-operated restaurant margin decreased 170 basis points (bps) to 16.7% primarily due to higher commodity costs.General and administrative (G&A) expenses declined 10.1% year over year owing to cost savings related to the company's system optimization initiative as well as lower professional fees.Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.3% year over year primarily due to lower franchise fees (as a result of system optimization and Buy and Flip transactions) as well as a year-over-year decline in company-operated restaurant margin, partially offset by G&A savings.Nevertheless, adjusted EBITDA margin improved 400 bps to 31.5% on the back of positive impact of Wendy's system optimization initiative.Image ActivationImage Activation remains an integral part of the company’s global growth strategy, and includes reimaging existing restaurants and building new restaurants.At the end of the third quarter, approximately 39% of the global system featured the brand’s new image. Meanwhile, Wendy’s and its franchisees continue to expect roughly 42% of the global system, image activated, by the end of 2017.Additionally, the company stated that it expects net new unit growth in 2017 to be in the 0.5-1% range in North America compared with a 1% growth, projected earlier.

2871,MCD,"In this week’s video I discuss both Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -  Free Report) and McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report).   When I am looking to recommend any growth and income stock I first identify companies that have a high Zacks Rank, a solid dividend and good long-term growth expectations.  And both ITW and MCD meet all of these criteria and more.  About the companyIllinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy) manufactures and markets a variety of products that are used worldwide.  The company’s products are found in cars, wind turbines, deep-sea rigs, healthcare, aerospace technology, food equipment, mobile devices, and many other items that you use on a daily basis.  ITW is a well-diversified company who has been a world leader in innovation for decades.  The company generates just over 50% of their revenues in the United States, and has operations around the world. Drivers behind the purchaseIllinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) who currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) announced earnings on Monday where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  Moreover, management increased their FY 2017 EPS outlook by $0.25 (+16% year over year growth), and raised their 2017 revenue guidance by $100 million to $14.3 billion (+5.2% year over year growth).  Overall, the company saw increasing revenues, improving margins, organic growth, and EPS expansion during their most recent quarterly report.   Further, the overall outlook for global growth is improving faster than previously expected.  This was reinforced when International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) increased growth expectations for both 2017 and 2018 (2017 was lifted by 0.1% to +3.6%, and 2018 was revised by +0.1% to +3.7%).  This improved global economic outlook is very beneficial to ITW as it sells industrial products and equipment in 57 different countries.Earnings History and Improving EstimatesThe company has beaten the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates in 7 out of the last 8 quarters.   Further, due to the strong quarterly performance and increased EPS guidance, analysts have positively revised their estimates for both 2017 and 2018. Price and Earnings Consensus ChartThis is a great example of the kind of chart I want to see when adding a position to the service.  Solid price appreciation, and consistent growth in year over year earnings estimates.Illinois Tool Works Inc. Price and Consensus Illinois Tool Works Inc. Price and Consensus | Illinois Tool Works Inc. QuoteThis is a stable, high quality company that has consistently beaten both earnings and revenue estimates that pays a nice +2.01% dividend yield.  Further, ITW is considered a dividend aristocrat (a company that has increased their annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years), so we should expect to see a bump in the dividend over the next 12 months as well. McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and over the past several quarters their international reach has been a strong tailwind for the company which has driven sales above expectations in four of the last five quarters.  The new meal options and innovation have been a large part of their sustained success, and people across the globe are visiting the famous chain more and more.  This was reflected in their recent same store sales (SSS) data, High-Growth Markets (China) +6.2%, Foundation Markets (Japan) +10.2%,  International Lead Markets (Europe, Canada) +5.7% and even at home as SSS were up +4.1%. Another attractive part of the McDonald’s story is managements Velocity Growth Plan, which is focused on “long-term profitable growth.”  Part of this strategy was to refranchise over 4,000 restaurants in China and Hong Kong, and management accomplished this goal in Q3, a year ahead of schedule.  Also, part of the growth plan is the adaptation of both mobile ordering and paying along with delivery.  While the investments in these new technologies will be a slight headwind in the near term, these new innovations are expected to benefit sales in the long term.  And as we are looking to hold this company for at least a year, this is an overall positive for the portfolio. Because of the positive earnings report, impressive same store sales, and management’s long term growth plans, analysts have raised both 2017 and 2018 EPS guidance once again.  This is reflected in the Price and Earnings Consensus graph below.  And as I mentioned before, I really like carts that show solid price appreciation along with year over year EPS guidance increases.McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus | McDonald's Corporation QuoteMcDonalds also has a solid annual dividend of $4.04 with a yield of +2.47%, and is a dividend aristocrat (has increased their dividend payments each year for the past 25 years or more).  So we are adding a company that has solid growth prospects with an increasing dividend.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2873,MCD,"Dow achieved the historical milestone of 22,000 for the first time on Wednesday. This stellar showing was a result of surge in the shares of Apple after the tech behemoth posted outstanding earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Broadly encouraging economic conditions also drove the Dow past the psychological milestone. The S&P 500 also finished in the green, however, the Nasdaq’s lackluster performance continued as it was dragged down to close in the red due to familiar tech overvaluation issues.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) breached all the records to finish above the 22,000 threshold for the first time on Wednesday and notched its seventh straight daily rise. The blue-chip index closed at 22,016.24, an all-time high, rising by 0.2% or 52.32 points in the process. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1%, rising 1.22 points to close at 2,477.57. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,362.65, declining 0.29 point. A total of around 6.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.1 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,871 to 866. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 2,114 to 601.Dow Hits 22,000, Buoyed By Apple’s Earnings Outperformance Dow breaches yet another record in 2017. The blue-chip index, for the first time, achieved the psychological milestone of 22,000. This historic benchmark was achieved within 107 trading days of Dow hitting 21,000.This stellar showing was made possible by Apple Inc.’s upbeat earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) reported spectacular results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, driven by the impressive Service segment performance. iPhone sales were also steady in the quarter. Earnings of $1.67 per share and revenues of $45.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and $44.7 billion, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 17.6% and revenues increased 7.2%. (Read More: Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates, Stock Up)Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) has also contributed to the Dow’s upward journey. Boeing reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 and increasing from last year’s loss of $0.44 per share. Furthermore, the escalating geopolitical risks involving Syria and North Korea has led to an increased demand for defense products. (Read More: Boeing Stock Flies to All-Time High After Q2 Earnings). The other companies which have added to the Dow’s performance Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report).Other Factors that Drove the Dow HigherSome other factors which have contributed to the Dow’s historic feat are broadly encouraging economic conditions, Fed’s hesitance to increase the interest rates any further and weakening dollar in the international markets.The private sector added 178,000 jobs in July although this was lower than the economists’ expectation of 185,000 jobs. But this would certainly lower the unemployment rate which hovered around 4.3% in the month of May, according to The Bureau of Labor Statistics. The recent addition of 178,000 jobs would go a long way in lowering the unemployment rate. Further, a steady GDP growth has also made the economy favorable for more investment and spending.The Fed increased interest rates three times since December. However, at the end of its two day policy meet, the Fed refrained from increasing the interest rates any further. This raises question on the ability of the Trump administration to deliver on the campaign trail promises and the investor sentiment was hurt leading to losses in the broader markets. On the other hand, this turned out to be a boon for the rate sensitive sectors such as utilities which would benefit from the move. Also, this boded well for the banks in general and boosted the bank shares thereby leading to broad based gains.The Dow consists of 30 large-cap companies which have overseas operations. For the record, the dollar has fallen more than 10% since the start of the year. This makes the US-based goods cheaper in the international market and an increased demand for the same. Also, foreign profits were worth more in dollars. This also resulted in broad based gains for the economy.Stocks That Made HeadlinesARRIS Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates, Revenues LagARRIS International plc’s (ARRS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

2874,MCD,"We expect pizza giant, Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report), to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 12, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Domino's pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 8.20%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.75%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Domino's Pizza Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Domino's Pizza Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Domino's is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Domino’s has an Earnings ESP of +2.12% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.24 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.22. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Domino's currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Domino's favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Notably, the second quarter of 2017 marked the 25th and 94th consecutive quarter of positive same-store-sales domestically and internationally, respectively, for Domino’s. We expect the company’s digital ordering system, focus on re-imaging and other sales initiatives to help sustain the momentum in the third quarter as well.Particularly, the extended ways to order a pizza has kept Domino’s at the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience, and is expected to be biggest driver of comps growth.Meanwhile, the company’s solid brand positioning along with its efforts to accelerate its presence in high-growth international markets is likely to drive top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.However, negative currency translation might dent the quarter’s profits given Domino’s significant international presence. Furthermore, higher costs are likely to hurt margins while a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space may restrict quarterly sales.Other Stocks to ConsiderDomino's is not the only company looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies to consider in the Zacks Restaurant Industry as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2875,MCD,"In recent times, we have witnessed catastrophic hurricanes making landfall on the U.S. soil, missile launches over Japan by North Korea, global terror attacks and cyber breach at credit bureau Equifax and the Securities and Exchange Commission.The Dow Jones, however, continued to scale record highs despite the bad tidings. The blue-chip index extended its winning streak to six straight sessions after President Trump’s closest confidant Rex Tillerson denied that he has considered stepping down. Trump administration, in the meanwhile, is moving ahead with his new tax plan that further helped stock traders breathe a sigh of relief.But, the primary catalyst that is helping the 30-stock index gain ground is bullish economic data. The ISM services index expanded at the fastest clip in 12 years on the heels of a solid ISM manufacturing report. Needless to say, the U.S. economy is growing close to the range expected by Trump and some other Republicans. This has provided a fillip to U.S. corporate profits, while the Federal Reserve’s intention to hike rates exhibited the underlying strength of the economy.Given the positives, investing in blue-chip dividend paying stocks seems tempting at the moment. These stocks provide higher returns at lower risks, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing. Dividend payers, moreover, have remarkable financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. After all, this month is traditionally known to be the most volatile for the broader market. The daily percentage change this month is 1.44%, compared with 1.08% for the other months.Before we cheery pick such stocks, here’s a look at the factors that helped the Dow Jones kick off October on a high note:Best Service Sector Growth in 12 YearsNon-manufacturing activity picked up in the United States to scale a 12-year high in September. Services Purchasing Managers’ Index was boosted by a rise in production and new orders. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the non-manufacturing gauge came in at 59.8% last month, its highest reading since August 2005.The new orders index registered 63%, six points higher than that recorded in the previous month, while the production index, climbed to a five-month high of 61.3%. This encouraging report on service growth showed a steady recovery of the economy from the hurricane-related setback.Factory Activity Hits 13-Year HighA key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13-year high in September, courtesy of two major hurricanes. Increased demand for rebuilding supplies somewhat drove manufacturing activity. New orders, production, new export orders and hiring increased last month.According to the ISM, the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. Notably, 17 of the 18 industries reported growth last month, led by textile mills and machinery. Only furniture manufacturing witnessed a decline (read more: U.S. Manufacturing Activity Hits 13-Year High: Top 5 Winners).Economic Recovery Solid, Corporate Earnings EncourageThe U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter.The resilience of the domestic economy boosted earnings results. Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index were up 11.1% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues. This marked the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Earnings growth is also expected to enter the positive territory in Q3. Total Q3 earnings are poised to be up 3.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues (read more: Handicapping the Q3 Earnings Season).Trump’s Tax Policy ProposalsTrump has urged the Congress to proceed faster with the corporate tax cut and had recently held a bipartisan group of House members at the White House to discuss a tax deal. He has been working on a major tax overhaul in more than three decades. Ever since 1986, the tax code hasn’t been restructured, when President Ronald Reagan along with a divided Congress broadened the tax base and slashed marginal tax rates.Trump proposed a multi-trillion-dollar tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy and drive corporate profits. Such a tax cut included trimming of the business tax rate to 20% from 35%. Low corporate tax will benefit businesses of all sizes, as most of them will see an improvement in the bottom line (read more: 5 Stocks Blistering Higher on Tax Reform).5 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy for Solid GainsThanks to the bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp rally in the Dow.  The companies under the index are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow. They also return record amount of money to shareholders in the form of dividends.We have, thus, selected five blue-chip dividend paying stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2876,MCD,"E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the latest technology corporation to face the regulatory wrath of the European Union.After a three-year investigation, the European Commission has ordered Amazon to pay $300 million, or about €250 million, in back taxes to Luxembourg, saying that the company’s regional headquarters in the country allowed Amazon to avoid paying taxes on much of its European profits between 2006 and 2014.The Commission said that Amazon was benefitting from a tax arrangement with Luxembourg, considered a tax haven, that was illegal. Amazon’s holding company in the country, which is a limited partnership without offices, employees, or any business activity, was not subject to corporate taxes under Luxembourg’s tax laws.“Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon,” said Margrethe Vestager, commissioner for the EU, in a statement. “As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon’s profits were not taxed…Member States cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,” she continued.Amazon initially entered into the tax arrangement with Luxembourg back in 2003, but it isn’t the only company that has done so. Thousands of other companies have based themselves in the small European country, notes Forbes. McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and French utility company Engie are also being investigated for their Luxembourg tax strategies.Amazon’s tax struggles have managed to travel stateside as well. According to Forbes, the company was accused of transferring U.S. funds to its Luxembourg-based shell company in order to bypass paying $234 million in taxes for 2005 and 2006. While Amazon won the case against the IRS regarding this accusation, the IRS is reportedly appealing.Meanwhile, the European Commission said it would take Ireland to court on Wednesday for failing to collect the $14.5 billion, or about €13 billion, in back taxes from iPhone maker Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) by the deadline, which was this past January. Regulators found that Apple was paying a tax rate of just 0.005% compared to Ireland’s usual corporate rate of 12.5%.And earlier this summer, EU regulators slapped Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) with a record $2.7 billion antitrust fine, ruling that the search engine denied “consumers a genuine choice” by utilizing its popular search engine to unfairly guide them to its shopping platform. In other words, Google had been giving illegal priority placement to its own shopping service in search results, while pushing rivals’ search results to areas where buyers were much less likely to click.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2878,MCD,"We expect the leading alcohol company, Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 5.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.2%. In fact, its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.7% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Constellation Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. The current estimate of $2.16 per share for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year growth of nearly 22%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.06 billion, which is 1.9% higher than the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares have surged 30.1%, while the industry grew 19.9%.Factors at PlayConstellation Brands has been on a roll owing to its strong brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and robust quarterly results. The company’s focus on brand building, strength in beer business and efforts to include new products in its wine and spirits portfolio are the key catalysts. Further, it has been gaining from effective integration and growth of recently acquired brands, higher margins, solid overall depletion trends and strong consumer demand.In fact, these factors assisted the company to showcase another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year-over-year and 11th straight positive surprise. Moreover, sales advanced while favorable pricing, volumes and lower cost of goods sold provided a boost to margins.Further, the company continues to gain from the recent buyouts and strength in the beer business, which encouraged management to raise fiscal 2018 earnings view. Management also hiked fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment. The company now envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $7.90-$8.10 per share. Operating income is now expected to grow 13-15% for the beer segment.The company is also on track with its Nava brewery expansion, while it also enhanced its wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars. These factors make us optimistic about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Constellation Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The Most Accurate estimate is $2.17 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.16 per share.

She said that it would rather be ‘imprudent’ to wait till the inflation levels reach 2% and then increase the interest rates gradually as this might lead to labor market becoming overheated. Consequently, such a scenario would lead to inflation problems for the economy and hence financial instability, said Yellen.Interestingly, only four of the 16 highest Fed officials have vouched to wait till 2018 in order to increase the interest rates. The CME FedWatch predicted a 76% probability of a rate hike in December.Yellen also commented that the problem of lower than targeted inflation rates is ‘temporary’ and the inflation rates would normalize and reach the targeted 2% in the course of next few years. She also stated that one must not rely on the predictability of the central bank when it comes to the amount by which rates might be hiked.Economic DataConsumer Confidence for the month of September deceased to 119.8 from 120.4 in the month of August.

2881,MCD,"Fast food giant Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. The company has inked a multi-unit store development agreement with its long-time franchisee Awale Networks, Inc., whereby it plans to build four new restaurants. The first restaurant under this deal is slated to open in 2018.Awale Networks currently owns 12 locations in Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham. The addition of these restaurants will strengthen the position of this long-term franchisee of Dunkin’ Donuts.Notably, Dunkin’ Donuts possesses more than 90 locations in the Greater Raleigh-Durham area and over 300 in North Carolina. This agreement is thus in sync with the company’s plan to drive growth in the region. Meanwhile, in order to fortify its presence, the company is continuously recruiting franchisees in the Greensboro and High Point areas as well.Dunkin' Brands is also looking to expand its footprint in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Also, it considers the untapped market of South Africa a great opportunity. In fact, the company has made a franchise agreement to develop more than 250 Dunkin' Donuts restaurants and over 70 Baskin-Robbins shops in the continent over the next few years.At the end of the third quarter, Dunkin' Brands opened 137 new restaurants worldwide. These include 67 Dunkin' Donuts U.S. locations, 18 Dunkin' Donuts International locations, 11 Baskin-Robbins U.S. locations and 41 Baskin-Robbins International outlets. Additionally, Dunkin' Donuts U.S. franchisees remodeled 88 restaurants, while Baskin-Robbins U.S. franchisees renovated 24 outlets.Notably, Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have outperformed its industry in the last year. While the stock rallied 18.1%, the industry gained 16.2%. However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been weak over the last few years. Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from food & beverages companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) might continue to exert pressure on revenues.Nevertheless, we are positive on the company’s continued expansion strategies along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include product launches, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, the ongoing loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to draw customers and drive earnings as well as revenue growth.Currently, Dunkin’ Brands has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2882,MCD,"On Sep 14, we issued an updated research report on Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report).Notably, Cracker Barrel’s distinctiveness in the retail-restaurant space lies in the fact that apart from serving food, its restaurant establishments have old-country feel along with unique gift shops.This week, the company posted mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line lagged the same.Key Growth DriversIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, Cracker Barrel had launched its new fast casual concept, Holler & Dash Biscuit House, with operating hours limited to breakfast and lunch time. This new concept is expected to add considerably to the top line and boost shareholder value over the long term. Also, the company plans to expand its long-standing brand’s footprint in new and developing markets. In fact, continuous expansion plans of the company reinstate our belief in the brand’s demand across the country.We note that Cracker Barrel relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited time offers to boost its top-line performance because they are appealing to both regular users and less-frequent guests. Going forward, the company aims to continue investing in new product news that will drive business frequency.In fiscal 2018, the company aims to meet consumers' need for convenience via growth in its off-premise business. Moreover, it has also been testing an enhanced everybody value platform at breakfast, lunch and dinner to further engage as a value player in the restaurant space. Coming to menu innovation, Cracker Barrel plans to introduce a new coffee platform this year, which should further boost check averages.On the retail side, the company is likely to increase its emphasis on value to better compete in a very promotional environment, grow its sales gap and achieve its long-term business growth. Thus, in fiscal 2018, along with the affordability of its merchandise offerings, the company will also be working on the quality and exclusivity of its assortments, placing greater emphasis on price value relationship.Meanwhile, in a bid to address the challenges of the competitive restaurant industry, Cracker Barrel is undertaking extensive marketing efforts, mainly focused on the brand’s differentiation, menu offering and its value. In fact, the company expects its extensive advertising and marketing efforts to favor sales mix in the near term.This apart, Cracker Barrel also has an effective cost-cutting mechanism in place and undertakes various measures to keep costs under control. All these efforts coupled with ongoing commodity cost deflation helped it to achieve its target of removing $50 million in annual cost from the business by fiscal 2017-end as outlined in fiscal 2014. These initiatives are expected to aid the company in combating some of the wage inflation pressures as well.  Consequently, Cracker Barrel expects to deliver between $7 million and $8 million in annual cost savings for fiscal 2018.ChallengesCurrently, the company operates 645 Cracker Barrel outlets and five Holler & Dash Biscuit House locations across 44 states in the United States. In fiscal 2018, it expects to open eight or nine new Cracker Barrel stores and three or four new Holler & Dash Biscuit House restaurants.However, Cracker Barrel loses out in terms of international presence. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are following aggressive global expansion policies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak on this front.Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic. Meanwhile, management notes that Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been affected by the challenges faced by the retail industry, as a whole. Thus, given the continued challenges facing the restaurant and retail industry, the company’s top line is likely to remain under pressure.Additionally, higher labor costs along with expenses related to various sales boosting initiatives as well as opening of new units are anticipated to continue hurting margins.Resultantly, Cracker Barrel’s shares have declined 10.7% year to date, as against 6.5% growth of the industry it belongs to.Bottom LineGoing forward, we expect the company’s enhanced focus on convenience, value and menu innovation along with cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue and cost woes.Cracker Barrel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2883,MCD,"Shares of Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) tanked nearly 19% in after-hours trading on Nov 6, after the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and lowered its profit outlook for the year.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionRed Robin’s adjusted earnings of 21 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents by 22.2% and declined 44.7% year over year.Revenues of $304.2 million came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $308.1 million by over 1% but increased 2.3% year over year. This improvement was driven primarily by new restaurant openings.Behind the Headline NumbersCompany-owned restaurants comps decreased 0.1% year over year, as against the prior-quarter comps increase of 0.5%. The downturn was led by a 0.1% decline in average guest check and flat guest counts. Notably, the decrease in average guest check comprised a 1.6% drop in menu mix, partly offset by a 1.5% increase in pricing.Restaurant-level operating profit margin decreased 120 basis points (bps) to 17.4% due to rise in occupancy costs, higher cost of sales, elevated labor costs and increase in other restaurant operating expenses.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased 4.9% to $25.5 million from $26.8 million in the year-ago quarter.Fourth-Quarter ViewFor the fourth quarter, earnings per share are estimated between 45 cents and 60 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents is pegged much higher than the guided range.Guidance for 2017For 2017, Red Robin now anticipates adjusted earnings in the band of $2.16-$2.31 per share. Previously, the company projected the same to fall in the low end of the $2.80-$3.10 per share range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at $2.78.Red Robin projects comparable restaurant revenues to be flat to up 0.5% compared with the rise in the band of 0.5-1.5%, anticipated earlier.Cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant revenues, is projected to be in the range of down 25 bps to up 25 bps in 2017 compared with 2016, owing to the impact of higher beef prices in the second half of the current year.Restaurant labor costs, as a percentage of restaurant revenues, are expected to be up 50 bps year over year.Red Robin has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

2884,MCD,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Apart from the earnings release, Starbucks made other major announcements. First, Starbucks lowered long-term financial targets, cutting the annual earnings growth forecast to 12% versus the prior guidance for 15%-20%. The company expects global same-store sales or comps of 3-5% and high single-digit net revenue growth (versus prior expectation of 10% or greater).Second, the premium coffee giant has entered into an agreement to sell Tazo tea to Unilever for $384 million. The deal includes the Tazo brand, signature recipes, intellectual property and inventory and allows Starbucks to focus its tea strategy on Teavana.Starbucks shares dipped more than 3% following the news release on Nov 2, possibly in response to the lowered long-term targets and weak fourth-quarter results.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 55 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but grew 10% year over year.Total fourth-quarter sales of $5.7 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion by 0.6% and remained unchanged from the year-ago level. The underperformance was due to the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey, which affected the company’s overall top line as well as U.S. comp growth by 1%. This was because more than 1,000 stores had to be temporarily closed due to storm-related reasons.Global same-store sales increased 2%, lower than 4% growth in the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter compared with 4% in the previous quarter. Transactions increased 1%.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 360 basis points (bps) year over year to 17.9% in the quarter due to higher partner investments, primarily in the Americas segment, and the lapping of the 53rd week in the year ago quarter. Again, product mix shift, largely towards food, a higher donation to The Starbucks Foundation, and restructuring and impairments cost added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 90 bps to 20%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were down 0.5% year over year to $3.9 billion.Comps rise of 3% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 5% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 1% increase in average ticket.The company's core espresso, tea and refreshment beverages contributed 2% to comps growth in the U.S. Food sales contributed 2%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the U.S. are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase of from 25% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 390 bps to 24% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by hurricanes, higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 2.5% to $859.9 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 2%, higher than 1% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth delivering 8% in the quarter, its strongest in nine quarters. Japan’s comp growth improved sequentially. Store and market profitability in Japan were robust, with comp growth in core food, tea, and espresso categories.Starbucks' licensed joint venture markets, including East China and South Korea, continue to contribute to CAP's performance in the quarter. Again, South Korea marks its fifth-largest global market, with system sales exceeding $1 billion in fiscal 2017, with double-digit comp growth in the year, underscoring the broad success Starbucks is having across the region.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 60 bps year over year to 23.5% in the quarter buoyed by strong sales leverage and higher JV income. These are partly offset by an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were down 0.1% year over year at $269.9 million in the segment as higher revenues from addition of new stores were offset by an extra week in the year-ago period.That said, comps grew 1% (against 2% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 330 bps to 12.9% due to softer performance in its company-owned markets and a 210-basis-point impact from a tax settlement in the quarter.Channel Development (CPG): This segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo teas, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages (like Frappuccino and Starbucks Refreshers) and Starbucks and Tazo-branded K-Cup packs sold through channels such as grocery, specialty retailers, and foodservice, to name a few.Channel Development's net revenues declined 0.7% to $514.9 million.Operating margin expanded 80 bps to 47.9%.All-Other: The segment comprises emerging brands like Teavana (acquired in Dec 2012), Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 9.2% to $104.6 million.Fiscal 2017 HighlightsThe company’s non-GAAP earnings came in at $2.06 per share, increasing 11.4% year over year. Net revenues were $22.4 billion, up 5% on 3% global comps growth.The company’s non-GAAP operating income increased 7.8% to $4.4 billion in the year and corresponding margin expanded 10 bps.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks projected global comp growth at 3-5% based on the addition of approximately 2,300 net new stores globally.Consolidated operating margin is likely to be slightly up, excluding the impact of the change in ownership structure in East China on operating margin.The company expects its GAAP EPS to grow more than 40%.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS growth of 12-13%, or $2.30-$2.33 per share in fiscal 2018 with growth in the second half to be a shade higher than the first half.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2886,MCD,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) posted mixed results in the third quarter of 2017, wherein though the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line lagged the same.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.76 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 by 0.6% and improved 9% from the year-ago quarter. The upside reflects stronger operating performance and G&A savings. Notably, adjusted earnings exclude the impact of current-year non-recurring gains and these unrelated strategic charges.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 2 cents per share on earnings in the quarter. At constant currency, earnings grew 7% year over year.Revenues of $5.75 billion declined 10% year over year, mainly due to the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative. At constant currency, the figure declined 12%. Moreover, the same lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.80 billion by nearly 1%.Behind the Headlines NumbersIn the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 23% to $3.06 billion. However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants increased 10% to $2.69 billion.Global comps grew 6%, supported by positive guest counts across all the segments. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Meanwhile, comps growth was slightly lower than the last quarter’s increase of 6.6%.Segment DetailsEffective Jul 1, 2015, McDonald's began reporting results under four segments: U.S. (the company's largest segment), International Lead Markets (mature markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K.), High-Growth Markets (markets that have high restaurant expansion and franchising potential such as China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands) and Foundational Markets (the remaining markets in McDonald's system).U.S.: Comps grew 4.1% in the third quarter owing to the positive impact of the national beverage and McPick 2 value promotions and the continued success of the Signature Crafted premium sandwich platform. Markedly, this segment continues to build momentum as it executes strategic menu, value and convenience initiatives to attract customers. In fact, comps growth was better than the prior quarter rise of 3.9%.Segment operating income also increased 6% on the back of higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars and G&A savings.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 5.7%, lower than the 6.3% rise witnessed in the last quarter. Continued momentum in the U.K. and Canada along with upbeat results across all other markets drove comps.Operating income was up 21%, including the impact of foreign currency translation. At constant currency, the figure was up 17%, primarily on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars.High-Growth Markets: Comps grew 6.2%, slightly lower than the prior-quarter’s 7% increase, led by strong performance in China as well as positive results across majority of the segment.Markedly, the segment's operating income for the quarter included a gain of roughly $850 million associated to the refranchising of China and Hong Kong, partially offset by unrelated non-cash impairment charges. Excluding these items, the segment's operating income rose 7% (3% in constant currencies), reflecting higher sales-driven margin dollars.Foundational Markets: Comps in Foundational Markets grew 10.2% on the back of positive sales performance across all geographic regions. However, the figure came in lower than the 13% growth recorded in the last quarter.Meanwhile, operating income declined due to the company's refranchising initiatives and elevated restaurant technology spending, somewhat offset by the benefit from prior year's strategic charges comparison.McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Upcoming ReleasesMcDonald’s has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2888,MCD,"We’ve already got a busy day of Q3 earnings reports to sift through, and market participants should take heart that, by and large, most major companies reporting before the opening bell have outperformed expectations — in some cases by a wide margin. After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%. Caterpillar has also upped full-year guidance to around $6.25 per share; $5.26 was the previous Zacks consensus estimate. CAT also carries a Zacks Style Score of A.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) also outperformed expectations this morning: its $1.32 per share easily outperformed the $1.07 expected — though results are still down more than 20% year over year — on quarterly sales of $33.62 billion — well beyond the $31.6 billion we had been looking for. GM looks to bring two electric cars to market in the next year and a half. It also has posted a positive earnings surprise for at least the past five straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of 14.7%. Shares of GM are up 3% at this point in today’s pre-market.Defense and aerospace major United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations on earnings, revenues and guidance.

Full-year guidance was also raised from $6.45 - 6.60 per share to $6.58 - 6.63.Industrial supply giant 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) also beat top and bottom-line estimates prior to Tuesday’s open, with earnings of $2.33 per share and revenues of $8.17 billion surprising the $2.21 per share and $7.91 billion expected. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up notably, from the previous Zacks consensus estimate of $8.95 per share to $9.00 - 9.15 as of its Q3 report. Shares of 3M are up 1.6% thus far in today’s pre-market.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 earnings report this morning, beating earnings estimates by a penny to $1.76 per share on $5.76 billion, which was a bit shy of the $5.80 billion expected. The Zacks ESP called this one-cent beat exactly, even as the negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit same-store sales in Texas and Florida from Q3 2016. In fact, U.S. comps were up 4.1% in the quarter, and International was up 6%. Shares are currently up 1.3% in early trading.Other companies this morning to have surpassed expectations and also raised full-year guidance are Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Polaris (PII  -  Free Report).

The index also enjoyed an upward journey, powered by upbeat quarterly earnings results by several other blue-chip companies, including Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report).Also, there has been a particularly sharp run-up in the stock price of blue-chips on signs of a strengthening economy.

Spending rebounded in the last quarter, buoyed by an uptick in household finances. Disposable income adjusted for inflation saw the best back-to-back quarters this year since the first half of 2015. Consumer spending was also driven by the strongest labor market in years.Companies, in the meanwhile, increased investments in equipment like computers, which rose at a rate of 8.2%, the highest in almost two years. This also highlights the optimism among companies over demand in domestic and overseas markets. Among other bright spots, nonresidential fixed investment that includes structures and intellectual properties contributed 0.64 percentage points to growth.

2891,MCD,"Leading fire-grilled chicken chain, El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report), currently has more than 470 restaurants in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. The company is looking to further expand its footprint in key markets through a mix of franchisee and company-owned stores.In fact, El Pollo Loco has opened 18 restaurants year to date, with another seven slated to open in the coming weeks.On Sep 21, the company opened its latest 2,660-square-foot outlet in Scottsdale, AZ. Located at 15255 N. 64th St., the resturant can accommodate about 60 guests.The outlet features the brand’s new Vision Design and has an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of its signature dish. Also, it marks El Pollo Loco’s third restaurant in Scottsdale and 24th in the greater Phoenix area.However, despite vigorous domestic expansion, El Pollo Loco loses out in terms of international presence. While other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) pursue aggressive global expansion policies, El Pollo Loco seems to be weak on this front.Additionally, shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date. The stock has been down 13.9%, as against the industry’s growth of 8.3%. Moreover, earnings estimates for current quarter and current year have moved down 5.3% and 2.9%, respectively, over the past 60 days.A challenging sales environment, given lower consumer spending in the U.S. restaurant space, remains a potent headwind to the company’s top line. Meanwhile, higher costs related to sales initiatives and wage rate increases may continue to hurt profits too.Nevertheless, this chicken chain's continuous expansion plans are anticipated to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Going forward, El Pollo Loco expects to drive growth through a number of initiatives such as its authentic advertising campaign, the recently launched mobile and online ordering app, loyalty program and delivery system. Also, menu innovation and limited time offers are likely to boost traffic at its restaurants.Currently, El Pollo Loco has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2892,MCD,"Shares of The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE  -  Free Report) declined 7% in afterhours trading on Nov 1, after the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Further, a lowered fiscal 2017 outlook owing to the prevailing challenging restaurant environment and the impact from weather events, led to the slump in the stock price.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 56 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents by 6.7%. Further, earnings declined 20% year over year.Sales of $555.4 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $562.5 million by 1.3% and declined 0.8% year over year.The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated QuoteInside the HeadlinesComps at Cheesecake Factory restaurants declined 2.3%, whereas the year-ago quarter marked a 1.7% growth in comps and the preceding quarter marked a 0.5% decline. Menu price increase of 2.4% was more than offset by a 4.3% decline in traffic and negative mix of 0.4%.We note that in August, the company stated that it expects comps decline of roughly 1-2% at Cheesecake Factory restaurants in third-quarter fiscal 2017.In fact, the hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) had a 0.8% negative impact on the company’s comps.

Meanwhile, labor expense ratio was 34.9%, 160 bps higher year over year.

2893,MCD,"Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) posted lower-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2018 with both earnings and revenues lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, shares of this Texas-based casual-dining restaurant gained more than 7% in yesterday’s trading session following the release. This is because investors gained confidence in Chili’s new menu and operational focus on speed that are likely to drive traffic.Earnings and Revenues DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 42 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents by nearly 2.3%. The bottom line also decreased 14.3% year over year due to lower revenues and margins. Notably, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a negative impact of about 3 cents per share on the company’s earnings.Quarterly revenues declined 2.5% year over year to $739.4 million due to lower company sales, partially offset by franchise and other revenues. While, the company’s sales decreased 2.8% to $716.9 million, franchise and other revenues improved 6.5%. Weather events had an adverse impact on the company’s sales to the tune of $5.4 million.Consequently, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $756 million by 2.3%.Comps decreased 3.3% in the reported quarter, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter's decline of 1.3% and preceding quarter’s drop of 1.8%.Brinker International, Inc.

Comps compared unfavorably with the prior-quarter decline of 2.2% and 1.4% drop in the year-ago quarter.Comps at its franchised restaurants went down 4.1% compared with a 0.6% decline in the year-ago quarter and 1.7% drop in the last quarter.In international franchised Chili’s restaurants, comps declined 7.9% comparing unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s growth of 0.9% and the prior-quarter’s decline of 4.2%.

2894,MCD,"The Dow finished at an all time high on Monday buoyed by the rally in shares of Goldman Sachs, Home Depot and Boeing. However, the technology sector slumped due to familiar overvaluation concerns, pulling the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to end in the negative territory. Although seven out of eleven major sectors of the S&P ended in the green, led by financials, a selling in major tech stocks such as Facebook and Google owner Alphabet negated such gains.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) touched an all-time intraday high of 21,929.80, earlier in the session. However, the blue-chip index pulled back to close at 21,891.12, also an all-time high, rising by 0.3% or 60.81 points in the process. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.1%, dwindling 1.80 points to close at 2,470.30. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,348.12, declining by 26.55 points or 0.4%. A total of around 6.3 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.0 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,495 to 1,017. On the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,278 to 971.Boeing Lifts Dow to Fresh Record The Dow’s stellar showing was powered by excellent earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). A rally in the shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) also helped Dow’s excellent performance. Moreover, low sovereign bond yields along with these results have essentially helped the Dow notch a record high on Monday.Technology Stocks Suffer, Drag S&P 500 and Nasdaq LowerOngoing tech overvaluation concerns led the investors to indulge in portfolio reshuffling toward the end of the month. A sell off in stocks of tech giants dragged the Nasdaq lower. During the session, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 1.2%, 3.2% and 1.3% respectively. Apple Inc is due to report on Tuesday and investors are hopeful of a good show from Apple.  The analysts expect Apple to control much of the tech sector over the coming week.Upbeat earnings from Chevron CVX and the growth in housing market boosted energy and bank shares. Broad based gains for the S&P 500 came from what has been an amazing earnings season all around. Further, there was a hike in oil prices as a result of production-curb commitments from OPEC and Saudi Arabia’s decision to curtail oil export to the States. However, the S&P 500 declined 1.8% to finish at 2,470.30. This fall was a result of the slump in tech stocks.Materials also contributed to the decline in S&P 500. The Materials Select Sector SPDR declined 0.8%. Seven of the eleven sectors of the S&P 500 were high, with the financial sector turning up in good numbers. The Financials Select SPDR was up 0.6%. However, this was negated by the losses incurred in the technology sector which turned out to be one of the worst performers. The Technology Select SPDR was down 0.5%.White House Drama Keeps Markets on the EdgeThe latest White House upheaval was marked by Anthony Scaramucci’s resignation from the post of White House communications director. Scaramcci stepped down just ten days after being nominated to the post. Moreover, the Trump administration’s failure to push through a bill to repeal the Obamacare has hurt the investor sentiment. Market watchers are increasingly losing faith in the promises made by President Trump in the run up to presidential elections. Trump's failure to keep his campaign trail promises has made investors doubtful about his ability to further his wider pro-growth agenda.Economic DataThe National Association of Realtors announced that its Pending Home Sales Index, increased 1.5% in June based on contracts signed last month. This was more than what the economists’ expectation of a 0.7% increase. For the record, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index declined to 58.9 in July from 65.7 in June.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Dow increased 2.5% and the S&P 500 rose 1.9% whereas the Nasdaq increased 3.4%. The Dow’s great run has been supported by excellent earnings for the month. Leading companies which posted better-than-expected earnings include the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), McDonalds MCD, Boeing, Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Facebook and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).However, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost out on some of the gains made earlier in the month. The tech rally initially gained on strong tech earnings expectations which were expected to justify high valuations of the tech stocks.  Gradually, investors took profits off the table by selling off tech stocks and this weighed on the broader markets, curbing gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.Also, Trump administration’s inability to repeal Obamacare hurt investor sentiment. Market watchers lost their faith in Trump’s ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro-growth agenda. Moreover, the Fed’s call to leave rates unchanged aided rate-sensitive industries and helped in broad based gains. Pegged at 1.4%, inflation still remains well below the targeted 2.0%, hurting investor sentiment.Stocks That Made Headlines:Discovery Lags Q2 Earnings, To Buy Scripps NetworksSilver Spring, MD-based Discovery Communications, Inc. DISCA posted a disappointing performance in the second quarter of 2017, missing earnings and revenue estimates.

2895,MCD,"The Dow outperformed the two other benchmarks to close at a record high riding on a rally in shares of Chevron. Amazon’s disappointing second quarter results weighed on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.The FDA’s decision to cut nicotine content in cigarettes weighed on the shares of tobacco maker Altria Group, which in turn dragged the S&P 500 lower Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s failure to repeal Obamacare also weighed down broader markets, following concerns about its ability to push through crucial policy changes. Meanwhile, second quarter GDP came in below expectations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) touched all-time intraday high and rose 0.2% or 33.76 points, closing at 21,830.31. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.1%, dwindling 3.32 points to close at 2,472.10. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,374.68, declining 45 points or 0.2%.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio .On the Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Dow Breaches Record, Recovers from 40-Point DeclineThe Dow matched an all-time intraday high on Friday, closing at a record level of 21,830.31. The blue-chip index was boosted by splendid earnings from Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) . This enabled the Dow to recover from the 40 point decline it suffered earlier in the session. U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp. reported strong second-quarter results amid the recovery in commodity prices, production gains and the success of its cost savings initiatives. The company reported earnings per share (excluding special items) of 91 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents and the year-ago profit of 48 cents. These helped shares of the oil giant gain an impressive 1.9%. (Read More: Chevron Q2 Earnings Beat on Oil Rally, Output Rise).On the other hand, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) posted a dismal performance, losing1.5%. Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corporation posted an earnings miss in second-quarter 2017 owing to a decline in liquid volumes and lower margin from chemical businesses. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved refinery volumes. The company reported earnings of 78 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter level of 41 cents. (Read More: Exxon Mobil Q2 Earnings Miss on Lower Volumes). However, Exxon’s losses were negated by Chevron’s excellent earnings performance and the blue-chip index posted a weekly gain.Amazon Posts Disappointing Earnings Amidst Speculations On OvervaluationAmazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) posted dismal earnings in the second quarter. Its second-quarter 2017 earnings per share (EPS) of 40 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. (Read More: Amazon Q2 Earnings Hurt by Higher Spending, AWS Solid). Amazon’s dismal performance led to losses for both the Dow and the S&P 500.Investors have been worried regarding the now familiar overvaluation of tech stocks as they fear a potential market crash and cautious investors have started taking profits off the table. This has affected the broader market and has pulled down the Nasdaq composite which closed at 6,374.68, declining 0.1%. The earnings season continues as Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is expected to report this week.FDA Announces a Cut In Nicotine Content, S&P 500 Slips The S&P 500 finished 3.32 points lower, closing at 2,472.10. Although, the index recovered from its early 10- point deficit, it still closed the day 0.1% lower. Apart from Amazon’s dismal earnings, the Food and Drug Administration’s call to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes hurt investor sentiment. The Select Consumer Staples SPDR (XLP) declined 0.8%, emerging as the worst performer out of eleven sectors of the S&P. Eight of the eleven sectors of the S&P ended in negative territory. The FDA’s decision also had negative ramifications for tobacco maker Altria Group Inc. MO as its shares slid 9.5%.On a broader scale, disappointing earnings from Amazon, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil also dented investor sentiment. Starbucks met analysts’ expectations on earnings, but failed to meet the same on revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 billion by 1.4%. (Read More: Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings in Line, Signals Soft US Market)Trump’s Failure to Repeal Obamacare Dampens Investor SentimentThe Trump –led Republican Government has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act yet again. This has dampened investor sentiment with market watchers losing their faith in the promises made by President Trump in the run up to the presidential elections. Trump's failure to keep his campaign trail promises has made investors doubtful of his ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro-growth agenda. These concerns also contributed toward losses for the broader markets.Economic DataThe gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.6% in the second quarter which came in lower than the expected rate of 2.8%. This was 1.2% higher than the first quarter. Consumer spending remained the major engine of growth. Personal consumption rose 2.8%, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. This was buoyed by a vibrant labor market which also meant increased spending in new homes.Weekly ResultsFor the week, the Dow gained 1.2% whereas the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The Dow’s great run has been supported by excellent earnings for the week. The companies which reported better-than-expected earnings were AT&T (T  -  Free Report), McDonalds MCD, Boeing (B  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 turned in mixed performances over the week. Despite splendid earnings from Facebook and the tech rally, disappointing performance from Amazon and the swoon in the shares of Apple, led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to close in the red.

2896,MCD,"Leading fire-grilled chicken chain, El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report), opened its latest outlet in Riverside, CA, on Sep 14. The 4,000-square-foot restaurant, located at Van Buren Blvd., can accommodate more than 60 guests.The outlet features the brand’s new Vision Design and has an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of its signature dish. Also, this marks El Pollo Loco’s seventh restaurant in Riverside.Currently, the company has more than 470 company-owned and franchised restaurants in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Moreover, it is looking to expand its presence in key markets through franchisees and company-owned stores. To this end, El Pollo Loco has already opened about 17 restaurants year to date with another eight to open soon enough, in the coming weeks.However, this fire-grilled chicken chain loses out in terms of international presence. While other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) pursue aggressive global expansion policies, El Pollo Loco seems to be weak on this front.Additionally, shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date. The stock declined 6.9%, as against the industry’s growth of 6.4%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have moved down 5.3% and 2.9%, respectively, over the past 60 days.Furthermore, a challenging sales environment given lower consumer spending in the U.S. restaurant space remains a potent headwind to the company’s top line. Meanwhile, higher costs related to sales initiatives and wage rate increases may continue to hurt profits too.Nevertheless, continuous expansion plans are expected to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Going forward, El Pollo Loco further expects to drive growth through a number of initiatives such as its authentic advertising campaign, its recently launched mobile and online ordering app, loyalty program and delivery system. Also, menu innovation and limited time offers are likely to boost traffic at its restaurants.Currently, El Pollo Loco has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2897,MCD,"Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results, wherein though earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell slightly short of the same.Notably, shares were up nearly 5% in afterhours trading on Nov 1 as the company raised its sales forecast for the year on the back of stepped-up expansion plans.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionShake Shack’s adjusted earnings of 17 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents by 13.3%. Also, the figure rose 13.3% year over year given an increase in revenues.Revenues surged 26.9% year over year to $94.6 million and came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94.7 million. An increase in Shack sales and licensing revenues, led to the improvement.Evidently, Shack sales rose 26.8% year over year to $91.1 million, primarily owing to the opening of 21 new domestic company-operated Shacks. This was partly offset by decline in same-Shack sales (or comps) as well as lost revenues, given hurricane-related Shack closures. Meanwhile, licensing revenues for the quarter came in at $3.5 million, up 30.2% year over year backed by opening of new licensed Shacks.Behind the Headline NumbersSame-Shack sales (or comps) declined 1.6% year over year due to a 3.8% decrease in guest traffic, partly offset by a combined increase in price and sales mix of 2.2%. Comps compared favorably with prior-quarter comps decline of 1.8% and unfavorably with rise of 2.9% in the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased 110 basis points (bps) to 88.8% mainly on an 80-bps increase in labor costs and 90-bps rise in both other operating expenses as well as depreciation expenses. However, these were somewhat offset by a decline of 90 bps and 70 bps in general and administrative expenses (G&A) and pre-opening costs, respectively.As a percentage of Shack sales, Shack-level operating profit margins decreased 160 bps to 27.2% primarily due to increased labor and related expenses as well as certain higher operating costs.Adjusted EBITDA (earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased 19.9% to $18.2 million. However, as a percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins declined roughly 110 bps to 19.2% from 20.3% in the year-ago quarter.2017 OutlookShake Shack has updated its full-year 2017 guidance.The company raised the lower end of its revenue guidance and now expects the same to be between $354 million and $355 million (earlier $351–$355 million).Currently, it projects Same-Shack sales to be down in the range of 1.5% to 2% year over year compared with the decline in the band of 2-3%, anticipated earlier.Shack-level operating profit margin is guided between 26.5% and 27% (earlier 26.5% to 27.5%), while general and administrative expenses are still anticipated between $38 million and $40 million.Given the strength of its development pipeline, the company now expects to open 24 to 26 new domestic company-operated Shacks in 2017, up from 23-24 guided earlier, and 18 net new licensed Shacks, up from 15 announced earlier, representing unit growth of roughly 39% and 36%, respectively.Preliminary 2018 ViewBuilding on the momentum, the company has stepped up its development plans for 2018 and intends to make it the company’s biggest year of openings to date. Notably, it expects to open 32 to 35 new domestic company-operated Shacks and 16 to18 net new licensed Shacks in 2018.Shake Shack, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Shake Shack, Inc.

2898,MCD,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on leading quick-service hamburger restaurant chain Jack in the Box, Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report).Jack in the Box’s shares have widely underperformed its industry year to date. The company’s shares have declined 13.3% against the industry’s gain of 5.6% in the same period.Additionally, Jack in the Box has been witnessing an unflattering movement in its earnings estimates trend, reflecting ongoing pessimism in the stock’s prospects. Over the last month, current quarter earnings estimates have moved down 7.1% due to seven downward revisions versus none upward. Meanwhile, current year consensus estimates have revised 3.8% downward due to eight negative revisions versus none in the opposite direction.A Soft Industry Backdrop Pressurizing the Top lineOver the past few quarters, the U.S. restaurants space has not been too enticing. Despite economic growth, somewhat lower energy prices and higher income, consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out, which resulted in low consumption.Moreover, as consumers demand high-quality products at lower prices, it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive. This, in turn, is resulting in a bigger gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home indices.Consequently, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the second quarter of calendar 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood.Resultantly, Jack in the Box’s sales has come under pressure. Comps at the Jack in the Box company stores were down 1.6% in second-quarter fiscal 2017, while comps at company-owned Qdoba restaurants declined 1.1%.Furthermore, the company lowered its comps outlook for 2017 and now anticipates the same to decline 2-2.5% at Qdoba company restaurants but inch up 0.5% at Jack in the Box system restaurants.Higher Costs & Heightened CompetitionJack in the Box reported a year-over-year decline in earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2017 as its margins were pressurized. Margins were negatively impacted by costs related to the 31 restaurants that were franchised, wage rate increases, commodity cost inflation, particularly in beef as well as higher repairs and maintenance costs.Going forward, nationwide wage increases and higher healthcare costs under the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue hurting this restaurant operator’s margins. However, commodity cost inflation is anticipated to prevail, in addition to expenses related to the company’s remodeling initiative as well as unit expansion. Meanwhile, widespread marketing schemes are projected to increase overall expenses.While all these expenses are likely to weigh down margins and thereby earnings, the company’s revenues are expected to be pressurized by heightened competition.In fact, Jack in the Box has been experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.While other restaurant chains including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front. Thus, limited international presence might be a big disadvantage for the company and hurt its competitive positioning.Sales-building Initiatives Offer Some RespiteDespite the prevailing headwinds, Jack in the Box’s several initiatives offer some respite.The company makes regular menu innovations and provides limited period offers (LPO) at both its brands to drive long-term customer loyalty. Its premium and value offerings, along with increased focus on breakfast menu to combat competition bode well.Apart from menu innovation and remodeling efforts, Jack in the Box expects catering, marketing initiatives and delivery to boost comps at the Qdoba brand.Qdoba is also developing a mobile app which will enable online ordering and mobile payment. The company is also redesigning its affinity program to bring back guests more often and to provide them with better control over reward points.Meanwhile, Jack in the Box restaurants are currently 85% franchised. The company plans to increase its franchise restaurants to around 90% by fiscal 2018. We believe, franchising a large chunk of its system will lower general and administrative expenses, and thereby boost earnings.Strategic Review of Qdoba Brand Could Prove BeneficialThe Qdoba brand has become more of a drag in recent quarters given poor restaurant level execution and a choppy sales environment.Keeping in mind the recent performance of the brand, and given that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models, management has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. This was done in order to assist the board in its assessment of possible alternatives with respect to the brand, coupled with other ways to boost shareholder value.Though management continues to believe in the brand’s potential, this strategic review by Morgan Stanley should aid in taking the requisite steps in better managing the company.However, it is to be noted that there is no guarantee that the evaluation process will result in a transaction. Also, the company has not set a timetable for conclusion of the process.Currently, Jack in the Box carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2899,MCD,"McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) last-reported results were encouraging with the company bettering our expectations on both top and bottom lines. Shares are also trending up as seen in the chart below:But to understand whether this was just a one-time thing or part of a broader recovery, let’s look for a moment at what was bothering the company in the first place.The way I see it, there were two main problems that led to the decline in its share of the market from 17.5% five years ago to 15.1% last year, according to Euromonitor. The first was an inability to capture an equal share of millennial traffic as it had of earlier generations. The second is related to the persistent weakness in Asian markets, particularly China.Of course, strategic refranchising makes headline numbers erratic and comparisons difficult because closing down company-owned stores is a big hit to revenues that can’t be offset by the 6% commission on sales from franchised stores. But at the end of the day, it makes sense, because both capital and operational expenses are thus taken out, with a resultant positive impact on profitability.In this respect, other fast food chains have already moved to a model where around 95% of the stores are franchised; so McDonald’s, being slightly late to react, will continue to enjoy some near-term positive impact that may not be seen in the others.Targeting MillennialsMillennials are generally more concerned about health, convenience, responsible sourcing and freshness of ingredients. And these are areas the company is doubling down on.In what is a complete reversal of earlier policy, management announced the intention to use fresh beef instead of frozen patties. Being somewhat more difficult to handle, this increases the risk of microbe buildup and food borne disease, but the strategy has given Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) an advantage so it’s worth trying out. McDonald’s isn’t taking this to all products at once, which sounds like a good idea.  Other menu changes include a reduction in the use of artificial preservatives, colors and flavors, HFCS-free buns and antibiotics-free chicken, in addition to the Premium Salads refresh, the margarine replacement with butter in Egg McMuffins, milk products from growth hormone-free cows and localized menu options that were announced earlier. In the pipeline is 100% cage-free eggs by 2025 in the U.S. and Canada.On the convenience side, the company is working on putting up digital sign boards, facilitating mobile ordering, tables with serving staff as in fast casual restaurants in some places, curbside service and delivery options both by its own staff and through partnerships with companies like GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report). It will also have 2,500 Experience of the Future (EOTF) stores by year-end, meaning that that’s the number of stores that will have Samsung tablets on the table or in kiosks that customers can use to order or communicate with staff.Stealing from the CompetitionMcDonald’s figures that not everyone is that health conscious however, so it seeks to lure in the diet cheaters as well. Not to mention those that would otherwise have gone to a Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) or a Dunkin’ (DNKN  -  Free Report) outlet instead. In the 2-5 PM timeframe that has always been quiet for quick service restaurants, McDonald’s is laying out croissants, muffin tops and a new sundae-topping station for ice cream lovers. It also has special offers on drinks that can be purchased for as low as $1-2.Plus there are seasonal-themed coffees and environmentally friendly coffee beans (a page out of Starbucks). For this purpose, McDonald’s is getting 12,000 new espresso machines, store redesigns and stepping up marketing efforts. The goal is clear: McDonald’s may be looking out for the health conscious, but it isn’t about to dump those wanting to indulge.Looking for Growth in ChinaChina is part of McDonald's “fast growing” segment, but it hasn’t been growing too fast of late. Changing customer perceptions following the stale meat scandal had a notable impact on not only McDonald’s but also on Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report). Chinese fast food chains in the meantime have gained some ground. Families in particular have moved on from Brand America to other things like food quality, so they are frequenting the fast casual segment these days. But office goers are reportedly coming back.McDonald’s isn’t taking chances. Just as it has done in other Asian markets like Japan (3,000 outlets), South Korea (600) and Taiwan (400), the company is transferring an 80% interest in 2,000 Chinese outlets to CITIC Limited, CITIC Capital Partners and The Carlyle Group for 10 years. In return, it’s getting a cool $2.08 billion from the largest franchisee outside the U.S.There are ambitious plans afoot, with the group targeting double-digit growth in each of the next five years by increasing the number of restaurants from 2,500 to 4,500. By 2022, it also intends to bring delivery hub coverage to over 75% of restaurants. This therefore looks like a very good deal by which McDonald’s is refranchising the business, acquiring local talent and catering to local preferences in a highly profitable way.  Last WordsTo ensure that all goes smoothly, McDonald’s has brought in Morgan Flatley (formerly CMO of Global Nutrition at Pepsico, responsible for getting Gatorade back to sustained growth), as U.S. Chief Marketing Officer; Farhan Siddiqi, as Head of U.S. Digital (formerly worked at Bank of America, Target and GE); and Linda Van Gosen (formerly VP at Startbucks, responsible for Starbucks Evenings, VP of Brand Strategy, Insights and Menu Innovation at TGI Friday’s and VP of Product Innovation at Chili’s Grill & Bar) as new Head of U.S. Menu.Given the above and the possibility of President Trump’s tax reforms kicking in, Mc Donald’s is set for a rebound. So if results are beginning to look up at McDonald’s it’s very likely an indication of more to come.McDonald’s shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2900,MCD,"Famous Dave’s of America, Inc.  reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 14, after the market closed. While, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues lagged the same.Shares of the company gained 11.4% in the first full-trading session following the results.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionFamous Dave’s fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents by 77.8%. However, the bottom line declined 15.8% year over year due to lower revenues.Revenues of $25.3 million were down 8.8% year over year as company-owned net restaurant sales as well as franchise royalty and fee revenues declined. Also, the top line came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26 million by 2.9%.Famous Dave's of America, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Famous Dave's of America, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Famous Dave's of America, Inc. QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersSystem-wide comps fell 3% due to a decrease in comps at both company-operated and franchise restaurants.Company-operated restaurant sales were $21 million compared with $23 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline of nearly 9% in the sales was fueled by the decrease in comps and the net closure of five restaurants since the end of second-quarter fiscal 2016.Notably, comps at company-operated restaurants decreased 2.2% comparing favorably with the prior-year quarter decline of 6.4%, and the previous quarter’s decline of 3.3%.Meanwhile, franchise royalty revenues decreased about 9% year over year, driven by the net closure of seven franchise restaurants since the year-ago quarter, and a decline in comps. This was partially offset by franchise fee revenues earned from the opening of one franchise-operated restaurant in the reported quarter.It is to be noted that comps at franchise restaurants were down 3.2% in the quarter. This reported figure was better than a 4.3% decline recorded in the prior-year quarter, and 4.8% decrease in the previous quarter.Restaurant-level operating margin for company-owned restaurants fell 130 basis points year over year to 8.2%. This lower margin was mainly driven by sales deleverage on fixed labor and operating costs, partially offset by lower food and beverage costs.Remarkably, general and administrative (G&A) expenses declined to $3.5 million from $4.5 million in the prior-year period. This year-over-year decrease was a result of the company’s continued optimization of its G&A structure to be commensurate with that of a dedicated franchisor, a decline in professional fees and reduced costs incurred for franchise-related matters.Notably, given the challenging sales environment in the U.S. restaurants space as well as prevailing inflationary pressures across the industry, Famous Dave’s is focused on tightly managing all the costs and expenses in its immediate control.Refranchising and Restaurant Optimization PlanOn May 2, Famous Dave’s announced plans to accelerate the refranchising and optimization of its company-operated restaurants over the next 12 to 24 months. In keeping with this strategy, it has closed six underperforming restaurants to date.According to the company, this initiative is likely to “permit the company to shift its resources and energy to the growth and support of its franchise system, which are paramount to the company’s success”.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesFamous Dave’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other restaurant stocks, McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.73, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 by 6.79%. The bottom line also increased 19% year over year.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings were $2.32 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.16 by 7.41%. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago quarter figure of 87 cents per share, given a substantial rise in revenues.In second-quarter 2017, Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted earnings of $1.32 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 by 8.20%. Furthermore, the bottom line increased 34.7% year over year on strong sales and a lower share count.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2901,MCD,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Buffalo Wild Wings Inc. .The company reported lower-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. This bleak performance was mainly due to the increased costs of traditional chicken wings coupled with higher promotional activity, lower-than-expected same-store sales as well as greater labor and operating expenses.ConcernsBuffalo Wild Wings’ earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine of the last 11 quarters due to higher costs. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues have also been lagging the same for the last 10 quarters. Such persistent top- and bottom-line miss raises concerns. In fact, comps have been much under pressure so far in 2017, adding to the woes.Furthermore, the menu price increases made by the company along with a choppy sales environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic trends in the near term, thereby weighing on the comps.Additionally, fluctuation in price of chicken – a key ingredient for the company – might hurt the company’s profitability. Notably, the company expects traditional chicken wing prices to rise in the range of 8% to 10% in 2017, which is likely to dampen profits. Also, Buffalo Wild Wings’ promotion of Half-Price Wing Tuesdays puts pressure on its cost of sales as the high priced wings items are offered at lower prices.The costs related to company’s other sales boosting initiatives like unit expansion and higher labor costs due to the competitive labor market are also estimated to continue to hurt profits in the near-term.Moreover, while other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) pursue aggressive global expansion policies, Buffalo Wild Wings seems to be slow on this front. This is because it has just started to expand its reach in international markets and thus lags severely.Some RespiteVarious sales initiatives undertaken by the company like menu innovation and promotional offerings, increased focus on take-out and delivery services, enhancing digital capabilities, roll out of loyalty program, investing in Guest Experience, along with better food presentation and operational efficiency are expected to boost comps. Meanwhile, the company’s cost-saving efforts are likely to drive margins.Additionally, Buffalo Wild Wings has decided to give something new a shot this summer and started testing small-format stores in the Minneapolis metro area.Given consumers' increasing shift toward to-go and in-home dining experiences, the company is experimenting with these small, fast food style stores. We believe these options are sure to improve its reach as well as market share potential in the near term.Bottom LineDespite various strategic initiatives, the uncertain sales environment and a rising costs scenario could continue weighing on the company’s performance, going forward. It would thus be prudent for investors to remain on the sidelines for some time now.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Such gains were made possible by a rally in shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and DowDuPont (DWDP) which increased 2.2% and 2.5% respectively. However, gains for the Dow were pared by a decline in the shares of McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report).

"
2905,MCD," Wachovia Corp.  (WB) announced the largest quarterly loss by a bank in U.S. history.  The troubled financial institution lost $24 billion after a $19 billion impairment of goodwill.  Net loss per share was a startling $11.18 per share, $2.23 excluding write downs and restructuring expenses.   Wachovia is still on schedule to be acquired by  Wells Fargo & Co.

2906,MCD,"In addition to Wachovia, far too many firms posted disappointing earnings and/or forecasts which over shadowed  McDonalds Corp.  (MCD  -  Free Report) solid earnings announcement.

Same-store sales were up 4.7% domestically and 7.1% worldwide.  Earnings per share were $1.05, 8 cents higher than the consensus estimate. Despite the excellent results the stock still closed down 1.7%

KMB lowered its fourth-quarter and full-year guidance. The company cited the immediate impact of the stronger dollar as the primary reason for the disappointing outlook.

2918,MCD,"As stated in Tuesdays closing commentary, Lockheed Martin Corporations (LMT) soft outlook, provided in its third-quarter report, was an impetus for removal. LMT's initial 2009 profit guidance of $7.65 to $7.90 per share was well below the consensus earnings estimate. Even after adjusting the forecast for an expected 30-cent charge related to pension costs, the range was still disappointing.

2942,MCD,"Everyday readers of Zacks.com are offered four new stocks that fit each of the four main styles of investing: Aggressive Growth, Growth & Income, Momentum, and Value. For those who have checked out the companies under the different categories but may not have had the time to learn more about the style of investing related to the stock being researched, I thought it would be helpful to offer more insight on and links to explanations of the four investment styles.
"
2943,MCD,"The Education section of Zacks.com offers a plethora of detailed  
"
2944,MCD,"articles and helpful information on each style of investing. Extremely helpful are the guides for each style.     
"
2945,MCD,"Because I write about Growth and Income stocks, I will focus on this style for this weeks Investment Idea. However, links  
"
2946,MCD,"are provided to guides for all four investment styles at the end of the article. In an effort to leave no stone unturned, we  
"
2947,MCD,"made sure that each of the links below provide a comprehensive PDF guide and a list of individual well-detailed articles on  
"
2948,MCD,"the four different styles of investing.   
"
2949,MCD,"What to Expect with Growth and Income
"
2950,MCD,"Generally, a Growth and Income play will have healthy balance sheets, consistent dividend payments, quality products and  
"
2951,MCD,"services and experienced management teams. Usually Growth and Income companies are industry leaders, displaying steady  
"
2952,MCD,"earnings growth.
"
2953,MCD,"Companies that continually exhibit stable earnings growth, more than anything else,
"
2954,MCD,"are ones that should hit the radar screens of Growth & Income investors. After all,
"
2955,MCD,"companies exhibiting all of the characteristics mentioned earlier should have no problem
"
2956,MCD,"producing a steady stream of profit growth. Analysts will subsequently grow more
"
2957,MCD,"optimistic about the future earnings potential of the company and adjust their estimates
"
2958,MCD,"up accordingly. 
"
2959,MCD,"Growth & income investors get a dual benefit from following earnings
"
2960,MCD,"estimate revisions. First, positive estimate revisions help investors buy shares in the
"
2961,MCD,"companies with the best chances to outperform the market. Second, positive estimate
"
2962,MCD,"revisions provide the easiest means to monitor the health of companies, providing a
"
2963,MCD,"rather clear signal when the time has come to abandon ship. Companies experiencing
"
2964,MCD,"upward estimate revisions will generally enjoy positive momentum going forward. Rarely
"
2965,MCD,"will a stock suffer a significant price decline in the face of improving fundamentals. Add it
"
2966,MCD,"all up and its clear that Growth and Income investors should only buy shares in
"
2967,MCD,"companies enjoying upward earnings estimate revisions. The best way to harness
"
2968,MCD,"this phenomenon is through the Zacks Rank.
"
2969,MCD,"Solid Growth and Income picks should carry a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Check out the Guide to Growth and Income investing for more detailed information  
"
2970,MCD,"on this style of investing and the important role that the Zacks Rank plays in screening for Growth and Income stocks.     
"
2971,MCD,"A Growth and Income Stalwart
"
2972,MCD,"I have covered a wide variety of companies that fall under the Growth and Income style. Below is an example of a consistent Growth and Income play that is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (""strong buy"") name.

"
2991,MCD,"We are in the thick of the Q3 earnings season with results seemingly on solid ground given the positive momentum on the revenue front. Apart from maintaining the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises, the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is quite palpable.According to our latest Earnings Preview, 64.2% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 is already out. As of Oct 27, 2017, total earnings for the 272 S&P 500 members are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues. Of these, 75.7% surpassed earnings estimates, while 66.2% beat revenue expectations.A Look at the Restaurant IndustryWe note that the performance of the restaurant industry, under the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, has been mixed so far this earnings season. Among the restaurant stocks that have reported, Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust results, beating earnings and revenue estimates.McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results. While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same. However, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lagged on both fronts.Soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains. Also, the recent hurricanes seem to have negatively impacted results of a number of restaurant companies this earnings season, which includes the likes of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report)    that reported lower-than-expected results in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment.Let’s have a sneak peek at two major restaurant stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping before the announcement.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.We expect Starbucks’ revenues to increase on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth. Starbucks also projected global comps growth at 3-4% for the quarter. Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes, Seared Steak and Egg Wrap.Starbucks’ digital offering, Mobile Order and Pay, is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in 2017. Again, growth in Starbucks reward members is expected to contribute to its revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States. Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $5.73 billion, implying 0.4% year-over-year growth.With respect to the company’s bottom line, Starbucks’ EPS is likely to witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores. Hence, despite a revenue-growth expectation, the coffee giant’s margins are likely to narrow due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation. These headwinds, however, are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative (G&A) expenses.That said, a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share, reflecting a decrease of 2.5% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%. Starbucks currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making an earnings prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for a likely earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.(Read: Will Higher Costs Impact Starbucks' Q4 Earnings?) Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteYum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers before the opening bell.Post China business separation, Yum! Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure bodes well. This, in turn, is likely to bolster third-quarter results.Particularly, augmented pace of unit development along with increased investments in technology-driven initiatives is anticipated to somewhat drive top-line growth in the quarter.Coming to the Pizza Hut brand, while the international division might continue doing well, Pizza Hut U.S. is expected to post soft results for the quarter despite numerous strategic efforts similar to the last few quarters. Notably, a soft consumer-spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is likely to continue restricting revenue growth.Meanwhile, KFC’s efforts to revamp outlets, focus on its operational excellence, delivery services, innovation and convenience, are expected to continue boosting comps.However, Yum! Brands is likely to witness a decline in company sales due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative, which, in turn, will lower the company’s revenues in the third quarter. A slowdown in emerging markets is likely to further hamper the quarter’s performance.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 66 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 39.5%. The same for revenues is pegged at $1.39 billion, 58.2% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Yum! Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -1.37%. The company currently has Zacks Rank #3, making an earnings prediction uncertain.

Price and EPS Surprise  Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Yum! Brands, Inc. QuoteOur TakeEarnings beat for both the companies remain uncertain. Starbucks and Yum! Brands have delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters. However, Yum! Brands’ average beat of 7.01% steers past Starbucks’ level of 0.46%.From the sales growth perspective, Starbucks is well positioned to report better quarterly results.Meanwhile, both the companies are expected to report a decline in earnings. However, Yum! Brands’ rate of decline of earnings is more than the Starbucks’ (-39.5% Vs. -2.5%).Stay tuned!

Comps at system-wide international restaurants increased 5.3%, lower than comps growth of 7.6% a year ago but higher than 3.9% in the preceding quarter.G&A costs decreased 1% year over year in the quarter. This is primarily due to lower management incentive costs coupled with benefits from higher revenues.2017 OutlookFor 2017, Papa John’s expects adjusted earnings per share growth of 3% to 7%, below the previous range of 8% to 12%.North America system-wide comps growth is projected as positive, up to 1.5%, down from the previous range of 2% to 4% growth.Meanwhile, international comps are still expected to grow 4% to 6% in 2017.Debt-EBITDA ratio is expected in the range of 2.5 to 3.5, higher than the previously projected range of 1.5x to 2.0x.Capital expenditures are expected between $45 million and $55 million, same as the previously guided range.The company reaffirmed its guidance for net global new unit growth at the range of 3-4%, primarily to mirror the closure of stores in India.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company plans to carry out an accelerated share repurchase program for a portion of the share buyback authorization.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesPapa John’s has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2993,MCD,"Shares of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) fell nearly 4% in afterhours trading on Jul 27, after the company reported lower-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2017.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 49 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by 3.9%. Moreover, earnings decreased 12.5% from the year-ago figure of 56 cents, primarily due to increased expenses.Revenues of $265.8 million were up 6.2% year over year given an increase in total operating weeks, somewhat offset by lower weekly sales average.

Moreover, operating margin decreased 310 bps to 4.7%.

2994,MCD,"Shares of Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) were up nearly 2% in the trading session on Jul 27, after the company reported mixed second-quarter 2017 results. While, the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line lagged the same.Earnings and Revenues DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents by 3.2% and increased 12.3% year over year. This upside was mainly owing to better margins, offset by an increase in shares outstanding.Dunkin' Brands’ revenues in the quarter increased 1% year over year to $218.5 million. The improvement was on the back of a rise in royalty income as well as a boost in rental income. But it was also partly offset by a decrease in sales at company-operated restaurants and decline in sales of ice cream and other products, particularly in the Middle East, along with decrease in other revenues. Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $219.6 million by 0.5% in the reported quarter.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.

The uptick in revenues was primarily owing to an increase in royalty income and an improvement in sales of ice cream and other products.However, comps decreased 0.9% in the Baskin Robbins U.S. division comparably weaker than 0.6% growth in the year-ago quarter but better than the 2.4% decline in the prior quarter.At Baskin Robbins International division, comps grew 3.3%, better than the 6.6% slump in the prior-year quarter and the 2.0% decline in the prior quarter.Operating MarginAdjusted operating income rose 6.9% from the prior-year quarter to $118.9 million mainly backed by an increase in royalty income as well as rental margin, and a decrease in general and administrative expenses.

Meanwhile, adjusted operating income margin was up  290 basis points to 54.4%.Store UpdateIn the reported quarter, Dunkin' Brands opened 133 net new restaurants worldwide.

2995,MCD,"The U.S. stock market seemingly can’t be stopped these days, as strong earnings from several industry giants helped the DOW and S&P 500 reach record intraday highs on Wednesday.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 115 points during regular trading hours Wednesday, hitting a new all-time high in the process. The index’s big move was spurred in part by Boeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) massive climb after it reported its second-quarter financial results, which have helped it jump 8.35% through early afternoon trading.The airplane manufacturer added more than 100 points on Wednesday to move past Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) as the most expensive stock in the Blue-Chip index.Solid early Wednesday gains from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), and Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) also helped the 30-stock index reach an intraday high of 21,742.70. The Dow is up 9.86% year-to-date.S&P 500 & NasdaqThe S&P 500 also reached new heights today, just one day after closing—yet again—at an all-time high of 2,477.13, on the back of big movement from Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report). The index opened at 2,479.97 and reached an intraday high of 2,481.69 on Wednesday.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) jumped 6.27% in intraday trading, which made it one of the biggest movers in the index.

Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal projected a fall of about 2.6 million barrels.This massive reduction in excess oil has helped U.S. crude oil prices rise 1.29% to $48.51 a barrel on Wednesday.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2998,MCD,"The Q3 reporting cycle has started on an encouraging note with multiple companies reporting significant earnings and revenue growth compared with the prior quarters. Particularly, the momentum on the revenue side is quite palpable.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 87 S&P 500 members that have reported results (as of Oct 20) are up 9.4% from the year-ago period, courtesy a 7.3% rise in revenues. Notably, 71.3% of the companies that have posted their quarterly numbers have surpassed earnings estimates, while 70.1% have exceeded top-line expectations.Restaurant Stocks in FocusThe restaurant industry belongs to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector and the space is expected to deliver mixed performance this earnings season. Overall Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be down 2.2% year over year, though revenues are anticipated to rise 5.8%.In the recent quarters, the restaurant industry’s sales trends have been very challenging, given soft consumer spending on dining out, which has resulted in low consumption. Declining comps due to sluggish traffic trends along with rising costs are thus taking the sheen out of restaurant companies. Nevertheless, restaurant operators are undertaking various sales building and digital initiatives to enhance guest experience and, in turn, drive traffic and comps.Also, the third quarter of 2017 marked the seventh consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales (comps) for the restaurant industry as a whole, per TDn2K’s Black Box Intelligence. Markedly, the quarter posted the second worst sales and traffic growth rates in over five years. In fact, the recent hurricanes appear to have particularly impacted results for restaurant companies in the quarter.Thus, though the overall scenario is still bordering on the negative and the earnings picture seems to be less enticing, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are likely to continue exhibiting strength even in a not-so-favorable environment. Let’s take a look at what might be in store for the two restaurant companies that are set to report their third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24. Will these companies manage to put up a decent performance?Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) came up with a positive earnings surprise of 7.41% in the last quarter. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 3.94%.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Chipotle this quarter. This is because, according to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.For the quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -6.08% and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the company’s earnings and revenues are likely to improve year over year. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings stands at $1.60, representing a year-over-year increase of over 100%. Also, revenues are estimated to improve 10.2% to $1.14 billion.However, it is to be noted that the to-be-reported quarter is expected to witness easy year-over-year comparisons as Chipotle was in the midst of its massive food-safety scandal this time last year.Though Chipotle’s new brand-management efforts, continual restaurant openings along with various sales-building initiatives bodes well, renewed food safety concerns may pressurize the company’s top line. Also, costs associated with marketing programs, higher labor expenses along with elevated food costs, given rise in avocado prices, are likely to dent the quarter’s profitability (read more: Will Food Safety Issues Hurt Chipotle's Q3 Earnings?).McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 6.79%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 12 quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 7.44%.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWe expect the company to surpass expectations in the quarter due to the combination of its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of +0.18%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the U.S. segment is currently pegged at nearly $2 billion, reflecting a decline of nearly 4% year over year, given the prevailing challenging restaurant environment in the domestic space. Nevertheless, various sales and digital initiatives undertaken are likely to drive the segment’s comps.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1.82 billion and $1.48 billion for International Lead Markets and High-Growth Markets, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 3% and 10%, respectively. Political and economic unrest in key operating regions are likely to hurt sales, despite consistent efforts to improve performance and drive comps in these markets.Meanwhile, though increased focus on refranchising is likely to boost earnings, it may hamper the quarter’s revenue growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.75, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. The same for revenues is projected to be $5.8 billion, down 10.2% from the prior-year quarter (read more: Will Comps Growth Drive McDonald's Q3 Earnings?).Stay tuned!

2999,MCD,"Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. In the trailing four quarters, it had underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 19.2%. In the preceding quarter, it missed the consensus mark by 13.6%. The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Skechers will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?After witnessing a decline in the bottom line for the five straight quarters, Skechers is likely to post earnings growth in the third quarter of 2017. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 43 cents, which is a penny above from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,065 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 13%. However, we notice that the rate of growth may decelerate from the preceding quarter that saw 16.9% jump in the top line.Management had earlier guided third-quarter net sales in the band of $1.050-$1.075 billion compared with $942.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the company had envisioned earnings per share in the range of 42-47 cents.Factors at PlayInvestors remained apprehensive about Skechers’ bottom-line performance that has been declining since the past few quarters due to rise in selling and general & administrative expenses. However, we believe that greater emphasis on new line of products, cost containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform may help reverse trend. The company is also enhancing e-commerce platform. Although, Skechers expects to deliver flat sales in the domestic wholesale business, it envisions double-digit growth at its international business as well as company-owned retail stores.Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Skechers U.S.A., Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Skechers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Skechers carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -2.33%, consequently making the surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.67% and a Zacks Rank #1.

While, 75.7% of the companies that have reported their quarterly numbers surpassed earnings estimate, 66.2% exceeded top-line expectations.Turning our focus to the widely popular restaurant industry, we note that the performance of the players here has been mixed so far this earnings season.Among the restaurant stocks that have reported, Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust results beating earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results. While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same. However, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lagged on both fronts.A soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs are continuing to haunt restaurant chains. Also, the recent hurricanes seem to have impacted results for a number of restaurant companies in the quarter including the likes of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) that reported lower-than-expected results in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment.Markedly, the three restaurant companies that are set to report their quarterly results on Nov 1, have a significant exposure to the hurricane affected areas. This may result in sales decline in the quarter due to destruction caused by the same.Despite these headwinds, will these companies manage to put up a decent performance? Let’s take a look at what might be in store for these companies:Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.00% in the last reported quarter.

In fact, the consensus estimate of $92 million for Shack sales and $3.4 million for licensing revenues in the quarter, reflects a year-over-year improvement of 27.8% and 24.8%, respectively.Apart from the adverse affects of the hurricanes, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might limit revenue growth and hurt comps. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the quarter’s comps to witness a decline of 2.5%. Comps grew 2.9% in the year-ago quarter (read more: Will Higher Revenues Drive Shake Shack's Q3 Earnings?).The Cheesecake Factory Inc.

Markedly, the consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 60 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 13.7%. Nevertheless, the company's initiatives to boost sales and traffic are likely to somewhat boost comps and drive the top line.

3003,MCD,"Shares of Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) were up about 0.4% in the trading session on Oct 26, after the company reported mixed third-quarter 2017 results. While, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line lagged the same.Earnings and Revenues DiscussionAdjusted earnings of 61 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents by 3.2%. However, the same improved 1.7% year over year, owing to higher revenues and a decrease in shares outstanding.Dunkin' Brands’ revenues in the quarter increased 8.2% year over year to $224.2 million. The improvement was on the back of a rise in franchise fees and royalty income driven by system-wide sales growth as well as a boost in rental income. Also, an increase in other revenues backed by license fees related to Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods and ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, along with increased transfer fee income contributed to the same. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $214 million by 4.9% in the reported quarter.Inside the Headline NumbersDunkin' Brands operates through its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands.Markedly, the company’s system-wide sales increased 3.3%, lower than 4.6% growth recorded in the prior quarter.Dunkin’ DonutsDunkin' Donuts U.S. reported revenues of $165.1 million, which reflects an increase of 8.3% over the prior-year quarter. The upside can be attributable to higher royalty income and rental income as well as an increase in franchise fees and other revenues, partly offset by a decrease in sales at company-operated restaurants.Comps increased 0.6% in the Dunkin Donuts U.S. division comparing unfavorably with 2% growth in the prior-year quarter but slightly better than 0.5% growth in the preceding quarter.Comps at Dunkin’ Donuts International division also increased 1.3%, as against a 1.4% decline in the prior-year quarter. In fact, the figure compared unfavorably with the decline of 2.8% in the preceding quarter too.Baskin-RobbinsBaskin-Robbins U.S. revenues were down 0.2% from the prior-year quarter to $13.8 million. The downtrend was mainly due to lower sale of ice cream and other products, besides lower other revenues.Comps decreased 0.4% in the Baskin-Robbins U.S. division, comparably better than 0.9% decline in both the year-ago quarter and in the last quarter.At Baskin-Robbins International division, comps declined 4.3%, worse than the 2.9% slump in the prior-year quarter and 3.3% growth in the prior quarter.Operating MarginAdjusted operating income rose 11.5% from the year-ago quarter to $127.9 million mainly as a result of higher revenues. The upside was partly offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. Meanwhile, adjusted operating income margin was up 170 basis points to 57.1%.Store UpdateIn the quarter under review, Dunkin' Brands opened 137 net new restaurants worldwide. These include 67 net new Dunkin' Donuts U.S. locations, 18 net new Dunkin' Donuts International locations, 11 net new Baskin-Robbins U.S. locations and 41 net new Baskin-Robbins International outlets.Additionally, Dunkin' Donuts U.S. franchisees remodeled 88 restaurants while Baskin-Robbins U.S. franchisees renovated 24 outlets.GuidanceFor 2017, Dunkin’ Brands continues to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.40 to $2.43 and maintains the projection of mid-to-high single-digit growth in adjusted operating income.Furthermore, the company anticipates low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth.

3004,MCD,"The broader U.S. market has been wavering for the last few days. First, tensions between President Donald Trump and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un were sky-high thanks to nuclear activity by the latter. Second, U.S. stocks have been guilty of overvaluation for quite some time.Finally, the disbanding of President Trump’s Manufacturing Council and Trump’s warning of a government shutdown sparked off political anxiety in America. The latest Fed minutes also showed that policymakers are wary of weak inflation. Meanwhile, some U.S. economic readings have come in weak.The net result is 0.9% one-month slide in the S&P 500-based ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) and a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq 100-based ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report). But the Dow Jones Industrial Average-based ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) gained about 1.3% in a month (as of August 23, 2017).Let’s find out what led the Dow ETF scrape past the other two:As per an article published on nytimes, the two indexes – The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones – “usually move within a percentage point or two of one another.”  But in the last three months (as of August 23, 2017) DIA returned (up 4.8%) almost double that of SPY (up 2.4%). Along with nytimes, we believe that the key cause of this divergence is Boeing shares.Let’s delve a little deeper and find what other stocks were possible for this divergent performance and what could be the future of SPY and DIA.Boeing’s Exposure to DIA & SPYBoeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) holds the top spot in DIA with about 7.42% exposure while the stock is nowhere in the top-10 holdings of SPY. Boeing shares added about 30.5% in the last three months (as of August 23, 2017).Apple’s Exposure to DIA & SPYApple (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares have about 5% exposure in DIA while its weight in SPY is relatively less at 3.95%.UnitedHealth Group’s Exposure toDIA & SPYUnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) shares have about 6% exposure in DIA with no exposure in the top-10 holdings of SPY.McDonald’s Exposure to DIA & SPYMcDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) shares gained about 8.1% in the last three months. DIA puts about 5% of its portfolio in MCD while SPY’s top-10 holdings are void of MCD.Visa’s Exposure to DIA & SPYVisa (V  -  Free Report) has over 3% weight in DIA unlike SPY. As a result, VISA’s sharp ascent offered an edge to DIA over SPY.Can the Edge of DIA Hold over SPY?The DIA’s edge over SPY may lose in the coming days given the not-so-great prospect of McDonald’s and Visa as evident from the VGM scores. However, the index as well as the fund are likely to be favored by Boeing and UnitedHealth Group thanks to their bullish VGM score and Zacks Industry Rank.Apple shares are likely to play a moderate role in DIA as well as SPY’s performance as the stock has a decent VGM score of C but belongs to a downbeat Zacks Industry Rank in the bottom 5%. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3005,MCD,"Fast food giant Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand further in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. The company has inked a multi-unit store development agreement with Coastal Franchising, Inc. whereby it plans to build seven new restaurants therein.Franchisee group Coastal Franchising, which is led by George Ross, currently operates 39 outlets throughout the Carolinas, including five in Raleigh-Durham itself. This addition of seven units will more than double the franchisee’s presence in the area. The first of these is expected to open in 2018.Notably, this agreement is in sync with the company’s plan to fuel growth in North Carolina, which is home to over 200 Dunkin’ Donuts outlets.Meanwhile, apart from foraying into domestic markets, Dunkin' Brands is also looking to expand its footprint internationally in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Also, it considers the untapped market of South Africa a great potential.At the end of second-quarter 2017, there were in excess of 12,300 Dunkin' Donuts points of distribution and over 7,800 Baskin-Robbins points of distribution, across more than 60 countries in Dunkin’ Brands’ fully-franchised system.In fact, in full-year 2017, the company expects Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees to add 330-350 net new restaurants, and Baskin-Robbins franchisees to add 10 net new restaurants in the United States. Moreover, internationally, the company anticipates franchisees and licensees to add 50-100 net new restaurants.Notably, the Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have outperformed its industry in the last year. While the stock rallied 9.7%, the industry witnessed a gain of 4.9% in the same time period.However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been suffering for the last few years at both its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from similar food & beverages companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) might continue to put pressure on revenues.Although the company is certainly not immune to certain headwinds, we expect it to sustain the momentum going forward on the back of continued expansion strategies along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include product launches, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, the ongoing loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to attract customers and positively support earnings as well as revenue growth.Currently, Dunkin’ Brands’ has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Nonetheless, the major indexes are overdue for a short-term rebound. Whether we'll see this happen over the next 5 days is a questionable, but I do think we are either at or near a short-term bottom.
"
3036,MCD,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings SurprisesDeckers Outdoor (DECK  -  Free Report) raised its third-quarter sales guidance last week, helped by robust demand for its UGG shoes. The company now sees revenue of about $195 million, a rise of 51% over 2007 levels, up from its prior view of a 34% increase. Though DECK did not provide a new profit target, the majority of the covering analysts raised their forecasts. The consensus earnings forecast now calls for profits of $1.79, versus the previous forecast of $1.68 per share. DECK has topped expectations for 13 consecutive quarters. Deckers Outdoor is scheduled to report on Thursday, Oct 23, after close of trading.
"
3037,MCD,"JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report) saw preliminary passenger revenue per available seat miles rise by 28% in September. Lower oil prices of late have also acted in favor of the company, which has topped consensus estimates in all of the last 4 quarters. Analysts have thus become more bullish on JBLU and expect the company to post a narrower loss in the third quarter. The consensus estimates now stands at a loss of 5 cents per share compared with a projected loss of 9 cents a month ago. JetBlue is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, Oct 23, before the start of trading.
"
3038,MCD,"Timken (TKR  -  Free Report) boosted its third-quarter guidance to a range of $1 to $1.10 per share, helped by strong overseas demand, capacity expansion and lower scrap prices. The new outlook is significantly above the companys prior view of 65 cents to 75 cents per share. Analysts now expect the companys quarterly profit to reach $1.07 per share. Timken is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Friday, Oct 24, before the start of trading.
"
3039,MCD,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesAffymetrix (AFFX) forecast third-quarter sales below brokerage analysts expectations, citing increased competition for academic research funding and a fall in industrial spending. The company, which has missed forecasts twice during the last 4 quarters, guided to sales of $75 million. Analysts now see a quarterly loss of 6 cents a share, wider than the loss of 1 cent they had forecast a week ago. Affymetrix is scheduled to report results on Thursday, Oct 23, after close of trading.

3046,MCD,"Illinois-based McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report), a well-known fast food chain, recently boosted its dividend by 33% to 50 cents per share. MCD noted that the dividend is payable December 15 to shareholders of record on December 1. The company is yielding 2.5% in an industry that virtually pays no income. Strong Fundamentals McDonald's offers a return on equity (ROE) of 26%, above the industry average of 17%. The company's net margin of 19.2% soars past the industry average of 2.5%. Rising Estimates Analysts have been raising estimates. Wall Street has full-year 2008 earnings pegged at $3.53, up from last month's $3.52 and the three months-ago level of $3.40.

3047,MCD,"Following the sell-off that came after Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) bottom-line miss after the bell yesterday — based on a gigantic one-time payout of a settlement with the EU for $2.7 billion — Q2 earnings season does not pump the breaks; it keeps going, with several Dow components having reported before the bell today. As far as Alphabet is concerned, investors will be looking for signs that anti-trust cases like the one that resulted in the GOOGL settlement with the EU was a simple anomaly or a sign of things to come for the search giant.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) kept its impressive streak of positive earnings surprises alive with an 11-cent beat to $1.73 per share, on quarterly sales of nearly $6.05 billion, higher than the $6 billion expected. Strong global comps bolstered the quick-service giant, up 6.6% year after year (+4% in the previous quarter), and pre-market trading of MCD shares is up 3% at this hour. We look for a possible change to its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating in the coming days.Farm and mining equipment major Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) posted $1.49 per share this morning on $11.3 billion in revenues, surpassing the $1.26 per share and $10.95 billion estimated. This marks at least the fifth straight positive earnings surprise for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, which also raised 2017 guidance for both sales and earnings. CAT stock is up 5% in today’s pre-market.Chemicals giant DuPont  also kept a nice string of earnings beats alive this morning, putting up $1.38 per share, ahead of the $1.29 in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues grew 5% year over year to $7.42 billion, higher than the $7.26 billion expected. The Zacks Rank #3 company looks toward its merger with Dow Chemical  next month, with spinoffs to follow in the moths ahead.Minnesota-based 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) missed estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning, falling short on the bottom line by a penny to $2.58 per share on quarterly sales of $7.81 billion, beneath the Zacks consensus estimate of $7.88 billion. That said, the conglomerate raised the bottom end of its 2017 earnings guidance, though shares are selling off a bit in toad’s pre-market.Finally, United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by 8 cents to $1.85 per share on $15.28 billion in revenues for Q2, ahead of the $15.18 billion expected. The company has also raised the lower end of its guidance this morning, and we see shares of UTX trading up 1.5% in today’s early market.

3050,MCD,"Per a recent Reuters report, McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) intends to close all 169 outlets in India’s northern and eastern regions due to a dispute with the concerned franchise partner — Connaught Plaza Restaurants Pvt Ltd.Reportedly, the franchise violated certain terms of the agreement, including the payment of royalties. Therefore, all the outlets under this franchisee will no longer be allowed to use McDonald's name, trademarks, designs, recipes, and branding within 15 days of termination notice. Further, it will lead to about 6,500 job losses.The move also follows the company’s prolonged legal squabble with Connaught Plaza that led to the shutdown of more than 40 restaurants in June.Meanwhile, shares of McDonald’s have widely outperformed its industry year to date. While the company’s shares have rallied 30.1%, the industry gained 5.7%.Ever since the company’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, announced a turnaround plan a string of changes has been implemented on the restaurant chain as well as on its menu. This was done in an effort to rejuvenate the brand. The company since then, has reported better sales and profits by trimming costs, simplifying menus, offering value meals and rolling out digital initiatives.Currently, McDonald’s operates over 37,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries, of which about 85% are franchised. With less than 500 outlets, India forms relatively small part of the chain. However, as the country is one of the world’s leading emerging markets, disruption in operations here will not bode well for the brand's long-term growth. Shutting down stores here compromises McDonald’s share in the country’s booming quick-service restaurants space where the company is already facing stiff competition from contenders such as Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) as well as YUM! Brands Inc.’s (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut and KFC brands.Nevertheless, the company has already started looking out for another partner to fill the gap in the region.McDonald’s presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked restaurant stock from the same space is Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) that has surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 30.5%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3051,MCD,"In this digital era, as consumers increasingly look for convenience, technology has begun to play an important role in determining customer experience. This digital wave has hit the U.S. restaurant space too as an increasing number of restaurant chains are deploying technology to enhance guest experience.In fact, technology at restaurants has become essential — more than ever before — given the troubles plaguing the U.S. restaurant space over the past few quarters.Hence, restaurant operators are going all guns blazing, with their online and digital marketing activities, to meet consumers’ increasing dependence on and penchant for online and mobile web technology and consequently lure them back.Age of Mobile OrderingWhile smartphone apps attract consumers, video menu boards in quick-service restaurants and tabletop devices speed up sales and ensure convenience. Further, restaurant operators rely on social media for promotions and incorporate Facebook, Twitter, online review sites and blogs aggressively into their marketing mix.In fact, mobile ordering in particular is fast becoming a crucial part of many restaurants' plans, given what it can bring in enhanced sales. This is because when using a phone to order their food, customers, on an average, tend to spend more and visit more often. Going forward, mobile ordering is thus set to be the core to the customer’s experience, rather than just being a point of differentiation.Notably, pizza giants Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Papa John's International Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) have been the industry bellwethers in the digital ordering space.  Both the companies hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Domino’s continues adding to its digital capabilities with the launch of various ordering apps and platforms. The extended ways to order a pizza has thus kept this company in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience. Moreover, digital leadership is helping the pizza giant to expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas. In fact, at the end of 2016, the company generated over 60% digital sales in the United States.Papa John’s too continues to reinforce its commitment toward providing a better customer experience with enhancements to its digital ordering process. Markedly, the company’s mobile ordering applications support category-leading five simple, secure, and mobile-friendly ways to pay online orders without using cash or credit card. In the second quarter of 2017, Papa John’s recorded more than 60% online sales mix, of which around 70% was from its mobile channels, and has a long-term target of eventually reaching 80%.Though few restaurants have managed to come as far along as the pizza chains but still there are many who have advanced their own apps by leaps and bounds to arrest more customers on the go.It is to be noted that coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty and e-Commerce platforms to create more revenue streams. In fact, Starbucks’ mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment app in the United States.Nearly 30% of all U.S. transactions took place through mobile devices at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. Currently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is introducing many technology innovations to further strengthen its brand, improve efficiency and in-store execution and increase profitability.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) is also growing in terms of its usage of digital technology. Dunkin’ Donuts’ mobile ordering service — On-the-Go — is available nationwide exclusively for Dunkin' Donuts DD Perks Rewards Program members. This ordering service gives the company the power to drive customer loyalty and boost efficiency as well as speed of service at its restaurants. Again, in August 2016, Baskin-Robbins' launched a mobile app with a variety of interactive features.Meanwhile, in order to catch up with established mobile ordering offerings from competitors, burger giant McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) has also begun testing mobile order-and-pay capabilities on its app in the United States. The company is thus set to launch the option in nearly all 14,000 U.S. restaurants and 6,000 others in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia and China by the end of this year.Both Dunkin' Brands and McDonald’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bottom LineThe restaurant industry’s sales trends in recent quarters have been strained given the soft consumer spending environment.However, often a rising tide lifts all boats in an industry as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that drive securities across the board. This could happen in the restaurants space as well. Increasing focus of operators on mobile ordering to cater to ever-changing wants and needs of time-crunched customers could lift the industry from its current position at the bottom 14% out of the over 250 Zacks categorized industries.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Competition will certainly be tough, be it at the brick-and-mortar stores or online portals, the retailers need to be hawk-eyed.Improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer confidence points to an uptick in sales during this festive season, and retail bellwethers will leave no opportunity to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile.As retailers are gearing up for the season, in the same fashion you can also fine tune your portfolio to include stocks that are likely to trump estimates.

3053,MCD,"When almost the entire market is worried about overvaluation, U.S. blue-chip companies have brought sweet surprises for investors in the form of revenue growth. As per an article published on Financial Times, revenue growth at blue-chip US companies like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) are beating analyst expectations at almost the decade-best rate (read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).Oil-service bellwether Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), fast food giant McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and social-media darling  Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) surpassed sales expectations last week (read: Decent Oil Service Earnings Fail to Perk Up ETFs).As per the Earnings Trends issued on July 26, 2017, about 34.2% of the S&P 500 companies have reported this reporting cycle. Among these, 70.8% companies beat top-line estimates while 78.9% beat on the bottom line.Why Revenue Growth is a Bullish SignInvestors should note that sales are harder to be influenced in an income statement than earnings. A company can land up on decent earnings numbers by adopting cost-cutting or some other measures that do not speak for its core strength. But it is harder for a company to mold its revenue figure.Secondly, according to chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust, when corporate revenues are rising in a low inflation backdrop like this, it signifies “true demand-based revenue increase”. These gains are likely to be volume driven, not realization driven, which points to a recovering consumer segment. A still-low interest rate environment and energy prices maybe have been boosting the consumer area.Weaker Dollar: A Boon for Blue ChipsThe year 2017 has been all about greenback weakness, with the U.S. currency ETF PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF (UUP  -  Free Report) losing about 8.7%. The fund has dived over 5% in the last three months (as of July 28, 2017) (read: Rising ETFs in a Falling Dollar Environment).Political uncertainty in the Trump administration has kept the greenback from soaring. Investors should also note that lower-than-expected expansion in the fiscal policy given the ongoing political drama has prompted the IMF to downgrade U.S. growth to 2.1% for 2017 and 2018 from the previous projections of 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively.The Fed also stayed away from an extremely aggressive policy tightening – after two rate hikes this year – due to subdued inflation (read: ETF Winners & Losers on IMF Growth Forecast).This makes us think that this is the right time to bet on large-cap stocks rather than the smaller ones. Large-cap stocks perform better in a weaker dollar environment since the former has substantial foreign exposure. So, negative currency translation risk gets minimized in a falling dollar environment.Financial Times reported that an analyst with AllianceBernstein indicated, “the weaker dollar appears to be a factor this season as global companies have posted 300 basis points better growth than those with higher domestic revenue exposure.”Global Economy on the MendSince large-caps rely heavily on foreign economies, the health of the Euro zone, Japan and emerging economies is very important in taking investing decisions. The IMF upgraded 2017 GDP growth projections for the Euro zone by 0.2 percentage points from April to 1.9%. High levels of public investment also led IMF to beef up its Chinese growth forecast.The IMF also nudged up the 2017 growth forecast for Japan to 1.3%, from 1.2% forecast in April. Emerging markets, as a whole, are also better placed now. All these point at better demand from foreign economies.ETFs to PlayIf you are convinced by the above-mentioned reasonings, you can try a few large-cap ETFs mentioned below.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) The fund comprises 30 blue-chip U.S. stocks.

3054,MCD,"It’s been an interesting morning in the restaurant space as several of the industry’s major players, including McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report), reported their latest earnings results. Despite solid beats by both of the aforementioned companies, the market’s reaction has been entirely different.McDonald’s topped expectations on the top and bottom line, posting adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and revenues of $6.05 billion. These results surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.62 and $5.99 billion, respectively. Profits improved 19% year-over-year, while revenues were down about 2% on a constant-currency basis.McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteThe real story for McDonald’s was its impressive comparable-store sales growth in key markets. Comps in the U.S. gained a respectable 3.9%, but comps in the company’s International Lead Markets—which includes mature markets like Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K.—soared 6.3%.Elsewhere, McDonald’s saw 7% comps growth in its High-Growth Markets, a segment that includes countries with high restaurant expansion and franchising potential—such as China, Italy, Poland, Russia, and South Korea (read more: McDonald's Tops Q2 Earnings on Solid Comps Growth).Shares of MCD opened at $157.75, nearly 4% higher than Monday’s close, following the release of the report.This price action was not matched by Domino’s, despite the pizza chain reporting similarly impressive numbers. Domino’s posted earnings of $1.32 per share on revenues of $629 million, surpassing our Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.22 and $613 million, respectively.Revenues in the company’s supply chain unit, which includes ingredients and equipment sold to franchisees, climbed 15% year-over-year. Same-store sales at company-owned restaurants soared 11.2%, while international comps rose a modest 2.6%.Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteDPZ shares opened lower on Tuesday, eventually sliding more than 10% to an intraday low of $192.57 in morning trading.Weakness in the Domino’s international business is likely to blame for the market’s harsh reaction to the report. For instance, the company’s Domino’s Pizza Group Plc franchise is the largest pizza delivery chain in the U.K., and with like-for-like sales growth coming in much lower than last year, investors might be worried about the company’s strength in key markets.Overall, the retail restaurant business has been more familiar with challenges this year. The industry is sitting in the bottom 19% of the Zacks Industry Rank, and its modest growth has been outpaced by the S&P 500 so far.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3057,MCD,"A challenging industry backdrop has been hampering the performance of most restaurant chains and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is no exception.In fact, as the operating environment remains increasingly challenging, the decline in sales volume has begun to impact the returns on the company’s new restaurant openings. Also, management noted that 2016 class of new restaurant openings generated below-expectation revenues, limiting overall revenue growth for the company.Nevertheless, at the last quarterly conference call, the company stated that the recent performance has been encouraging as the locations opened in 2017 have seen better revenue trends, more in line with past standards.Consequently, though Red Robin has slowed down on its unit growth plan for 2017 and 2018, it has not completely refrained from it.Recently, the completely announced its plan to open a new Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brew restaurant at Cedar Park, TX, on Sep 18.Apart from the signature items like Royal Red Robin Burger, Bottomless Steak Fries, Smoke & Pepper Burger, and Red's Tavern Double the menu will also feature Freckled Lemonade.

3086,MCD,"Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes.Last quarter, Buffalo Wild Wings saw an earnings miss of 14.29%. Moreover, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 10.69%.Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayAfter four consecutive quarters of comps decline, Buffalo Wild Wings finally witnessed marginal comps growth in the last reported quarter. This upside was driven by the company’s strong market position, new menu launches and investing in guest experience, among other initiatives.In fact, Buffalo Wild Wings’ efforts to revive comps growth via promotional offerings, better food presentation, along with various digital initiatives including the revamp of its mobile app is expected to boost second-quarter results too.Meanwhile, increased focus on better staffing in the take-out area and improving operational execution is likely to further boost take-out sales, a growing segment of the company’s overall revenue stream. Additionally, the variety and convenience of its FastBreak program is expected to have improved lunch-time sales in the quarter.However, Buffalo Wild Wings has been witnessing declining traffic trends, of late. In fact, we believe that the menu price increases made by the company, along with a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might affect traffic trends further, thereby putting the quarter’s comps under pressure.Furthermore, fluctuation in the price of chicken – a key ingredient for the company – might hurt the quarter’s profitability and remains a major cause of concern. Also, the company’s promotion of Half-Price Wing Tuesdays further puts pressure on its cost of sales as the high priced wings items are offered at lower prices. In fact, the increase in this promotion mix last quarter had an adverse impact of 37 cents on the company’s earnings per share. This trend might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, as well.Meanwhile, costs related to company’s sales boosting initiatives like unit expansion and higher labor costs due to the competitive labor market are estimated to continue denting profits in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Buffalo Wild Wings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

3088,MCD,"We expect burger giant, McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, McDonald's pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 11.36%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last eleven quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.01%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McDonald's is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.64, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.62. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McDonald's currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of McDonald's favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What is Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings?Global comps at McDonald’s have been positive for the last seven quarters, marking a trend that is likely to continue in the second quarter as well. This appears to be the result of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales.In sync with these efforts, the company has been focusing on operational excellence, product innovation, undertaking efficient marketing and promotions, offering a value menu, and rolling out more limited-time offerings to improve guest count – which remains the company’s top priority – and drive the top line.Moreover, efforts to enhance digital capabilities, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the U.S. might further propel the quarter’s results.However, a slowdown in emerging markets and the prevailing challenging restaurant environment in the domestic space are likely to hurt sales. Meanwhile, higher labor costs along with currency headwinds might dent the quarter’s profits.Other Stocks to ConsiderMcDonald's is not the only company looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3089,MCD,"Its time again for the second-quarter reporting cycle to gain momentum. In fact, now that we are done with the earnings results from the early reporters and the late comers from the previous quarter, we will witness second-quarter earnings acquiring full impetus. So, let’s brace ourselves for the next round of earnings.Among all the sectors, our focus in the discussion here will be the Retail-Wholesale sector.  A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment due to sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players. We believe the impact of the slowdown in traffic trends will clearly be reflected in the diminished sales and comparable store sales (comps) numbers in second-quarter 2017.Further, these retailers are heavily investing in eCommerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.The data released by the Commerce Department on Jul 14 revealed that retail sales declined for the second month in a row. U.S. retail and food services sales for Jun 2017 declined 0.2% sequentially, compared with a 0.1% decline in May. The decline can be attributed to soft sales at gasoline stations, clothing retailers and department stores. Further, consumers continued to spend lower at restaurants as well as on hobbies.Additionally, the data revealed that retail trade sales for June dipped 0.1% from May but increased about 3% from last year. While non-store retailers registered growth of 9.2% from last year, sales for the Sporting Goods, Hobby, Book, & Music Stores declined 8.9% year over year.However, U.S. retail and food services sales improved 2.8% form Jun 2016. Moreover, total sales for second-quarter 2017 (Apr 2017 through Jun 2017) reflected a 3.8% growth from the prior-year period. The overall increase in the estimate for the second quarter could be attributed to the growing online sales, which now forms a part of core sales of most retailers.Q2 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, 30 S&P 500 members that together represent 9.3% of the Index’s total market capitalization have released second-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 13.8%, on 6% revenue growth. Further, about 83.3% delivered both positive earnings and revenue surprises.While this represents only a small sample, we can ascertain that the second-quarter earnings season is surely off to a good start. More clarity on the results will be evident from the S&P members reporting earnings in the next few weeks. A look at the earnings calendar shows that we are only few days away from the reporting cycle fully taking off.Coming to expectations, total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.6% year over year, with a 4.5% jump in revenues. For the retail sector, in particular, earnings in the second quarter are expected to inch up 0.1%, with 3.7% revenue growth.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Preview report published on Jul 15.That said, we bring to you five retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.

3090,MCD,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to revitalize its McCafe brand. In this regard, the company is focusing on new cafe-quality espresso beverages, extended retail offerings and a branding overhaul to gain ground in the battle for the nation's coffee drinkers.Inside the HeadlinesIn addition to recrafted lattes and mochas, the company has added a new set of espresso-based beverages to the McCafe lineup that are made with freshly-ground espresso and US-sourced whole or nonfat milk. The three new beverages include caramel macchiato, cappuccino and americano.Notably, these new offerings along with all McCafe specialty beverages will be available for $2 for a limited time at the participating restaurants.  Also, the company recently inked a deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) to bring a line of ready-to-drink McCafe Frappe beverges to groceries across the United States in early 2018. The bottled drinks will come in three flavors that include caramel, vanilla and mocha.Currently, the fast food chain maintains a line of whole bean, ground and single-serve coffee in retail stores. Therefore, this will be McDonalds’ first foray into the nearly $2 billion ready-to-drink coffee category.Apart from the coffee upgrades, McDonald's also announced a McCafe brand revamp with the introduction of a new brand logo and packaging that will change with the seasons. In fact, as part of its evolving Experience of the Future initiative, the company also plans to transform its in-restaurant McCafe presence with a sleek and contemporary look in 2018.Furthermore, the company has brought in new coffee makers into its stores so that the new espresso-based beverages are handcrafted with a steady, appetizing flavor. The rollout to nearly all of McDonald's 14,000 restaurants is accompanied by new training for crew members.Rationale BehindWith its refined new beverages and updated branding, the company aims to capitalize on the growing coffee culture among customers and meet their demand in terms of taste, convenience and value. In October 2016, the company had stated that it would be buying all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. Elevating its coffee business has thus become an essential part of its growth strategy amid escalating demand for the same and continual pressure on the food sales.Markedly, McDonald's launched the coffee brand McCafe in the United States in 2009. Though McCafe generates nearly $4 billion in sales annually in the country, it has the scope to fare much better. In fact, this is just the start to its McCafe commitment with more transformations in store.Moreover, by bringing bottled McCafe drinks to store shelves, the company aims to keep up with rival Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.’s (DNKN  -  Free Report) Dunkin’ Donuts that signed similar deal with Coca Cola last year, and coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), which sells its bottled Frappuccinos in partnership with Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and has for long dominated the ready-to-drink coffee space.Bottom LineMcDonald’s shares have gained 23.5% over the past six months, outpacing 9% growth of the industry it belongs to.In fact, growing guest count remains McDonald’s top priority and it is undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to this end. The company has thus been simplifying menus, offering value meals, rolling out all-day breakfast in the United States, focusing on delivery to provide increased convenience and taking steps to meet consumer preference for quality food.By elevating and leveraging the McCafe coffee brand, the company aims to further raise the bar for guests and convert casual diners to loyal customers.Additionally, we note that ever since jumping into the coffee fray, McDonald's has gained from pricing its beverages far lower than its direct coffee competitors. Thus, the new drinks and expansion into retail is likely to add to McDonald’s top line and may perhaps prove to be challenging for its close competitors.McDonald's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3091,MCD,"Fast food giant, Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand further throughout Georgia. The company has signed store development agreements with QSR Group, LLC, and Guzaratti LLC, whereby it plans to build six new restaurants.QSR Group will develop five Dunkin' Donuts restaurants in Macon, GA, including two multi-brand locations with Baskin-Robbins. The first of these is expected to open in 2018. Meanwhile, Guzaratti will open one Dunkin' Donuts location in a gas and convenience store in the Buckhead suburb of Atlanta, GA.Notably, these agreements are in sync with the company’s plan to fuel growth in the Greater Atlanta and Macon regions, which are home to more than 190 Dunkin’ Donuts outlets. In fact, the company is offering special development incentives in order to continue recruiting more franchisees.Apart from foraying into domestic markets, Dunkin' Brands is also looking to expand its footprint internationally in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Also, it considers the untapped market of South Africa a great potential.At the end of second-quarter 2017, there were in excess of 12,300 Dunkin' Donuts points of distribution and over 7,800 Baskin-Robbins points of distribution, across more than 60 countries worldwide in Dunkin’ Brands’ fully-franchised system.In fact, in 2017, the company expects Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees to add 330-350 net new restaurants and Baskin-Robbins franchisees to add 10 net new restaurants in the United States. Moreover, this fast food chain anticipates franchisees and licensees to add 50-100 net new restaurants, internationally.However, Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have underperformed its industry in the last year. While the stock was up 3.7%, the industry witnessed a gain of 5%.We note that Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been suffering for the last few years at both its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Also, Dunkin’ Donuts admits facing tough competition from McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Restaurant Brands International, Inc.’s (QSR  -  Free Report) Burger King that have been cutting into its afternoon traffic. Competition arises from other well-established coffee makers like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) as well.Additionally, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurants space remains a concern.Although the company is certainly not immune to certain headwinds, we expect it to sustain the momentum, going forward, backed by the continued expansion strategies, along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include curbside delivery, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to attract customers and support earnings, as well as revenue growth.Dunkin’ Brands’ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3092,MCD,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on burger giant, McDonald’s Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report).This leading fast-food chain currently operates over 37,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Sales Efforts for its Key MarketsIn order to boost comps in the United States, which represents a major portion of the company’s business, McDonald’s aims to increase focus on growing guest traffic. This will be done by accentuating on operational excellence, product innovation, offering a value menu and rolling out more limited-time offerings.In fact, the company’s first and second phase of All Day Breakfast along with its national value platform – McPick 2 – have been immensely popular among guests in the United States and may continue aiding top-line growth.On the digital front, McDonald’s has finally begun testing mobile order-and-pay capabilities on its app in the United States and is set to launch the option in nearly all 14,000 U.S. restaurants and 6,000 others in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia and China by the end of this year.Adding mobile to its ordering options is expected to enhance speed and convenience for customers. Moreover, given McDonald's large footprint in terms of locations, this is expected to boost sales and enhance the company’s competitive position.Meanwhile, to provide augmented convenience to customers, McDonald’s is increasingly focusing on expanding the delivery service. Also, it is accelerating Experience of the Future (EOTF) deployment in the United States and building on its success in markets around the world. Through elevating the customer experience at McDonald's, this initiative represents one of the greatest opportunities to build on business momentum, besides growing guest counts.Additionally, McDonalds is adapting to changing consumer preference, bringing more transparency in its operations and trying to attract more health-conscious eaters by altering its practices and food lineup as well.These apart, the company is also trying to improve its performance in the lnternational Lead Markets as well as the High-Growth Markets. In fact, it intends to drive comps growth in these markets through introduction of value meals, comprehensive focus around new products and value as well as breakfast platforms, customizing the menu to local customer tastes, reimaging of restaurants, efficient marketing and promotions, improved service, and increased convenience via delivery.Notably, global comps at McDonald’s have been positive over the last eight consecutive quarters.Increased Focus on FranchisingCurrently, nearly 85% of the company’s restaurants are franchised. Going forward, McDonald’s aims to refranchise 4,000 of its restaurants by the end of 2017 with the long-term goal of becoming 95% franchised. We note that increased focus on refranchising will reduce the company’s capital requirements and facilitate earnings per share (EPS) growth and Return on Equity (ROE) expansion over the long term.In January 2017, the company entered into a strategic partnership and sold the control of its Chinese business, thus reducing its own share to 20%. In fact, it continues to look out for similar partnerships to streamline its business and focus on the quality of its offerings. These deals are thus likely to have an upside impact on the company’s earnings and margins as McDonald's is expected to gain from trimming its overall cost of operations and preserving its capital.ConcernsWith about 40% of McDonald’s operating income coming from the International Lead Markets and over 10% from the High-Growth Markets, the company’s earnings remain vulnerable to negative currency translation. Given that the dollar is strengthening against various currencies, the company’s results are likely to be affected.Moreover, apart from rise in minimum wage, additional health care costs related to Obamacare in the United States, raise labor costs for the company. Meanwhile, costs associated with brand positioning in all the key markets and ongoing investments in initiatives would continue to weigh on margins, at least in the near term.In addition to these headwinds, McDonald’s is grappling with difficulties like decelerating growth in Asia along with weakness in some parts of Europe, where the economic/political conditions are expected to be further challenging post Brexit. A challenging sales environment in the U.S restaurant space is further likely to keep the top line under pressure.Bottom LineMcDonald’s shares have rallied 23.7% over the last six months, as against the industry’s gain of 7.1%. Furthermore, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 12 quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 7.44%.Various sales and digital initiatives undertaken by the company to reinforce its position worldwide are anticipated to continue driving growth over the long term. This, in turn, will help fight macroeconomic, cost and currency woes.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMcDonald’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in this sector include Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR  -  Free Report) and Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc.  holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the trailing four quarters, Papa John's, Restaurant Brands and Bravo Brio pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.10%, 6.46% and 28.27%, respectively.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars. But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

"

The S&P 500 has shown a good run so far this year and hit a record high on Tuesday led by over 1% increase in each of energy, materials and financial shares. Oil price rose following Saudi’s decision to curb oil exports to the US. The Nasdaq gained on Tuesday owing to bullish sentiments ahead of key tech earnings releases expected later this week. These gains occurred despite a decline in the shares of Alphabet which has been plagued by a rise in acquisition costs.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 0.5% or 100.46 points, closing at 21,613.43.

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.73 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 by 6.8% and improved 19% from the year-ago quarter. This has been attributed to the food giant’s national cold beverage value promotion, which offers soft drinks for $1 and the launch of Signature Crafted sandwiches which have been strategically priced between $5 and $7 each.

3159,MCD,"We have seen a number of major earnings beats this earnings season, but we shouldn’t see this as the new norm that will continue through the rest of this reporting cycle. A company’s earnings outperformance is as much a function of the overall business environment as it is of management effectiveness in executing operating and strategic plans. As such, the very strong results from a company like McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) doesn’t mean that all restaurant operators stand to shine this earnings season. What it does mean is that the operating environment is favorable for earnings growth, with effectively run operators able to capitalize on opportunities. All in all, the fundamental backdrop is favorable to earnings growth.With respect to the Q2 scorecard, we now have results from 128 S&P 500 members that combined account for 36.1% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.3% beating revenue estimates.Putting results from these 128 index members in a historical context, the growth pace is below what we had seen in Q1, but is about in-line with the 4-quarter average and presents a notable improvement over the 12-quarter average, as the comparison chart below shows.Unlike the growth pace, the proportion of companies beating estimates is tracking above historical periods, as the comparison chart below shows. The proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is particularly notable.In terms of standout sectors, the Tech sector results have been strong, with total earnings for the 37% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported up +13.2% on +11.1% higher revenues, with 90.9% beating EPS estimates and 81.8% beating revenue estimates. I even see strength in the Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) earnings report that many in in the market found disappointing. For a company this big to be able to grow the top-line in excess of +20%, entirely through organic means, is very impressive. We will see how the rest of the Tech sector results come out in the coming days, but it is reasonable to be optimistic about the sector’s earnings prospects based on what we have seen already from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and others. The Finance sector’s results have not been well received, but they aren’t bad either. Total earnings for the 54.1% of the sector’s market cap that have reported already are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues, with 82.9% beating EPS estimates and 68.6% beating revenue estimates.It is relatively early for the Energy and Consumer Staple sectors, but both of those sectors have gotten off to a shaky start this earnings season.Beyond Q2, earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +4.8% from the same period last year in Q3. Estimates for the quarter have started coming down, with the current +4.8% growth pace down from more than +6% at the start of the quarter. This pace of negative revision is about in-line with what we had seen in the run up to the Q2 earnings season, which was a material improvement over what we had seen in the last two years.Unlike the decelerating quarterly growth pace, the overall level of quarterly earnings is in record territory, as the chart in the accompanying video shows.

"
3175,MCD,"Markets finished with strong gains garnered over a month which featured stellar earnings releases. Tech stocks overcame overvaluation fears over most of this period. However, profit taking and portfolio reshuffling toward the latter half of July meant that investors had to give up on some of these windfall gains. Most economic data released during this period was encouraging even as the Fed refrained from raising rates. On the flip side, attempts to push through a new healthcare law failed, casting aspersions on the Trump administration’s ability to implement its pro-growth agenda.July’s PerformanceFor the month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased by 2.5%, 1.9% and 3.4%, respectively. The Dow’s great run was supported by excellent second-quarter earnings released during the month. Leading companies which posted better-than-expected earnings include the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).However, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost out on some of the gains made earlier in the month. Tech stocks initially gained on strong tech earnings expectations which were expected to justify high valuations for the sector.  Gradually, investors took profits off the table by selling off tech stocks and this weighed on the broader markets, curbing gains for these two benchmarks.Also, the Trump administration’s inability to repeal Obamacare hurt investor sentiment. Following this development, market watchers lost their faith in Trump’s ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro-growth agenda. Moreover, the Fed’s call to leave rates unchanged aided rate-sensitive industries and helped in broad-based gains.Bullish Domestic DataThe majority of the economic data released in July indicated that the economy was on a firm footing. The ISM Manufacturing Index increased to 57.8 while the ISM Services Index increased to 57.4 in June. Industrial production moved up 0.4% in June. Notably, durable orders rose by 6.5% in June, which represents the largest increase since Jul 2014. Also, the Leading Indicators Index increased by 0.6%.On the negative side, factory orders declined by 0.8% in May while retail sales slipped 0.2%. CPI remained unchanged in June while core CPI gained 0.1%. PPI and core PPI gained 0.1% each.GDP Rises in Q2As per the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday, the real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.6% in the first quarter of 2017. This was higher than analysts’ estimates of an increase of 2.5%. Further, it is nearly double the downwardly revised 1.2% pace of growth recorded in the first quarter.A rebound in consumer spending helped boost overall economic growth. Consumer outlays grew 2.8% in the second quarter as Americans spent more on healthcare, groceries and clothes. Spending rebounded during the quarter, buoyed by an uptick in household finances, in turn powered by a buoyant labor market. Disposable income adjusted for inflation saw the best back-to-back quarters this year since the first half of 2015. (Read: US GDP Crosses $19TN for the First Time: 5 Best Gainers)Housing Sector ImprovesOverall, data on the housing sector was bullish in nature. Housing starts increased by 8.3% from May. This represents a 2.1% annual increase, the highest recorded in four months. Building permits also increased, by 7.4%. Pending home sales increased by 1.5% in June, ending three successive months of losses. New home sales increased by 0.8% in June, representing the second successive month of gains.On the negative side, existing home sales lost 1.8% in June, following a record spike in home prices. More significantly, the NAHB Housing Market index lost 2 points to touch 64 in July. This is the lowest level recorded since Nov 2016. A spike in building material prices, particularly lumber was believed to be responsible for the decline.Job Additions Rise, Unemployment Inches UpAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs in June, much higher than the consensus estimate of 174,000. The addition of 222,000 jobs marked the second-biggest job gains of the year.Meanwhile, unemployment rate increased marginally from 4.3% to 4.4% in June, as more people came into the labor force searching for jobs. The ""U-6"", considered to be a broader measure of the unemployment as it includes those workers who are working part-time for purely economic reasons, increased to 8.6%.Payrolls data also showed that average hourly wages increased 0.2% to $26.25 against the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.3%. Hourly pay has experienced an increase of 2.5% over the last twelve months. Additionally, the labor force participation rate for June increased marginally to come in at 62.8%.Earnings Expectations Power Tech Rebound, Volatility PersistsTech shares began to rebound early in the month, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) advancing by 1.2% on Jul 7. Investors regained their faith in tech shares after the sector suffered several setbacks following concerns over exorbitant valuations. Powering these gains were expectations of a stellar earnings show from big tech names. Market watchers believe that such a strong performance would justify the valuation levels of tech stocks.Ultimately, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook’s earnings surpassed estimates and delighted investors. In contrast, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) posted a disappointing performance. As of Jul 28, we have Q2 results from 66.1% of the technology sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Technology companies are up +18.8% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues, with 87.1% beating EPS estimates and 87.1% beating revenue estimates.Consequently, the Technology Select Sector SPDR is up 4.5% and leads gains for the S&P 500’s sectors. However, overvaluation concerns have returned to haunt tech stocks on occasion, raising volatility levels for the sector. Q2 Earnings Likely to Set New RecordThe Q2 earnings season, which has crossed the half-way mark already, reconfirms the positive earnings picture that emerged as a result of the preceding reporting cycle. With results from 286 S&P 500 members out as of Jul 28, total earnings are up +11.3% from the same period last year on +6.1% higher revenues, with 74.5% beating EPS estimates and 69.2% beating revenue estimates.Total Q2 earnings for the index are currently expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on +5.0% higher revenues. At the start of the quarter, the expectation was for earnings growth of +7.9%, which came down as the quarter unfolded, reaching as low as +5.6% just ahead of the start of the reporting season.Since plenty of results are still to come, the actual Q2 earnings growth could very well go above +10%, which will follow the +13.3% earnings growth in the preceding quarter. The deceleration in Q2 earnings growth notwithstanding, the quarter’s earnings tally is on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record, surpassing the 2016 Q4 level, as you can see in the chart below. (Read: Q2 Earnings Season Past the Halfway Mark)FOMC MinutesMinutes of June 13-14 Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released during the first week of the month. Minutes showed that “several” officials supported paring back of Fed’s $4 trillion-plus bond portfolio within a “couple of months”.Meanwhile, several Fed officials raised concerns over the impact of Fed’s policy measures on financial markets. Officials indicated willingness to hike key interest rates further this year despite recent soft readings on inflation. Even though inflation is still short of central bank's target of 2%, Fed officials believe inflation will reach its targeted level by 2018.Fed Leaves Rates UnchangedThe Fed opted to leave interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Jul 26. The Fed maintained the benchmark lending rate and hinted that it will start trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in ""relatively soon"". Market watchers believe that such language indicates that the Fed will begin the process of unwinding in September. Additionally, the central bank’s statement dropped the word “somewhat” from its June statement instead choosing to directly state that inflation continued to remain ""below 2%"".This only represents a slight shift but is significant because it acknowledges a negative view on one of the Fed’s key objectives. The Fed’s recognition of low inflation levels bodes well for rate-sensitive sectors.5 Star Performers for JulyI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or equal to 20%Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

Strong earnings performances from leading tech names have gone a long way toward dispelling such doubts. Meanwhile, the Fed’s call to leave rates unchanged has also been welcomed by market watchers. Economic data has also mostly been bullish.The only likely downside for stocks at this point is the Trump administration’s failure to push through its pro-growth agenda. However, given the predictability of such reverses, investors are likely to price in this factor sooner rather than later. In any case, these developments have had little material impact on the month’s proceedings. This is why gains for stocks are likely to continue in August, powered primarily by stellar second-quarter earnings numbers.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017                 From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

3176,MCD,"Farm and ranch store retailer, Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company posted earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, recording an average earnings beat of 0.9%.Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS Surprise  Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS Surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Tractor Supply will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.28, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.2%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.03 billion, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.However, we note that the stock has underperformed both the Zacks categorized Retail – Miscellaneous industry and the Retail-Wholesale sector in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 20.2%, while the Zacks categorized industry has dipped 10.8%. Meanwhile, the sector has witnessed growth of 5.6%.Factors at PlayTractor Supply has been struggling for quite some time now due to challenging economic backdrop at the agricultural and energy sectors. This has been taking a toll on consumer spending and been weighing on its top-line performance.While the company’s revenues came marginally ahead of estimate in first-quarter 2017, comps declined due to a fall in comparable transaction count and average ticket. Further, comps were hurt by soft seasonal merchandise sales, along with deflationary pressure. Moreover, its margins continue to be under pressure due to increased markdowns, higher promotional activities as well as due to rise in freight expense for consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products.Nevertheless, the company remains hopeful of the spring selling season, wherein it anticipates seasonal merchandise sales to witness some improvement. Further, its upcoming merchandise strategies and constant implementation of cross-network consumer-centric growth plans reflect its spring season prospects. Also, the company's focus on enhancement of IT systems and supply chain bode well.While the company’s growth prospects and optimism for the spring season are noteworthy, we cannot ignore the current trends in the agricultural sector and its dependence on seasons. So, let’s see if Tractor Supply’s initiatives can help it tide over the current trends.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tractor Supply is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Tractor Supply has an Earnings ESP of -2.34% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.25 is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. Further, the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3177,MCD,"Tennessee-based casual dining restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday, Inc.  is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 figures on Jul 20, after market close.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsRuby Tuesday has incurred losses in five out of the last seven quarters. Meanwhile, higher labor costs and other expenses related to initiatives are expected to take a toll on the company’s profits in the to-be-reported quarter as well. In fact, guest traffic is also threatened by the persistent softness in the casual dining industry and attractive discount offered by its competitors.Nonetheless, Ruby Tuesday is aggressively pursuing brand transformation initiatives. From new menu items to limited time offers and executing marketing campaigns, the company is leaving no stone unturned to satisfy customers and return to profits.Notably, the company’s “fresh start” initiatives – Fresh New Menu, Fresh New Garden Bar, and Fresh Experience – are also expected to have gained further momentum in the fiscal fourth quarter and more favorably impact the quarter’s traffic and comps.The company particularly anticipates its Garden Bar initiative to boost traffic greatly, given its uniqueness that makes it a key competitive differentiator for the brand. Moreover, its Fresh Experience is expected to aid in enhancing service and overall guest experience.Stocks to ConsiderAccording to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key factors – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.

3178,MCD,"The second-quarter earnings season is expected to be strong, with the S&P 500 index anticipated to see earnings growth of 5.6% and revenue growth of 4.5%, per the latest Earnings Trends. The stock market is also at record levels. However, the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical risks, Fed-related uncertainty, and lofty valuation could bring some difficulties for stocks this season (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).  While five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to post double-digit earnings growth, six sectors would lag. Plus, the current earnings estimate is down from 7.9% projected at the start of the second quarter. Amid such volatility, investors should focus on ETFs with large allocations to stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release. This could result in a winning bet this earnings season.How to Find ETFs?Handpicking ETFs with a portfolio of stocks that are most likely to beat on earnings is no mean task. However, our proprietary methodology of finding out the Earnings ESP of stocks by calculating the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is a solid building block.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Betting on ETFs with the winning combination of stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) would lead to profits in investor portfolios.

Then, we narrowed down the list by selecting the group of stocks with higher positive Earnings ESP. Accordingly, we chose three ETFs, which contain few stocks with higher chances of beating estimates in a particular industry (see: all the ETF Categories here).Our research shows that for the stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.

It is pretty well spread out across various securities as each holds less than 5.6% of total assets.

3179,MCD,"The Q2 earnings season has started off on an encouraging note with multiple companies reporting better earnings and revenue growth compared with the last few quarters.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 97 S&P 500 members that have reported results (as of Jul 21) are up 8.4% from the year-ago period, courtesy of a 5.1% rise in revenues. Notably, 78.4% of the companies that have posted their quarterly numbers have surpassed earnings estimates, while 72.2% have exceeded top-line expectations.Restaurant Stocks in FocusThe restaurant industry belongs to the broader Retail-Wholesale sector and the space is expected to deliver mixed performance this earnings season. Overall Q2 earnings for the sector are expected to be down 0.2% year over year, though revenues are expected to rise 3.9%.It is to be noted that the restaurant industry’s sales trends in recent quarters have been very challenging, given soft consumer spending on dining out, which has resulted in low consumption. Declining comps due to sluggish traffic trends along with rising costs, are thus taking the sheen out of restaurant companies. Nevertheless, the to-be-reported quarter is set to witness improvement over the recent quarters, given improving economic indicators, such as growing income and solid employment numbers.Evidently, on one hand, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales (comps) for the restaurant industry as a whole, per TDn2K’s Black Box Intelligence. On the other hand, the quarter posted the best results for the industry since the second quarter of 2016.Notably, besides improving economic conditions, easy year-over-year comparisons also seem to have aided the results.Thus, though the overall scenario is still bordering on the negative and the earnings picture also seems to be less enticing, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are likely to continue exhibiting strength even in a not-so-favorable environment, and are expected to fare well this earnings season. Three restaurant companies are set to report their second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25. Will these companies manage to put up a decent performance? Let’s take a look at what might be in store for these companies:McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 11.36%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last eleven quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 7.01%.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteNotably, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is likely for McDonald's this time around. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients – a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.For the quarter, McDonald’s has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line is pegged at $1.62. Global comps at McDonald’s have been positive for the last seven quarters, marking a trend that is likely to continue in Q2 as well. Still, soft industry growth could somewhat hurt sales, whereas negative currency translation might dent the quarter’s profits (read more: McDonald's Buckles Up for Q2 Earnings: A Beat in Store?).Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) came up with a positive earnings surprise of 25.00% in the last quarter.

3180,MCD,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25%. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 8.59%.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsChipotle’s new brand-management efforts, along with various sales-building initiatives like menu innovation, simplification of restaurant operations and increased brand marketing should aid in improving guest experience and reinstate customer affinity for the Chipotle brand. This, in turn, might drive its top- and bottom–line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, Chipotle claims to be the only national restaurant brand to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in its ingredients. The company’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone is thus expected to aid in bringing back health-conscious customers and improving sales in the quarter.Meanwhile, the rollout of “Smarter Pickup Times” technology in all its restaurants that offer digital ordering is anticipated to further drive sales as it improves the digital ordering experience.However, costs associated with marketing and promotional initiatives to connect with its customers, implementation of food safety measures and higher labor expenses are likely to continue thwarting the quarter’s profitability.In fact, during the first-quarter conference call, management declared that they expect a short supply environment for avocados that will add 40 basis points (bps) to the company’s food costs in the to-be-reported quarter. Furthermore, marketing and promotional activities are expected to total about 3.6% to 3.7% of sales in the quarter, due to the brand’s national TV campaign.Additionally, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is expected to limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Chipotle this quarter.

The upside reflects stronger operating performance and G&A savings across all the segments.

Notably, at constant currency, earnings grew 21% year over year.Revenues of $6.05 billion declined 3% year over year, mainly due to the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative. At constant currency, the figure declined 2%. However, the same surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of nearly $6 billion by nearly 1%.McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteBehind the Headlines NumbersIn the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 8.9% to $3.57 billion.

Moreover, comps growth was higher than the last quarter’s increase of 4%.Segment DetailsEffective Jul 1, 2015, McDonald's began reporting results under four segments: U.S. (the company's largest segment), International Lead Markets (mature markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K.), High-Growth Markets (markets that have high restaurant expansion and franchising potential such as China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands) and Foundational Markets (the remaining markets in McDonald's system).U.S.: Comps grew 3.9% in the second quarter, given the expansion of the national cold beverage value promotion and the launch of the Signature Crafted premium sandwich platform. Notably, this segment continues to build momentum as it executes strategic menu, value and convenience initiatives to attract customers. Moreover, comps growth was better than the prior quarter rise of 1.7%.Segment operating income also increased 5% on the back of higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars, G&A savings and higher gains on sales of restaurants.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 6.3%, higher than the 2.8% rise witnessed in the last quarter. Continued momentum in the U.K., robust performance in Canada and Germany, and upbeat results across all other markets, drove comps.Operating income was up 8%, including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. At constant currency, the figure was up 13%, primarily on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars.High-Growth Markets: Comps grew 7%, much better than the prior-quarter’s 3.8% increase, led by strong performance in China as well as positive results across the entire segment.The segment's operating income rose 28% (in constant currencies as well). Notably, about half of the increase came on the back of lower depreciation expense due to the accounting treatment associated with the pending sale of the China and the Hong Kong businesses.Foundational Markets: Comps in Foundational Markets grew 13%, faring better than the 10.7% growth in the last quarter. Operating income rose considerably primarily owing to strong results in Japan, along with solid performance across the segment's other geographic regions.

"
3195,MCD,"Providing a certain measure of relief to the market was the Labor Department's report on wholesale prices, which dropped .9% last month, almost twice as much as the expected .5%. The lower reading is a reaction to the recent dip in energy prices and a much welcomed reprieve from the recent trend higher, but most inflationary readings are still high on a historical basis.

3223,MCD,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), alias AB InBev, is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27.  Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 26%.In fact, AB InBev has reported negative surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 29.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price and EPS Surprise  Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price and EPS Surprise | Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether AB InBev will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.14, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $14.5 billion, up 33.9% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized Beverages – Alcohol industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have inched up 0.8%, while the Zacks categorized industry grew 3.3%.Factors at PlayAB InBev is on track with the integration of the recently acquired brewing giant SABMiller. The company is currently in the process of divesting SABMiller assets that it promised as part of the merger deal. Despite the divestitures, this combined mega-brewing company still holds the top spot in the beer industry, controlling about one-thirds of the global beer market. This behemoth accounts for nearly 30% of global beer sales and 46% of global beer profits. Further, we laud AB InBev’s robust growth endeavors that have enabled it to maintain its world’s largest brewer status.However, the company has reported dismal earnings for five straight quarters now. In the last reported quarter, the company’s results were significantly hurt by a disappointing Brazilian performance, which in turn was marred by difficult consumer trends and unfavorable currency movements. Negative foreign currency translations were responsible for the 38.4% increase in AB InBev’s cost of sales in the quarter.Further, management anticipates cost of sales to escalate in 2017 due to lingering currency woes, along with growth of premium brands. This remains a threat for the bottom line. Additionally, a tough macroeconomic environment and volatility in some of the core regions remain concerns for the company, given its consumer-driven business.While management expects great volatility in some of its core regions, it still projects revenues growth in 2017 to be backed by robust growth of global brands and its commercial plans. That said, let’s wait and see if AB InBev’s steady growth efforts can aid in reviving performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that AB InBev is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. AB InBev has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.14 per share. While the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

3224,MCD,"Shares of Minneapolis-based restaurant chain, Buffalo Wild Wings Inc. , have declined 20.9% year to date against the Zacks categorized Retail–Restaurants industry’s gain of 10.7%.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Buffalo Wild Wings’ current quarter earnings has moved down 5.4%, reflecting three downward revisions versus none upward, over the last 60 days. Also, current year earnings estimates have decline 2%, on the back of four downward revisions versus no upward revision. This testifies the flinching confidence that analysts have in the company. In fact, this bearish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and why we fear that the company might continue to disappoint in the near term.Let’s take an in-depth look at the factors that have hampered the stock’s momentum and are behind the slump:Challenging Macro EnvironmentOver the last few quarters, the U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing for investors. Despite economic growth, somewhat lower energy prices and higher income, consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out, which resulted in low consumption.Thus, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the first quarter of 2017 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood. Consequently, Buffalo Wild Wings’ sales have also come under pressure.In fact, the company’s revenues have been lagging the consensus estimate for the past nine quarters. Though the company posted positive comps last quarter, it mostly struggled with comps growth all through 2016. Notably, the menu price increases made by the company, along with the prevailing challenging restaurant environment might affect traffic trends in the near term, thereby weighing on the comps.Cost IssuesOf late, there has been substantial fluctuation in the traditional chicken wing price – a key ingredient for the company – which has put Buffalo Wild Wings’ margins under pressure. In fact, the company expects traditional chicken wing prices to rise in the range of 8% to 10% in 2017, which is likely to dampen profits.Additionally, the company’s promotion of Half-Price Wing Tuesdays puts further pressure on its cost of sales as the high priced wings items are offered at lower prices. In fact, in the first quarter of 2017, the increase in this promotion mix had an adverse impact of 37 cents on the company’s earnings per share (EPS). Thus, the company is aggressively evaluating other offers in place of this promotion in a bid to protect its margins. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen if other promotions could boost traffic the way Half-Price Wing Tuesdays did for the company.Meanwhile, costs related to company’s other sales boosting initiatives, like unit expansion and higher labor costs owing to the competitive labor market are estimated to continue to hurt profits in the near term.In fact, Buffalo Wild Wings’ earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight of the last ten quarters due to higher costs.Pressure From Activist InvestorActivist investor, Marcato Capital Management, which holds about a 9.9% stake in the company, is becoming increasingly powerful within it. In fact, the firm has been pushing the company to bring about changes at the board and management levels, and also improve food quality and service.Particularly, the firm had been agitating for Buffalo Wild Wings CEO, Sally Smith’s removal, who has finally announced her retirement from the position before the end of 2017. Moreover, in May 2017, Marcato acquired three seats on the nine-member strong board of directors of Buffalo Wild Wings. It is to be noted that the firm has also pushed Buffalo Wild Wings to franchise about 90% of its locations by 2020, in a bid to save costs.This continual pressure from Macrato has thus further compounded the woes for this restaurant company.Is There a Ray of Hope?However, we laud the company’s various innovative initiatives like menu innovation, promotional offerings, roll-out of loyalty program and delivery, enhancement of digital capabilities, along with international expansion that should aid in driving sales.Additionally, Buffalo Wild Wings has decided to give something new a shot this summer and test small-format stores in the Minneapolis metro area. Given consumers increasing drift toward to-go and in-home dining experiences, the company is experimenting with these small, fast food style stores. It is thus set to open two pilot restaurants, named B-Dubs Express, which will be an order and pick up at the counter concept, serving the chain’s chicken wing-filled menu while sports play on TV.Meanwhile, the company has undergone a thorough review of its cost structure in a bid to improve efficiencies in labor, organizational structure as well as third-party expend. Based on the review, it has come up with a strategic plan to realize savings worth $40 to $50 million in restaurant level expenses and G&A by the end of 2018, which will result in improved margins.Bottom LineWhile Buffalo Wild Wings’ growth initiatives and the new business ventures seem to be encouraging, only time will tell that how successful they turn out to be.At the moment, the shake up on top amid continued stock volatility, sales declines and negative estimate revisions, suggests that there may be more trouble down the road.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in this sector include Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report), Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) and McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report). While Dave & Buster's and Red Robin sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), McDonald's carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Dave & Buster's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 30.50%. Meanwhile, for fiscal 2017, EPS is projected to witness a rise of 23.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Red Robin’s 2017 earnings climbed 7%, over the past 60 days. Moreover, the company’s trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a positive 17.27%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's 2017 earnings moved up 0.6%, over the past 60 days.

Further, it is focused on these plans to take advantage of growth opportunities, consequently enhancing profitability.Moreover, the company continues to progress well with savings programs, as both, Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program, and Funding the Growth undertakings are delivering impressive results. These initiatives contributed significantly to margin expansion in first-quarter 2017.However, the company’s sales trend remains soft largely due to unfavorable currency movements. The company lagged sales estimates in 15 out of the past 16 quarters. Moreover, adverse currency and a tough global environment are likely to impact 2017 results. Nonetheless, organic sales are anticipated to improve sequentially throughout the year.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Colgate is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Colgate has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 72 cents. While the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

(CAT  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +11.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.Whole Foods Market Inc.  currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.94% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3237,MCD,"Barring a few hiccups, the U.S. stock market has displayed a decent run in an economy that witnessed a rise in the benchmark interest rate, recorded sharp rise in U.S. factory activity in June, saw oil prices lose ground and encountered political gridlock. We note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 has gained 9.1%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has surged 16.3% so far in the year.The buoyant market provides an ideal opportunity to boost your portfolio by adding growth stocks. These are generally hot and flourishing stocks with earnings growth potential. Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors, we are focusing on Retail-Wholesale. The sector has gained 14.3% so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 index.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers. On the other hand, steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration offer a perfect background to drive consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales in the current retail landscape that is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping.As a result, retailers are now concentrating more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) is one of those retailers who are making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel and strengthening partnership with vendors. The company also launched a fresh strategy called “Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue” to explore and pursue growth opportunities and optimize cost with focus on key areas.These initiatives have led shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company 25% higher year-to-date. The stock has outpaced the Zacks categorized Retail-Consumer Electronic industry’s gain of 20%. We believe this retailer of technology products, services, and solutions with long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8% and a Growth Score of “B” appears a lucrative option.3 Other Prominent Growth PicksHere we have highlighted three other Retail/Wholesale stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of “A” or “B.” These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results.

"
3239,MCD,"Lehman Brothers Inc. (LEH) spooked the market when word spread that the troubled investment bank's negotiations with Korea Development Bank had stalled.

Lehman shares were down more than 40% on the day. 
"
3240,MCD,"The downtrend in the overall market and financial sector was hastened by American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), as investors speculated that the world's largest insurer would also need to raise more capital to protect itself from exposure to mortgage related assets. AIG has already posted $20 billion in losses over the last three quarters and raised $20 billion in new capital.

"
3257,MCD,"The backbone of the quarter was in the company's global sales, which increased 7.4%. Europe and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa each saw double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Europes revenues rose 23% (11% in constant currencies) led by France, the U.

"
3266,MCD,"The New Year Shift
"
3267,MCD,"With the new year, we turn our attention to 2008 and 2009 from 2007 and 200 and the tables will be significantly different from those of weeks past. In our system, the fiscal year is determined on if the year has been completed, not if it has been reported. Thus 2007 is now FY(0) and 2008 is now FY(1).
"
3268,MCD,"The total number of estimates for 2009 is still thin, and the number of estimate revisions is even thinner. Thus, dont put too much emphasis on the 2009 data yet. Also realize that the changes in growth rates you will see over the coming weeks will be as much a reflection of new estimates being added as changes in existing estimates.
"
3269,MCD,"Earnings Scorecard and Median Growth Rates
"
3270,MCD,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is off to a mixed start. Positive surprises are out numbering disappointments by just over 2:1, which is a little bit behind the normal 3:1 margin. The median surprise is a healthy 3.36%. The median year-over-year growth rate is 6.98%, which is well behind the double-digit median growth rates we have been accustom to for the last five years.
"
3271,MCD,"It is still very early, with less than 5.0% of firms reporting, and the sample of fourth-quarter earnings is hardly representative. Five sectors have yet to have any firms report.
"
3272,MCD,"Among those that do have reports in, Tech looks terrific with median year-over-year growth of 29.7%. That number should come down significantly as the reporting season wears on as the remaining firms have a median expected growth rate of 14.3%. Still, that sort of growth is better than a sharp stick in the eye, and should be good enough for silver in the median year-over-year growth race. On the other hand, the Financials would probably prefer the sharp stick in the eye. The median earnings growth is -141.5%, indicating that more than half the reporting firms have moved from positive earnings in a year ago to a loss this year. That number should get better as reporting season continues, but is still likely to be anemic at best when all is said and done. The median expected year-over-year growth for the remaining firms in the sector is just 2.7%, and the estimates are falling fast.
"
3273,MCD,"Energy should be the top performing sector on a median growth rate basis with 19.0% growth anticipated. Tech and Industrials are predicted to take the silver and bronze with growth rates of 14.3% and 13.5%, respectively. Utilities and Health Care should make it over the double-digit threshold as well with 12.8% and 10.8% growth, respectively. Materials, Telecom and Consumer Discretionary are expected to be the weakest on a median growth rate basis.

"
3275,MCD,"On a total net income basis, the fourth quarter can be summed up in a single word: UGLY. Total net income reported so far is 18.2% below year ago levels. However it very much looks like a tale of two markets, with Tech doing well and Financials doing awful. The Financials total net income is 38.0% below year ago levels, and based on the expectations of the yet to report firms (-55.4%), should deteriorate further. Telecom will lead the pack but that is artificially boosted by the AT&T/Bell South merger a year ago.
"
3276,MCD,"Technology total income should come down slightly from the 22.9% growth reported so far, based on the 19.8% growth expected for those yet to report. Energy and Health Care dont have any firms which have reported yet, but should turn in double-digit total net income growth performances of 14.9% and 11.4%, respectively.
"
3277,MCD,"While at first glance, looking at the yet to be reported group (the vast majority of firms), a decline of 8.5% in total earnings looks bleak, keep in mind just how concentrated the declines are. If just Financials are excluded, expected total net income growth jumps to positive growth of 7.2%. Given the importance of the Financials to both the market and to the overall economy, that may be a little akin to asking: ""Aside from that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play,"" but it does help put things into perspective. If one goes one step further and excludes the Consumer Discretionary sector, which is being hammered by some of the effects of the consumer credit crunch and a very promotional Christmas season, the overall growth rate in total net income jumps to the double digits at 10.8%. Looking forward to the first quarter, many of the same trends are in place, albeit in a more muted fashion with significant weakness expected among the Financials and the Discretionary firms and significant strength in Technology and Energy.

"
3279,MCD,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
3280,MCD,"The revisions ratio for 2008 is 0.56, indicating nearly two estimate cuts for every increase. The total number of revisions over the last four weeks was slightly lower than it was last week (three weeks of overlap) largely due to the holidays. As earnings season gets into full swing over the next few weeks the totals will climb significantly from current levels.
"
3281,MCD,"By far the sector that is faring the worst is the Financials where cuts outnumber increases by almost 10:1. In fact, the Financial sector accounts for 47% of all the estimate cuts for 2008. Put another way, the revisions ratio for the rest of the S&P 500 is 0.95, which is very much in the neutral range.
"
3282,MCD,"The revisions ratios for the Materials and Utilities sectors were also ugly at 0.24 and 0.30 respectively, however the total number of revisions for those two sectors was very light, which means that the picture is not quite as bleak as it appears at first glance.
"
3283,MCD,"The Consumer Discretionary sector was also weak with almost two cuts for every increase, and that on a much more robust total number of estimate revisions. Just three firms, AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) accounted for 41% of all upward revisions in the sector however. Note that the ratio of firms with rising estimates to falling estimates confirms the weak numbers for the sectors with weak revisions ratios.
"
3284,MCD,"Only two sectors were showing substantial strength, Energy and Staples. Both had a reasonably robust total number of revisions.  The reason for the strength in Energy is clear enough: $100/barrel. For Staples it appears that much of the strength comes from the grocery stores where higher food prices are helping profitability.

3286,MCD,"The first peak at 2009 revisions shows that analysts are already revising their estimates downward on balance for the year, although not at the same rate they are doing so for 2008. As with 2008, Energy and the defensive Health Care and Staples sectors are doing well while the picture for the Financials looks bleak. However, the total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is just 600 (250 up and 350 down) and the numbers for some of the individual sectors are very light. If this holds up, the go heavy on Energy and light on Financials play that was so profitable in 2007 looks like it will work again in 2008.

"
3288,MCD,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3289,MCD,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
3290,MCD,"Despite their current problems, the Financials still have a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials will account for 22.7% of the total net income for the S&P 500. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is the cheapest on a P/E basis, it is still the second largest overall influence on the market. For many years it was clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Just within the last moth it lost that spot to the Tech sector. Based on 2007 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of only 12.5x and based on 2008, only 10.4x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
3291,MCD,"Energy is the second largest sector based on total earnings, both for 2007 (15.6%) or 2008 (15.2%), but is a fairly distant third when it comes to total market capitalization (and thus weight in the index) at 12.8%. On a P/E basis, Energy is the second cheapest sector at 13.7x for 2007 and 12.2x for 2008.
"
3292,MCD,"Much has changed during 2007, and it is likely that much will also change in 2008 as well. At the start of 2007, the Financials represented 21.9% of the S&P 500 total market capitalization and were expected to provide 26.9% of the total earnings. In other words the sector has lost 4.92% of ""market cap share"" in just one year, and 4.16% of 2007 ""earnings share"".
"
3293,MCD,"For perspective, the whole Utilities sector currently comprises just 3.53% of market capitalization and 3.30% of 2007 earnings. Energy on the other hand has seen its share of the market capitalization of the index rise 3.80% share points.
"
3294,MCD,"Clearly the Financials are a big influence on the market, comprising 17.1% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. The credit crunch and mortgage woes have had an effect on the sector. At the beginning of 2007, it comprised 21.9% of the market capitalization of the index. The Financials sector is relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be a big influence on the market, since they contribute 22.3% of the total expected earnings for 2007 and 23.2% of the expected earnings for 2008.  However, at the start of the year, Financials represented 26.9% of the expected earnings for 2007. The Financials are the cheapest sector in the market followed Energy on a P/E basis. However, given recent events in the credit markets there have to be serious questions about how real the earnings are for many of the firms in the sector. Given the pace of estimate cuts, look for the actual total earnings to be significantly less than is currently forecast.
"
3295,MCD,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the 12.4% of the total market capitalization of the index. It is expected to contribute 15.2% of the total earnings in 2007 and 14.7% in 2008. At the beginning of the year Energy was just 9.0% of the total market capitalization of the index. Tech on the other hand represents 17.4% of the total market capitalization, but only 12.5% of the 2007, and 13.2% of the 2008 total earnings. Tech recently dethroned Financials as the biggest sector in the market, a position it has not held since the height of the dotcom bubble. Energy last held the title back in the late 1970s.
"
3296,MCD,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 13.6x 2007 and 12.1x 2008 earnings. The Financials are trading for 12.7x 2007 and 10.6x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 16.6x and 14.3x, respectively. Tech continues to be the most expensive sector trading at 22.9x and 18.9x 2007 and 2008 earnings, respectively. Based on 2008 expectations the P/E for the overall market translates to an earnings yield of 6.9%, which is far more attractive than the 3.86% level available on a 10 year T-Note. The note however has been helped by a flight to quality. The yield on 10-year AA corporates is at 5.33%. Still, equities look much more attractive than bonds on this basis. However, keep in mind that these earning are after several years of very robust growth and corporate profits are near a record high percentage of GDP. If firms were to return to more normal levels of profitability, they would be much less attractively valued. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2008 P/E ratios.

3308,MCD,"Share repurchases were still very significant in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year (the data is not out yet for the second quarter) and the reduction in share count also boosts EPS growth.
"
3309,MCD,"Currency translation gains will be less of a factor this quarter due to the rebound in the dollar. However, the strong overseas demand that the previously very weak dollar stimulated will still prove to be a boost to the earnings of many firms. The delay is because in the third quarter they will be shipping goods ordered previously. Given both the rebound in the dollar and the very significant economic slowdown abroad, look for the export boom to fade in the fourth quarter and into 2009.

"
3311,MCD,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. With smaller totals for any given sector than the S&P 500 over all, the ratio should be farther away from 1.0 to be truly significant. However, for the sake of consistency, we refer to readings above 1.25 as being in positive territory and below 0.80 as being in negative territory.

3313,MCD,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E. The P/Es are calculated as the total Market Capitalization of the sector divided by the total expected earnings for the sector.

"
3317,MCD,"Zacks Put/Call Ratio Greater than 1.0 filter . This filter today brought out a ticker that drew my attention: MCD, which is the ticker for fast-food Goliath  McDonalds  ( MCD ).  
"
3318,MCD,"First, a word about the put/call open interest ratio, which is simply the ratio of total put open interest to total call open interest. We compute the Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) based on open interest in the front three months only. These near-term options tend to attract a more speculative crowd, the sentiment of which is more useful for shorter-term trading. 
"
3319,MCD,"Before we dive any deeper into technicals and sentiment for MCD, a little background is in order.  What is the filter? Well, lets first define a put and a call. A put is simply a bet that the underlying stock is going to move lower, while a call is a bet that the underlying stock is going to move higher. According to our Expectational Analysis® methodology, heavy attention paid to puts by investors indicates an increase in pessimism toward an equity, and can present the opportunity for a solid bullish addition to your portfolio.  
"
3320,MCD,"As mentioned above, we at Schaeffer's are contrarian-based investors, indicating that we want to see skepticism toward an outperforming stock.  On the other hand, we typically like to see optimism toward an underperformer.  In our eyes, too much optimism is a sign that nearly everyone who wants to invest in a particular stock already has.  Just because a stock sees substantial optimism doesnt mean that we will blindly short that particular security; we need to see some negative price action or a major catalyst for a downside move in order to pull the trigger in most cases.  Other indicators we use to measure overall sentiment include short interest, magazine cover stories, media comments, and analyst ratings.  
"
3321,MCD,"Approximately one month ago, McDonalds Schaeffers put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) rested at 1.13. In other words, put and call open interest were relatively even. It seems, however, that since then the discrepancy between put and call open interest has widened dramatically. Currently, call open interest rests at 74,304, while put open interest docks at 222,443; this configuration leaves the SOIR standing at 2.99, higher than 100% of all other readings over the last year. Basically, this means that bearish options betters regarding MCD nearly triple their bullish counterparts.  
"
3322,MCD,"So, why the huge drop-off all of a sudden? Well, the gap (more like the Grand Canyon) doesnt necessarily seem to come from a stampede of bearish options players, rather than a depletion of bullish options betters. From November 12 to November 13, call open interest decreased by more than 100,000, while put open interest remained virtually unscathed. My first thought was that the options expired, but the November expiration date wasnt until later in the week. The majority of the news for the security seemed to be positive, as McDonalds reported a 5.4% increase in same-store sales for the month. Finally, after further review and some New York Jets-esque investigating from my colleagues,  it seems the hacking of call open interest around November 12 could be attributed to options traders most likely closing out existing dividend-capture trades. Eureka!   
"
3323,MCD,"Technically speaking, McDonalds has seen an approximate 50% increase in the past year. With the exception of a rough patch in August, the shares have managed to ride support from their 10-week and 20-week averages. In fact, MCD today reached a new annual high of $60.77.   
"
3324,MCD,"Despite the highest SOIR in a year, there seems to be excessive optimism on the Street. Currently, analysts polled by Zacks rank MCD with a whopping nine strong buy ratings and three buy ratings, compared to only three hold ratings and no sell ratings. This configuration leaves ample room for downgrades, as any scent of negative news in the air could send the bulls scrambling. Adding to the bullishness, short interest in the equity decreased by almost 19% from a month ago, indicative of hopeful investor sentiment.   
"
3325,MCD,"Is MCD overrated? Only time will tell. If the equity can manage to stay atop its moving averages and keep up its endurance, we could see the blue-chip continue its uptrend.  
"
3326,MCD,"Make sure to continue utilizing all of the valuable filters on these pages for more money-making ideas.  Moreover, don't be afraid to make a few paper trades in order to see what strategy works best for you.  Please remember that, when it comes to options, the majority of your trades are going to be losers. Don't get discouraged, because that's the beauty of the leverage that options provide. It takes only a few winners out of every 10 trades to make you a very happy investor. Thanks for reading, best of luck in your trading!

3339,MCD,"It was mainly Wabtecs (WAB  -  Free Report) loss of 13% that caused the Focus List to lag todays market. There was no specific news item driving the share price slide and high volume. However, the overall global economy concerns had to have had an impact on Fridays trading action.

"
3375,MCD,"The shift away from financial earnings could, ironically, hurt the market because less bad news is priced into companies from most other sectors. (Homebuilders, and to a lesser extent retailers, are the notable exception.) Brokerage analysts expect average earnings growth from the S&P 500 companies reporting next week to be 3.5%. (The median growth rate is higher at 8%).

3376,MCD,"For the nine Dow components on the calendar, the average expected growth rate is -0.9% and the median is 6.3%. Not bad numbers, but also not the stuff that rallies are made of.

3378,MCD,"First-Quarter Earnings
"
3379,MCD,"As of Thursday evening, about 20% of the companies within the S&P 500 have reported first-quarter earnings. Positive earnings surprises are outnumbering negative earnings surprises by a margin of 2.2:1, which is actually worse than the recent sentiment would have investors believe.
"
3380,MCD,"Growth remains a matter of perception. Median per share earnings growth is running at a brisk 8.6%. Median net income growth, however, is a nominal 1.6%. Average earnings per share and average net income are both down by more than 27%.
"
3381,MCD,"Out of the 20 companies with the biggest declines in year-over-year net income, 16 are either in the financial or construction sector. The four exceptions are Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), The New York Times (NYT  -  Free Report), Alcoa (AA) and International Game Technology (IGT). These companies have posted year-over-year declines of 40% or more.

"
3384,MCD,"Utilities may seem too conservative for many traders, but shares of American Electric Power (AEP) have moved higher after the previous earnings surprises - providing an opportunity for short-term profits. A recent revision by one of the covering brokerage analysts suggests the electric utility could again surprise to the upside. The current first-quarter consensus earnings estimate of 75 cents per share is three cents higher than average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 88 cents per share. American Electric Power is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, before the start of trading.
"
3385,MCD,"Record oil and natural gas prices are benefiting companies with exposure to the upstream side of the business, particularly exploration and production (E&P). This is why brokerage analysts have raised their first-quarter profit forecasts on EnCana (ECA  -  Free Report) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days.
"
3386,MCD,"During the past 30 days, positive revisions by three brokerage analysts have boosted the first-quarter consensus earnings estimate on EnCana to $1.23 per share, from $1.17 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.25 per share. ECA has exceeded expectations for four consecutive quarters. EnCana is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Apr 22, before the start of trading.
"
3387,MCD,"The current consensus earnings estimate for OXY of $1.90 per share is 27 cents higher than the average forecast of a month ago and reflects positive revisions from half of the 14 covering brokerage analysts. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at $1.95 per share. OXY has exceeded expectations for five consecutive quarters. Occidental Petroleum is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, before the start of trading.
"
3388,MCD,"Western Digital's (WDC  -  Free Report) newly announced stock repurchase plan won't have any impact on first-quarter results, but brokerage analysts remain optimistic about the company's performance. Revisions by two analysts have pushed the first-quarter consensus earnings estimate a penny higher to $1.09 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.12 per share. The storage device maker has exceeded expectations for 13 out of the past 14 quarters. Western Digital is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, after the close of trading.

Brokerage analysts have noticed, however, and they have reacted by cutting their forecasts on Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report). The current first-quarter consensus estimate calls for a loss of four cents per share; two months ago, analysts had expected breakeven results. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at a loss of five cents per share. POOL has missed expectations during three out of the last four quarters. Pool Corp is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 24, before the start of trading.

"
3396,MCD,"High commodity prices have taken a big bite out of the restaurants industry.  Stocks were performing well at the beginning of the year, but are currently down -20% to -25% from their 52-week highs, on average.  But a good management team and a hot concept can go a long way even during unfavorable circumstances.  If investors do their homework and consult analysts, the restaurants industry can continue to provide sustenance to their portfolios.  The space enjoys a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.87 at the moment, which places it 73rd out of more than 200 companies.  
"
3397,MCD,"The restaurants industry is in the business of meeting the primal needs of the public, said 5-Star analyst Dean Haskell of JMP Securities.  If a company is able to meet those needs, it will be successful, even if the industry isnt much help.  For this reason, Haskell believes that a solid management team is the most important aspect of a restaurant company.  Good management is able to give its customers what they want while keeping a sharp eye out for where the industry is moving.  The ability to spot an opportunity or emerging trend, and the resourcefulness to take advantage of it, can make the difference between a solid investment and a risky venture.  One can bet the restaurants that first picked up on the growing obesity concerns and low-carb craze made their investors very happy.  
"
3398,MCD,"A good management team leads toward another crucial aspect of a solid restaurant company; namely the concept.  In fact, the concept is a direct extension of management, because the team consistently attempts to make sure the concept is working and appeals to customers.  At the moment, Haskell is looking towards companies like Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ: CAKE ) and Wendys (NYSE: WEN ), among others.  These companies have good menus, clean spaces, and fast, friendly service.  Equally as important, at least to the investor, is their predictable return on capital.
"
3399,MCD,"As mentioned earlier, high commodity prices stunted a solid beginning for the year.  Management teams have attempted to combat the problem by raising prices, and luckily the move has not scared away customers.  However, restaurants can only raise prices sparingly; about once a quarter.  Therefore, it often takes several quarters for companies to catch up with food cost inflation.  
"
3400,MCD,"At the moment, same-store sales are slowing, but remain positive, while operating margin is under pressure and new unit development is accelerating.  Haskell says that these are the three important technical factors to look at in the space.  So while the industry is challenged at the moment, there is opportunity for investors willing to stay selective.  Analysts can help you to find the truly innovative management companies, and also point out some of the emerging trends that can make a particular stock a very good investment.  If your portfolio is starved for profit, you might want to try placing an order with the restaurants industry. What Do the All Stars Recommend?

3402,MCD,"Below are the top stocks recommended by the most 5-Star analysts in the restaurants industry.Panera Bread Company  (NASDAQ: PNRA ) owns and franchises bakery-cafes under the Panera Bread and Saint Louis Bread Company names.  Although the company raised a few eyebrows when it adjusted its 2004 earnings per diluted share target downward, the All Stars werent frightened away as many believe that this growing companys problems are temporary.  In fact, with four recommendations, Panera Bread has more All Stars in its corner than any other company in the restaurants industry.  Earlier this month, the company reported second quarter earnings of $0.21 per diluted share, which was +11% better than last years $0.19.  It also matched the consensus, and marked the 18th consecutive quarter of earnings per share that either met or topped Wall Street expectations.  Company and franchisee revenues advanced +31% and +24% respectively from year-ago levels, while system-wide comparable bakery-café sales rose +1.9%.  Panera Bread opened 32 new bakery-cafes during the quarter, which brought the total number to 669 by the end of that period.  The company established a development target of 150 to 160 new bakery-cafes in 2005, which would be +20% more than the number expected to be opened this year.  Looking forward to 2005, Ron Shaich, Chairman and CEO, stated, We believe as commodity prices stabilize, and the percentage change in new company bakery-café openings moderates, earnings will once again expand at a faster rate then revenue.  Many analysts believe that as well, and are expecting big things from this unique and growing restaurant company.  To further research Panera Bread Company, click PNRA .Applebees International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: APPB ) develops, franchises and operates restaurants under the Applebees Neighborhood Grill & Bar brand, the largest casual dining concept in the world.  Applebees is a favorite in its industry among analysts, as the company has made many moves over the years to improve its business.  Specifically, one analyst from Thomas Weisel Partners stated that Applebees has improved its menu offerings, enhanced convenience, leveraged its scale, maintained its unit advantage, and reduced variability in the system.  In our view, investors continue to underestimate the positive impact that these factors continue to have on the companys financial performance.  Excluding items in both periods, Applebees reported second quarter earnings of $0.36 per diluted share, vs. $0.30 in the year-ago period.  The result was almost +6% better than the consensus.  System-wide comparable sales improved +6.3%, marking an impressive 24 straight quarters of comparable sales growth.  Applebees also continues to make its menu more appetizing to its customers, as evidenced by the addition of ten Weight Watchers® items in May and the introduction of baby back ribs.  During the quarter, twelve new Applebees restaurants were opened system-wide, bringing the total to 1,612 by the end of the period.  Over 100 new restaurants are expected to open this year.  To further research Applebees International, Inc., click APPB .Ruby Tuesday, Inc.  (NYSE: RI ) has company-owned, and/or franchise Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 41 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 12 foreign countries.  Ruby Tuesday has put together 28 consecutive quarters of earnings per share at or above Wall Street expectations.  That includes its fiscal fourth  quarter result from mid-July, when the company reported diluted earnings of $0.46 per share.  The result was in-line with the consensus, and +17.9% better than last years $0.39.  Company-owned same-store sales improved by +1.3%.  Ruby Tuesdays Spring menu was rolled out in the quarter, and included some lower pricing along with Phase Two of the Ruby Tuesday Smart Eating initiative.  As we head into fiscal 2005, we now plan to invest money in advertising initiatives affecting the majority of our company-owned locations, said Sandy Beall, Chairman and CEO of Ruby Tuesday.  We believe these initiatives, among others, will enable us to continue to deliver on our longer-term goals.  Ruby Tuesday expects 50 to 55 company-owned restaurant openings during fiscal 2005, and expects its franchisees (including both domestic and international) will open 35 to 40 Ruby Tuesday restaurants during the same period.
"
3403,MCD,"Ruby Tuesday is one of the leaders in its industry when it comes to combating obesity and giving its customers healthier options.  The Smart Eating program mentioned above was launched in November 2003, and is a company-wide effort to provide menu items with the tools and information to make healthier and more informed choices.  Since the launch, Ruby Tuesday has made changes such as a switch to cooking with canola oil, and the addition of dozens of Smart Eating choices that are lower-calorie, lower-fat, or lower-carb.  Ruby Tuesday also promotes its signature salad bar.  To further research Ruby Tuesday, click RI .McDonalds Corporation  (NYSE: MCD ) develops, operates, franchises and services a worldwide system of restaurants that prepare, assemble, package and sell a limited menu of value-priced foods. The company operates primarily in the quick-service hamburger restaurant business.  The McDonalds Plan to Win strategy continues to pay off for the industry stalwart, as global comparable sales advanced +6.4% in July.  That marks the companys 15th straight quarter with a global same-store sales rise.  U.S. comparable sales advanced +7.8% in the period, demonstrating the sustainability of its Plan and the staying power of its renewed momentum.  Comparable sales in Europe improved +2.1%.  However, monthly sales are not the only area where McDonalds momentum is evident, as more customer visits and enhanced profitability helped the company put together a robust second quarter.  In late July, the company reported diluted earnings of $0.47 per share, which matched the consensus and accounted for the 12th straight quarter of earnings per share that matched or surpassed Wall Streets expectations.  The result was also up +27% (or +22% in constant currencies) from last years $0.37.  Also, revenues advanced +10% (or +7% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion in the quarter, as comparable sales improved +7.8%.  
"
3404,MCD,"Our results to date reflect the strength of our commitment to enhancing McDonalds brand relevance and improving the operational execution in our restaurants, said Charlie Bell, President and CEO of McDonalds.  As we continue through 2004, we will maintain our intense focus on delivering a superior restaurant experience to our customers.  Analysts like the results from the companys Plan, which includes focusing on People, Product, Place, Price and Promotion.  The company has more work to do, which suggests that its momentum should continue.  To further research McDonalds Corporation, click MCD .Starbucks Corporation  (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is the leading retailer, roaster and brand of specialty coffee in the world, with more than 8,000 retail locations in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim.  Starbucks is the McDonalds of coffee, so its only fitting that it too enjoys solid momentum.  Late last month, the company announced consolidated net revenues of $409 million for July, which was an increase of +27% year-over-year.  Furthermore, same-store sales improved +10%.  An analyst at WR Hambrecht & Company stated, We expect the strong comp store sales momentum to continue through the end of the year.  We continue to recommend purchases of SBUX shares based upon managements ability to sustain at least 20% sales and earnings growth, continue to rapidly grow the store base, drive international profitability, increase store volumes, and lift financial returns.  
"
3405,MCD,"For its fiscal third quarter, Starbucks reported diluted earnings of $0.24 per share on consolidated net revenues of $1.3 billion.  That earnings results topped the consensus by more than +9%, improved upon the year-ago result of $0.17, and marked the 28th straight quarter with earnings per share at or above Wall Street expectations.  Net revenues advanced +27% year-over-year from $1 billion.  Same-store sales rose +11%, which was the 150th straight month of same-store sales gains.  These quarterly results were strong enough for Starbucks to raise its full year 2004 earnings per share target.  In fact, the company said its consistently strong performance puts it in a good position to achieve its aggressive goals for fiscal 2005.  Those goals include accelerating its store development plans and opening about 1,500 new stores on a global basis.  In the U.S., it plans to open about 550 company-operated locations and 525 licensed locations.  Starbucks is a popular and growing company, so its easy to see why it has caught the attention of the All Stars.  To learn more about Starbucks Corporation, click SBUX .
"
3406,MCD,"Another week, another rate cut. The futures markets are predicting the Federal Open Market Committee (a.k.a ""the Fed"") will cut rates for the second time this month when it meets on Wednesday and Thursday. As of yesterday, Jan 24, expectations were highest for an additional 50-basis point cut, though the possibility of just a quarter-point cut is gaining steam.
"
3407,MCD,"The problems for the economy stem from a lack of available credit, and anything that can be done to encourage lending is a step in the right direction. Therefore, erring on the side of cutting rates too much is better than maintaining the fight against inflation. The stimulus can always be pulled back later in the year. If the economy does regain its footing, it would not surprise me to see rate hikes occur in the fourth quarter of this year. Let's hope that the economy regains enough strength to make my prediction about higher rates come true.

As of Thursday evening, median per share earnings growth for S&P 500 companies was 8.6%. The pace of net income growth was slightly less at 5.5%, reflecting the impact of share buybacks.
"
3415,MCD,"More companies continue to beat expectations than miss, though the number of misses remains proportionately higher than we have seen in past quarters. A total of 97 companies have beat and 42 have missed, a surprise ratio of 2.3:1.
"
3416,MCD,"The sample size remains relatively small with only 159 total reports (20 companies met expectations) and therefore the numbers should continue to change as more companies release their earnings results.
"
3417,MCD,"Earnings growth is not much different for the broader S&P Composite 1500 (S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600). Median EPS growth is running at 8.8% and median net income growth is 5.1%. The surprise ratio is 1.74:1 (172 companies beat and 99 missed).

3418,MCD,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jan 28 - Feb 1
"
3419,MCD,"Earlier this month, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) preannounced full-year 2007 adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share. Following the announcement, two of the 10 covering brokerage analysts adjusted their fourth-quarter forecasts. The revisions caused a one-cent increase in the consensus earnings estimate to 29 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 32 cents per share. CELG has topped expectations for five consecutive quarters. Celgene is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 31, before the start of trading.
"
3420,MCD,"Crude's ability to stay near $90 per barrel, and its upward march towards $100 in late December, has caused brokerage analysts to adjust their profit projections on many oil companies, including  Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report). During the past 30 days, four of the covering analysts raised their forecasts, causing a seven-cent increase in the fourth-quarter consensus estimate to $1.67 per share. The most accurate forecast is slightly more bullish at $1.68 per share. OXY has topped expectations for four consecutive quarters. Occidental Petroleum is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jan 29, before the start of trading.
"
3421,MCD,"Petro-Canada (PCZ) has topped expectations over the past three quarters by an average margin of 18 cents per share. For many of the same reasons as OXY, brokerage analysts have been raising their fourth-quarter profit projections on PCZ. Positive revisions by two of the four covering analysts have caused the fourth-quarter consensus estimate to rise 10 cents to $1.39 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.41 per share. Petro-Canada is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 31.
"
3422,MCD,"VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) beat expectations by eight cents when it reported its first quarter as a publicly-traded company last October. A recent upward revision to the fourth-quarter consensus estimate suggests a second positive surprise could be forthcoming. Within the past 30 days, one brokerage analyst raised his profit forecast, pushing the consensus estimate up one cent to 17 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 19 cents per share. VMware is scheduled to report on Monday, Jan 28, after the close of trading.
"
3423,MCD,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jan 28 - Feb 1
"
3424,MCD,"The slowing economy is just the latest headwind for YRC Worldwide (YRCW). The trucking company is also contending with high energy prices and competition from other trucking companies and rail. Therefore, it is little wonder that roughly half of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their fourth-quarter earnings estimates within the past 30 days. The consensus estimate of 55 cents is four cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is a penny lower at 54 cents per share. YRC has missed three times in just the past four quarters. YRC Worldwide is scheduled to report on Monday, Jan 28, after the close of trading.

"
3430,MCD,"The proposed merger between SAP (SAP  -  Free Report) and Business Objects (BOBJ), announced over the weekend, put the spotlight on the business intelligence software market. Among the independent companies still left standing, Cognos (COGN) is rumored to be a likely takeover target.
"
3431,MCD,"Trading on merger speculation is extremely risky, but COGN could see its shares appreciate even without an acquisition offer. The company recent reported fiscal second-quarter profits of 31 cents per share, a penny above expectations and 19% above year-ago levels. Revenues rose 10% to $252.4 million, driven in part by a 12% increase in license revenues. Gross margins widened by 200 basis points to 79.1%. The company is seeing customers standardizing on Cognos 8 and has version 8.3 in beta. (Our software analyst, Abdul Saleh, believes that version 8.3, which is currently in beta, could provide an additional catalyst for the stock.)
"
3432,MCD,"Based on the strength of its second-quarter results, COGN boosted its fiscal 2008 outlook. The company now expects revenues to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.100 billion and earnings per share to total between $1.66 to $1.76. Previously, the company had forecast revenues of $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion and earnings per share of $1.66 to $1.73. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year profit forecasts in response, sending the consensus estimate four cents higher to $1.79 per share.
"
3433,MCD,"Last week, P.F. Chang's China Bistro (PFCB) slashed its third-quarter guidance. The company said that same-store sales at its namesake restaurants and at Pei Wei decreased 1.6% and 1%, respectively, during the third quarter. (The decrease at the Bistro locations included the impact of a 2-3% price increase.) Adding to the downward pressure on the bottom line, the company also said that it incurred higher wages, repairs and restaurant supplies. As a result, PFCB expects third-quarter revenues to have totaled $270.8 million and per share earnings to be within a range of five to seven cents. Previously, the company had guided for revenues of $273 million and per share profits of above 25 cents.
"
3434,MCD,"Not surprisingly, brokerage analysts were quick to cut their full-year forecasts. The downward revisions caused an eight-cent drop in the consensus estimate to $1.26 per share.
"
3435,MCD,"PFCB's warning follows the fourth consecutive earnings miss by fast-food chain operator CKE Restaurants (CKR) and a warning by Ruby Tuesday (RT).
"
3436,MCD,"A few weeks ago, CKR reported second-quarter earnings of 18 cents per share; brokerage analysts had been expecting 20 cents per share. The company was adversely affected by both higher food prices (including beef, cheese and soft drink syrup) and higher occupancy and operating costs. The 0.4% decrease in consolidated revenues did not help earnings either. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts cut their full-forecasts in reaction to the report.
"
3437,MCD,"RT said that first-quarter same-store sales at company owned restaurants plunged 4.8% during its fiscal first quarter. The company blamed ""continued high gas prices, higher interest rates, and competitive value promotion"" for the poor performance. RT now expects fiscal first-quarter profits to total 21 cents per share when it reports this afternoon.
"
3438,MCD,"The economy is having an impact on consumer spending and higher food prices are a drag on earnings, especially for restaurant chains that lack the ability to pass along the higher costs to consumers. Although the outlook for restaurants appears to be somewhat mixed overall (over the past four weeks, a total of 44 full-year earnings estimates have been raised and 47 have been cut), the companies that seem to be faring the best in the current environment are the fast food chains. About of the recent positive revisions have been concentrated in just three companies: McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report).
"
3439,MCD,"YUM reported third-quarter earnings on Monday afternoon. The company earned 50 cents per share, six cents above expectations and 20% above year-ago levels. U.S. same-store sales were essentially flat, but company realized strong growth in China. It also announced plans to open Taco Bell restaurants in Mexico with the hopes that its ""American"" menu will provide an attractive alternative to traditional Mexican food. YUM raised its full-year guidance to profits of $1.65 per share, a penny above then the consensus estimate. Four of the six covering brokerage analysts adjusted their forecasts in response, boosting the consensus estimate to $1.65 per share.
"
3440,MCD,"The New York Times reported on Tuesday that New York regulators are proposing a requirement for insurance companies to set aside reserves to cover damage caused by a severe hurricane. The reserves would come out of premium payments. Insurers are unhappy because under current federal tax law, the money set aside in the reserves would not be tax deductible.
"
3441,MCD,"Ironically, the lack of a severe hurricane in North America might just help insurance company profits this year. Over the past several days, brokerage analysts have upped their full-year forecasts on multiple property and casualty insurers and reinsurers including AllState (ALL  -  Free Report), Chubb (CB  -  Free Report), Ace Limited (ACE), Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) and XL Capital (XL  -  Free Report).
"
3442,MCD,"The upward revisions likely reflect the relatively calm hurricane season, increased premiums and the rebound in the U.S. equity markets. Investors should note while none of the insurers have changed their third-quarter guidance, three or more brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts on 11 different companies - a bullish sign.

3445,MCD,"Since the United States is the richest and most powerful country in the world, its only logical that we would be the fattest as well.  As recent court cases attest, Americans love to eat, and obesity has become the newest health concern in the nation.  However, divorcing the public relations aspect from the situation, the restaurant industry is a large, multi-billion-dollar and highly competitive industry here.  Now, recent attempts by companies to change the way they do business, especially from the fast-food franchises, have begun to pay off, giving the industry a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.93.  According to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  that places 81st out of more than 200 industries. 
"
3446,MCD,"Restaurant stocks are doing great, said 5-Star analyst Jonathan Waite, research analyst at McDonald Investments, Inc., A KeyCorp Company.  Fast food companies are leading the way, according to Waite, as they have found the benefits of offering higher premium items.  McDonalds is leading the way in this matter, in much the same way it leads the industry itself.  Last year, the companys hottest new menu item was not a quadruple cheeseburger or $10 milkshake, but premium salads.   
"
3447,MCD,"Companies learned that they could sell a premium item for $3.99, instead of something off of a 99-cent menu, said Waite.   
"
3448,MCD,"Along with such items, comes a new way a directing business.  In a January press release, Jim Cantalupo, McDonalds Chairman and CEO, said, From the very beginning, we introduced a new level of discipline and focus to all aspects of the business.  In 2003, we eliminated projects not directly impacting our customers' experience, narrowed our non-McDonald's brand activities, aligned our System around a single action plan, and re-established McDonald's marketing leadership through the introduction of our first ever global brand direction, 'i'm lovin' it.  As a result of such actions, same-store sales for McDonalds, and many of its competitors, have been on the rise.   
"
3449,MCD,"Some casual dining restaurants are also getting into offering more healthy choices.  While these companies are not experiencing the thrust of fast-food franchises, many of them have also reported strong quarterly earnings and sales results.  And as far as obesity claims are concerned, Waite believes such attention impacts these companies mainly on a public relations front.   
"
3450,MCD,"Given the size of the industry, it can be rather daunting at times to pick one or two issues that are likely to rise from the pack.  Thats where analysts can help you pinpoint the best opportunities.  Waite likes companies that have the potential to be a good national chain.  Also, he looks for a high return on invested capital, and a strong management team.  If handled the right way, the restaurant industry can provide good sustenance to your portfolio.

3452,MCD,"Below are some of the top stocks in the restaurants industry recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts.  Unlike other industry reports, you probably are quite familiar with each of these companies, even if youve never eaten at one.  All of them were able to match Wall Street expectations in the their most recent quarters, and all have enjoyed higher sales as well.  Applebees International, Inc.  (NASDAQ:  APPB ) develops, franchises and operates restaurants under the Applebees Neighborhood Grill & Bar brand, the largest casual dining concept in the world.  As of February 22, 2004, there were 1,594 Applebees restaurants operating system-wide in 49 states and nine international countries.  Late last month Applebees reported that comparable sales for company restaurants advanced +8.4% in its February period.  System-wide comparable sales increased +7.8% while comparable sales for franchise restaurants moved forward +7.6%.  In February, Applebees completed one of the best years in its history with fourth quarter net earnings of 41 cents per share, matching the consensus and beating the year-ago total by +14%.  System-wide comparable sales improved +4.6%, marking the companys 22nd straight quarter of comparable sales growth.  In 2003, the company continued to expand its market share as at least 100 new restaurants were opened for the 11th consecutive year.  Furthermore, the new year got off to a good start with solid sales results in January.   
"
3453,MCD,"In mid-November, Applebees launched a five-market test of a new Weight Watchers menu.  More than 70 restaurants are testing a combined total of 18 potential items.  The most popular eight to 10 items will be selected for the national menu, which will launch in 2004.  Some of the items tested include a Mexican Fiesta Dip, a French Onion Soup, a Grilled Citrus Chicken Salad, a Chicken Fajita Skillet, and a Chocolate Raspberry Layer Cake.  In its quarterly report, Applebees stated that it is pleased with the early results and guest response, and believe the strategic initiative can contribute to its continued success in the latter half of 2004 and beyond.

(NASDAQ:  CAKE ) operates 74 upscale, casual dining restaurants under The Cheesecake Factory® name that offer an extensive menu of more than 200 items with an average check of approximately $16.  The company also operates a bakery production facility that produces over 50 varieties of quality cheesecakes and other baked products for the companys restaurants and for other leading foodservice operators, retailers and distributors.  For its fourth quarter, Cheesecake Factory reported diluted net income of 30 cents per share, which matched the consensus and improved upon the prior year.  Total revenues advanced +23% to $214.5 million while comparable restaurants sales rose +2.5%.  The company attributed the comparable restaurant sales rise to the sustained popularity of its concepts, great operational execution, and favorable weather comparisons in California and Florida.   
"
3454,MCD,"The Cheesecake Factory opened seven new restaurants in the fourth quarter, and it achieved its goal to open as many as 14 new Cheesecake Factory restaurants during fiscal 2003.  As for fiscal 2004, the company wants to open 16 new restaurants.  CAKEs goal is to achieve a +22% to +23% increase in total restaurant operating weeks during the fiscal year. Compared to a +21% increase during fiscal 2003.  With a popular brand and ambitious goals for the future, theres no wonder why four All Star analysts are recommending this company.

Panera Bread Company  (NASDAQ:  PNRA ) owns and franchises bakery-cafes under the Panera Bread and Saint Louis Bread Company names.  The company is a leader in the emerging specialty bread/café category due to its unique bread combined with a quick, casual dining experience.  For the four weeks ended February 21, 2004, Panera Bread reported that system-wide comparable bakery-café sales advanced +1.4%.  For its fourth quarter, the company reported earnings of 34 cents per diluted share, which was +36% better than the year-ago result of 25 cents.  The performance also matched the consensus.

McDonalds  (NYSE:  MCD ) is the worlds leading food service retailer with more than 30,000 restaurants in 119 countries, serving 47 million customers each day.  The company is one of the worlds most well-known and valuable brands and holds a leading share in the globally branded quick service restaurant segment of the informal eating-out market in virtually every county in which it does business.  Earlier this month, McDonalds announced that systemwide sales for February 2004 jumped +22.6%, or +14.8 in constant currencies.  Comparable sales for McDonalds restaurants worldwide increased +13.9%.  The performance was helped by an extra day in February due to leap year.  The month marked the tenth straight of increased systemwide comparable sales.  While the company knows that some unique factors helped Februarys numbers, the performance was also helped by its Plan to Win strategy.  The plan includes actions to improve the customer experience through better tasting food, improved service, relevant marketing, and enhanced menu variety.  Mid-February saw the company announce that it generated a record $3.3 billion of cash from operation in 2003, thanks to increased sales at existing restaurants.  The combination of increased cash generation and lower capital expenditures allowed the company to pay down approximately $900 million of debt in 2003 while increasing its annual dividend by +70% to about $500 million.  The revitalization work we have done so far has paid off in increased sales and cash flow at existing restaurants and better restaurant experiences for our customers, said Jim Cantalupo, Chairman and CEO of McDonalds.  We will continue to focus on the customer, improve the restaurant experience and exercise financial discipline.   
"

3458,MCD,"Over the past several months, the Experts views presented in this column have been predicting and analyzing the recent correction. John Bollingers suggestion to Say Goodbye in July would have been decent advice to take. The strong move off the March lows to the June highs had many concerned that valuations had gotten ahead of earnings growth. Then, stocks suffered a serious sell off in the wake of the yield spike. Many of the top Experts on Wall Street right now, though, believe that the correction is nearing completion and suspect that stocks will begin a new up move shortly. In spite of the near-term down trend, the dominant trend since October is up. Will the 6.8% drop in the S&P 500 since June 17th be the end of the correction? The Experts weigh in on how to prepare for an intermediate bottom, why the expect the next move to be up and how to profit in such a leg.So Those Were the Earnings, Now What?
"
3459,MCD,"Wall Street was fairly pleased with the performance of corporate America in the second quarter earnings reporting season. Conservative expectations, low interest rates, and a declining dollar combined with scattered demand strength to produce an up quarter all around. The market had largely discounted good earnings for the quarter, and it would have taken an aggregate earnings surprise on the order of 30% above expectations to drive the market higher on the news. In fact, a good bit of the weakness, according to several Experts, can be attributed to a low threshold for profit-taking.
"
3460,MCD,"Richard Moroney, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts believes that a good barometer for buying stocks, though is to look beyond the absolute earnings level vs. estimates. Strictly using the surprise, i.e. the difference between corporate guidance/analyst estimates and the actual earnings reported, can result in jumping on low-quality earnings bandwagons. Cookie jars, and other accounting gimmicks, allow companies to manage their earnings to a point to beat earnings estimates by a couple of pennies. Coupling guidance and analyst estimates with earnings surprises are approaching Moroneys ultimate decision-making process on which stocks to buy.
"
3461,MCD,"Further, the record of the company in beating earnings estimates over the last several quarters and its ability to grow earnings consistently are crucial for the editor of Dow Theory Forecasts. Moroney notes that a critical factor in looking at stocks to buy right now is to include an analysis of the markets reaction to the earnings report. This would seem somewhat intuitive, but it bears delving slightly deeper. The market is first and foremost a discounting mechanism. Most stocks recommended by the Experts trade hundreds of thousands of shares a day. Thus, the stocks movement is the exhibition of the interaction of expectations, estimates and assumptions from thousands of people.
"
3462,MCD,"As such, simply reading an earnings report citing performance vs. guidance, or press release that compares the report to estimates does not provide sufficient insight or justification to buy a stock. Taking a look at the response of the stocks price reaction to the earnings report provides further insight into the stocks ability to meet true expectations or force those that follow the stock to revise their expectations upward.Theres No Time Like the Present
"
3463,MCD,"Moroney brings this up right now because of our proximity to the 2nd quarter earnings period. He profiles several stocks whose stock prices were goosed in the wake of their earnings releases. 
"
3464,MCD,"Fisher Scientific (NYSE: FSH ) raised its guidance about a month before the company reported earnings for the second quarter. Ben Zacks, editor of the Zacks Advisor added the company to his Focus List in May, after first quarter earnings, since which it has appreciated 21%. The company beat profit estimates by $.04 per share, and the consensus estimate for the 2003 fiscal year moved the same amount. The company expects around 5% sales growth for 2003, which should prove conservative, and profit margins are likely to expand. The company trades at a modest 16x 2003 earnings, and Moroney rates the company a Buy. Fishers stock price jumped a slight bit right after it reported earnings and has come off less than the indices.
"
3465,MCD,"Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: (INTC  -  Free Report) ) benefited from improvement in demand for microprocessors throughout the quarter. The company is boosting R&D spending and predicted higher profit margins for the rest of the year, two signs which pleased investors. Since it reported, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by about 11% for the rest of the year. Moroney predicts the companys communication business will remain weak, but its semiconductor billings have been rising of late. The company, though, trades at 35x earnings, so Moroney rates it strictly a Long Term Buy.As For Sentiment
"
3466,MCD,"Paul Hauck and John Scherr are in constant communication with a large community of individual and institutional investors. Hauck and Scherr are both contrarians who state, in their August issue of WhisperNumber Earnings Digest that the renewed interest in stocks that begin in March was a rally killer from the start. The lack of pent up demand from a general balance of bullishness in stocks placed an expiration date on the rally in their opinions. Disney (NYSE: (DIS  -  Free Report) ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), and McDonalds (NYSE: (MCD  -  Free Report) ) moved up during the rally due to the fact that theyd been largely out of favor.
"
3467,MCD,"The correction, though, in spite of not igniting a new bear leg, marks the waning of some of that bullishness. Hauck and Scherr expect sentiment to drift lower throughout the rest of August. Late-comers who sat skeptically on the sidelines in March, April and May, and then bought in June, were largely forced to sell in July, and will be among those who drive sentiment lower. Hauck and Scherr expect this new dose of skepticism to set the market up for a rally in late August or early September, though dont think it will be as large as the takeoff from the post-Iraq conflict lows.
"
3468,MCD,"Hauck believe that Technology has likely had its rally, and that Financials and Health Care have performed too well to take off. If you seek to invest in Technology stocks, they recommend Microsoft (NASDAQ: (MSFT  -  Free Report) ), which hasnt made a significant move lately. Utilities, Energy and Transportation should be a significant part of the concentration of the rally. Hauck and Scherr are also very positive on the Gold sector, and sentiment remains very bearish in that area. Bullishness, they say, would cause them to question their outlook for it.Down Trend Within an Up Market
"
3469,MCD,"It has been a long time since a good number of Experts were classifying a particular leg as a correction within a clear up market. Yet, they are making compelling cases right now to find stocks with strong earnings momentum and big cap cyclicals that will benefit from economic strength. Certainly, each of the Experts would concede that the market could turn decidedly bearish and move significantly lower. A positive turn in late August or early September, though, would be clear evidence of market strength and the Experts are hoping and jockeying for the proper positions in their portfolios.
