5,LRCX,"The next shoe to drop in President Donald Trump's China trade war was expected to land this week. Officials were expected to detail new investment restrictions and Trump export controls aimed at China by June 30, with semiconductor equipment a likely focus.But Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro in a CNBC interview and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a tweet tried to downplay the coming report, saying it isn't aimed at China directly. Mnuchin tweeted that investment restrictions would target any country that steals American technology. Navarro said there would be no investment restrictions.Stocks rallied into the close but still finished with deep losses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years, and that post-Brexit vote move two years ago only lasted a day. The S&P 500 index closed just above its 50-day line after trading below that key support most of the session. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.1%.So has the plan that tanked the stock market really changed? It's hard to be sure, but it wouldn't be a shock. Although Trump threatened a full-scale trade war with China last week, he's also been working to save ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm that is the 4th biggest cell phone supplier to the U.S. market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe logical explanation is that Trump really wants a deal with China. He's been wielding threats to help make it happen, but the stock market reaction on Monday may help convince him to back off a new threat that could make it impossible for China to return to the bargaining table.The biggest near-term concerns about the coming news drop have less to do with Chinese investment restrictions and more to do with Trump export controls.In a new analysis, Moody's Investors Service said that the toughest export restriction it envisions likely would be a ban on chip equipment sales to Chinese companies, which account for 6%, or $1.8 billion, of combined revenue for Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Shares of Applied Materials sank 2.6% in the stock market today, while Lam Research lost 2.1% and KLA-Tencor 2.3%.Total sales in China for those big three U.S. chip-equipment firms make up 18% of total revenue, including sales to non-Chinese companies operating in China. Moody's doesn't rule out the possibility Trump export controls could go so far as to ban sales of chip gear even to non-Chinese companies operating in China, such as Samsung, Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Even if Trump export controls only cut off sales to Chinese companies, that could go a long way to deepening trade hostilities between the U.S. and Beijing.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.China aims to close the technological gap, dominate domestic markets and establish global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. U.S. efforts to counter this threat point to an American technological cold war with China, regardless of Trump's combative approach to trade.""Outside of Applied, Lam and KLA, we believe alternative suppliers of the array of leading-edge semiconductor equipment that Chinese companies need to produce chips do not exist.""Just a week after the new restrictions are expected to be released, on July 6, 25% tariffs are set to take effect on roughly $34 billion worth of imports from China. Another $16 billion worth of goods could also face tariffs shortly thereafter. The second batch of Trump tariffs includes processor and memory chips.A study based on the preliminary list of goods to face Trump tariffs found that the bulk would hit multinationals from the U.S. and other countries besides China. The Semiconductor Industry Association said much the same thing on June 15 after the final list of products was released: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedHarley-Davidson Just Gave Trump Tariffs A Black EyeIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

IBD 50 stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points Tuesday, joining fellow chip gear leaders ASML Holding (ASML) and Teradyne (TER). Recent memory-chip IPO Smart Global Holdings (SMH) also moved back into a buy zone.These chip stocks provide several reasons to be bullish for the stock market rally, which was downgraded to uptrend under pressure after Monday.S&P 500 index futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. So did Dow Jones futures. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.25%, with Facebook sliding again.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

It will be Jerome Powell's first policy meeting as Fed chairman, with Powell holding a press conference following the 2 p.m. policy announcement.While investors should be cautious about making new purchases with the stock market rally under pressure, one reason to be hopeful is leading stocks setting up and breaking out. And as a practical matter, a stock market uptrend isn't that useful for active investors unless there are quality stocks in buy zones.All five chip stocks cited here have Composite Ratings above 95. Lam Research and Smart Global boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. ASML has a 98 CR, Applied Materials a 97 and Teradyne a 96. The Composite Rating combines several proprietary ratings, including on earnings and other key metrics. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 before making their big runs.Smart Global has a relative strength line in new high ground. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. An RS line hitting new highs ahead of or amid a breakout is a bullish sign. Teradyne and ASML also have RS lines at record highs, while Applied Materials and Lam Research are not far off.ASML shares edged down 0.1% to 212.60 in Tuesday's stock market trading, holding above a 208.68 buy point. Teradyne rose 0.6% to 48.99 vs. its cup-base entry point of 48.63. Applied Materials climbed 1.25% to 59.23, moving above its 58.83 buy point from a double-bottom pattern. Lam Research advanced 0.7% to 219.13, just above its 218.88 double-bottom entry. Smart Global vaulted 6.2% to 44.92, moving back above a 43.25 buy point and rising to the top of the 5% chase zone.Facebook has fallen more than 9% already this week, plunging through key support. It's a major component of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index. Also, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP) also fell at least in part in sympathy. But so far, despite Monday's sell-off in the major averages and Tuesday's tepid bounce, leading stocks haven't suffered too much damage.Not every stock market rally needs semiconductors playing a big role. But the chip sector is a big part of the overall market, especially the Nasdaq. And chips are in virtually every tech product, from smartphones to PCs to servers as well as automobiles and so many other products. So if chip stocks and companies are doing well, that likely bodes well for tech stocks and companies overall.In addition to the five chip stocks cited here, a number of semiconductor manufacturers are near buy zones.

13,LRCX,"McDonald's, Chevron and Home Depot each gained 2 points in the stock market today and helped push the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 0.5% higher in afternoon trading Thursday. Tesla rallied again as crude oil rose sharply.Among the Dow Jones' 30 components, eight stocks rallied at least 1 point as U.S. Treasury bonds fell, pushing up yields. Oil rallied sharply.Meanwhile, software stocks dropped en masse, pressuring the Nasdaq. Chip equipment firms, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), also took it hard on the chin. Both of these former big winners in 2017 are now in basing mode.At 2:15 p.m. ET, the tech-centered composite fell 0.9%, slightly cutting early losses. The Nasdaq 100 slumped 1.2%, poised to halt a four-day winning streak. The S&P 500 traded virtually flat, down 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 fell 0.4% after rising four sessions in a row.Enterprise software shares took a break. In the IBD Sector Leaders screen, Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), RealPage (RP) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) all slid 2% to 3% or more in brisk volume.Tesla (TSLA) has been rising on comments earlier this week by CEO Elon Musk that he's confident the electric vehicle pioneer will ramp up weekly production of the pivotal Model 3 sedan to 3,000 units per week by month's end.The stock has rebounded as much as 35% from its near-term low of 244.59 on April 2. Over the same time frame, the Nasdaq composite has gained 13%.However, please check out the MarketSmith daily chart on Tesla, and you'll see that Tesla is having some trouble climbing back above the 200-day moving average.The 200-day line traces the average closing price of a stock over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' worth of action. As a growth investor, you want to see a stock rise not only above its 50-day moving average but the 200-day line as well.Most of the top dogs in the IBD 50 show such a trend. They're hitting new highs, leading their 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.On the positive side, Tesla now stands just 17% below its 52-week and all-time peak of 389.61. That price represents a fantastic gain since the transportation innovator initially broke out of a stage-one base near 40 back in April 2013.The current base is first stage. Watch to see if the stock can keep muscling higher, slashing through a very visible overhead supply of willing sellers at the 350 to 360 price range.Tesla's sales jumped 68% last year to $11.76 billion, breaking the $10 billion barrier. But the Palo Alto, Calif., company also lost $8.66 a share. The Street sees Tesla bleeding more red ink this year (an estimated net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018), but then earn $2.37 a share in 2019.The company has a $54 billion market cap and 170 million shares outstanding.In contrast, Toyota Motor (TM) has a $201 billion market cap (share price times total shares outstanding) and 1.47 billion shares outstanding. The global car and truck titan had $265 billion in sales in 2017, up 4%.Toyota shares are forming a saucer with a droopy-looking handle. In a bull market, the handle should show a maximum decline of 8% to 12% from high to low. In Toyota's case, the correction within its three-week handle is an acceptable 9%. The provisional buy point is 138.68.McDonald's (MCD) surged more than 3% to 168.48 in active turnover. The world's largest restaurant chain hit a nearly four-month high and is carving a new saucer-style base. The current buy point for now is 178.80.Elsewhere in stocks today, Five Below (FIVE) destroyed short sellers with a 22% gain, extending its run to five sessions. Shares notched an all-time high of 99.91, up 487% from its July 2012 IPO at 17 a share.The operator of stores that sell items at $5 or less reported late Wednesday that earnings in the April-ended first quarter catapulted 133% to 35 cents a share, the biggest for any first quarter. Sales jumped 27% to $296.3 million.Five Below, based in Philadelphia, has aggressively expanded its chain into new markets in the Midwest, Southwest, and California. The stock entered IBD Leaderboard as a call options play ahead of Wednesday's quarterly results.The stock has also risen 27% past a recent breakout point of 78.38 in a well-formed base on base. A seven-week flat base makes up the upper portion of this bullish chart pattern.WTI crude oil futures rallied 1.7% and got as high as $66.07 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.95%.Chevron (CVX) posted a bullish gap up, rising 3.75, or nearly 3%, to 127.13. Volume is running mildly above average.Despite the nice gain, the integrated oil major is not yet at a proper buy point.Right now, watch to see if Chevron can rally past the handle portion of its five-month cup with handle. The handle' s high is 131.08, thus generating a 131.18 buy point.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, leading industry sectors in the stock market, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Should You Buy Stocks Or Sell Now?

The S&P 500 fought to hold a gain of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite opened to a narrow loss, despite strong early gains from Qualcomm (QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).

Entegris' early gain broke the stock out past a 38.35 buy point in third stage cup base.Despite powerful gains by Qualcomm and NXP, heavy early losses from Vodafone Group (VOD) and Lam Research (LRCX) helped drag the Nasdaq 100 into negative premarket territory.But Nasdaq-listed Zscaler spiked 31.8% at the open. The security software play's fiscal third-quarter results showed its loss narrowed to 2 cents a share during the quarter, vs. expectations for an 8-cent per-share loss. Revenue rose a much-better-than-forecast 50%. Zscaler has soared nearly 17% since the start of June, to 92% above its March IPO price. The gain sent shares far beyond a buy range above a 30.20 buy point in a double-bottom base.IBD Leaderboard stock Five Below blasted 19.6% higher as first-quarter revenue and earnings topped consensus views.

19,LRCX,"Tuesday's new-high list delivered an ample supply of top-rated growth stocks, although many gave back early gains, following the trend of the broad market.Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) hit a new high Tuesday, but the biotech ended near its session low after trying to clear a base with a 21.20 entry. Shares edged 0.3% higher to 20.94.Elsewhere, chip stocks outperformed early but gave back early gains along with the Nasdaq composite.

21,LRCX,"Your stocks to watch are five semiconductors that just entered buy range last week: Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Lam Research (LRCX), ASML Holding (ASML), Teradyne (TER), and Marvell Technology Group (MRVL).X The chip sector has been a key reason why the Nasdaq composite has outperformed recently, with the Nasdaq hitting a new high on Friday. Chips are also a significant part of the S&P 500 index, which retook its 50-day moving average Friday.Chip-equipment makers Lam Research, ASML and Teradyne all have Composite Ratings above 95. The Composite Rating combines earnings and several other key fundamental and technical ratings. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs.The Semiconductor-Equipment group was the top-performing industry last week out of the 197 that IBD tracks, soaring 9.8%. The Semiconductor-Manufacturing group ran up a strong 5.4%. The Computer-Data Storage group, which includes some chip stocks, vaulted 9%.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersBy comparison, the Nasdaq composite jumped 4.2% last week while the S&P 500 gained 3.5% and the Dow Jones 3.25%.These five new chip breakouts follow Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron Technology (MU).

The SOXX ETF has cleared a consolidation and hit a new high.Skyworks shares rose 1.9% to 113.56 in Friday's stock market trading, just moving past a 112.28 buy point from cup-with-handle base. Volume was 41% below normal though. You want to see volume rise at least 40%-50% above average on a breakout as confirmation of institutional support.Skyworks rose 1.4% to 115.16 on Monday on volume that was modestly above normal.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has rebounded from a 52-week low but is still off the high of its consolidation. That's a concern. But the RS line, which is the blue line in the chart below, is hitting short-term highs.Earnings at the firm have been growing by an average of 23% over the last four quarters, and it has managed to outperform Wall Street estimates in each of the last seven quarters. The Apple supplier has also been expanding its reach, and is supplying chips to Chinese smartphone companies as well as South Korea-based Samsung Electronics. But the iPhone maker still accounts for around 40% of Skyworks' revenue.As for Apple, its shares rose 1% to 181.72, clearing a V-shaped cup base with a high-handle entry of 180.71. But volume was well below normal.Lam Research stock shot up 5.7% to 224.95 on Friday, clearing a double-bottom base entry of 218.48 and hitting a new high. Volume was 65% above average. The RS line is approaching the consolidation high and is significantly above the prior short-term peak at the middle of the ""W""-shaped pattern.Lam shares rose 1.6% to 228.65 on Monday, just in buying range.In the last quarter Lam Research's earnings increased 94% year-over-year, and over the past four quarters the average figure is 98.8%. It has also managed to beat views on revenue and earnings in each of the past five quarters.Earlier in the week Lam announced a 120% dividend hike and added $2 billion to its stock repurchase program. Lam said it plans to return at least 50% of free cash flow to investors over the next five years.ASML rose 2.1% to 209.41, clearing a 208.58 buy point from a short consolidation. Like Skyworks, volume was 41% below average. On a positive note, ASML's RS line is at a new high, and has been trending higher since December 2016.ASML stock advanced 0.9% to 211.30 on Monday.The Dutch chip-equipment maker is currently the largest supplier of photolithography systems. ASML has enjoyed average EPS growth of 58.5% over the last four quarters, and in its most recent quarter enjoyed a year-over-year increase of 39%.Teradyne advanced 1.9% to 49.40 on Friday, clearing a cup-base entry of 48.63, but in volume that was 9% below normal. The RS line was already at a new high before the breakout.Shares climbed about 1% to 49.92 on Monday.The Massachusetts-based company is one of the leading suppliers of automation equipment for test and industrial applications, with customers including Samsung, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC).Teradyne has enjoyed healthy quarterly EPS growth averaging 53.5% over the past four quarters. Its earnings per share were up 44% year-over-year in its most recent quarter.

25,LRCX,"The odds that Qualcomm's (QCOM) purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) will go through improved significantly over the weekend after President Donald Trump struck a conciliatory tone in a tweet about trade with China.Chinese regulators have restarted their review of Qualcomm's application to acquire NXP after postponing the process in reaction to growing trade tensions with the U.S., Bloomberg reported Monday.China's approval is the last regulatory roadblock to the Qualcomm-NXP deal, which was announced in October 2016. The $44 billion acquisition has received antitrust clearance from eight of the nine required government regulatory bodies around the world. China's Ministry of Commerce last month said it was reluctant to approve the deal, because it could have a negative impact on domestic tech firms.On Sunday, Trump took to Twitter to announce that he is working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to ensure that Chinese telecom gear maker ZTE doesn't go under, weeks after the U.S. Commerce Department banned sales of key technologies to the firm. The move signaled a calming of tensions over trade between the two countries.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

36,LRCX,"The Nasdaq composite rallied solidly Tuesday while the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average rose slightly in large part because chip-related stocks were big winners. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Cree (CREE) cleared buy points, Intel (INTC) and Micron Technology (MU) hit new highs, and Lam Research (LRCX) announced big shareholder returns. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), a big buyer of semiconductors, carved a new buy point.X These chip plays, along with several others that are in buy range or setting up, are outperforming the S&P 500 index, as shown by their relative strength lines. The RS line for the iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF matched a record high.Some of these breakouts are late-stage bases, such as with Applied Materials. Other stocks are extended, like Micron, while Dow component Intel didn't complete a proper base. But several chip stocks are worth watching.Investors also should watch semiconductors because a healthy chip sector is a positive sign for a market rally. First, chips are a big part of market weightings, especially the Nasdaq. Chips also make up the guts of so many tech products, from the Apple iPhone to PCs to servers and many more. If chip stocks are doing well, that's a good sign for tech stocks and tech demand overall.Apple fell 0.1% to 176.67 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple has now completed a high handle, with the top of the handle slightly above the left side of a short, V-shaped cup base. That means that Apple's buy point has actually risen, from 180.20 to 180.71.Apple's RS line, which was lagging badly for several months, rose significantly in February. It's edged lower in the last few sessions, but is still above the high of the left side of the consolidation.Apple fell 0.9% to 175.03 in Wednesday trades.Applied Materials, a chip equipment giant, shot up 4.1% to a record close of 59.99 on Tuesday, clearing a 58.83 double-bottom buy point after trying to break out briefly last week. (You could also view 59.10 as alternative entry from a newly formed handle.)Volume was 36% above normal, but you'd like to see trading that's at least 40% to 50% higher than average on a breakout to confirm strong institutional buying.Applied Materials' RS line is not quite at its late-November peak, but is definitely above where it was at the middle of the ""W"" in the double-bottom base.Applied Materials fell 1% to close at 59.42 Wednesday.Applied Materials is in a fifth-stage base. Fifth-stage bases are more likely to fail and less likely to deliver big gains than early-stage bases.Cree, which makes chips for LED lighting, vaulted 9.7% to 41.76 Tuesday, blasting above a 40.34 buy point in volume that was 372% above normal. The RS line is hitting a new high. Cree cleared a second-stage base.Cree rose 2.7% Wednesday to 42.89.Intel stock rose 1.9% to 50.71 on Tuesday in average volume, reaching a record 51.33 intraday. But the Dow Jones component had not yet consolidated for six weeks, the minimum for a cup base. Intel's stock chart has had a string of bad luck. But the RS line is hitting new highs.Intel rose 1.2% to 51.32 Wednesday.Micron stock jumped 3.3% to 53.74 on Tuesday, its best reading since late 2000. It was the third straight robust gain in above-average volume.Micron cleared a 47.08 double-bottom buy point on Feb. 26 and topped a 49.99 alternative entry on Monday. Shares are now extended from either entry.Micron rose 0.4% to close at 53.97 Wednesday.Lam Research popped 4.65% to 207.94 on Tuesday, making good progress toward a 218.58 double-bottom buy point.

52,LRCX,"The stock market showed it's being stingy with its losses following Wednesday's dramatic rebound. The Nasdaq composite, the top index in 2017, jumped off its mild intraday lows and edged slightly higher in the late afternoon Thursday.X The Nasdaq, a 1.1% winner on Wednesday, was down all of 0.3% in the early morning before turning higher. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on that exchange, rose roughly 0.1%.Chipmakers and semiconductor equipment plays continued Wednesday's solid rebound, and STMicroelectronics (STM) broke out, clearing a 24.90 buy point in a 10-week flat base. The stock gapped up bullishly at the open and is up nearly 3% to 24.97. The buy zone goes up to 5% past the 24.90 entry, or 26.15.Silicon wafer etching systems expert Lam Research (LRCX) fell less than 1% to 203.66 in heavy volume, but the pullback looks normal following a strong gain Wednesday.Watch to see if Lam can remain above its 50-day moving average as the stock attempts to form a new base, which could provide a brand-new proper buy point.The strength in tech is helping the S&P 500 rally off its lows. The large-cap benchmark is off just 0.3%. At 2798, it's up 4.6% year to date.  Top-performing industry groups include movies, market research, specialty retail, design software, paint and lodging shares, all up 1% as a group or more.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped more than 0.3% lower. The Russell 2000 is off 0.4%.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, continues to act like a market leader ever since it turned fortunes around for investors with its breakout on Jan. 6, 2017, from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. IBD's Stock Market Today had featured that breakout at length. Today, shares are up just 0.3%, but at 179 the gain from that prime entry point has now reached 51%.Long-term investors have no reason whatsoever to sell. Apple has not triggered any defense-type sell signals, such as a severe drop below the 50-day line or 10-week moving average in massive volume and failure to recover. Rather, the iPhone, iPad and digital services innovator is actually in buy range for those who wish to add a small amount of shares to an existing position.Why? The stock recently bounced off its 10-week moving average near 173 following a solid breakout on Oct. 27 past a new cup with handle that formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. This new base presented a key buy point at 160.97, and just a few weeks ago Apple made its first pullback to the 10-week moving average.A solid rebound off this medium-term support and resistance level offers a follow-on entry point. Buying more shares in a rising stock gives a savvy growth investor a chance to compound one's return. It's best to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line once the rebound is moving.Apple is expected to grow profits in the double digits for a fourth straight quarter as analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings up 13% to $3.78 a share in the fiscal first quarter ended in December. Earnings have grown 2%, 11%, 18% and 24% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters as sales picked up 3%, 5%, 7% and 12%.Going back to STMicroelectronics, the decline within the base from intraday to intraday low is 15.5%, hitting the maximum decline allowed for a good flat base. One could also view the chart action as a shallow cup base with no handle.Either way, the action within the base is generally sound. After a more than 200% rally following an October 2016 breakout from a first-stage bottoming base pattern, STMicro has been stingy with giving up those gains.Two concerns remain. There are no up weeks in price in heavy weekly turnover within the latest base, and two sharp down weeks in massive volume. However, in the prior two weeks, STMicro showed strong gains in rising weekly turnover vs. the prior week. One could view that as a form of institutional accumulation.Plus, such recent heavy buying is reflected in STMicro's positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating, a B on a scale of A to E, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. A grade of C+ or higher indicates that fund managers have been net buyers of the stock over the past 13 weeks.The Swiss chipmaker focuses on industrial markets including cars. It's staged a stunning turnaround in both the top and bottom lines following lousy results from 2013 to the first half of 2016.Revenue rose 2% in the third quarter of 2016 to $1.8 billion, ending a three-year-plus slump in sales, then accelerated to gains of 11%, 13%, 13% and 19% vs. year-ago levels in the four most recent quarters. Earnings have been superb over the same time frame and include year-over-year increases of 325% and 155% in the past two periods.The Street sees earnings up 133% to 35 cents a share in Q4 of last year. Growth should continue to be bright in 2018, with earnings seen rising 34% to $1.25 a share on a 12% bump up in sales to $9.25 billion. That would mark the highest annual sales since 2011.STMicro's Composite Rating is a solid 93 on a scale of 1 to 99.Elsewhere, WTI near-term crude oil futures inched up 0.1% to $64.05 a barrel; prices eclipsed the $60 level on Dec. 29.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.60%, just 2 basis points shy of eclipsing the March 2017 high of 2.62%.RELATED:The Golden Rule Of InvestingFinding Hot New IPOs: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Dell, Cisco And Google?Inside Big Picture: Is It Time To Worry About Bonds?

Micron Technology (MU), which already topped a double-bottom buy point, cleared an alternate entry and soared to a 17-year high amid continued strong memory-chip demand and pricing. .Target (TGT), which plans to hike its minimum wage to $12 an hour, missed profit views and fell short of consensus for EPS guidance.

Off-price chain Ross Stores (ROST) beat comfortably as comps grew 5%, but offered cautious guidance, weighing on shares. Peer Burlington Stores (BURL) got a bump from a solid quarter. Big Lots (BIG) tumbled on a surprise drop in same-store sales.That was much better than expected, while December and January payrolls were revised up by a combined 54,000. The jobless rate held at 4.1% as the labor force participation rate soared. But the real story was wages. Average hourly earnings rose just 2.6% vs. a year earlier, below views for 2.9%. January's wage gain, initially reported as 2.9%, was revised down to 2.8%. So the jobs report didn't fan fears of four Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018.A series of earnings beats was not enough to stop some of America's trendiest clothing retailers from suffering steep losses Thursday. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) sold off Thursday despite matching Q4 earnings estimates and guiding Q1 earnings above views Thursday.

Casa, which came public in mid-December, jumped to a new high.Cybersecurity provider Okta (OKTA), which pre-announced earnings on Feb. 22, provided stellar additional financials when reporting full Q4 results.

56,LRCX,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have been heavily buying shares in big-name industry leaders, including Bank of America (BAC), Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), investing well over $1 billion in each during that period.X BofA led the group, with top fund managers scooping up more than $2 billion of the financial giant's shares. Boosted by that demand, the stock is now around 25% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared in September.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) and software and analytics leader Adobe (ADBE) both came in just shy of the $1 billion mark, getting investments of approximately $982 million and $932 million, respectively.The IBD 50 screen identifies the top growth stocks that are strongly displaying the key traits typically shared by the biggest stock market winners.Seven of the names on this month's list of new buys by top funds are also currently on the IBD 50, including Applied Materials, Adobe, Abiomed (ABMD), Lam Research (LRCX) and S&P Global (SPGI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn addition to BofA, seven other bank stocks made the list, joined by six financial sector companies, including Charles Schwab, which was named one of the best online stock brokers for 2018.Leading portfolio managers also continued to pick up shares in semiconductor stocks, including the aforementioned Intel, Applied Materials and Lam Research, as well as Microsemi (MSCC) and KLA Tencor (KLAC).Portfolio managers also showed a healthy interest in medical stocks, with five companies from that sector joining Abiomed and Abbot Laboratories on the list, including Express Scripts (ESRX) and Cantel Medical (CMD).Just because mutual fund managers have been buying a stock doesn't mean it's time for individual investors to pick up shares, especially given that the overall market has come under selling pressure recently. Be sure to run all your stock ideas through a buying checklist and do additional research before making any investment decisions.On Tuesday, Applied Materials cleared a 58.83 buy point in a later-stage, and therefore riskier, double bottom. Its relative strength line has been trending sharply higher and is just shy of new high ground.Lam Research is also working on a late-stage double bottom, and has now climbed within 5% of the 218.58 entry.Scanning and tracking solutions leader Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) leapt past a buy point in January, but pulled back as the stock market fell sharply in early February. But on Feb. 22, Zebra soared on its Q4 earnings report and is now 27% above the initial 112.49 entry.Adobe also launched a successful breakout in January and has now climbed 14% above the 186.37 buy point.IBD 50 member SVB Financial (SIVB), which owns Silicon Valley Bank and was just featured in the IBD Stock Analysis, broke out past a 263.19 entry on Tuesday, but is now testing support at the buy point after the resignation of Donald Trump's top economic advisor Gary Cohn rattled the market.Despite being among the top new buys this month, Boeing topped the list of stocks being sold, with 42 net sellers (123 funds selling minus 81 buying).American Express (AXP) was second, with 40 net sellers (90 funds selling minus 50 buying).Managed care provider Humana (HUM) and Motorola Solutions (MSI) also saw a significant number of net sellers.You May Also Like:What Are Today's Fastest-Growing Companies?Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsVideo: How To Quickly Find Top-Performing Mutual Funds

57,LRCX,"Investors preferred to continue investing in U.S. stocks and trimming their stakes in Bitcoin-related securities on Tuesday as the Nasdaq continued to stage one of its biggest month-to-date gains.X The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7% while the Nasdaq 100, capturing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose 0.8%.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), meanwhile, flashed a warning sign that a prolonged correction may be in the works. The popular fund dropped 2% to 1,653.90, sinking for a third straight session and giving back all of last Thursday's strong rebound. The fund is also losing more ground below its critical 50-day moving average.Bitcoin Investment Trust gave astute chart readers a pair of sell signals in December when it showed some clear signs of a climax run, one of the most important sell signals featured in IBD market columns. Bitcoin also slashed through its 10-day moving average, a good sell trigger for short-term traders.The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, is now at 169.49. The heavily traded ETF extended its overall gain since a Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016, to more than 57%. A follow-through is a vital market-turning signal that was noted by The Big Picture back then. Typical follow-through rallies occur on the fourth day or later after an initial rally attempt that follows a significant market correction.Meanwhile, some blue chips took a break as the Dow Jones industrial average finished practically at breakeven. At least seven of the 30 member stocks in the Dow Jones industrials fell 1 point or more, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) following its plan to take a $13.6 billion charge following the new tax code and repatriate billions in profits back into America immediately. The company also suffered a setback in court over a drug patent.The S&P 500 lifted 0.2%. Breadth was positive on both exchanges; on the Nasdaq, winners smashed losers by a nearly 4-3 margin. NYSE winners crushed losers by nearly 9-to-5.J&J slid 4% to 141.83 in heavy turnover, but the uptrend remains in place as the diversified medical products giant remains above its 50-day line. At its recent peak, the stock held a 14.9% profit since clearing a 129.10 buy point in a long base on base, a key pattern for those who want to buy the most bullish growth stocks.Apple (AAPL) edged slightly higher to 177.04 and trades just a few points off its all-time peak of 180.10. At that peak, the largest company in the U.S. exchanges by market cap ($900 billion) has run 52% since the pivotal breakout from a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Apple is also up nearly 10% from its latest true base, a second-stage cup with handle that provided a 160.97 entry. The base formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. Volume on the Oct. 27 breakout came in strong, 64% above the 50-day average. It later tried to break out from a flat base at 176.34 but has not climbed much from that entry.While the iPhone and digital services titan has sort of set the standard over the past 12 months on how a giant company can turn things around and rally nicely from key breakouts points, the market's rally across techland means that IBD-style growth investors can possibly find other big cap names that could present even richer stock profit potential.Four names to consider include:Lam Research (LRCX), a play on semiconductor equipment, $34 billion market cap: The stock rallied nearly 3% to 215.05 and is crafting the right side of a new cup-style base since peaking at 219.70 on Nov. 21.Lam, which had been regularly featured in IBD Big Cap 20 throughout 2017, is expected to grow fiscal second-quarter earnings by a whopping 64% to $3.68 a share. In contrast, Apple's profit in the just-ended fiscal first quarter is expected to rise 13%.PayPal (PYPL), digital payments pioneer, $101 billion market cap: The stock floated 0.2% higher to 84.18, a fifth straight gain, and is now up 5.9% past the recent breakout from a good flat base at 79.48. Shares are thus a tad extended from the proper buy zone.Earnings are seen rising 24% to 52 cents in Q4, following year-over-year gains of 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31%.Salesforce.com (CRM), a business software innovator, $81 billion market cap: The Marc Benioff-led cloud-based enterprise software giant is nominally in buy range at 113.24, 3.6% above a 109.29 entry in a six-week flat base.Earnings in the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter are seen rising 18% to 33 cents a share following EPS increases of 26%, 14%, 47%, 17%, 38% and 62% in the prior six quarters.

TI also guided higher. The stock jumped nearly 5% in premarket trading after closing up 0.3% at 98.42.Texas Instruments isn't just one of the biggest chipmakers but also fairly diverse, with big exposure to the mobile and automotive markets. So TI's results are a good indicator for chips and end markets.STMicroelectronics (STM), chip-gear maker MKS Instruments (MKSI) and LED-chip maker Cree (CREE) also jumped overnight on their results.But big-cap chip-equipment maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled overnight on weak guidance. Teradyne warned of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices.That's not the most recent chip warning directly tied to smartphone weakness. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which makes a lot of chips for Intel, Nvidia and others, cited phone woes in its grim outlook last week.Still, the SOXX ETF rose a fraction in premarket trading.Intel, which reports earnings Thursday, rose 0.5% in Wednesday's premarket. On Tuesday, Intel closed up 0.7% at 51.45 after hitting 53.64 intraday, nearly retaking a 53.88 flat-base entry.Nvidia was indicated slightly lower after initially showing a modest gain.Remember that after-hours action in stock futures as well as individual stocks and ETFs doesn't always translate into regular-session gains.Chip stocks are a huge share of the market, especially in the Nasdaq. Chips are in so many products, from PCs, servers and smartphones like the Apple iPhone, to also ""non-tech"" products such as cars and appliances. So if semis are faring poorly, it's not a good sign for end demand in many industries. That's a big reason why last week's weak outlooks from contract chip giant Taiwan Semi and equipment makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML) have hurt the broader stock market.  Apple lost 1.4% on Tuesday after undercutting its 200-day line Monday.

But selling in several chip names has Wall Street questioning whether or not they'll be able to maintain their market leadership.Earnings from IBD Sector Leader MKS Instruments (MKSI), one of several top growth stocks in the chip sector, are due Tuesday after the close. Profit at the chip-equipment firm is expected to jump 57% from the year-ago quarter to $2 a share. Sales are expected to rise 21% to $530.68 million.MKS provides instruments, subsystems and process control technologies used in the chip-manufacturing process. The company's Light & Motion segment specializes in lasers and laser-based systems.MKS is among a small group of chip names that pays a quarterly dividend. It mostly recently paid a dividend of 18 cents a share, good for a modest annualized yield of around 0.6%.MKS Instruments gave up its 50-day moving average Thursday as shares lost more than 5% in heavy volume. The weakness came after a failed breakout from a late-stage base over a 109.50 buy point. MKS has erased a double-digit gain from the buy point, a sell signal for those who bought at the breakout. The stock flashed the same sell signal April 4.Semiconductor stocks faced a fresh round of selling Thursday.

62,LRCX,"The stock market faces several key tests in the coming week. Can the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reclaim key support. Can Apple (AAPL) stock hold its 200-day? How will chip stocks respond? Will the 10-year Treasury yield top 3%? And is Twitter (TWTR) now a better stock than Facebook (FB) or Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL)?The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Friday. Apple stock, the top weighting in all three gauges, tumbled to just above its 200-day line. Several chip warnings set the stage for the stock market and Apple struggles; now Intel (INTC) leads several other big chip names with earnings this week. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a four-year high of 2.96%, as inflation and Fed rate hike fears mount up.Those stock market tests are interrelated to a large extent. But there's also a big question. After struggling for years as a company and stock, Twitter has been roaring back over the past 12 months and in 2018 while FANG stocks Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet have lost momentum.The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, and the major averages did close higher for the week. But the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite came under pressure just as stock breakouts were picking up steam.

The Nasdaq was above its 50-day for the most part from mid-February to March 21, but since then it's had just 3 days over that line.The S&P 500 and other major averages rose slightly on the stock market today.After tumbling 2.8% on Thursday, the iPhone maker fell 4.1% on Friday, crashing through its 50-day moving average and closing just above its 200-day line. No question, Apple stock was a major reason for Friday's stock market sell-off.Apple did trade below its 200-day line for a few days in early February as the brief stock market correction bottomed. But aside from that unusual market environment, Apple stock has not traded below its 200-day line since July 2016.Technically, Apple is in a flat base. But its  relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at its lowest levels since mid-February. The RS line hasn't made headway in almost a year.Apple rose a fraction Monday morning.Chip stocks set the stage for Friday's sell-off in the major averages and Apple with gloomy outlooks from a trio of major semiconductor players: Chip-gear makers ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) and contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Taiwan Semi, which makes chips for Apple and many others, cited weak smartphone demand.The iShares Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) ETF dipped below its 50-day on Wednesday, then tumbled Thursday and Friday. The Philly Sox SOXX ETF rose slightly early Monday.While the stock market can rally without chips participating, it's not easy. Chips are a major part of the stock market. And chips are in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3. So if semiconductors are struggling, that's a bad sign for several other big stock market sectors.Intel, Texas Instruments (TXN), MKS Instruments (MKSI) are among the key chip names on tap this week.The 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply last week, especially Wednesday-Friday, closing at a four-year high of 2.96% and contributing to Friday's stock market slide. With oil prices at their highest levels since late 2014 and wage pressures bubbling, inflation and Fed rate hike concerns are growing.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2.99% and then pared gains to 2.97%.A year ago, this would have been a laughable question. At most, investors might debate whether Twitter or Snap was a better Facebook also-ran.Over the past 12 months, Snap has tumbled 28%. Facebook has climbed 16% and Google-parent Alphabet 25%. Twitter stock has more than doubled, surging 118%. In 2018, Twitter has rallied 33%, while Facebook is down 6% while Google and Snap are up 2% and 4%, respectively.Snap was massively overhyped for its March 2017 IPO. Facebook, struggling with user growth and time on site, is struggling with a data privacy scandal as well as Russian interference. Those Facebook woes have spilled over to Google, while both are facing growing headaches in Europe over competition and privacy concerns.Twitter has gained momentum. In the fourth quarter it crushed adjusted earnings views and reported its first-ever GAAP profit. Always popular with reporters, policy experts and newshounds, Twitter is building on its news niche with more video even as Facebook de-emphasizes news.Alphabet reports earnings late Monday, followed by Twitter early Wednesday and Facebook that evening.Twitter is consolidating just above its 50-day line, but does not yet have a proper base or buy point. Alphabet is working on a double-bottom base, just below its 50-day. Facebook has been moving higher, but is below its 50-day and 200-day lines.Alphabet and Facebook were just above break-even Monday morning, while Twitter rose a fraction.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Signal More Losses; These Big Earnings Are On TapNot Just Apple: The Other Big Reason For Friday's Market Sell-OffThe Big Picture: Coming Week Could Turn Market AroundStocks To Watch: TD Ameritrade, Green Dot Among Stocks Added To IBD 50 ListFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet Lead Tech Earnings Bonanza: Investing Action Plan

63,LRCX,"Chip stocks are hoping for some much-needed good news in the week ahead as earnings season shifts into high gear.The week ahead will bring earnings reports from a bunch of closely watched chip companies, including Texas Instruments (TXN) on Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) on Thursday.The sector was knocked down over the past week by cautious reports from chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX).Investors fret the chip sector has peaked and is starting to enter a down cycle, analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Taiwan Semi said the sales weakness was related mostly to the smartphone sector, particularly Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker said sector growth areas like automotive, Internet of Things and data centers remained strong, Gill said.Lam Research also rattled chip stocks when it gave a disappointing outlook late Tuesday for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Fremont, Calif.-based Lam makes wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry.Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Friday said chip stocks could go 4% to 7% lower.

Analysts expect TI to earn $1.11 a share, up 14% year over year. That's on sales of $3.65 billion, up 7%, in the March quarter.Analysts say Santa Clara, Calif.-based AMD should earn 9 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss of 4 cents a share. That's on sales of $1.57 billion, up 59%, in its fiscal first quarter.Wall Street expects San Diego-based Qualcomm to earn 70 cents a share, down 48%, on sales of $5.19 billion, down 13%, in its fiscal second quarter.A legal dispute with major customer Apple has dampened its results in recent quarters. Apple refuses to pay technology licensing fees to Qualcomm until the legal matter is resolved.Also weighing on Qualcomm is the possibility that China could block its proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). On Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce gave a pessimistic preliminary review of the Qualcomm-NXP deal.Analysts see Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel earning 72 cents a share, up 9%, on sales of $15.05 billion, up 2%, in the first quarter.RELATED:Qualcomm To Cut 1,500 Jobs To Help Stave Off Broadcom MergerIntel Stock Nears Buy Point After Price-Target HikeChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

On that date, the U.S. is to impose 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech-related imports, with tariffs on another $16 billion in goods due shortly thereafter. China has said it will match Trump tariffs dollar for dollar, whenever they are imposed.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq all rallied early Wednesday on hopes that Trump's move to delay investment and export restrictions might keep the China trade war on the back burner.

Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would  ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy.Trump's latest decision could be a reprieve for the semiconductor sector.

91,LRCX,"Semiconductor equipment makers have greatly diverged over the last few quarters. While former top stocks Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) break down amid signs of slowing shipments, other semiconductor stocks are nearing potential entries and even attempting to break out in the stock market today.XChip gear maker Entegris (ENTG) tried to break out above a base's 38.35 buy point Thursday after announcing it acquired the SAES Pure Gas business from SAES Getters.

92,LRCX,"Some of the best software stocks were the hardest hit Thursday as sellers finally came into the Nasdaq composite after four straight gains. The Dow Jones industrial average ended higher, helped by solid performances from McDonald's (MCD), Chevron (CVX) and Procter & Gamble (PG).The Nasdaq lost 0.7%, but selling was more subdued in the S&P 500. The benchmark index eased 0.1%, while the Dow gained 0.4%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Wednesday.Big decliners in the Nasdaq 100 included chip-equipment firms Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT).

95,LRCX,"As the major averages edged lower on Thursday, chip-equipment stocks kept rising. The chip-gear group has led all industries this week. ASML Holding (ASML) broke out this week on strong earnings. Meanwhile, Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), Ichor Holdings (ICHR), Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) and Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP) are all in proper bases moving toward buy points.X Applied Materials, Lam Research and Ichor Holdings, like ASML, boast Composite Ratings of 95 or above. All-time stock winners often have 95-plus CRs near the start of big runs. (Electro Scientific and Cabot Micro have CRs of 91 and 90, respectively.)Meanwhile, Ichor Holdings and Electro Scientific have offered bullish sales guidance, helping to give the entire group a lift along with ASML.Industry strength is important. Leading stocks are heavily influenced by their industry group, so you want to see positive market and industry trends. The Electronics-Semiconductor Group is rated a so-so 74 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, though that ranking is improving after the chip sector slumped at the end of last year. The chip-gear group soared 7.4%, double the gain of the second-best performing industry.Applied Materials is in a cup base with a buy point of 60.99. Shares closed flat at 57.40 in Friday's stock market trading. But shares still soared 7.4% so far this week, reclaiming their 50-day moving average. Applied Materials' relative strength line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, has now hit a very short-term high, but is still well off the highs of the left side of the consolidation. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.)Applied Materials and Lam Research got upgrades earlier this week from Susquehanna Financial Group, saying they should benefit from strong demand from the memory chip field. Applied Materials also is a player in equipment for making organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays.Lam Research rose 1% to 207.53 on Friday, capping a 10.1% gain for the week. Lam Research has a 219.80 cup-base buy point. The RS line has topped a very short-term peak, but is still in the lower half of its current consolidation. That's a concern.Lam Research is due to report earnings next Wednesday.Ichor Holdings skyrocketed 6.8% on Thursday after surging nearly 20% on Wednesday, vaulting above its 50-day line. Ichor fell 1.1% to 32.39 on Friday, but still rose 31% for the week.Ichor, which makes fluid delivery subsystems for chipmaking equipment, is approaching a 35.61 buy point. Aggressive investors could have considered buying on Wednesday as Ichor broke a downtrend in heavy volume.Ichor's RS line has sprinted higher this week, but remains well off its old highs.What triggered this stock explosion? Ichor said Wednesday that it expects to report fourth-quarter revenue of $183 million, up 39% vs. a year earlier. Analysts had forecast $180 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. Even better, Ichor sees current-quarter revenue of $240 million to $250 million. That would be a 65% gain at the midpoint of $245 million.Ichor, which came public in December 2016, sank 1.4% early Friday.Electro Scientific Industries spiked 19.5% on Thursday to 26.30, rising to 27.65 intraday, just below a 27.82 buy point. The stock edged up 0.5% to 26.44 on Friday, up 32% this week. The RS line, which was at consolidation lows earlier this week, has shot above some short-term highs, but remains well off its late November peak.Thursday's move came after Electro Scientific reported preliminary fiscal third-quarter sales of $106 million to $111 million, a 221% gain at the midpoint. Analysts expected just $85 million.Shares of Cabot Microelectronics, which makes polishing slurries for use in the chipmaking process, didn't sell off as much as many of its peers late last year. The stock is generally finding support at its 50-day moving average. Since bottoming in mid-December, Cabot Micro has rallied, but generally in line with the broader market.Cabot Micro advanced 2.8% to 102.79 on Friday, approaching a 103.02 buy point in a shallow cup base.

97,LRCX,"Major indexes continued to stage a healthy rebound, breakouts gained more steam, and a key Bitcoin-driven ETF showed more signs that a longer-term correction in the alternative digital currency may be in the works.X Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which staged a tremendous price run of more than 1,500% in 2017, plunged as much as 18.3% intraday before shaving a majority of those losses.Yet shares in the Bitcoin-tracking exchange-traded note still dropped more than 7% to 1,607 and severely undercut the critical 50-day moving average for the first time since peaking at 3,522 in December. Bitcoin Investment had broken out on Nov. 22 from a large, deep cup with handle at 958.10 and gained more than 250% before topping. Concerns of South Korea mulling a move to ban cryptocurrency trading are apparently still weighing on traders.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite, the leading major index in 2017 with a 28.2% gain, rose nearly 1.1%, while the S&P 500 practically matched that advance. The Dow Jones industrial average spurted 1.1% higher, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least 12 of the 30 components.Longtime Dow Jones industrial component IBM (IBM) staged a bullish gap up as shares rose more than 2% to 168.59 in volume running double its 50-day average. The stock has also risen past a 162.61 buy point in a first-stage saucer with handle.This base is part of a long bottoming base process. The buy zone goes up to 170.74.Optimism is rising among analysts that Big Blue will finally break its multiyear slump in revenues. Q4 profit, meanwhile, is expected to inch up 3% to $5.16 a share, which would be the biggest increase in four quarters.IBM drums up a terrible Composite Rating of 42 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, but low Composite and other scores are typical for companies that have been lagging for years but are aiming at a real turnaround. On the positive side, a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating points to net buying among fund managers in IBM over the past 13 weeks.Buying only those stocks that show an Accumulation Rating of C+ or higher generally increases the odds of making money when buying a stock at the proper entry point.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 25.1% in 2017.The Dow transports edged up 0.3%; the Russell 2000 was up almost 0.6%. Volume is running mildly lower on both exchanges following a distribution day, or session of unusually intense institutional selling, on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.Top-ranking stocks as seen in IBD's key stockpicking screens mostly thrived, with several hailing from the semiconductor and related sectors. Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment ranks first among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD with a 3.5% lift. Homebuilding, computer networking, leisure products and oil drilling stocks also led the upside with gains of 2% each.Universal Display (OLED), No. 1 in the IBD 50, moved out of buy range as shares rolled nearly 3% higher to 204 in volume running more than 25% above normal levels.The expert in organic light emitting diodes for a range of electronic devices broke out past a 192.85 entry in a six-week cup without handle on Jan. 8 and has acted well since then. The 5% buy zone goes up to 202.49.Universal Display has sported four quarters in a row of excellent top and bottom-line growth. The Ewing, N.J., firm earned 28 cents a share in the third quarter vs. a 3-cent loss a year earlier. That followed EPS increases of 41%, 450% and 115%.No wonder, then, that Universal Display gets a top-notch 99 Earnings Per Share Rating from IBD, which means that the company's profit growth over the past three to five years and in recent quarters is superior to 99% of all companies in IBD's database.The Street expects earnings in Q4 to rise 53% to 84 cents a share on a 33% jump in revenue to $99.3 million. In Q1 of this year, Universal Display is seen growing earnings 41% to 31 cents a share and revenue up 20% to $66.9 million.Universal Display is ranked No. 1 in the IBD 50 and has a relatively small float of 41 million shares out of 47 million shares outstanding. A small float is bullish for growth stock investors, as it helps constrain supply of shares, one of tenets of IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point selection system for outstanding stocks. Plus, it takes fresh demand from only a few institutional investors, including hedge funds, pensions, banks and sovereign wealth funds, amid a limited supply of shares readily available for sale, to send a stock into breakout mode and into new highs.Universal Display is now a mid-cap stock with a value of $9.6 billion. Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in the stock have climbed from a combined 344 funds at the end of 2016 to 416 at the end of last year.Laser maker Coherent (COHR) (breakout at 320.83), scientific instruments maker IPG Photonics (IPGP) (cleared a cup at 248.33), semiconductor lithography systems expert ASML (ASML) (186.47 buy point in a solid flat base) have also broken out and shown positive action.Lam Research (LRCX), a huge winner since 2015, is building a base. Watch to see if shares can remain above the key 50-day moving average. If it does, it would boost the chances that the wafer cleaning and etching systems supplier can continue to flesh out the right side of a potential new base.Lam had cleared a 170.10 entry in a good flat base on Sept. 11 and rallied 29% before correcting in price. One of IBD's key sell rules is to take at least partial gains when a stock breaks out and advances at least 20% to 25% from the proper entry.Going back to Bitcoin Investment Trust, IBD noted in a prior Stock Market Today column how a definitive cross below the 10-day moving average offers a good exit point for short-term traders. Bitcoin Investment Trust violated its 10-day line on Dec. 20, just two days after it posted a closing peak of 3,463.Given the climax-run-style move that it made in mid-December, following strong gains earlier in the year, it's sensible to expect that it will take weeks, if not months, for the ETF to set up another proper buy point.Bitcoin, itself, took years to digest strong gains after it broke out in October 2013 and ran up from a breakout near 120 to a peak of 1,087 just two months later, an 800% gain in just two months. It took more than three years of basing before Bitcoin eclipsed that high.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on breakouts, growth stocks, and other financial markets.)RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Do You Know This Critical Chart-Reading Skill?How To Invest With Success: The Latest In Investor's CornerStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhen To Sell Stocks: What Does A Climax Run Look Like?How To Find Excellent Growth Stocks: Start With A Simple Routine

98,LRCX,"Semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers saw their shares jump on Wednesday after positive reports from ASML Holding (ASML) and Ichor Holdings (ICHR).X Dutch lithography gear specialist ASML on Wednesday delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and gave bullish commentary about the year ahead.Ichor, a provider of fluid delivery subsystems for chipmaking equipment, gave preliminary fourth-quarter results that topped views. Ichor shares soared nearly 20% to close at 30.66 Wednesday.Fremont, Calif.-based Ichor said it expects to post revenue of $183 million for the fourth quarter when it releases official results on Feb. 7. Analysts were modeling for $180 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.For the current quarter, Ichor guided to sales of $240 million to $250 million, with the midpoint of $245 million topping the consensus view of $207 million, Zacks said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks currently includes two chip-gear makers: Applied Materials and Lam Research.ASML shares jumped nearly 7% to finish at 199.18 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, ASML hit an all-time high of 201.20.Other chip-gear makers were on the move Wednesday as well. Applied Materials (AMAT) surged 5.2% to 57.34, and Lam Research (LRCX) leapt 7.7% to 205.08.Elsewhere, MKS Instruments (MKSI) jumped 5.8% to close at 103.30, and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) gained 5.4% to 113.49.And late Wednesday, Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) shares took off, soaring by more than 23% past the 27 mark in after-hours action. That followed a 9.5% gain during the regular session to close at 22.01.Electro Scientific reported preliminary fiscal third-quarter results after the close with revenue expected to reach $106 million to $111 million. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expected sales of $85 million.RELATED:3 Reasons To Be Wary Of Apple As Stock Retakes Buy Zone: S&P 500 FuturesApplied Materials, Lam Research Boosted By Upgrades; ASML Breaks OutChart Action For The Chip-Gear Stocks

99,LRCX,"Chip-gear makers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) received upgrades from a Wall Street firm on Tuesday, sending their shares higher. Meanwhile, industry peer ASML Holding (ASML) blasted higher on a bullish report published Monday.X Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini upgraded shares of Applied Materials and Lam to positive from neutral. He raised his price target for Applied Materials to 72 from 60 and for Lam to 250 from 200.Applied Materials shares were up 2% to close at 54.50 on the stock market today. Lam shares gained 1% to finish at 190.39.Hosseini said he is incrementally more positive on the semiconductor capital equipment market based on indications for ""stable spending"" through 2020. Applied Materials and Lam are both poised to benefit from continued strength in the memory chip market, he said.End-market demand drivers include enterprise and cloud computing service providers, such as Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN), which continue to build out their infrastructures, he said.Applied Materials also is aided by equipment sales to display manufacturers, such as gear to make next-generation liquid crystal display (LCD) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, Hosseini said.IBD'S TAKE: Lam Research is currently ranked No. 42 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Hosseini also reiterated his positive rating on ASML, which is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter financial results on Wednesday.ASML is being driven by a strong product cycle for its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) systems, he said. The Dutch company makes lithography systems used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.Investment bank Credit Suisse on Monday upgraded ASML to outperform from neutral.ASML climbed 3.1% to end the regular trading session at 186.38. Earlier in the session, it reached an all-time high of 188.49.B. Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis on Tuesday kept his neutral rating on ASML with a price target of 166.Ellis also issued a positive report on Applied Materials.

101,LRCX,"Stocks took a well-deserved break in afternoon trading Wednesday, yet the major indexes held losses modest in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to show market-leading action as shares move sideways after an Oct. 27 breakout.X Apple, one of the big-cap leaders of 2017, is down roughly 1% for the week following a 3.4% lift in the first trading week of 2018.Yet, more importantly, the mega-cap iPhone, iPad and digital services play has held nicely above a 160.97 buy point in a good cup with handle that the stock formed from early September to late October. A strong rebound off the 10-week moving average, currently near 172, offers a chance for buyers at the earlier buy point to add a small amount of shares to a winning position.Watch to see if volume also increases to the upside. The current daily average volume over the past 50 sessions for the consumer electronics giant is 28 million shares.Apple gained as much as 10% past the key 160.97 cup-with-handle entry and remains too far extended from that buy point. Following IBD's CAN SLIM stock selection system means buying no more than 5% past a proper buy point after a stock breaks out. The reason: You don't want to get shaken out at the wrong time.In that base, the correction of just 9.6% from the intraday high to intraday low was unusually shallow. In most cases, a cup with handle will show a decline from head to toe of 12% to as much as 33%. In some rare cases, the decline can reach 40% to 50% after a superlative prior price run.The 160.97 entry derives from adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle, or in Apple's case the intraday high seen on Oct. 17. Apple broke out eight sessions later, surpassing the top of a handle just ahead of reporting a 24% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter profit to $2.07 a share (its biggest year-over-year gain in eight quarters) and a 12% rise in revenue to $52.58 billion.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite remained off a bit more than 0.3% as sellers dominated among chipmaking and semiconductor equipment stocks. Lam Research (LRCX), a former IBD Big Cap 20 stock and big winner in 2017, fell more than 2% to 192.12 in fast turnover after trying to climb back above the key 50-day moving average on Monday. Despite a two-day drop, the expert in silicon wafer etching systems is clearly forming a new base.The S&P 500 was down almost 0.3%. Solid gains in airline, bank, department store, steel, metal ores, movie and gaming shares helped limit the downside. Last week, the large-cap benchmark rallied 2.6% on top of a 19.4% advance in 2017.The Dow Jones industrial average edged less than 0.2% lower, helped by strength in General Electric (GE) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Results from JPMorgan are due Friday before the open.JPMorgan broke out of a flat base with a 95.32 buy point on Sept. 21 and has risen as much as 16%.Besides Apple, the only other component in the Dow down 1 point or more is UnitedHealth (UNH). The managed care giant has carved a shallow five-week flat base that shows a 231.87 buy point.UnitedHealth, which garners a $216 billion market value, initially broke out all the way back in September 2010, clearing a 33.89 buy point in a saucer with handle. It created new bases along the way, providing additional correct entry points in the stock.Elsewhere in other financial markets, the rush out of U.S. government bonds got a boost on reports that China, a heavy buyer of Treasury securities, is mulling fewer purchases in the future. That actually is not new news, but the Bloomberg report still appeared to weigh on bond prices.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.58%, roughly 60 basis points above the 2-year note and 115 basis points above 3-month Treasury bill yields.Dividend-heavy utilities continue to sell off. Dominion Energy (D) dropped more than 1% to 76.07 in volume running 59% above average. A few weeks ago, the stock took out its 50-day moving average in heavy volume, a sell signal for most stocks.Be wary of buying high-yield stocks on the way down; it's no different from catching a falling knife among high-octane issues.The Dow utility average, which slid 3.1% last week, fell another 1.1% in the stock market today.Crude oil continues to climb, as WTI near-term futures ramped up 0.5% to $63.29 a barrel. In addition to constrained supply amid stricter production quotas being enforced by OPEC and Russia and low U.S. crude inventories, other factors for the rise may have to do with the fact that cash coming out of debt securities needs to find a new home.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) fell nearly 4% to 2,080 in dull turnover as its base building work continues. It lies 40% off a 3,522 all-time peak.Back to Apple, fiscal first-quarter results are due Feb. 1 after the close.Apple had a glorious first quarter in the market last year. On Jan. 6, the stock broke out ahead of quarterly results when it cleared a 118.12 buy point in a bottoming base and first-stage cup with handle. A few weeks later, Apple soared on better than expected results. That report led to a sustained turnaround in fundamentals.The gain from that initial 118.12 entry point has so far reached 50%.Wall Street expects growth in the top and bottom lines to continue. This boosts the prospects of further capital appreciation this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 12% vs. a year ago to $3.77 in the October-to-December quarter on a 10% lift in revenue to $86.17 billion.In fiscal Q2, expect growth to accelerate. Earnings may rise 39% to $2.92 a share on a 30% jump in revenue to $68.75 billion.Institutions savor the shares of companies that can accelerate their growth.Apple gets a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- on IBD Stock Checkup, while the Relative Strength Rating is good at 83. The EPS Rating of 90 on a scale of 1 to 99 is a remarkable improvement from a 45 all the way back on Jan. 1, 2017. RELATED:How To Find The Correct Buy Point For All StocksStocks Near A Buy ZoneWhich Hot Growth Stocks Are Leading The Market?

102,LRCX,"Semiconductor industry executives are confident the chip business will continue to see healthy growth in 2018, though not at last year's blistering pace, according to one advisory firm's survey.Lincoln Clark, head of the semiconductor practice at KPMG, said the survey results show ""tempered optimism"" for the industry this year.""It's unlikely we'll see a repeat of 2017's growth rate for global semiconductor revenue, but 2018 should be another successful year in its own right as more than one-quarter of the respondents expect their revenue to grow at least 6%,"" Clark said in a news release Tuesday.The survey also found that semiconductor leaders are more optimistic than they were last year when asked for their outlook on profitability, revenue growth, capital spending, research and development spending, and workforce growth, KPMG said.Growth drivers this year are expected to include cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, or IoT, the firm said.""Though the No. 1 revenue driver remains wireless applications, its importance fell slightly in 2018 though we do anticipate growth as 5G begins to roll out in future periods,"" Clark said.Of the 150 semiconductor industry leaders surveyed, 75% said wireless communications would be an important revenue driver this year. That's down from 84% in last year's survey.Internet of Things was the second most-cited revenue driver this year. IoT spans data devices including the connected home, smart cities and personal wearables. Some 63% of respondents said it would be an important driver in 2018, up from 56% last year.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks currently includes two chip industry players ASML and Nvidia.Cloud computing and AI jumped into the top 10 list of revenue drivers as they were each cited by 43% of respondents, compared with 27% for cloud last year and 18% for AI.Those drivers map with the growth strategies for major chipmakers include Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM).Spending on semiconductor capital equipment will continue ""at historically high levels,"" KPMG said in its report. Demand drivers for chip-gear capital expenditures include memory chips and cloud platforms, it said.That bodes well for major chip-gear vendors such as ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX).RELATED:Ichor Holdings Upgraded To Strong Buy; Veeco Rallies On Earnings ReportNvidia Cheers Investors; Qualcomm Rejects Sweetened Takeover Bid

103,LRCX,"Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) is poised for another winning year in 2018, a Wall Street investment bank predicted Monday.X Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said his best ideas in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in 2018 are unchanged from 2017. They include Nvidia, Micron Technology (MU), Analog Devices (ADI), Xilinx (XLNX), Western Digital (WDC), Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holding (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and Universal Display (OLED).""Yes, semiconductor stocks had an excellent run in 2017 – with the SOX up 39%,"" Muse said in a note to clients. ""But multiples still remain below the broader market and remain inexpensive vs. most other cyclicals. And very importantly, we believe we are on the cusp of true rising silicon intensity led by AI/Big Data (creation, transmission, analytics, storage) that will likely drive the third meaningful upcycle for semis.""Still, chip stocks will ""face a wall of worry"" in 2018 as fears persist that the current cycle is peaking, he said.Nvidia is likely to lead semi stocks for the third year in a row, thanks to its leadership in artificial intelligence, Muse said.He has a near-term price target on Nvidia of 250, but longer term sees it hitting 300.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes Nvidia, Applied Materials and Universal Display.Nvidia jumped 3% to close at 199.35 on the stock market today.In addition to artificial intelligence and Big Data, another technology trend in 2018 will be the continued adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays in smartphones, Muse said.The OLED trend is helping equipment maker Applied Materials and technology and materials supplier Universal Display, he said.RELATED:Entegris Looking For China Growth, Possible Acquisitions In 2018Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018Looking For The Next Nvidia?

The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average traded 1.2% and 1.3% lower. All three major indexes were on pace for their first weekly decline in 2018 after four straight weeks of solid gains.X In economic news, the U.S. economy added 200,000 jobs in January, above the 175,000 consensus estimate. The unemployment rate held at 4.1%, according to the Labor Department.Among the Dow Jones industrials, Apple (AAPL) dropped nearly 3% after providing weak guidance in the current quarter due to a slowdown in sales of the new iPhone X. The stock, which has been faltering in recent weeks, triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell level from a 176.34 flat-base buy point. Bearishly, the stock's relative strength line has been lagging for months and did not reach a new high on the stock's most recent breakout attempt.Elsewhere in the Dow, energy components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) reported disappointing earnings results early Friday, as their shares sold off 5% and 3%, respectively. Exxon fell below its 84.34 flat-base buy point, while Chevron was testing a 120.99 flat-base entry.Among companies reporting earnings, Amazon neared a new high after strong earnings results late Thursday. The e-commerce giant rose over 4% to recover from Thursday's over-4% decline. Shares are well-extended from a 1,213.51 flat-base buy point.Fellow FANG stock Alphabet (GOOGL) fell nearly 6% after reporting weak results due to increasing traffic costs.

107,LRCX,"In the past 12 months, the Big Cap 20 and a ""buy high"" strategy could've made the individual investor some nice profits. A look at how success unfolded could help the next time around.Few stocks have done better than PayPal (PYPL) in price performance. A year ago, the Big Cap 20 stock was too extended to buy. Some individual investors might've wondered about that.If the stock is too high to buy, why should it appear in the Big Cap 20? The question points to two misunderstandings. First, the Big Cap 20 is more of a watch list than a buy list. Second, ""too high to buy"" suggests the IBD-style investor is looking for bargains. Not so.An IBD investor would rather buy a stock at a higher price that is likely to work than a lower price that is unlikely to work. While that sounds counterintuitive, it's a sound strategy.In PayPal's case, the stock was extended in late May 2017 when it appeared on the Big Cap 20. But a patient investor was able to act on a valid buy point in mid-July. The stock crossed above a 55.24 buy point in a second-stage flat base and rose 42% in 20 weeks.That's how the IBD-style investor likes to make money.Let's look at some additional Big Cap 20 success stories from the year-ago lineup.Hotel chain Marriott International (MAR) was extended. The stock began to consolidate in early June. By mid-September, it had sketched a double-bottom base with a 107.73 buy point. Marriott broke out Sept. 20 in heavy volume.From there, Marriott rose 38% in 19 weeks.Chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) was extended. The stock began to consolidate in early June. Lam formed a cup-without-handle that went nowhere. A second side-by-side cup with handle led to a mid-September breakout. The stock cleared a 169.25 entry and advanced 29% in 11 weeks.Another chip-equipment maker, Applied Materials (AMAT), also consolidated in early June. The stock completed a cup-with-handle pattern over more than three months. Applied Materials broke out in mid-September. The stock rose 27% in 10 weeks.The two chip stocks succeeded despite being late-stage bases. Three factors may have helped the stocks overcome the odds.First, the chip sector was ranked No. 2 among 33 sectors. Second, the chip-equipment group was No. 18 among 197 groups. Third, the market was in the midst of a confirmed rally that would last 112 sessions.Nvidia (NVDA), a chip designer, was extended in May 2017. The stock broke out of a stage-two base in mid-September. Nvidia cleared a 174.66 entry.In nine weeks, Nvidia rose 25%.In each of these five cases, waiting to buy higher worked.RELATED:Morgan Stanley Raises Price Target On Apple StockBest Buy Gaps Down, Loses 50-Day Line16 Steps To Turn $15.26 Into $1 MillionMarketSmith: Four Weeks For $29.95

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseInvestment bank Goldman Sachs downgraded Applied Materials stock to neutral from buy. At least four Wall Street research firms cut their price targets on the stock: B. Riley FBR, Goldman, Needham and Nomura Instinet.Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari soured on Applied Materials because of its ""underwhelming"" market share outlook in its core semiconductor-equipment business. He also cited ""worse-than-feared fundamentals"" in its display-equipment business. Hari cut his 12-month price target on the stock to 58 from 65.Applied Materials expects its display-equipment sales to rise more than 30% this year, but sees a decline of 15% to 20% next year. That decline is much worse than the 1% drop that Hari had been modeling.""The deterioration in the outlook for Display is being driven by a weaker outlook for OLED adoption in smartphones, which is in turn driving capacity addition push-outs (from 2021 to 2023) at AMAT's OLED customers,"" he said in a note to clients.Shares of Universal Display (OLED), a leading supplier of OLED display materials and technology, fell 5.8%, to close at 94.10.Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said Applied's long-term prospects remain strong. The company is seen benefiting from the major tech trends of artificial intelligence and Big Data, he said.Applied Materials ""shares are just too cheap to ignore,"" Muse said in a report.

So did memory chip giant Micron Technology (MU).Meanwhile, China search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) fell sharply after announcing a key executive shakeup involving its artificial intelligence efforts.As for stock market futures today, Dow Jones futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn Thursday's stock market trading, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed with slim losses. Small caps continued to lead, with the S&P 600 rising for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Baidu says that COO Lu Qi will leave the role and no longer oversee the search engine giant's artificial intelligence efforts. Qi had joined the company in late 2016 to head up AI efforts. Baidu has made huge spending bets on AI to drive future growth.The stock fell 6.2% to 262.50 in premarket trading. That would push Baidu back below a conventional entry of 275.07 from a long consolidation.Applied Materials earnings rose 54% to $1.22 a share in its fiscal Q2, with revenue rising 29% to $4.57 billion. Both comfortably beat analyst views. But the chip-equipment maker sees Q3 revenue of $4.43 billion. That's roughly in line with the Zacks estimate of $4.45 billion, but clearly below other consensus targets for $4.53 billion.Applied Materials fell 5.1% in the premarket, suggesting a move below its 200-day moving average at Friday's open. On Thursday, the stock fell 2.2% to 53.96, once again hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average.The Applied Materials stock chart, which previously had been forming a double-bottom base, is starting to look like a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.Meanwhile, Lam Research lost about 1.5% early Friday. KLA-Tencor was not yet active Friday but had fallen late Thursday by about 1.5%. Lam has been fighting to hold above its 50-day, while KLA-Tencor is just above that level.Applied Materials is heavily exposed to the memory market, with over half its sales going to the DRAM and flash markets. Memory giant Micron Technology lost 0.6% early Friday. Micron fell 3.2% to 54.70 on Thursday. The IBD 50 chip stock has been building the right side of a consolidation, retaking its 50-day line on Monday.The broader chip sector has been so-so in recent months. Chipmakers and fabless chipmakers have done reasonably well, helped by Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) moving into buy range. A few others are consolidating in decent form, but breakouts are scarce. But chip-equipment makers have struggled in recent months, with the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group falling to 133 out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group's relative strength line has been lagging for nearly six months, reflecting its underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Typically, the broader stock market struggles to rally without chips. The major averages have largely done so in recent weeks in part due to the surge in oil stocks. But it's also due to Apple (AAPL), which is a huge buyer of chips. But Apple's big recent breakout reflects optimism about a $100 billion buyback, strong growth in services and Warren Buffett buying more shares. None of that benefits chipmakers. Indeed, iPhone shipments were slightly below estimates in the latest quarter.But with Apple now pausing after its 17% surge over nine sessions, watch to see if the relationship between chips and the broader market reasserts itself.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Small Caps Sail As Rest Of Market HesitatesBest Oil Stocks: Callon Petroleum Grows Like Gangbusters In Permian BasinThe Stock Market Myth That Too Many BelieveTop IPO Stock Triggers Sell Signal, But Rebounds; Is It Safe To Buy?Deere Reports, These 2 IBD 50 Stocks Form Bases: Investing Action Plan

The Oct. 27 breakout spurred an 11.9% rally through mid-January of this year, but Apple surrendered all of that gain amid the market's early-February correction.Apple now gets the worst possible E grade for Accumulation/Distribution based on price-and-volume action over the past 13 weeks. Indeed, the member of IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products industry group hasn't posted an up day in above-average turnover since March 2. Watch for a potential change in such interplay between price and volume and use either the stock quotes or IBD Stock Checkup to see if Apple's Accumulation grade can reach a C (neutral) or an A or B (net accumulation among institutional investors) in the coming weeks or months.When a stock breaks out of a well-formed base such as a flat base or double bottom, the Accumulation rating should ideally be at least C+ or higher.The Accumulation rating for the Nasdaq composite, found in the General Market Indicators page at the bottom of IBD's Big Picture column or in the Market Trend section of Investors.com, is currently a lowly D-.Read the latest corporate news on Apple by going to IBD's Technology section.Meanwhile, MKS Instruments (MKSI) also outperformed the major indexes with a 1.9% jump to 112.50 after popping to 115.60 intraday, The member of IBD's semiconductor equipment industry group rebounded back above its 50-day moving average, a sign of strength. Plus, MKS is above a prior buy point of 109.50 in a 15-week cup with deep handle and in buy range.The test of the 50-day line is MKS' first since its Feb. 15 breakout. Normally, during a confirmed market uptrend, such a rebound off or back above this medium-term support level offers holders a chance to add shares to a winning position. Currently, the market is still in an official correction and it's not clear yet if the overall market sell-off has ended.MKS is expected to grow first-quarter earnings 57% to $2 a share, on top of a 234% boost in the same quarter a year ago.Three more chip-related names that deserve close watch:Lam Research (LRCX): The chip equipment giant, up 2.2% to 194.89, is trying to end nearly two weeks of being submerged beneath its 50-day moving average.

"
153,LRCX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Thursday morning after the major averages rebounded strongly Wednesday.X Apple (AAPL) moved into buy range for the third time in a month after announcing plans to repatriate nearly all of its ""overseas"" cash to the U.S. But volume was just so-so, Apple's relative strength line remains near recent lows, and iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) generally continue to struggle.Meanwhile, chip gear maker ASML Holding (ASML) blasted past a buy point on strong earnings, while collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) moved firmly into a buy zone a day ahead of its quarterly report. Both ASML and Altassian moved in strong volume with encouraging gains in their RS lines, signaling the stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 indexS&P 500 futures climbed 0.15% above fair value. Dow futures rose nearly 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were a fraction above fair value.Apple announced plans to repatriate nearly all its overseas cash to take advantage of tax reform changes. The Dow industrials component will pay $38 billion in taxes, give a $2,500 bonus to employees, and boost its advanced manufacturing investment fund to $5 billion from $1 billion.Shares of Apple erased intraday losses to rally 1.65% to 179.10 in Wednesday's stock market trading, reclaiming a 176.34 flat-base buy point yet again, following one-day moves over that entry on Dec. 18 and Jan. 12. But the same three problems remain that should make investors wary.Volume: Apple's volume rose 12% above normal, which is actually a little better than the prior two moves into a buy zone. But the volume is well below the minimum 40%-50% above-average increase you'd like to see to reflect institutional buying.Relative strength: Apple's RS line — the blue line in the chart below — is near the bottom of its recent consolidation, and Thursday's move didn't mark a big shift. Apple's 1.65% gain wasn't that much better than the S&P 500's 0.9%. Apple's RS line hasn't made much headway since May.IPhone ecosystem: If Apple's prospects are so strong, then why aren't iPhone chipmakers also breaking out, or at least making moves toward doing so? Broadcom is stuck below its 50-day moving average, while Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) are below their 50-day and 200-day lines. All three have lagging RS lines.Can Apple's low-volume, lagging-RS move into buy zone work? Sure, but the odds of big gains are lower, while the risks of failure are higher.The Dutch chip gear maker tried to clear a 186.47 cup-base entry on Tuesday, but with the market reversing lower ASML settled for a 3% rise to 186.38. On Wednesday, ASML gapped higher on a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue. Shares blasted past the entry point and traded part of the session in the 5% buy zone before closing up 6.9% to 199.18, slightly extended. Investors should look to see if ASML pulls back into the buy zone or, eventually, to its 50-day moving average for an entry point.ASML roared higher on triple normal volume. The stock's RS line moved above a recent consolidation, providing some confirmation of the bullish price action, while approaching the late-November peak.Another reason to be bullish about ASML: Unlike Apple chipmakers, several chip equipment makers made bullish moves and/or news. Ichor Holdings (ICHR) shot up 20% on strong preliminary revenue figures and bullish sales guidance, skyrocketing back above its 50-day line. After the close, Electro Scientific (ESIO) leapt more than 20% on its own bullish guidance, signaling a move toward a buy point.KLA-Tencor (KLAC) reclaimed a buy point in volume that was so-so: 22% above normal. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) rose strongly as they build the right side of bases.Even if none of these stocks looks as good as ASML, industry-group moves are important for even leading stocks.Atlassian, like ASML, also tried to break out on Tuesday, but closed below a 53.55 cup-base entry. On Wednesday, shares popped 3.9% to 54.87 in volume that was 69% above normal. The RS line is above a very short-term high and is making progress on reaching the highs of the left side of the consolidation.But Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday evening, with investors expecting a 33% EPS gain to 12 cents.

156,LRCX,"Tuesday's premarket trading received several shots in the arm. First was Netflix (NFLX), which surged after reporting strong first-quarter results late Monday. Then a cohort of blue chip names kicked in and posted early advances, following above-expectation quarterly results.The result: futures for the Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 1%. The S&P 500 traded 0.8% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures pressed 1.1% higher.Netflix was the premarket trading powerhouse, up more than 7% and easily the largest gainer among Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 stocks. Merck (MRK) bolstered the Dow in early trade, following an analyst upgrade. But the drugmaker quickly surrendered its lead as investors waded into an early batch of blue-chip earnings reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The positive premarket trading poised the week-old uptrend to hurdle resistance. The uptrend is in good standing, carrying no distribution days. But the 50-day moving average remains the key test for all three major indexes. The Dow failed to hold above its 50-day line on Monday, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have yet to break back above the critical level of support.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePremarket action suggested the Dow and the S&P 500 would open above their 50-day lines. Keep in mind that futures-driven premarket trading does not always translate to action during the regular session.On the Dow, UnitedHealth rolled up an early 2.5% gain on first-quarter results that were stronger than expected. The stock retook its 50-day line of support with a 2.6% gain on Monday, attempting to start up the right side of a four-month consolidation.Also on the Dow, Merck buzzed ahead 2.1%, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight, from equal weight. The drugmaker surged 2.6% in heavy trade Monday, after the company's lung-cancer treatment outperformed competitors in clinical trials. Merck is up 11% from an early April low and, like the overall Dow index, stands poised to test resistance at its 50-day moving average.Further down the list of early Dow advancers, Johnson & Johnson trimmed its early gain to 0.3%. The medical products leader reported first-quarter results in which earnings and revenue topped analysts' targets, and full-year guidance met or beat expectations.Goldman Sachs reversed an early loss, stepping up 0.9% after clobbering first-quarter earnings expectations and raising its quarterly dividend nearly 7%.  The stock has spent three days fighting resistance at its 50-day moving average.IBD Leaderboard stocks churned out some strong early moves, drafting Netflix's early advance. The streaming entertainment leader reported first-quarter sales and earnings only narrowly above consensus targets. But a blowout beat in subscriber growth surprised investors and launched shares higher in premarket trading. Netflix shares remain extended after a rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Planet Fitness (PLNT) popped 1.6% ahead of the open.  The gym network ended Monday a bit more than 2% below a 40.14 buy point in a second-stage flat base.Leader peer Lululemon Athletica (LULU) pared its early surge back to 0.3% in premarket trading. The company late Monday named Patrick Guido its chief financial officer, effective April 30. The stock has jumped 18% over the past three weeks.China-based stocks were mixed, as after markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai ended lower Tuesday, despite data showing the country's GDP expanded 6.8% during the first quarter. Retail sales surged 35.4%, while investment in education soared 26.9%. China's Commerce Ministry also announced its would impose 179% tariffs on sorghum imported from the U.S. The ministry said an investigation found the grain was unfairly subsidized by the U.S. government.March IPO IQiyi (IQ) jumped 2.3% in premarket trading. Shares of the Netflix-like platform advanced over the past six sessions, rising 9.7% above their March 29 IPO price.Housing starts jumped in March to an annualized rate of 1.32 million, the Commerce Department reported. That was a healthy uptick from February's disappointing 1.295 rate of home starts, startling economists who had projected a rate of 1.264 million new projects.Building permits, which gauge upcoming activity, posted an even larger increase — to an annualized rate of 1.354 million. February's permits clocked a 1.321 million pace.

But the chip sector, along with key semiconductor stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT), Texas Instruments (TXN), undercut recent levels Friday, while Micron Technology (MU) wiped out big gains and flashed sell signals.The chip action is worrisome for the stock market rally attempt. It's hard for stocks to have a sustained advance without chips taking part. For one, chips are a big part of the overall market, especially the tech sector. Second, if chip stocks are struggling, that could be a bad sign for demand in the vast array of products that use chips, from the Apple (AAPL) iPhone to a Tesla (TSLA) Model 3.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbled 3.1% on Friday, undercutting its April 2 low. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF also did so. Notably, the Philly Sox index retreated on Thursday. The major averages rose somewhat that day, but volume was light and the Nasdaq lagged.Nvidia retreated 7.5% last week to a two-month low. But its real problems began March 27, when Nvidia said that it was halting self-driving tests. That also was bad news for Nvidia customer Tesla. That was a bad day for the general market, with the Nasdaq finding resistance at the 50-day line and reversing sharply lower.But there were warning signs earlier that day. Soon after the March 27 open, Applied Materials and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points, but quickly backed off.Last week Applied Materials skidded 5.9% last week to its worst levels since mid-February, approaching its 200-day line. Texas Instruments' relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a two-month low.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMicron Technology was a rare chip stock that was a market leader in recent weeks. Micron had a powerful breakout from late February and rapidly ran up. But the memory-chip giant has sold off 23% from its March 13. On Friday, shares nearly completed a round trip back to the 47.08 double-bottom base buy point. Micron closed below its 50-day line.Micron's sell-off dragged down several other memory plays, including chip-gear makers Applied Materials and Lam.However, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, Nvidia and Micron were all up about 1% in premarket trading Monday.Another factors also aren't encouraging. The three-day stock market rally came on increasingly light volume, while Friday's sell-off came on heavier trade. That's classic stock market correction behavior.Some recent breakouts, such as Five Below (FIVE), Vipor Energy Partners (VNOM), fell back below buy points on Friday. Apple and Netflix (NFLX), which reclaimed their 50-day moving averages by Thursday, fell back below those levels on Friday.Despite Friday's big retreat, the put/call ratio came in at a relatively tame 1.04. That fear gauge is below the 1.15 level that often indicates a short-term bottom. The market has several big sell-offs over the past 10 weeks, only to bounce back quickly, sometimes that very day. So even a stock market correction, investors may be complacent.Instead, that lack of investor panic should be one more reason to worry. If nothing else, the recent market swings should underscore the importance of not trying to jump back into stocks before a confirmed rally.As long as the major averages hold above recent lows, the stock market rally attempt is still live. If one or more of the major averages rises strongly in heavier volume on Monday, that could confirm the new uptrend.Stock market futures indicated a solid open Monday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Trump's Trade War Takes Out BullsMicron, Texas Instruments Hit With Sells As Broker Starts CoverageNetflix, 3 Top IPOs Join Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Earnings Growth If You're Not Following This Sector Leader Closely, You Should Be After Market Sell-Off, These Stocks Added To, Cut From IBD Lists

A few new IPOs impressed.Internet television network Netflix cheered investors with third-quarter subscriber additions that trounced expectations, though earnings growth missed views.

Rival investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) also beat, but some analysts raised concerns that its results were helped by its more volatile and capital intensive lines of business.

Earlier in the session Ichor notched a record high of 35.51. Ichor went public at 9 a share in December.Fremont, Calif.-based Ichor makes gas- and chemical-delivery subsystems for chipmaking equipment.Daryanani raised his earnings estimates for Ichor for the next four quarters, ""given recent positive industry data points.""Ichor is being boosted by strong underlying wafer fabrication equipment trends from key customers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), Daryanani said in a report.

197,LRCX,"Major indexes edged higher at midday Monday, the start of a holiday-shortened week that currently see the market in a confirmed uptrend.Apple (AAPL) backtracked in light volume, and another light-volume drop could put shares back in buy range. Last month, Apple cleared a brand-new cup with handle, moving past a 160.97 entry. The 5% chase zone extends up to 169.02.XOther key megacap and big-cap techs to keep watching with less than two months to go in 2017 include Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). All five of these names rank in the latest IBD Big Cap 20.All five of these names are currently extended from a proper buy point. However, given their excellent fundamentals, superior position within their respective markets, and outstanding relative price strength, they certainly deserve a spot on a long-term watch list. New follow-on entry points or new bases will eventually emerge.At 1 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose close to 0.2%. Most Chinese ADRs flexed strength, following a third straight advance for the Hang Seng equities benchmark in Hong Kong. Volume is running sharply lower vs. the same time on Friday, which saw turnover boosted by expiring monthly and weekly stock and index options.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied nearly 0.4%, buoyed by 1-point gains or more by at least five of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and IBM (IBM).Investors received additional confirmation that the U.S. economy is rising. The leading indicators index showed a 1.2% gain in October, blasting the Econoday consensus view of up 0.6% and a big improvement from a 0.2% drop in September.Home Depot barreled more than 1.5% higher to 170.49, good for a new all-time high. The stock marked a follow-on entry point as it bounced off the rising 10-week moving average near 165 last week in hefty volume.Those who bought shares when the stock cleared earlier buy points may add a small amount of shares to the winning position. Adding shares to your best stocks is a great way to compound your overall return, but it should only be done when the market is in a solid uptrend, as noted in the Market Pulse table of IBD's The Big Picture.The Street sees the home improvement chain's earnings rising 12% to $1.62 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January. That would extend Home Depot's streak of double-digit profit growth to 16 quarters in a row.No wonder Home Depot's EPS Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is a very respectable 92 on scale of 1 (atrocious earnings) to 99 (exceptional profit growth, both near and long term).Back to Apple, the stock provides multiple reasons why the outlook for a continued fundamentals turnaround remains very strong.Earnings per share jumped 24% to $2.07 in the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, and Apple crushed the consensus view by nearly 11%. But perhaps more importantly, the iPhone marketer is poised to continue growing profit at double-digit pace into the next fiscal year.The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings (for the quarter ending in December, a big-time shopping month) rising 12% to $3.77 a share; that would also be a quarterly best.A second reason to have confidence in Apple's turnaround? Revenue growth is accelerating. In the latest quarter, revenue jumped 12% to $52.58 billion, the biggest year-over-year gain in nearly three years. Analysts on consensus see sales picking up 10%, 30%, 25% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the next four quarters.Three, Apple's ratings in IBD Stock Checkup continue to stay solid and show dramatic improvement vs. the start of the year. While the Composite Rating dipped just a bit to 89, it's still up strong from a lowly 51 on Jan. 1. The RS Rating continues to reflect leadership among big caps at 83.Four, the daily and weekly chart action for Apple has not shed any sell signals, other than to take profits at 20% to 25% for those who wish to raise some cash and look for perhaps a better growth name. Apple has jumped nearly 50% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. Meanwhile, the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, on a scale of A to E, indicates mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and insurers are overall net accumulators of Apple shares.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

199,LRCX,"The S&P 500 index was slightly lower for the week even as Dow components Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) skyrocketed on strong earnings and hopes that the titans will continue to transition into faster-growth markets. The Dow's General Electric (GE) tumbled as Wall Street isn't sold on its turnaround plan. Tesla (TSLA) unveiled new future vehicles even as it struggles to get the Model 3 out the door and General Motors (GM) ramps up its electric car goals.

Shares tumbled below their 200-day line on Wednesday but regained that key level by the end of the week.New General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery offered up a plan to turn around the troubled industrial giant, but Wall Street found GE's strategic vision held little that was new or bold.

Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September. The overall 0.2% gain edged past expectations, but came in on the weak side outside of autos with a 0.1% rise.Emirates announced an order for 40 Boeing (BA) 787-10s, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices, instead of the expected Airbus (EADSY) A380 order.

212,LRCX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were essentially flat early Tuesday morning, while Dow industrials continued to outperform and Nasdaq 100 futures pulled back.X For a second straight session, the S&P 500 dipped Monday as top techs such as chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), Micron Technology (MU), ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) crashing through key support in recent days, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbling through its 50-day line on Monday.Losses by chips and leading techs such as Facebook (FB), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) offset gains by financials, retailers, transports and media companies.It's hard for the market to advance without the chip sector. Not only are key parts of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index, but they are involved in so many other tech fields. Nvidia is a great example with its graphics chips and cards expanding from PC gaming fields to autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and even Bitcoin mining.S&P 500 index futures were just a fraction above fair value. Dow industrial futures climbed 0.3% after blue chips added 0.2% in Monday's stock market trading. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.3% after the composite closed down 1.1%.Nvidia tried to retake its 50-day moving average on Monday, but reversed hard to close down 5.6% to 186.66, nearly 15% off its Nov. 20 peak.The recent heavy-volume retreat suggests investors may consider taking profits in the highflier. The stock is still slightly extended from a 174.66 buy point, but don't let a 10%+ gain turn into nothing or a loss.Nvidia fell 0.9% in premarket trading.Micron Technology has fallen for six straight sessions, starting when Morgan Stanley predicted that memory chip prices will fall. Micron fell below its 50-day line last Thursday and found resistance at the level the past two sessions.Micron edged lower early Tuesday.Chip-equipment makers ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research plunged through their 50-day moving averages in heavy volume on Nov. 29, flashing clear sell signals. The chip-equipment makers have continued to fall since then.ASML and Lam Research edged lower in early trading, while Applied Materials was not yet active.ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research have the biggest market caps among IBD's chip-equipment group. The eight largest chip-gear firms are all below their 50-day lines.Not every chip stock is in freefall.Intel (INTC), the world's largest chipmaker and a Dow component, has pulled back modestly in recent weeks, but remains above its 50-day moving average. Intel has expanded from chips for the PC market to data centers and, greatly aided by its Mobileye acquisition, targeting the automotive market.Broadcom (AVGO) also has pulled back, testing a recent buy point on Monday before rebounding somewhat. But it's in better health than most. The Apple (AAPL) chip supplier turned its unsolicited Qualcomm (QCOM) bid into a hostile effort, nominating directors to replace Qualcomm's entire board.RELATED:The Big Picture: Nasdaq Slumps As Leaders Hammered AgainFacebook, Nvidia Lead 5 Top Stocks Failing Test At This Key Support LevelStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksTechs Fall As Tax Reform Favors These IndustriesChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

215,LRCX,"Leading semiconductor and chip-gear stocks were in the green on Thursday, continuing their winning ways.Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) rose a fraction to 191.03 on the stock market today, after getting a price-target hike from RBC Capital Markets. In intraday trading, it hit an all-time high of 193.09.Nvidia stock broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 174.66 on Sept. 15 and is now extended beyond its buy zone.RBC analyst Mitch Steves raised his price target on Nvidia stock to 220 from 205 and reiterated his outperform rating. He sees solid demand for graphics chips for gaming devices and PCs as well as data centers.Nvidia is currently ranked No. 6 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. It is one of six chip industry players on IBD's flagship stock screen. The others are Lam Research (LRCX), Applied Materials (AMAT), Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Ichor Holdings (ICHR).Five of those six IBD 50 stocks notched record or multiyear highs on Thursday. The outlier was Ichor, which notched an all-time high of 31.68 on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Ichor jumped 3.8% to 31.34 on Thursday.Lam Research rose 0.4% to 186.99.

216,LRCX,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have continued to pick up shares in chip stocks like Applied Materials (AMAT) and Intel (INTC), as well as in building-related companies, including Thor Industries (THO), Pulte Group (PHM) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).XWith an eye toward the growth of industrial output, leading fund managers also invested in five chemical companies, including DowDuPont (DWDP), Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and plastics manufacturer Rogers (ROG).Fifty-one leading mutual funds also took a nearly $128 million gulp of energy drink leader Monster Beverage (MNST), which cleared a 57.35 buy point on, quite appropriately, Halloween.  The Coca-Cola (KO) partner is trading 1% above the entry, meaning it's still in the buy zone, which extends to 60.22.Monster sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and five quarters of rising fund ownership. The maker of Monster Rehab and other drink brands is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 8, with analysts expecting 21% EPS growth. Note that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports.DowDuPont received the biggest investment of any stock on the list, as 73 funds purchased $16.7 billion worth of shares. But that number is skewed by the merger of Dow Chemical Co. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. that was just completed in September to create the new entity. The chemical giant's market cap stands at just over $88 billion, and the stock has eased back into the buy zone after become extended from a breakout in September.Forty-two funds invested just over $1.7 billion in leading chip stock Intel, which broke out on Oct. 2, then soared over 7% on Oct. 27 after reporting third-quarter earnings. Intel is now about 22% above the initial buy point.UnitedHealth (UNH) was the only other company to join the billion-dollar club, with 67 funds investing $1.2 billion.  The megacap managed-care stock has continued to climb since a breakout in March 2016, clearly boosted by seven quarters of rising fund ownership.Semiconductor stocks like IBD 50 members Applied Materials and Lam Research (LRCX) have been on a tear since the beginning of 2016, but it's a cyclical industry, so investors should be ready to lock in gains if the stocks begin to show topping action.In addition to Applied Materials, Lam Research, IBD Big Cap 20 stock Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel, six more semiconductor-related companies made this month's list, a sign that institutional investors are continuing to put their chips on the table, so to speak. Time will tell if, in the short term, that turns out to be a good bet.Applied Materials is 19% above its recent 47.69 buy point in a later-stage cup with handle, putting just below a potential profit-taking zone. Lam Research is already in the 20% - 25% profit-taking area.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and automaker General Motors (GM) topped the list of new sells this month. JPMorgan showed 42 net sellers (89 selling minus 47 buying), while GM had 29 (43 selling, 14 buying).Megacap medical stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) came in third, with 24 net sellers (68 selling, 44 buying).Despite the selling, Johnson & Johnson is still within buy range after retaking a 137.18 entry on Oct. 17 after reporting a 13% rise in Q3 earnings.JPMorgan has continued to climb beyond a 95.32 buy point, but after reporting earnings on Oct. 24, General Motors has been giving back a chunk of the 25%-plus gains it made from a breakout in September. So far, GM has found support at its 50-day line.RELATED: Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsMutual Fund Managers Like Foreign And U.S. Stocks If Taxes Are CutVideo: How To Find & Track The Best ETFs

217,LRCX,"Tech stocks led the major market indexes higher Monday as the Broadcom (AVGO)-Qualcomm (QCOM) deal grabbed the spotlight.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) gained 0.3%, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) each climbed 0.1%. Emerging markets outperformed with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) rallied 1.1%.QQQ hit an all-time high as tech stocks advanced. Apple (AAPL) was up more than 1% at a record high and is extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point. Apple retail stores reportedly sold out of the new iPhone X by Sunday evening.Energy, semiconductor and real estate were among the biggest sector fund gainers in the stock market today. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) gapped up and rose more than 1% each. Qualcomm rose 2% to extend Friday's 13% surge, which occurred amid Broadcom's offer to buy the chipmaker in a deal valued at $130 billion.Also among chips, Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were higher on reports the two chip companies are teaming up.Oil and gold funds were mostly higher as the respective underlying commodities saw price gains. VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) surged nearly 4% each, the latter to a six-month high. West Texas intermediate crude prices gained 3% to $57.29 a barrel.VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) were up more than 2% apiece.

However, the solo non-big-cap fund on the list is also the top performer based on year-to-date returns through Oct. 31.Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) racked up a 38.2% gain, thanks in part to a 15.1% jump in the past three months. That's more than double the S&P 500's 16.9% return. Morningstar Direct classifies the $186.4 million fund as midcap growth. FFTY is out of buy range from a 30.23 flat-base entry cleared in late August. But a new buy opportunity could arise if shares pull back to and find support at the 50-day moving average.Launched in April 2015 in partnership with Innovator Capital Management, the ETF tracks the IBD 50 Index, which comprises the top 50 growth stocks selected by IBD. Companies in the index tend to share traits of the market's biggest winning stocks such as outstanding profit and sales growth, wide profit margins and a high return on equity.FFTY's top holdings as of Nov. 2 included chip names Nvidia (NVDA) and Lam Research (LRCX), Universal Display (OLED) and Align Technology (ALGN). Nvidia has nearly doubled in price this year, while Universal Display has surged over 180%. With Innovator Capital Management's IBD 50 ETF, you can trade the IBD 50 in just one transaction.Up next is iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), with a 33.6% YTD gain.

The $4.6 billion fund, which tracks the MSCI USA Momentum Index, marked its fourth anniversary in April.Information technology accounted for the biggest chunk of assets at 34%, followed by 25% in financials and about 13% each in consumer discretionary and health care. Industrials made up 12%.

220,LRCX,"Key U.S. indexes are keeping solid gains with less than half an hour to go on Friday and look poised to even post modest gains for the week. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, was fighting for a positive weekly finish and may be showing that its respectable run after the Jan. 6-9 breakout past 118.12 is far from over.While the threat of a military conflict in North Korea helped sour Wall Street's mood early during the July Fourth holiday-shortened trading week, Friday's better than expected report on U.S. payrolls in June (up 222,000, vs. the Econoday consensus view of 170,000) appeared to help enliven the bulls.Meanwhile, Tradeweb noted that the yield spread between the U.S. 2- and 10-year Treasury notes is now at the widest level since mid-May. This is good news for both the finance sector and the general economy.The Nasdaq composite, boosted by strength in the fiber optic gear, semiconductor equipment, fabless chip and various software industries, rallied more than 1%. That's ahead of advances of 0.7% and 0.5% for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, respectively. The Russell 2000 rose 0.9%; at 1413, the small-cap benchmark is trying to cut its weekly loss to a fractional amount.Volume was running lower on both main markets vs. the same time Thursday.Apple, up more than 1% to 144.53, traded in light volume. For weeks, the iPhone and iPad giant has swum in a narrow price channel of 142 to 148. However, that's good news for long-term holders in that Apple is still within arm's length of regaining its 50-day moving average. The stock is just 7% below a 156.65 all-time high.In contrast, Qualcomm (QCOM), which has lodged another patent technology infringement lawsuit against Apple, is lagging the market and fellow wireless tech-related names for these reasons:One, the big cap is trading below both the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Two, at 55.41, down more than 1%, Qualcomm is trading more than 22% below its 52-week peak of 71.62. The stock would have to rise a lot more than Apple to stage a breakout.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Qualcomm also sports a lowly RS Rating of 19 on a scale of 1 to 99. Apple has improved its rating to 83, meaning it's outrun 83% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.However, keep an eye on Apple's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is currently weak at D-.Wall Street sees Apple's earnings rising 7% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $8.93 a share, then accelerating to an 18% increase in FY 2018. In contrast, analysts see Qualcomm's earnings dropping 4% to $4.25 a share in FY 2017 (also ending in September) and down 8% in FY 2018.IBD's TAKE: Apple has gained more than 32% since it cleared a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. You can improve your results by mastering this key chart pattern that has showed up among great winners in the U.S. market going back to the late 19th century. Read more about the cup with handle and other bullish chart patterns as well as important sell signals to lock in gains after a breakout at Investor's Corner.Elsewhere in the stock market today, IBD 50 names Veeva Systems (VEEV), Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and Sina (SINA) deserve focus as these fast-growing medical software, tech and internet plays are trying to reclaim or spring off their rising 50-day moving average lines, a sign of power.The average EPS increase in the latest quarter for the first three is 105%, while Sina posted a profit of 50 cents a share vs. a net loss of 4 cents in the year-ago quarter. Sina is expected to grow Q2 profit 107% to 56 cents a share, more than meeting the C in IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm.

Analyst Stephen Tanal sees a high level of uncertainty about earnings in coming years due to the disruption in the grocery space, noting the expansion of European discounters in the U.S.Wells Fargo cut its price target to 28 from 35, keeping an outperform rating, saying that Kroger's discounting to preserve market share was more aggressive than expected amid tough competition, as Wal-Mart (WMT) cuts prices and Amazon (AMZN) invests to grow its grocery business.Shares of Kroger fell 9,2% to 92.29 Friday, hitting a three-year low after tumbling 18.9% Thursday.The downgrade didn't help, but Kroger and other grocery sellers tumbled on Amazon's deal to buy Whole Foods Market (WMT).Stifel raised its price target on the cloud-based provider of medical records and billing management software to 151 from 106, keeping a hold rating.

222,LRCX,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

223,LRCX,"Small caps swaggered to a 1.4% gain for the Russell 2000 near midday Wednesday, as the major indexes did about half as well.XThe Nasdaq rose 0.9% while the S&P 500 added 0.8%. Blue chips were up almost without exception as the Dow Jones industrial average popped 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq.In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, four stocks advanced 1% or more: Walt Disney (DIS), Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and American Express (AXP). Volume was above average for Disney and JPMorgan but average to below average for American Express and Caterpillar.Chart-wise, JPMorgan is the most attractive of the four. The money center has formed a 13% deep consolidation, which is shallow enough for a flat base. The buy point would be 94.08. However, the daily chart looks somewhat like a double-bottom with a potential entry at 89.23. The stock cleared the 89.23 entry in the first 20 minutes of trade Wednesday but then pulled back under the entry.Money centers are in the bottom fifth among 197 industry groups, but JPMorgan has some quality support. Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), an A+ rated fund, increased its JPMorgan stake by 18% in Q1. Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX), an A rated fund, raised its stake by 6% in Q1.In the Nasdaq 100, TripAdvisor (TRIP) scored the best gain, a 5% advance in heavy volume. The stock is a laggard with a Relative Price Strength Rating of 6, which means about 94% of stocks are showing better price action than TripAdvisor.In the IBD 50, a computer-generated list of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, chip stocks rose. Chip designers Nvidia (NVDA) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) popped by 2% and 1% respectively.

224,LRCX,"The major market averages moved  higher Wednesday after Tuesday's brutal tech sell-off. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which briefly erased gains, powered higher with a 0.9% rise after Tuesday's sharp sell-off. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index gained 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.6%, led once again by financials.Among the Dow industrials, financial components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) rose nearly 1%. Goldman saw its price target hiked to 240 from 230 at Credit Suisse. JPMorgan briefly moved above a choppy double-bottom base with a 89.23 buy point. Heavy machinery company Caterpillar (CAT) moved up 1.3%.On the downside, Microsoft (MSFT) rose 0.4%, trading back above its 50-day line after undercutting that support on Tuesday.Within the S&P 500, financials were having a strong showing early Wednesday. Life insurer Prudential Financial (PRU) and Bank of America (BAC) both advanced more than 2%. Both stocks are consolidating above their 50-day moving average lines.Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Lam Research (LRCX), which broke through their key support levels Tuesday, initially fell but rebounded to rise modestly.Leading brokerage firm Charles Schwab (SCHW) jumped 0.7% to 42.91, building upon yesterday's breakout attempt above a 42.71 cup-with-handle entry.Among analyst actions in the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA) rose nearly 3% after Mizuho raised its price target to 170 from 145. The graphics chip maker has been consolidating sideways since a nasty reversal three weeks ago.Meanwhile, online travel site Expedia (EXPE) was upgraded to buy from hold at Citi. Shares traded 1.1% higher, and remains extended from its 132.27 cup-with-handle buy point.Among companies reporting earnings, KB Home (KBH) showed solid results late Tuesday, causing shares to climb 3.2% in early trading. The homebuilders have been steadily rising over the past several months, buoyed by mostly positive earnings results. KB Home reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and sales results.

225,LRCX,"Futures for the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial averages were mixed Wednesday morning, with big techs continuing to slide. That came after a slew of top-rated techs — including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Netflix (NFLX) — undercut their 50-day moving averages Tuesday, joining recent laggard Apple (AAPL).X As for the major averages, the Nasdaq composite fell 1.6%, the S&P 500 index 0.8% and the Dow industrials 0.5% on Tuesday.The heavy selling among leading stocks and major averages triggered a shift in market direction to ""uptrend under pressure."" The market came under pressure earlier this month, when Apple and other big techs sold off on June 9-10. But most leading techs, Apple being a notable exception, found support above their 50-day lines. On Tuesday, Alphabet fell below that level for the first time since April. Microsoft closed below its 50-day for the first time in seven months. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hadn't finished below that support zone since early December.Facebook (FB), which announced that it now has more than two billion monthly users, did manage to hold above its 50-day line. So did Amazon (AMZN), the final member of FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) and an IBD Leaderboard stock.Futures for the Dow industrials rose 0.25% above fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%. But Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%, as big techs continue to lag. Apple, along with Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, were fractionally lower. Amazon edged up.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to predict where the market is going; listen to the market. Pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks and read The Big Picture every day for timely, time-tested analysis.A brief sojourn below the 50-day line is not always fatal. But the sheer number of highly rated stocks — from Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) to Coherent (COHR) to Lam Research (LRCX) — that have cut through that level is worrisome.More than half of the IBD 50 fell 2% or more on Tuesday. True market leaders tend to fall about twice as much as the major averages in a correction.Still, it isn't all gloom. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) advanced 0.9% to 88.05, moving toward a buy point. Fed chief Janet Yellen said Tuesday that she doesn't expect another huge financial crisis ""in our lifetime."" That's a good sign going into U.S. banks' second round of stress tests due Wednesday evening. The Fed is expected to approve dividends and buybacks for many big banks.Meanwhile, biotech stocks pulled back Tuesday, but have largely held on to their recent big gains. Celgene (CELG) fell 2.2% but is comfortably in buy range.In the current environment, investors should be very cautious about making new purchases and be ready to take partial or full profits. Follow the action of the major averages and leading stocks.Even if you ignore the broader market, the broader market won't ignore you. If the market continues to weaken, your stocks will trip sell signals of their own.Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5% Wednesday. China's Shanghai composite retreated 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6%.The U.K.'s FTSE was unchanged intraday while Germany's Dax slid 0.5% and France's CAC-40 lost 0.3%.RELATED:Apple, Chips Lead Stocks Down; Are These 4 Tech Leaders Issuing A 'Sell'?The Big Picture: Uptrend Under PressureHow Far Can The Leading Stocks Fall?

227,LRCX,"The Relative Strength (RS) Rating for KLA Tencor (KLAC) moved up into a higher percentile Wednesday, as it got a lift from 68 to 72. X IBD's unique RS Rating measures market leadership by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks compares to other publicly traded companies. Decades of market research reveals that the market's biggest winners often have an RS Rating of above 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if KLA Tencor can continue to rebound and clear that threshold. Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineKLA Tencor broke out earlier, but is now trading around 4% below the prior 110.10 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to take shape. Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. Top and bottom line growth moved higher in the company's most recent quarter. Earnings were up 55%, compared to -7% in the prior report. Revenue increased from 2% to 29%. The company is expected to report its latest earnings and sales numbers on or around Jan. 26.KLA Tencor earns the No. 9 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group. Applied Materials (AMAT), Entegris (ENTG) and Lam Research (LRCX) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:

228,LRCX,"Strength in financials led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 0.3% gain in afternoon trading Wednesday, but selling was intense below the surface as weakness in semiconductor, FANG and China stocks weighed on the Nasdaq composite. Volume on both exchanges was tracking sharply higher than Tuesday's levels.X For the second straight session, the Dow's strength was fueled by strength in JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which showed gains of around 2%. UnitedHeath Group (UNH) and Verizon (VZ) did even better, rising around 3%.JPMorgan hit a new high after finding support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout over a 95.32 buy point. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, is trying to reclaim a 247.17 buy point, but it's been a laggard in the financial sector as evidenced by a Relative Strength Rating of 52.Money flowed out of bonds Wednesday, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield by 5 basis points to 2.38%.The S&P 500 eased less than 0.1%, but the Nasdaq composite slumped 1.1%. Longtime chip leaders Lam Research (LRCX), Applied Materials (AMAT)  and Nvidia (NVDA) flashed sell signals, slicing their 50-day moving average lines in heavy volume. Morgan Stanley on Monday cited lower flash memory prices and weak earnings growth next year as a reason to take profits in the chip space. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index lost 4%, stopping just above the 50-day line.Among the FANG stocks, Netflix (NFLX) fell below its 50-day line, and Facebook (FB) is testing support at the 50-day line. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) continue to hold above the key support levels.China stocks were also a drag on the Nasdaq. Weibo (WB) crashed nearly 5% to 110.44. It's just above a 105.60 double-bottom buy point and still holding above the 50-day moving average. YY Inc. (YY) looked poised to extend its losing streak to four sessions, falling nearly 6%. It's also above the 50-day line.More than half the names in the IBD 50 lost 2% or more.Retail stocks also outperformed in the stock market today, helped in part by news that the economy grew at a rate of 3.3% in the third quarter, mostly in-line with estimates. Ross Stores (ROST) jumped 4% to a new high. The strength came after the discount retailer  gapped up Nov. 17 on strong earnings.Meanwhile, bullish sentiment in the market remains high according to the latest data from Investors Intelligence. The number of bullish newsletter writers rose to 62.3% in the latest week, up from 61.5% the prior week, and the eighth straight reading above 60%. Three weeks ago, bullish sentiment hit a 30-year high of 64.4%.In the past, high bullish sentiment has been seen near market tops, while excessively bearish sentiment has been seen near market lows.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech As Apple, FANG Stocks Down; Telcos Rally5 Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipChina Stocks Hammered By Profit-Taking, Regulation ConcernsYellen Says U.S. Expansion Widening As Financial Risks MutedAmazon Calls Cyber Monday Its Biggest Online Shopping Day Ever

229,LRCX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index fell slightly early Friday after Senate Republicans delayed a vote on their tax-cut plan until Friday morning at the earliest after their legislation ran into a complication.X The S&P 500 index and Dow industrials hit record highs during Thursday's stock market trading on tax-cut hopes, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) leading banks. The Nasdaq composite rebounded somewhat Thursday from Wednesday's sell-off, though Netflix (NFLX) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among the notable leaders that did not bounce back and retake key levels.To win over Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., Senate leaders had included a fiscal trigger that would include automatic tax increases if the economic growth fails to live up to tax-cutters hopes. But the Senate parliamentarian ruled Thursday afternoon this will not work under Senate rules.S&P 500 futures fell 0.3% vs. fair value. Dow futures were 0.2% lower. Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 0.6%.JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, both Dow components, fell about 1% in premarket trading.But investors have been quick to buy on positive tax-cut news, while largely discounting setbacks.So far this week, JPMorgan has rallied 6% while Goldman has added 5%.Netflix edged down 0.3% to 187.58 on Thursday, even as the major averages rebounded. That followed Netflix's 5.5% tumble on Wednesday, falling through its 50-day line and a 190.05 buy point, wiping out a 7.5% gain from that entry. While technically the buy point is still valid, that isn't good action, so it would be understandable if investors took profits. Netflix also boasts a 204.48 potential buy point.Lam Research has been one of the strongest chip plays, with the semiconductor equipment surging for several months. But on Wednesday, shares plunged 8.7%, closing below their 50-day line in heavy volume, one of several top techs to flash sell signals. Lam didn't bounce back on Thursday, finding resistance at the 50-day line and losing 1.2%.Netflix's FANG peer Facebook (FB) also flashed sell signals on Wednesday, tumbling 4% to 175.13, two cents below its 50-day line and undercutting its 175.59 entry. Facebook did rise 1.2% on Thursday to 177.18 in solid volume, but much less active than on Wednesday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Bullish News ConvergesMcCain Gives GOP Tax-Cut Plan A Green Light; S&P 500 RollsTax Bill Will Pressure FANG, Momentum Stocks, Says JPMorgan5 Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

"
231,LRCX,"Wall Street saw some rotation out of outperforming technology stocks and some money going into other sectors, particularly finance and banking. Transportation and select retail stocks also gained ground.XThe Dow Jones industrial average paced the upside among major indexes, up around 0.4% as nine of the 30 Dow Jones industrial components rallied 1 point or more. American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs (GS), Home Depot (HD) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led the Dow's upside amid a gentle uptick in long-term interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond moved up to 2.38%, a two-week high.The broad-based advance offset a 4.51-point drop by fellow Dow 30 stock Apple (AAPL).The iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is still up from a breakout at 160.97 in a cup-with-handle base. The stock is now back in buy range, but it's preferable to see if Apple can dust itself off after Wednesday's steep fall and rally before considering a new buy.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was off less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.4% but remains close to its all-time high of 6914.Among the leading industry groups, department store chain, auto parts retailing, airline transport, hospital, home furnishings and medical services stocks all rallied hard, up 2% or more. (See the day-to-day performance of all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD by going to Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com.)The Bitcoin-tracking Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) ETF suffered a negative reversal, rising to as high as 1,823.99 before sliding nearly 4% to 1,414. Volume is running nearly quadruple the normal pace.Despite the drop, Bitcoin Investment Trust is still sharply extended from last week's breakout past a 985.10 buy point in an unusually deep cup with handle.Meanwhile, a bunch of names in the IBD 50, which through Tuesday's close was up more than 39% since Jan. 1 vs. a 17.3% lift for the S&P 500, sold off hard. Many of  the 50 top-rated companies saw losses of 5% or more, including YY Inc. (YY), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Ichor (ICHR). Yet among these three, only IPG Photonics has issued an IBD-style sell signal.IPG lost as much as 8.7% to a session low of 220.47 before shaving some of those losses. Watch to see how the industrial laser maker closes; the biggest single-session point loss in heavy turnover since the breakout is one key defense-type sell signal.However, as seen in a daily chart, the midcap still holds a decent air pocket above the rising 50-day moving average. So holders with large gains can of course lock in some profits, but they can also see if the stock generates a new high-quality base, which could potentially set up a new breakout.While IPG is showing the type of action that may signal a change in character and good reason to lighten one's exposure, it's still unclear whether the general rally in tech stocks is done or simply taking a well-needed pause.The chip sector certainly got pounded on Wednesday. The Philadelphia semiconductor index at one point fell more than 4%. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), both part of the IBD Big Cap 20, got pummeled as well.As seen in their daily charts, both of these large-cap leaders in semiconductor equipment have now undercut their respective 50-day moving averages. That alone is not a sell signal, however, as great stocks can recover and eventually move back above the key medium-term support line.In these situations, it's good to examine the weekly action and watch how a leading stock ends on Friday. If stocks such as Applied and Lam can bounce off their weekly lows and finish high in the range, it's a telltale clue that institutional appetite for growth stocks is still healthy.The 50-day moving average for Lam is currently near 197.85; the 50-day line is painted in red on an IBD daily chart. The 10-week moving average, found only on a weekly chart, is also painted in red.Another reason to keep holding tech stocks: Earnings are strong and revenue is likely to keep increasing in the current quarter. Plus, some observers are noting stable economic growth in the EU despite controversy over Brexit and problems for Germany to create a new coalition government. In the U.S., GDP growth is accelerating.A third reason: IBD's current outlook for the market, for now, remains ""Confirmed uptrend."" In recent days, the distribution-day count on the Nasdaq has declined, meaning that pronounced institutional selling has abated.Wednesday's sell-off, however, is a sign of heavy profit-taking amid concern over the fate of the tax-reform package proposed by Congress, which could get a final vote in the Senate later this week. Also, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, released in the afternoon, pointed out that ""price pressures have strengthened."" This could give the U.S. central bank more conviction to raise the cost of money sooner than later.A quarter-point hike in the fed funds rate to a target range of 1.25%-1.5% is all but assured when the Fed meets on Dec. 12-13.RELATED:Broad Sell-Off Hits Tech, Investors Rotate To Banks, Value StocksBitcoin Crashes Below $10,000 After Spike Above $11,000Do You Know How To Employ This Key Defense-Type Sell Signal?Can You Spot Major Market Tops?

Midday Monday the stock was finding support at its 50-day line. The restaurant group began the week No. 33 among 197 industry groups.Chip stocks, the No. 1 sector going into Monday's action, were suffering. Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) flopped 4.7%, the day's worst loss in the Nasdaq 100. Chip equipment provider Lam Research (LRCX), another member of the Nasdaq 100, trimmed 2%.Blue chips were narrowly up. General Electric (GE), a Dow Jones industrial average component, gained 3%.

242,LRCX,"X The Nasdaq composite led a mild retreat among key indexes in late afternoon trade Wednesday, but the stock market looks poised to wrap up the month with sterling gains.The Nasdaq, down nearly 0.3% as of 3 p.m. ET, is still hanging on to a monthly gain of more than 2.3%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, both down about 0.2% in the stock market today, are riding gains of nearly 1% and 0.2% since May 1, respectively. Money center bank, superregional, oil and gas, steel and department store retailing stocks led the downside with sharp losses.Volume on both main exchanges is running sharply higher vs. the same time Tuesday, indicating that some fund managers are opting to take profits with more enthusiasm than usual.Market breadth was negative, with losing stocks beating winners by a roughly 16-11 ratio. But on the NYSE, losers were roughly even with winners. Despite the market's pause, the upside is that high-quality stock leaders are mostly showing robust action. Top-ranked techs such as HR software expert and IBD Leaderboard member Workday (WDAY), graphics processor king Nvidia (NVDA), Lam Research (LRCX) and Alibaba (BABA) are up sharply from proper breakout points and hanging close to all-time highs.Analog Devices (ADI) is building upon its nice stretch of gains since its November 2016 breakout from a first-stage base at 67.01. Shares are up more than 2% to 86.92 and reached as high as 90.49 after the diversified semiconductor giant posted strong fiscal Q2 results (EPS up 61%, revenue up 47% to a record $1.15 billion).The stock is still in buy range after clearing a flat-base buy point of 84.34 on Tuesday. Analog's RS line is poking into new high ground, a bullish sign. The RS Rating of 85 and Accumulation/Distribution grade of B+ are positive as well.The proper buy zone goes up to 88.55, or up to 5% above the correct buy point of 84.34. The Norwood, Mass., firm has already seen more than 10 million shares exchange hands, triple its 50-day average turnover of almost 3.3 million shares.As noted in an IBD tech report earlier today, Analog also upended Wall Street's estimates for the current fiscal third quarter that ends in July. It forecast earnings of $1.14 a share in the midpoint of its target range, up 39%, on sales of $1.38 billion, up 55%. Other names to watch closely for potential breakouts and follow-on entries:Five Below (FIVE) , down 2% to 50.67. The discount retailer briefly poked above a long cup entry at 52.80 on May 19 before fading.Q1 results come out after the market close Thursday. The Street sees earnings rising 17% to 14 cents a share on a 20% jump in sales to $230.7 million. In the prior four quarters, Five Below topped the consensus EPS view by a penny to 2 cents.Five Below, which sells all items at $5 or less, holds a Composite Rating of 95 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and the company is expected to see double-digit profit growth in the next two years (up 25% to $1.62 a share in FY 2018 ending in January that year, up 18% in FY 2019). HealthEquity (HQY), up 1.3% to 45.80. The HSA account administrator is working on a new cup-type base since late January. A three-week handle, showing a gentle decline in bone-dry turnover, offers a 46.95 buy point for now. The buy point is derived by adding 10 cents to the highest price in the handle, or 46.85.Last year, the small cap broke out at 31.79 and rallied as much 55% before correcting in price.HealthEquity sports a 90 Composite Rating. It has been rangebound in recent months, perhaps due in part to its slowdown in profit increases. Earnings were flat at 7 cents a share in the January-ended fiscal fourth quarter, following a 75% boost in the year-ago period. But Q1 profit is seen accelerating 7% to 16 cents a share, on top of a 50% increase a year ago.Nutrisystem (NTRI) (97 Composite Rating), up 1.7% to 51.40. The diet products firm is close to retaking its 50-day moving average. Shares broke out in late April at 37.95.Concerns over government investigations into the potential ties between White House advisors and Russia are lingering, yet investors appear encouraged by new data showing that Q1 U.S. GDP was mildly better than originally thought. The core PCE price index, watched closely by the Federal Reserve, showed a 0.2% bump higher in April, in line with the Fed's target of 2% annualized inflation.Meanwhile, gold futures continued to strengthen amid a cooling U.S. dollar. The heavily followed SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) bullion-holding ETF rose nearly 0.8% to 121.04 and remains above its 50- and 200-day moving averages in brisk turnover. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell more than 2% to 85.38 in heavy turnover. As seen in a daily chart, the megacap bank has likely gone into base-building mode since dropping nearly 3% on March 21 and piercing its 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base last summer.Watch for a potential test of institutional buying support at the stock's rising 200-day moving average near 80.A drop to 80 would not be surprising, given the sector's strong move since the summer of last year. As reported in IBD's Stock Market Today columns at the time, JPMorgan had cleared a bottoming base pattern on Aug. 5 as it jumped out of a well-formed cup with handle at 65.08 in heavy volume.In a bottoming base, a stock has already suffered a big slide but is showing renewed strength. Heavy volume on up days and up weeks points to rising institutional demand and the potential for a breakout to 52-week highs.RELATED:In Investor's Corner: What's The Simple Way To Spot A Major Market Top?Also In Stock Market Today: Chevron, Oil Up; Time To Buy These 4 Top Techs?Inside IBD Weekly: The Case For A New Bull Run In GoldThese Banking Giants Are Breaking Below Buy Points, Key Levels TodayHere's Why Bank Stocks Are Breaking Key Support

243,LRCX,"Shares of computing and graphics chip maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) plummeted after receiving a stock downgrade on Tuesday, a day after posting in-line results for the first quarter.Meanwhile, semiconductor equipment maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) scored a price-target increase.Investment bank Macquarie Group cut its rating on AMD to underperform from neutral and lowered its price target to 10 from 14.AMD plunged 24.4% to 10.30 on the stock market today, the lowest since late January.""While the company appears to be making progress with its new Ryzen product, Q1 results clearly fell short of high expectations the stock was reflecting,"" Macquarie analyst Srini Pajjuri said in a report.AMD's first-quarter report late Monday underwhelmed. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company lost 4 cents a share excluding items, vs. a year-earlier loss of 12 cents a share, on sales of $984 million, up 18%, for the March quarter.""AMD's new products are beginning to accelerate growth, but perhaps without all the gross margin benefits we had hoped for,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report. ""The (roughly) 30% ramp in shares over the last 3 months required a near perfect quarter, but results fell a bit short.""IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks features eight chip industry players, including Lam Research and Advanced Energy Industries.Rolland rates AMD as neutral with a price target of 12.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh was upbeat on AMD's results. He reiterated his buy rating and raised his price target on the stock to 14 from 13.AMD guided above consensus estimates for the current quarter at break even on sales of $1.15 billion, up 12%. Analysts were modeling for AMD to lose a penny a share on sales of $1.12 billion in the June quarter.Needham reiterated its strong buy rating on KLA-Tencor and upped its price target to 120 from 105, after last week's earnings report.KLA-Tencor stock rose 0.55% to 99.72.""We like KLAC's better growth trajectory vs. peers over the next few quarters, the new product cycles (Gen 5, mask inspection, unannounced 3D Nand tool), industry-leading margins, and a discounted multiple relative to historical levels,"" Needham said in a report.Elsewhere in the semiconductor equipment sector, Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) fell 0.15% to 73.95 after trading as low as 74.34 intraday.Late Monday, Advanced Energy Industries beat Wall Street's estimates for the March quarter and guided higher for earnings and revenue in the June quarter.The company's Q1 results and Q2 guidance were good, but the magnitude of the beat-and-raise report was lower than expected after the very strong reports from peers Lam Research (LRCX) and MKS Instruments (MKSI) over the past two weeks, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg said in a report.RELATED:Chipmaker AMD Down Late On In-Line Q1 ResultsQualcomm Gets More Price-Target Cuts; Silicon Motion, Ichor HikedIntel Tumbles On Just-Shy Sales, But These 3 Chip Plays Beat

244,LRCX,"XInvestors brushed off concerns of a slowdown in consumer prices and most key indexes gained on Monday. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower on the back of 1-point drops or more by at least 4 of the Dow industrials' 30 components.The Nasdaq composite led the rally, rising 0.7% for the day, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. Volume fell on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.The Dow Jones transports slipped 0.3%.Last week, the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark rallied 1.5%, on top of a nearly 0.9% lift in the prior week. The Nasdaq had risen more than 4% over the prior two weeks, a clear signal that money continued to flow in the technology sector.In a heavy day for economic data, even bond investors didn't seem overly concerned about a surprise 0.1% dip in the March PCE prices gauge, excluding volatile energy and food prices, the first month-on-month drop since September 2001, according to Reuters. Plus, in the 12 months through March, the PCE index was up just 1.6%, vs. up 1.8% through February.The Federal Reserve has made it widely known that it wants to see inflation hitting at least 2% before taking more steps at reducing liquidity from the banking system. On Monday, meanwhile, investors sold U.S. government bonds hard; the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond inched up to 2.32%. The spread between the 2- and 10-year yields have slimmed a tad over the past 30 days.The interest-rate-sensitive Dow Jones utility average fell nearly 0.7%.Back to equities, looking at IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups, four of the top 10 groups come from the telecom and tech sectors (wireless services, semiconductor equipment, computer networking and computer data storage).Other top groups within the top 20 included the gaming group, which has vaulted from No. 80 to No. 13 over the past six weeks. Restaurants have jumped from No. 82 to No. 17 over the same time frame, while the lodging group has risen from No. 70 to No. 14.Among the four tech groups mentioned above, these names have stood out.Brooks Automation (BRKS) was up more than 5%, to 26.76, in heavy volume. The expert in automation and cryogenic systems for chipmakers and life sciences companies is extended sharply after a successful rebound off the 10-week moving average, near 16.90, in late January.Brooks also has been highlighted in the IBD Stock Spotlight.Western Digital (WDC) was down 1% to 87.97. The stock probed 52-week highs on Friday and has overall done well since it burst past an 81.77 flat-base buy point March 30. The stock is up almost 30% year to date, and harbors an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if Western Digital, thriving after its acquisition of SanDisk, eases back within the 5% buy zone from the 81.77 entry, or up to 85.85. At the moment, it is too far up from the buy point to be considered for purchase.Western gets a superb 99 Composite, the maximum allowed, from IBD Stock Checkup, as well as an A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating on a scale of A to E.Lam Research (LRCX) was up nearly 3% to a new high of 148.85. Shares are extended and it could be weeks before another entry develops. EPS growth in Q1 accelerated to 137%, up from gains of 20%, 0% and 43% in the prior three quarters, as sales rose 64%.Lam has been a fixture on the IBD Big Cap 20 (see the Stock Lists section on Investors.com) for several months, and currently ranks in the top 10 within the IBD 50.Other chip equipment names with outstanding Composite Ratings and excellent stock price action include ASML Holding (ASML) (broke out past an 110.24 early entry in late December, 2nd test of the 10-week moving average), and Applied Materials (AMAT), part of IBD Big Cap 20.Also in the group, Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP) is trading at new highs. But its recent pullback has produced a faulty cup base that falls short of the six-week minimum. Notice on a weekly chart how Cabot has gone two weeks down, then two weeks up into new high ground.At the same time, the 9.3% drop within the narrow consolidation was perhaps not enough to justify the V-shape-like action as an outright sell signal.Cabot faces a tough comp in fiscal Q3 earnings as profit grew 103% in the year-ago quarter that ended in June. Q3 profit this year is seen rising 5% to 83 cents a share.Among the fast-rising nontechnology groups:Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) was up more than 1% to 479.29 as it made a rebound off Monday's session low. The stock has climbed sharply in recent weeks, and last week the taco-and-burrito chain marked a solid Q1 rebound in profit ($1.60 a share on an adjusted basis) and revenue ($1.07 billion, up 28%, the largest gain in 10 quarters).The strong top-line result indicated that Chipotle is winning back trust among its customers. In Q1, the Denver-based firm, with founder Steve Ells now back as sole CEO, added 57 new shops while closing 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants and one Chipotle restaurant. Total restaurant count on March 31 reached 2,291.Operating margin at the restaurant level jumped to 17.7% from 6.8%, but that's still off from the 20% to 30% levels seen in prior years.Chipotle arguably broke out of a first-stage bottoming-base pattern at 434.79 at the end of March and also is extended.The Denver-based fast-casual dining pioneer sports a decent 77 RS Rating; other high-quality companies in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group with even better RS Ratings are Dave & Buster's (PLAY) at 83; Restaurant Brands (QSR) at 84; and Yum China (YUMC) at 87. Yum China, a spinoff from the KFC and Pizza Hut giant Yum Brands (YUM), has rallied 17% past a 29.45 aggressive entry within a four-month IPO base.Shares went public on Nov. 1 and ended their first trading session on the NYSE at 26.19.The Street expects earnings to grow 17% this year to $1.41 a share and 11% the next.RELATED:Stock Spotlight: The Secret Ingredient Behind These 5 Stocks' Big Moves UpHow To Invest: The Latest From IBD's Investor's CornerWhen Will Commodities Rebound?

247,LRCX,"XThe highflying chip gear sector continues to soar thanks to an upbeat earnings report from Lam Research (LRCX).Lam Research stock was in record high territory on Wednesday after the company delivered a beat-and-raise earnings report late Tuesday. Lam Research rose 6.9% to 136.17 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high.IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group jumped 3%, the second-best performing group on the stock market today. The group, which includes 34 stocks, is ranked No. 2 out of 197 groups.Major players in the sector that popped Wednesday include Applied Materials (AMAT), up 3.15% to 39.25, and KLA-Tencor (KLAC), which climbed 3.2% to 97.59. Others getting a lift included Rudolph Technologies (RTEC), MKS Instruments (MKSI) and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS).The one contrarian was ASML Holding (ASML), which reported what initially seemed to be upbeat results. Early Wednesday, Netherlands-based ASML reported first-quarter earnings of $1.12 a share, up 115% year over year, on sales of $2.07 billion, up 36%. Analysts were expecting 99 cents and $1.93 billion.Shares climbed 2.3% to 133.71 in morning action on better-than-expected first-quarter sales and earnings. But shares soon reversed and were down 2.9% at 126.89 at the close, below their 50-day line. The stock set a record high of 134.29 on March 28.While ASML's first-quarter results were strong, its second-quarter forecast disappointed investors. The company guided to sales in line with expectations, with gross profit margin below views.Also, ASML raised doubts over how many extreme ultraviolet lithography systems could be built and shipped next year, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini said. Wall Street was targeting 24 systems for next year and ASML said 20, he said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes three chip gear companies: Lam, Advanced Energy Industries and Applied Materials.Fremont, Calif.-based Lam earned $2.80 a share excluding items, up 137% year over year, on sales of $2.15 billion, up 64%, in the quarter ended March 26. Analysts expected Lam to earn $2.55 a share on sales of $2.13 billion.For the current quarter, Lam expects to earn $3 a share minus items, up 67%, on sales of $2.3 billion, up 49%. Wall Street had been modeling for Lam to earn $2.65 a share on sales of $2.19 billion in the June quarter.Lam stock received price-target increases from CFRA Research, Needham, Pacific Crest Securities, RBC Capital Markets and UBS.RELATED:Lam Research Exits March Quarter Like A LionThese Two Leading Chip Stocks At Make Or Break Moment

248,LRCX,"Semiconductor-equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) is expected to continue its streak of solid earnings and sales growth when it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results Thursday.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is scheduled to post results for the quarter ended Oct. 29 after the market close. Analysts expect Applied Materials to earn 91 cents a share, up 38% year over year, on sales of $3.94 billion, up 20%.However, if the company hits those targets, it would mark the second straight quarter of decelerating sales growth and third consecutive quarter of decelerating earnings growth.For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling Applied Materials to earn 91 cents a share, up 36%, on sales of $3.96 billion, up 21%.The company has benefited from strong chip production trends as well as growth in manufacturing OLED displays. Applied Materials is a leader in materials engineering systems used to make semiconductors and advanced displays.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.

249,LRCX,"The $1.7 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund III (NFEAX) is way ahead of the broad market as measured by the S&P 500 this year, and that's a nice change from last year. The rebound has a lot to do with the rally by growth stocks vs. value stocks in general, especially technology sector names like Alibaba Group (BABA) and Facebook (FB), says lead manager John Wilson.X Those two holdings are up 101% and 55%, respectively, this year. ""Technology this year is anchored by strong performances in internet stocks and semiconductor names and infrastructure (internet platform) software names,"" Wilson said.The shift has helped the fund. In 2016 the fund edged up 1.26% while the bogey advanced 11.96%. This year going into Wednesday the fund was up 27.58% vs. a 21.30% gain for the S&P 500 and a 26.97% gain by the fund's large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.The fund appears poised to keep riding that wave. Its largest sector as of Oct. 31 was technology, with a 34% weighting. That was more than double its next biggest weighting, which was 15.37% in consumer cyclical stocks. Health care stocks were less than one percentage point behind.In tech stocks, Wilson and co-managers Peter Deininger and Tchintcia Barros are playing several themes. One is a switch by technology consumers. ""They are starting to re-architect the different applications they use and software platforms they use,"" Deininger said. ""That benefits some individual software companies like Salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW).""Another theme involves the companies that create and supply the internet infrastructure — including the cloud — that firms like Salesforce and ServiceNow use to provide their services. ""Nvidia (NVDA) helps power some of the computer processing in next-generation data centers,"" Deininger said. ""It also helps drive business for more mundane suppliers, whether they are Micron Technology (MU), supplying underlying memory architecture, or Lam Research (LRCX), providing capital equipment that drives expansion that we see in the semiconductor industry overall.""Micron makes several types of computer chips, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and flash memory (NAND), which are increasingly important in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and augmented- and virtual-reality applications on Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other high-end smartphones, Deininger says.Lam is a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. It benefits not only from robust demand for memory chips and a rotation away from old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. It also benefits from the shift to multilayered computer chips and the increasing capital intensity of manufacturing with advanced technologies, Deininger says.After Alibaba's big share-price gain this year, the fund has moderately trimmed its share count in recent disclosures. ""These were modest position trims given the stock's strong performance this year,"" Wilson said. ""It had elevated to the point where we took a modest percentage off the table. It reflects the stock's strong price performance and the fact that its relative weighting had increased a lot, so we made trims to bring the relative risk-return down.""Wilson and his colleagues still like Alibaba because ""it's done a good job of monetizing their mobile user base,"" he said. ""There was some concern when they went public (about three years ago) that that would be a slow process. But they've done a good job of improving the relevance of their ecosystem to the Chinese consumer. And they've done an excellent job of tying in their retail network as a marketplace for them to sell a broad variety of goods and services.""He adds that Alibaba has done a good job of developing their infrastructure business like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.The fund has made moderate trims to its share count in Facebook for similar reasons. The fund still likes the stock. ""Our view is that the company has a tremendously strong global franchise,"" he said. ""They're increasingly effective at monetizing, especially in their core Facebook platform. And they've done a tremendous job of ramping up their Instagram platform, which is smaller but growing quickly.""He added, ""There are six million advertisers in Facebook and only two million on Instagram. But it is fair to say Instagram will get to six million, so it has a lot of runway."" User growth will spur advertiser growth, which will fuel Instagram's pricing power, Wilson says.In addition, he expects the firm to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. ""They have some additional opportunities that are interesting, but not totally clear,"" he said.As for Facebook's spending, Wilson is not worried. ""Clearly they are spending aggressively to address issues of newsfeed-quality issues,"" Wilson said. ""They're addressing those issues head-on and it is relatively well understood by the marketplace at this time.""Health care may be the fund's third-largest sector, but it is the fund's biggest overweight vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The fund managers like some biotechnology stocks that offer ""new revenue streams driven by new products that are perhaps not well understood by the market,"" he said.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is one. The company's lead drug, Soliris, has been used to treat blood disorders. The company now has approval to begin selling Soliris for treatment of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. But the stock, trading around 113, is 24% off its 51-week high of 149.34 set Sept. 5 and attempting a rally from its Dec. 7 low of 105.01.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

250,LRCX,"Stocks jumped at Wednesday's open as markets awaited a final, procedural House vote on Congress' massive tax overhaul package. Gains by Intel (INTC), FedEx (FDX) and Micron Technology (MU) also factored into early trade.X The Dow Jones industrial average,the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 all opened to gains of 0.3%. All three indexes traded just shy of new highs.Senate approval of the GOP's tax reform legislation early Wednesday gave markets some early lift, as a re-vote expected in the House later in the day was broadly seen as a technicality. Markets remained wary of the ongoing need for a budget agreement, without which federal offices would be required to shut down after Friday.Real estate data continued to roll in, with the Mortgage Bankers Association reporting a 4.9% drop in total mortgage applications activity last week, putting the week 8% below last year's level.

The Energy Information Administration offers up its weekly oil inventories report at 10:30 a.m. ET.Chipmakers were showing strong early action, as Intel headed the Dow, up 1.1%, although JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (UTX) also traded near the head of the list. Intel's move followed news reports of a company memo in which Chief Executive Brian Krzanich declared the company was set to take more risks, as it boosts the amount of its revenue coming from growth markets, vs. its legacy PC business.Intel's gain sent just above a 47.40 buy point in a flat base.Micron Technology leapt 5% at the open. The Boise, Idaho-based chipmaker reported a triple-digit surge in fiscal first-quarter earnings and a 71% revenue increase, easily topping analyst estimates. The stock ended Tuesday poised for a possible rebound from its 10-week moving average, which would offer a follow-on buying opportunity.Among other chip-related stocks, Applied Materials (AMAT) rose 0.8% and Lam Research (LRCX) gained 2%.Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 0.8%, deepening Tuesday's slide of more than 2%. The maker of battery-powered luxury cars received the largest order to date for its new autonomous tractor-trailer vehicles, a UPS (UPS) order for 125 trucks.FedEx opened 3% higher after reporting strong fiscal second-quarter results late Tuesday. A 15% profit gain and a 9% rise in revenue topped analyst forecasts, and an increase in full-year earnings guidance beat expectations. FedEx shares are extended above a 220.09 buy point in a flat base.November initial public offering Stitch Fix (SFIX) dived 14%, despite reporting better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings. The stock ended Tuesday 65% above its Nov. 17 IPO price.Open source software leader Red Hat (RHT) dumped more than 3% in premarket action. The Raleigh, N.C.-based cloud play reported a solid third-quarter performance late Tuesday, and shares ended the session up 58% from a breakout in February.Bitcoin dropped back to near the $17,000 level, after approaching $18,000 in early trade. Futures traded lower on both the CBOE and the CME.Among bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT)  gained 4%, after ending Tuesday with a 185% gain so far in December. Marathon Patent Group (MARA) posted a 2% gain. Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) stumbled 10% lower and Overstock.com (OSTK) also reversed losses to a 4% gain.Longfin (LFIN), the IPO that launched Friday just after announcing it had acquired Ziddu.com, a small lender using blockchain ledger accounting technology, made a sharp turn higher, surging 8%.

"
252,LRCX,"Stocks got hammered in afternoon trading Thursday as investors appeared to feel discouragement over the Senate plan to go slow in cutting U.S. corporate taxes.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq cut some of its early losses, yet still paced the broad decline, falling 0.9%. At one point the composite index lost more than 1.4%. The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) mirrored the 1.4% decline.At least 13 of the 30 components in the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1 point or more, pushing the popular average down nearly 1%. They included Goldman Sachs (GS) (still above its 50-day moving average, a good sign), McDonald's (MCD) (a gap down, but still well above its 50-day line, also good), and Caterpillar (CAT) (in a strong uptrend, no defense-type sell signals for now).The S&P 500, down almost 1.1% early, cut its decline to less than 0.6%.Breadth is negative across the board; at one point, losing issues outmatched winners by a nearly 5-2 margin on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.The S&P SmallCap 600 was off 0.5%, nearly cutting early losses in half, yet extending its weekly loss to nearly 1%. The 600 was also briefely back below its critical 50-day moving average.Chip equipment firms led the downside among tech stocks, falling nearly 4% as a group. Lam Research (LRCX), a member of IBD Big Cap 20, currently ranked No. 2, dropped more than 3% to 204.32 in mildly above average turnover. The specialist in wafer etching systems still trades well above its fast-rising 50-day moving average. Lam's most recent breakout was at 170.10.Elsewhere in the market, other leading industry groups were not immune to the decline. Among the top 20 ranking within IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, truck transport, residential building, educational software, automation and material handling machinery all fell at least 1%. Industries bucking the decline included mail order retailing, department store chains, apparel and shoe retailing and long term medical care, each up more than 1%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, is holding up quite well, despite at one point falling as much as 1.7% to an intraday low of 173.14. While the stock is on course to snap a five-day win streak, the iPhone giant has a nice cushion of gains since surging past a 160.97 entry in a brand-new cup with handle.Volume is running around 10% above usual levels.Apple is still up more than 46% since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 back on Jan. 6-9.There are at least five reasons why longer-term holders can sit and watch to see if Apple can rally another 20% from its latest entry. One is the fact that despite a temporary pullback in late September, the stock did not trigger any IBD sell rules.For instance, it did not fall 7%-8% below a prior flat-base buy point of 156.75. This is the golden rule of investing.Four more reasons to keep holding:One, growth is accelerating, and CFO Luca Maestri made it 100% clear in last week's news release: ""Apple's year-over-year revenue growth rate accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter and drove EPS growth of 24% in the September quarter,"" he said.IBD's Stock Market Today columns, since November of last year, have frequently noted that the prospects of a re-acceleration in top- and bottom-line growth in the consumer electronics and digital services giant was very good.Apple's revenue jumped 12% to $52.58 billion, up from gains of 3%, 5% and 7% in the prior three quarters. After-tax margin boosted 120 basis points higher to 20.4%.Two, some highly rated mutual funds are establishing new positions in Apple, including at least four funds with an A or A+ for 36-month performance by IBD, as of the second quarter of this year. Strong institutional buying is critical to a stock's long-term rise.Three, Apple's Composite Rating continues to improve on Stock Checkup, recently jumping to a very respectable 93 on a scale of 1 to 99. On Jan. 1, the Composite was 57.Four, Apple's relative strength line has jumped into new high ground. See the RS line, painted in blue, on any IBD chart or on MarketSmith. A rising RS line means a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.Microsoft (MSFT) is down around 0.5% to 84.09 in nearly flat turnover. Watch to see if the big player in Big Data, cloud computing services and business software can hold its recent bullish gap up in price.The stock is still 15% above a 72.99 entry in a solid flat base.That flat base began during a decline in the week ended June 9 and lasted five weeks, the minimum length required for this sideways-moving chart pattern. The flattish action indicates that big investors are reluctant to dump massive quantities of shares back into the market.In Microsoft's flat base, the correction from head to toe was a very mild 6.6%.Snapchat site operator Snap (SNAP), noted in a Sept. 20 Stock Market Today article regarding the prospects of its shares falling below 10 a share, lopped off another 4% to 12.38 in volume running double its 50-day average. The social media network got slammed Wednesday after reporting its smallest year-over-year revenue increase since going public March 2.Revenue rose 62% to $207.9 million, but that's a far slower gain vs. the increases of 406%, 286% and 153% in the prior three quarters.The company lost 14 cents a share in Q3, bigger than the 9-cent loss a year ago.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

255,LRCX,"XThe stock market rallied Wednesday afternoon as generally positive corporate earnings outweighed geopolitical tensions, like the U.K.'s snap election. Crude oil prices fell 1.4% after OPEC wouldn't commit to a production cut extension as U.S. output continued to rise.The Nasdaq led the way with a 0.6% advance, though off intraday highs. The S&P 500 rose 0.2.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average lagged the Nasdaq considerably for a second straight day, falling 0.25%. Volume rose modestly on the Nasdaq, but edged lower on the NYSE vs. the same time on Tuesday. Among the Dow industrials, IBM (IBM) was the clear laggard, accounting for all of the blue chip index's loss. Big Blue dropped nearly 5% in heavy turnover to pierce the 200-day line after the company released its Q1 results late Tuesday. Although the company exceeded earnings estimates, IBM's top line fell short of expectations, coming in at $18.16 billion vs. the estimated $18.39 billion.Pacing the advancers in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average were Boeing (BA), and Intel (INTC), which both rose about 1%. Among other companies reporting earnings, Morgan Stanley (MS) offered another bright spot among financials after Goldman Sachs (GS) surprisingly missed expectations on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley handily surpassed both top- and bottom-line estimates as fixed-income revenue fueled the earnings beat. Shares moved up 2.6%, but the stock remains well below the 50-day line.Chip stocks were moving higher in the stock market today. Chip gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML) beat the Street's earnings and sales estimates. Lam shares soared nearly 7% to notch an all-time high, while ASML reversed to fall more than 2%. Shares of ASML had been up as much as 2.3% in early trading. Fellow chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) jumped about 4%. The stock found support at the 50-day in recent trading sessions. Among leading growth stocks, Dycom (DY) was a top performer for a second straight day, gaining 4.5%, after breaking out on Tuesday. The telecom services provider cleared a cup-shaped base with a 98.57 buy point after Verizon (VZ) inked a $1.5 billion fiber-optic cable deal with Corning (GLW). Other leaders include Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) and Essent Group (ESNT) which rose 2.3% and 3.3%, respectively.Dycom recently joined IBD Leaderboard, which launched in July 2011 and has a strong track record of helping active investors make picks among the strongest performing stocks in the market. Stocks making Leaderboard show chart annotations done in real time by senior markets writers and editors.On the downside, China-based NetEase (NTES) continues to underperform, falling 0.6%. Just 7 weeks ago, the leading Chinese gaming stock was at all-time highs above the 300 price level. Now, the stock sits 16% off high as it consolidates under its 50-day. Chip designer Inphi (IPHI) also lagged, dropping 2.3%, though it appeared to be finding support at the 200-day.RELATED:IBM Beats On Bottom Line, Missed On Revenue As Restructuring ContinuesMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesLam Research, ASML Jump On Upbeat March Quarter Reports

Shares still rose 3%, helped by an earnings beat and news that fixed-income revenue nearly doubled to $1.71 billion.Dow components JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) lost 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively.In the stock market today, Lam Research was a top gainer in the IBD 50, rising 6%, after the company reported a 137% surge in quarterly profit. Sales jumped 64% to $2.15 billion. IBD 50 component and group peer Applied Materials (AMAT) also did well, rising 3%.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) gapped above the 800 level, soaring 7%, after the company reported Q1 earnings and sales that accelerated from Q4.

So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

268,LRCX,"The Trump administration's chances of pushing through tax reform legislation are improving and will pressure so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — and other momentum stocks with high hedge fund ownership, says JPMorgan.X ""For managers overweight growth/momentum, taking a defensive approach to tax reform appears prudent,"" said the JPMorgan report published Thursday. ""While passage of tax reform may provide mid-single digit upside to the S&P 500, we also estimate that equity allocations for most investor types are near historical highs, potentially leaving them less willing to increase allocations to U.S. equities further. Thus, passage of tax reform is likely to result in style implications for equities (i.e. value vs. growth).""JPMorgan recommends ""protective strategies"" for high growth/momentum stocks with high hedge fund ownership. They include: Facebook, Salesforce.com (CRM), Applied Materials (AMAT), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Qorvo (QRVO), Marriott International (MAR), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Autodesk (ADSK).Also on the list are: Micron (MU), Align Technology (ALGN), Netflix, JD.com (JD), Activision-Blizzard (ATVI), Red Hat (RHT), Lam Research (LRCX), Mercadolibre (MELI,) PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Stocks rose early Thursday as investors eyed a pending tax reform vote in the U.S. Senate. After a technology sector sell-off on Wednesday, all of the FANG stocks traded higher, led by Netflix. Goldman Sachs led the Dow, continuing a rally in banks and financial stocks.""Passage of tax reform, or increasing speculation thereof, could cause a continued rotation out of growth/momentum,"" said JPMorgan.

269,LRCX,"Shares in technology companies fell sharply Wednesday with so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — among the hardest hit as investors rotated into banks and value-stocks, one market strategist said.The Nasdaq dropped 1.4% to close at 6,824.39. The Dow rose 0.4% to 23,940.68. Telecom and financial stocks rallied amid the tech sell-off.Among the FANGs, Facebook lost 4% to 175.13 on the stock market today, and Amazon was off 2.7% to finish at 1,161.27. Netflix plunged 5.5% to 188.15. Alphabet retreated by 2.4% to 1037.38.The last rotation out of big-cap internet stocks occurred after President Trump's surprise election in 2016. But FANG stocks and other techs bounced back in 2017, accounting for most of the Nasdaq's gains.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, says the breakout by banks is significant.""One day does not make a trend but we are seeing signs of a rotation,"" Belski said. ""Does (the tech sell-off) mean that value investing strategies are beginning to become more prevalent — banks and financials being the biggest part of the value index — I think the answer to that is yes.""""The money has to come from somewhere. So it doesn't surprise us that the FANG/technology companies are across-the-board being used to fund this move into banks. Does that mean the tech boom is over? Absolutely not. It just seems natural, healthy that a reallocation of portfolio money is occurring.""Wednesday's sell-off in tech came even as Republicans moved closer to passing tax-reform legislation. One expectation is that companies such as Apple and Alphabet will get a boost on lower taxes for cash brought back into the U.S. from overseas. A sell-off in Chinese tech stocks, meanwhile, has gained momentum amid investor worries that its communist government is backtracking on some economic policies. Alibaba Group (BABA) tumbled 5.9% to 175.60, Baidu (BIDU) dropped 3.5% to finish at 235.49, and Tencent (TCEHY) gave back 4% to 52.Among U.S. tech stocks, Apple (AAPL) dropped 2.1% to 169.48, Tesla (TSLA) fell 3.2% to 307.54, and Nvidia (NVDA) plunged 6.8% to finish at 196.42.Chip companies and makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment also sold off.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Ichor Holdings (ICHR) fell 7.7% to 28.01, while Applied Materials (AMAT) also fell 7.7%, going to 52.91. Lam Research (LRCX) dropped 7.6% to 197.06. Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 2.1% to 271.50.But shares in telecom stocks AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) rose. AT&T gained 3% to close at 36.48. Verizon was up 2.27% to 49.90. The dividend-paying telecom stocks are viewed as a safe haven.Bank and financial stocks also rallied.Among stocks in the IBD 50, PayPal Holdings (PYPL) fell 5.8% to finish at 73.25, Arista Networks (ANET) shed 3.8% to 234.21, and Atlassian (TEAM) lost 9% to 46.59. PayPal peer Square (SQ) fell 8% to 39.13.Enterprise software stocks also took a hit. Salesforce.com (CRM) fell 2.8% to 103.53, Workday (WDAY) fell 7.2% to 106.54 and Autodesk (ADSK) plunged 15.9% to 109.34.RELATED:Senate Budget Committee OKs GOP Tax Bill; Apple, Alphabet Big Winners?Five Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

270,LRCX,"At least 10 of the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2 points or more to help power the blue chip index to a 1.4% gain and a leading position within Thursday's broad market rebound.XThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.8% in November, raising its year-to-date advance to 22.8%.Meanwhile, innovative new discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) rushed more than 3% higher in extended hours trading after announcing sparkling fiscal third-quarter results with earnings up 80% to 18 cents a share, crushing the 13-cent consensus view. Net margin shot 110 basis points higher to 3.8%.Revenue jumped 29% to $257.2 million, also beating views. In the prior four quarters, Five Below's revenue rose 18%, 19%, 21% and 29% vs. year- ago levels.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped as much as 1.6% and notched an all-time high of 24,327, breaking past 24,000 for the first time. At 24,272, the 30-stock Dow is now up almost 23% year to date.The Nasdaq composite recouped much of Wednesday's 1.3% drop, rising 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the all-electronic exchange, rebounded nearly 0.8%. The S&P 500 also rallied 0.8%. Volume zoomed higher on the NYSE on a blast of turnover in the final minutes and was virtually even on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq composite rose 2.2% in November and is up 23.1% since Jan. 1, vs. a 2.8% monthly lift and a 18.3% year-to-date gain for the 500.Five Below, the Sector Leader and highly rated member of IBD's discount and variety retail group had already become extended from a pair of proper buy points. At Thursday's close of 61.77, Five Below was up nearly 14% from a five-month cup base with a 54.23 buy point. The small cap firm is also up nearly 7% past a narrow flat base with a 57.75 entry.Five Below's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group ranks 68th among 197 industry groups and subgroups rated each day for relative six-month price performance by IBD. In general, the biggest stock market winners hail from the top 20 to 40 industry groups. However, Five Below's group has jumped to its current spot from No. 102 four weeks ago, a good sign.IBD's TAKE: Track the industry groups moving fast up the rankings by going to Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, then click on Industry Sub-Group Rankings. IBD research has found that up to 50% of a leading stock's move can be attributed to the strength of its industry group and broad industry sector.Five Below is a relatively new public company, debuting in July 2012 at 17 a share. It has a very reasonable float of 54 million shares, easily meeting the criteria of S in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The S stands for supply vs. demand. Goldman Sachs (GS) led the way among Dow 30 stocks in terms of point gain, rising more than 6 points, or nearly 3%, to 247.64. At one point, shares moved past a 247.84 buy point in  a nearly nine month saucer with handle.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, stretched its gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good cup with handle and a 160.97 buy point by rebounding 2.37, or 1.4%, to 171.85 in fast turnover. More than 40.1 million shares traded hands, 48% higher than usual.The gain for Apple from latest correct buy point is now back to 6.7%. The iPhone giant has also risen 45% since marking a breakout from a bottoming base on Jan. 6-9. At that time, Apple also cleared a cup with handle, shoving past a 118.12 entry.Back to Five Below, the Philadelphia-based company now operates more than 600 stores in 32 states. It has zero long-term debt and expanded its shareholders equity to $381 million vs. $288 million in the year-ago period.Five Below also forecast sales of $491 million to $503 million for the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter, well above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $484.1 million. Executives also see earnings of $1.09 to $1.16 a share, or up 21% to 29%.Five Below and peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) are the only two stocks in IBD's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group to earn a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup.Railroad giant CSX (CSX) gained more than 2%, rolling past a 55.09 entry in a 19-week flat base and is up nearly 9% for the week. Volume is heavy, running more than 60% above its usual pace. The RS line, drawn in blue on IBD's daily and weekly charts, is not at all-time highs but is rising sharply in recent weeks.Norfolk Southern (NSC) joined the breakout train, rising nearly 2% in spirited volume and moving past a 134.62 buy point.Both Norfolk and CSX have shown improved fundamentals, at least on a quarterly basis. The former has grown profit 9%, 15%, 26% and 13% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters, while the latter has seen EPS gains of 21%, 38%, 36% and 6%. CSX's profit, however, is seen dipping 2% to 57 cents a share, due in part to a tough year over year comparison.The Dow Jones transports, up 3.3% and posting a closing high on Wednesday, ramped another 2.1% higher to all-time highs.Back to Apple, the company has shown improving fundamentals over the past 12 months, and the Street appears confident that the turnaround will continue. Over the next two quarters, analysts on consensus see earnings growing 12% and 39%. That would extend Apple's streak of double-digit EPS growth to five straight quarters.Revenue increases are helping drive those positive expectations.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, Apple's sales slumped 9%. After that, revenue turned around, rising 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% in the next four quarters. Apple is now seen growing the top line 10% in the current first quarter (ending in December) to $86.18 billion, then another 30% to $68.77 billion in Q2 of fiscal 2018.Strong orders for the ultra-luxury iPhone X, a major iPhone replacement cycle, strength in digital services, increasing popularity of the cellular-enabled Apple Watch, and other products are helping continue Apple's dominance in consumer electronics.Apple's stock price strength also is improving. According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Relative Price Strength Rating is a respectable 80 on a scale of 1 (weak) to 99 (strong), up sharply since scoring a 59 on Jan. 1.Meanwhile, Apple's EPS Rating has improved to a solid 90 (also on a scale of 1 to 99), up from 45 on Jan. 1. The SMR Rating, which analyzes sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity, is at a top-shelf A on a scale of A to E.In the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, Apple's aftertax margin rose 120 basis points to 20.4%, indicating strong pricing power of its products as well as likely hinting at improved operating leverage or cost efficiencies.Semiconductor stocks are trying to rebound. Nvidia (NVDA), a leader in chips for artificial intelligence, data center, self-driving and virtual currency markets, is trying to stem its decline after briefly sliding through the 50-day moving average on Wednesday.Shares gained 2%. The long-term uptrend is intact, and Nvidia still holds a 14% gain since clearing a narrow flat base with a a 174.66 buy point on Sept. 15.Nvidia, an IBD 50 play at No. 10 and recently highlighted in IBD Sector Leaders, is facing tough year-over-year comparisons after posting large double-digit to triple-digit earnings gains since the second half of fiscal 2017, ended in January. Yet Wall Street still anticipates solid growth in the quarters ahead. Analysts on consensus forecast a 16% rise in January-ending Q4 profit to $1.15 a share on a 22% jump in sales to $2.66 billion, which would be a quarterly best.Growth is expected to reaccelerate in Q1 of fiscal 2019, with earnings rising 24% to 98 cents a share on a 27% pickup in sales to $2.46 billion.Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), however, failed to hold on to early gains and fell mildly. Both are members of IBD Big Cap 20. Watch to see if they can recover their respective 50-day moving averages. Failure to do so would trigger a sell signal.In other financial markets, investors trimmed more of their long-term government bond holdings ahead of a widely expected Federal Reserve hike in interest rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.41%, the highest since late October.Despite elevated crude oil prices in recent months, transport stocks continued to thrive. This may come as no surprise given the acceleration of the U.S. economy, which rose at a revised 3.3% annualized rate in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturing output data came in stronger than expected.In addition to the Senate's vote on a major tax reform bill that could sharply reduce corporate taxes, Wall Street will focus on the ISM manufacturing survey for November, due Friday at 10 a.m. ET.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Bitcoin Reverses; 3 Reasons Why The Tech Rally Isn't OverFinding Great New IPO Stocks: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Intel and Cisco?These 7 IBD Stock Lists Are Crushing The Major Indexes This YearThe Big Picture: Why Square May Need To Take A BreakStocks Near A Buy ZoneWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

271,LRCX,"Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C) and other financials such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) continued their rally on Wednesday, amid greater optimism over tax reform and the U.S. economy as well as signs the U.K. and European Union were coming closer to a settlement on their planned separation.X JPMorgan Chase popped 2.3% to 103.73 in the stock market today; the stock is extended from a 95.32 flat-base entry. Tuesday's rebound from the 50-day moving average offered a possible new buying opportunity, though investors should try to buy 50-day/10-week rebounds as quickly as possible.Goldman Sachs climbed 0.8% to 241.36, near a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base and moving above its 50-day line in strong volume.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are key reasons why the Dow industrials rallied and the S&P 500 was nearly flat as the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled.Citigroup rose 1.8% to 75.04. Citigroup is closing in on a 76.24 buy point but cleared an alternative entry at 74.95 intraday after powering above its 50-day line Tuesday.Bank of America (BAC) advanced 2.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) climbed 1.8%, also still within buy range of a cup-with-handle base with a 48.59 buy point.Two bank breakouts included Northern Trust (NTRS), up 2%, and SunTrust Banks (STI), up 3.15%.Charles Schwab climbed 2.7% to 48.42. Schwab is just within range of a 46.31 buy point of a flat base cleared on Tuesday. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) climbed 1.7%, now extended.Several factors appeared to be driving the rally in financials.The GOP's tax-cut plan on Tuesday cleared the Senate Budget Committee along party lines, moving the bill closer to a full vote in the chamber. A full Senate vote could come this week.The bill, which would slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, is likely to contain a tax-raising mechanism that would kick in if the benefits from the tax cuts don't pan out as expected, easing concerns about the debt.But other GOP lawmakers are opposed to that mechanism. The Senate bill also still needs to be fused together with the House's.Jerome Powell, who President Trump has chosen to succeed Janet Yellen as head the Federal Reserve, said at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that ""the case for raising interest rates at our next meeting is coming together"" while also stressing that he sees no sign of economic ""overheating."" The next policy meeting takes place on Dec. 12-13.When the Fed raises the rate on overnight loans that banks make to each other to meet financial quotas, banks pass the higher costs on to consumers, often through raising rates on their own loans. The higher rates help improve banks' financial results.Meanwhile, Powell hinted that he favors relief on financial rules. While not a surprise, the combination of steady of monetary policy and regulatory relief is positive for banks.The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose Wednesday. That rate also influences the rates on credit that banks offer to their customers.Wall Street has been concerned about the flattening of the yield curve, a gauge of inflation expectations that tracks the difference between short-term and long-term government debt. Earlier this month, the gap between the short end and long end of that curve was at its narrowest in a decade, raising concerns about a weaker economy. The yield spread widened slightly on Wednesday.The short end of that curve has crept up as the Fed raises rates. When Wall Street expects the economy to be stronger in the years ahead, the long end of the curve rises, as future economic growth raises prices and investors demand a greater return on their bonds to make up for the declining buying power of the dollar.Rising yields were definitely a factor Wednesday. Dow financials JPMorgan, Goldman and American Express (AXP) rallied, but Visa (V) fell sharply. Visa doesn't hold credit balances, so higher rates don't offer a benefit.The U.K. and the EU are reportedly coming closer to agreeing on what the island nation will pay to get out of the bloc. The payment could run into the tens of billions of euros, according to CNN. The pound jumped on the breakthrough, which mean the U.K. and EU can now address their post-divorce trading and regulatory relationships.The pound tanked last year after the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.

272,LRCX,"Reports that Apple (AAPL) is in the process of developing its own power management chip for the iPhone, which sent a key supplier tumbling, also threw a wrench into suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment in Tuesday trading.Among the leading chip-equipment stocks that fell were Lam Research (LRCX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Applied Materials (AMAT) — all three recently hitting record highs.Reports surfaced Tuesday that Apple is working on its own power management chips, which it currently sources from London-based Dialog Semiconductor. Dialog stock plunged more than 14% in Germany. Concerns are that Apple will replace Dialog with its own chips, possibly by 2019.Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe on Tuesday claimed there was ""strong evidence"" that Apple was working on making its own power management chips for the iPhone. Bankhaus Lampe cut its rating on Dialog to sell from hold.Earlier this month shares of London-based Imagination Technologies plunged after Apple said it would cease a contract to use its products. Apple reportedly has hired away engineers from both companies.Lam Research stock fell 1.2% to 127.23 on the stock market today, but closed well off session lows. KLAC-Tencor was down 0.9% to 95.50, while Applied Materials was off 1.7% to 38.20. IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Group, which has been No. 1 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks for several weeks, sank 0.5% on Tuesdsay.IBD'S TAKE:  The Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is ranked No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. While the highflying chip equipment sector could experience near-term pullbacks, the long-term outlook looks bright.The Apple reports also smacked chip-producing companies such as Cirrus Logic (CRUS), which lost 2% to 63.38. Qorvo (QRVO) dipped 0.6% to 70.20 and  Skyworks (SWKS) slipped 1.4% to 100.14.RELATED:Chip-Gear Makers Rise On Upbeat Micron OutlookChip Gear Stocks Rocking As Investors Come Knocking

273,LRCX,"ETF investors have profited most this year from the S&P 500 sector whose leaders looked most askance at President Donald Trump before his Jan. 24 inauguration. A rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday is set to mark the president's 100th day in office.The bellwether Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) has rallied 12.6% through April 27, outpacing Sector SPDRs tracking the materials, industrials and financial sectors — which were among the ""Trump Trades"" that rallied most in the massive sector rotation that marked his shock election victory.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the largest stock holdings in the cap-weighted index tracked by XLK, are all trading at or near 52-week highs.Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet are surging to record levels after the companies' latest earnings showed web-based, on-demand computing is driving and transforming their businesses.Those moves helped XLK make a fresh 52-week high of 54.49 on the stock market today. While XLK leads the Sector SPDRs so far this year, this broadly diversified tech exchange traded fund has been outpaced by peers investing in tech industry niches with bullish earnings momentum.Here is a look at two winning ETFs from a list screened for trading volume:Lam Research (LRCX), Micron Technology (MU) and Applied Materials (AMAT) have the biggest weights in the portfolio, at more than 5% each.Year to date through April 27, PSI is up 20% vs. a 13% gain for XLK and 7% for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average.The semiconductor ETF has far outstripped XLK over the past three and five years as well. Average annual gains are neck-and-neck over the past 10 years, at 9% for PSI and 10% for XLK.Its top stocks include design and imaging leader Adobe Systems (ADBE), tech giant Microsoft and interactive gaming firm Activision Blizzard (ATVI).""IGV redistributes its portfolio from giants like Microsoft into smaller, more growth-oriented software companies, and diversifies into closely related sectors such as IT services and counseling,"" according to ETF.com.This software ETF, like the PowerShares chip ETF, has jumped 20% year to date. It has outperformed both PSI and XLK over the past 10 years, with an 11% annual average gain.The technology sector of the S&P 500 was expected to report earnings growth of 16.2% in the first quarter, trailing only the energy sector and ahead of the S&P 500's overall 9.7% growth, according to S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates at the start of earnings season.Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research, pointed out that while energy is expected to bounce back from a loss, technology is likely to be a growth leader for the third quarter in a row.The semiconductor industry will likely drive Q1 tech earnings with a projected 39.4% growth rate, she added. Other tech industries expected to grow earnings by double digits for the quarter include internet software and services, at 28.3%, and electronic equipment at 18.8%, according to CFRA.Investors who bet on niche tech ETFs may miss out on the diversification benefits of broad-based technology ETFs such as XLK ""in case analysts are incorrect about the industry leading the sector's earnings this season,"" cautioned Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA.IBD'S TAKE: Find out why the No. 1 company in many technology funds earns a spot on IBD Leaderboard, an actionable list of market-leading stocks with the potential for explosive gains.RELATED:QQQ ETF: Best Large-Cap Growth Fund Or Tech Sector Star?

The S&P 500 index retook its 50-day line Thursday, but returned below that support Friday. The Nasdaq rallied 1.8%, fueled by chip gear stocks and Facebook.Netflix predicted it would reach the milestone of 100 million streaming video subscribers worldwide over the weekend.

""Ultimately, we didn't navigate the market well,"" Deputy CFO Martin Chavez said. ""But no quarter defines the franchise."" Compounding Goldman's woes, rival Morgan Stanley (MS) beat Goldman on fixed-income trading revenue and analyst estimates overall. Meanwhile, Bank of America (BAC) beat as higher rates from the Fed kick in, but it said falling Treasury yields could hurt results further off.RELATED:Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made augmented reality the centerpiece of his keynote presentation at the company's annual F8 Facebook Developer Conference.  In what was also seen as a strike against Snapchat (SNAP) operator Snap, which is also pushing into augmented reality, Zuckerberg said the mainstream augmented-reality platform of the future is not a headset or glasses, but a smartphone.RELATED:Strong results from semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) sparked a rally in the already hot chip gear sector.

Shares initially sold off but closed slightly higher. Management defended its plans to expand flights to reclaim what it called its ""natural"" market share.

Trump's order launches what promises to be a quick investigation into whether imports of steel are hurting national security. The order would potentially pave the way for trade restrictions under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Meanwhile, Nucor and Steel Dynamics, as expected after preannouncing in March, reported strong first-quarter earnings and signaled that Q2 is also shaping up to be a good one, helped by stronger steel consumption in nonresidential construction and improving energy-sector demand.RELATED:Trump Turbocharged Thursday's Top-Performing Stock GroupGeneral Electric (GE) reported flat earnings per share at 21 cents on revenue of $27.66 billion, down less than 1% vs. a year earlier, but both were better than expected.

But eBay's guidance was light.RELATED:Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) earned $2.37 a share in the first quarter, up 31% from a year ago and 20 cents ahead of expectations. Revenue grew 9.4% to $48.7 billion, topping estimates. UnitedHealth, which also raised its full-year guidance, is being helped by its pullback from the ObamaCare exchanges.

Meanwhile, rival E-Trade (ETFC) handily beat with 48 cents EPS and $553 million in Q1 sales, while TD Ameritrade (AMTD) posted mixed results.Visa's Q2 results beat estimates with 86 cents EPS and $4.5 billion in revenue. Full-year revenue guidance of 16%-18% growth also topped. Visa shares initially soared to a record high Friday but closed flat, though they were still up for the week. American Express (AXP) also topped forecasts with softer-than-expected earnings and sales declines. Shares leapt 6% on Thursday. American Express, which lost its card partnership with Costco (COST) last year, is in the midst of a premium credit-card war with JPMorgan Chase (JPM).CSX reported first-quarter earnings and revenue well above Wall Street estimates, with operating metrics also strong. That shows CSX was improving even before CEO and President Hunter Harrison took the helm in March. CSX also raised its dividend by 11% to 20 cents per share and said it would buy back up to $1 billion in stock. CSX shares surged 5.6% on Thursday, then added 2.4% to close above a buy point. Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), where Harrison previously was CEO, also topped views late Wednesday and rose 2.6% Thursday, paring gains Friday. Kansas City Southern (KSU) narrowly topped views Friday morning but fell sharply, more then offsetting Thursday's advance. Union Pacific (UNP) gained 1% Thursday and ticked higher Friday.RELATED:Drug and medical product giants Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) diverged on first-quarter earnings. J&J's $17.77 billion in sales were light with drug revenue advancing just 0.8%. Adjusted EPS did top views. Abbott crushed views. J&J, a Dow component, fell 2.6% for the week while Abbott Labs rose 2%.RELATED:D.R. Horton (DHI) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, though order cancellations rose. Shares initially retook a buy point, but quickly reversed to fall 2.5% on Thursday. Several other builders also reversed.

278,LRCX,"According to the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, the leading money managers appear to be focusing on building sector and related stocks like homebuilders NVR (NVR), Toll Bros. (TOL) and KB Homes (KBH), as well as construction equipment maker Graco (GGG), wood products producer Louisiana-Pacific (LPX) and steel maker Allegheny Technologies (ATI).XMastec (MTZ) and manufactured-home builder Patrick Industries (PATK) also earned a spot on the list, as did Kimball International (KBAL), which makes furniture for the office and hospitality industries, and home furniture maker Bassett Furniture Industries (BSET).Institutional investors also continued to show demand for top chip stocks, with IBD 50 members Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) making the cut, along with Cohu (COHU) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Cohu and Lam Research can also be found on IBD's latest list of stocks expecting 50% earnings growth in Q3.With tensions rising in North Korea and President Trump promising to significantly boost defense spending, it's no surprise that major defense contractors Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Heico (HEI) are also found on the list.In last month's report, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each into four stocks: United Health (UNH) ($1.39 billion), Apple (AAPL) ($1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) ($1.25 billion) and Celgene (CELG) ($1.07 billion).The latest list doesn't include any $1 billion-plus bets.

Note that Toll Bros. is trading at the upper limit of its buy range, while Boeing is now extended.While General Motors (GM) made the list of new buys, with five funds investing $1.2 million, it also led the list of new sells. The net number of funds selling GM (16 selling minus 5 buying) was 11.Diesel and gas engine maker Cummins (CMI) had the second-most net sellers (10), followed by axle and suspension maker Dana Inc. (DAN) (9).Despite the number of funds selling, each of these stocks has been rising, and Cummins entered a 170.78-179.32 buy zone last week.RELATED:Q3 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus GrowthU.S. Small Caps, Foreign Stocks Favored By FundsFind And Track The Best Mutual FundsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

283,LRCX,"Indexes pared gains in afternoon trading Wednesday. The Nasdaq continued to lead as components Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) traded in unusually heavy volume.The Nasdaq composite was up 0.5% but had been up as much as 0.8%. Facebook, the fifth-largest component of the Nasdaq, rose 1.3%. Volume was running above average, enough to put Facebook on IBD's Stocks On The Move list. The company is expected to benefit from a Hollywood writers' strike. Netflix, another big Nasdaq component, fell 1.8% in about double its usual volume. The video streaming company is breaking support at the 50-day moving average, putting the stock in a perilous spot.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.3% — a loss almost entirely at the hands of IBM (IBM). Big Blue gapped down 5% in huge volume after its Q1 sales missed expectations, and analysts responded by cutting price targets on the stock.The S&P 500 had only a small part of its early gain left, up 0.1%. The index met resistance at the 50-day moving average. It's the second time this week that's happened, and it should give investors pause.Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE. Winning stocks beat losers by 9-to-7 on the NYSE and by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Auto dealers, medical equipment, department stores, chip equipment and airlines were the top industry groups. Earnings caused some of those moves.

It's the first base for the stock, which had its IPO in January.Mettler Toledo (MTD) broke out past the 490.02 buy point of a flat base.

The stock erased all of an 11% gain from its 71.20 buy point.

284,LRCX,"The second annual IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards came down decidedly in favor of small-cap funds over their mid- and large-cap peers, as small caps overcame a roller-coaster stock market in 2016 to produce outsize gains.Winning an IBD Best Mutual Fund Award is not easy. Funds must have at least $100 million in assets and must beat a benchmark — in this case the S&P 500 — in the past one, three, five and 10 years.When you look at U.S. equity mutual funds organized by market capitalization — large, mid- and small cap — 1,200 are big enough and old enough. But only 49 emerged as winners by beating the S&P 500 over all four periods.Nearly half of those — 23 — were small-cap funds. Why so many?Part of the explanation is that they won the numbers game. They outperformed big-time in 2016 and in four earlier years of the decade, says Christopher Lo, a manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Small Cap Index (NMSCX), the ninth-best-performing portfolio on the Best Mutual Fund Awards winners small-cap list. Those five years of outperformance more than made up for years when they stood out less, he adds.Another reason small-cap funds predominate among cap-size outperformers is that in 2016 alone, they benefited more than other cap-size groups from the election results. ""Small caps tend to have higher shares of domestic revenues,"" Lo said. ""So they benefited from the prospect of policy changes, such as lowering corporate taxes — small caps tend to pay higher tax rates — and increasing infrastructure spending.""A third reason: Small caps tend to outperform in periods of rising interest rates. When rates rise because the economy is strengthening, that often coincides with strengthening fundamentals for U.S. small caps, Lo said.In addition, coming out of economic downturns — such as in 2010 — small caps tend to outperform because they are less burdened by balance-sheet debt. They borrow less than large caps do during downturns, Lo said.A fifth reason for small-cap excellence is the prevalence of small-cap innovators.The 108 Best Mutual Fund Award winners last year have dwindled to 49 the latest year. Why the big drop-off? The stock market in 2016 was a pivotal factor, as the Brexit and elections caught many fund managers on the wrong side of the broad market benchmark. The number of large-cap winners fell to 11 from 94, midcap winners edged up to 15 from 10 and small-cap winners rose to 23 from 4.Return winners among the three cap-size categories also got mowed down by a volatile market in 2016. Large-cap funds did best, with three of their 11 winners this year repeating from 2015. Just one midcap winner was a repeat performer. And not a single small-cap portfolio was a veteran award winner.So how can you use our lists of award winners to build a better portfolio? When you're building or reviewing a portfolio, your investment profile is likely to call for various weightings in large-, mid, and small-cap funds. Consider filling those portfolio slots with IBD Best Mutual Fund Award winners. If the winners aren't available in your 401(k) plan, you can ask your plan provider why not.What made these funds winners? For one thing, to become a winner it helps if a fund can minimize its losses in market downturns. Otherwise, its long-term returns suffer, potentially knocking it out of contention over the longer time periods.""It takes discipline,"" said Mark Oelschlager, manager of $213 million Pin Oak Equity Fund (POGSX), a top-five standout in the U.S. diversified equity, blend (where it is No. 1) and large-cap categories. He also runs $420 million Red Oak Technology (ROGSX), tops among sector funds. ""It takes a willingness to go against the crowd. And it takes conviction.""Oelschlager showed those traits in recent years when he bet big on financials as they sold off in the financial crisis. ""We had confidence that eventually conditions would change and we would be rewarded,"" he said. He has already started to take profits in the sector, trimming his weighting, he says.Independent thinking is another trait that fuels outperformance, Oelschlager says. His reaction to the market's postelection advance is a case study. While many other investors are seeking pure plays on the widely expected boost in infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts, Oelschlager is looking elsewhere. ""We've been looking in the opposite direction from the Trump bump,"" he said. ""We're moving incrementally toward stability. We still have significant exposure to financials and some other cyclical sectors, but we're generally favoring stability in consumer staples, health care, even in technology and financials.""Bank of New York Mellon (BK) is a financial he still likes. ""Its valuation is still attractive,"" he said. ""It's relatively stable. It doesn't have the same issues with lending cycles as many other banks because it's not focused on lending. It's more of a trust bank.""Paychex (PAYX) and Amdocs (DOX) are two more examples. Paychex provides payroll and other employee-benefits services for customers. Amdocs is a leader in back-end software systems for telecom enterprises. ""Both are relatively stable companies in what are considered cyclical sectors,"" Oelschlager said.Valero Energy (VLO) refines and markets fuels and other petroleum products. ""Energy is considered a cyclical, and energy is expected to benefit from Trump,"" Oelschlager said. ""But Valero has less leverage to this cycle. They are further downstream. They are not an E&P. They don't have the same volatility. And their results are more consistent than an E&P company's.""Oelschlager isn't the only advocate of discipline. Jerry Dodson, manager of $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), shows another way that discipline contributes to outperformance. Dodson buys stocks only once they have tumbled 33% below what he determines their intrinsic value to be.He must also satisfy himself that the stock's setback is just temporary and not a sign of something that has crippled the company. In addition, he wants bargains that can rebound within three years.""Part of the beauty of this process is that all we need is for the stock to rebound to its fair market value,"" Dodson said. ""We're not asking it to do anything extraordinary.""Dodson is a returning winner for good reason. Parnassus Endeavor posted a 12.23% average annual return over the 10 years ended Dec. 31. That was tops among all U.S. equity funds. It was also No. 1 in both the growth and large-cap categories. Its pace was nearly double the S&P 500's 6.95% yearly average return.There's no single path to consistent outperformance. Dodson achieved that goal with just 25 large-cap holdings as of Dec. 31. William Coleman and Gerry O'Reilly, managers of $5.2 billion Vanguard Tax-Managed Small Cap (VTMSX), reached the brass ring with 597 small stocks as of Jan. 31.The Vanguard fund ranks in the top five in both the small-cap and blend categories.Coleman and O'Reilly's strategy hinges on dumping holdings that are losing ground. They do it to minimize tax losses. But the strategy has the added benefit of constantly pumping up their weighting in their best performers. ""Some of our outperformance comes from selling names before they head farther south,"" O'Reilly said. ""We take those proceeds and spread them over winning names in our benchmark, which boosts our performance.""It's a strategy that wins by hitting singles, not home runs. The portfolio holds nearly 600 names, and just one had a weighting higher than 0.58% as of Dec. 31.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), with a weighting of about a quarter of 1%, gapped up 43% on March 20, and is now up 91% so far this year. The biotech jumped on the release of data from its main clinical trial, which involves a search a practical alternative to addictive opioid therapies for managing pain. Opioid abuse is an epidemic. The company has yet to notch an annual profit, going back to 2008.Nutrisystem (NTRI), which markets weight-loss products and services, is up 57% this year. Shares gapped up 19% on Feb. 28, the day after the company reported fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company reported 29-cent Q4 earnings per share, a 53% gain vs. 20% in Q3, topping analysts' estimates. It also offered bullish guidance for 2017.Lumentum Holdings (LITE), a fiber optics provider, is up 40% this year. The stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD's No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group. It has a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD — 99 is the highest rating. And it has four years in a row of annual EPS growth.IBD'S TAKE: See how Lumentum's easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.There are many paths to consistent outperformance. One fund's winning way may be fine for some shareholders but too volatile or too risky for others, says Gary Miller, lead manager of $8.2 billion Victory Sycamore Established Value Fund (GETGX), the No. 1 winner in the value funds category and a top-five winner in the midcap group.RELATED:Introducing IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards

287,LRCX,"A rosy report from Micron Technology (MU) was a rising tide that lifted many boats in the chip sector Friday, especially among makers of semiconductor capital equipment.IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group rose 0.6% on the stock market today. The group is ranked No. 1 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.Gainers in the group included ASML Holding (ASML), up 2.3% to 132.24; Lam Research (LRCX), up 1.7% to 127.47; and Brooks Automation (BRKS), up 0.5% to 21.10.Applied Materials (AMAT), the chip-gear sector's leading company by revenue, edged 0.3% higher to 38.97.Late Thursday, memory-chip maker Micron reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings on in-line sales and guided to much higher sales and earnings for the current quarter.Micron's report showed healthy demand and pricing for memory chips, including DRAM and Nand.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes three chip gear makers: Advanced Energy Industries, Applied Materials and Lam Research.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the ""read-through"" on Micron's report is ""largely positive"" for Micron rival Western Digital (WDC) as well as chip-gear makers Applied Materials, ASML and Lam Research.""We believe the continued 3D Nand spending will benefit (Applied) and (Lam) the most,"" Daryanani said in a report. ""We think ASML will see 3D Nand spending benefit in greenfield fabs but less in planar to 3D conversion.""Daryanani rates Lam Research and Western Digital as outperform and Applied Materials and ASML as sector perform.RELATED:As Chip Gear Makers Hit New Highs, Analyst Sees A Pullback

288,LRCX,"Tech stocks led a light rally in most of the key indexes in Friday afternoon trading, but the gains are likely not enough to wipe away losses for the week.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite backed off intraday highs and rose 0.3%, but at 5836 the tech-rich index was still down more than 1% for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average was virtually flatlining near 20,630, down 0.1%, and headed for a 1.3% weekly loss.However, as seen in a weekly chart, the Dow Jones industrials appear to be finding support near the 10-week moving average, a critical line of technical support and resistance. The S&P 500 on Friday was up less than 0.1%, and the Russell 2000 0.2%.On Tuesday, following the smackdown in equities, IBD downgraded the current outlook for the market to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Confirmed uptrend.""Volume is running higher vs. the same time Thursday on the Nasdaq but slower on the NYSE.While the Dow has Intel (INTC) as its component from the semiconductor sector, there are plenty of other chip companies that are showing stronger price action and more favorable characteristics that comprise a true market leader. Consider Broadcom (AVGO), which has been a member of Leaderboard and is now up more than 25% for the year. Shares in the diversified integrated circuit expert have been holding nicely above the 50-day moving average.The ideal time in 2016 to have bought shares? When Broadcom, after a few stumbles, gapped up on Dec. 9 and pushed past a 179.52 flat-base buy point.Intel, which has a mediocre 64 Composite Rating from IBD, broke out of a 15-week saucer-with-handle base at 37.45 in the week ended Jan. 27, but the breakout lasted less than a week. The next week, shares reversed badly, diving 3.8%. Since then, the stock has been dwelling below its 10-week moving average and is trying to hold above the longer-term 40-week line.In the same fabless semiconductor group, Cavium (CAVM) looks headed for only a minor loss as shares rose nearly 0.4% to 71.52, extended nearly 8% past a 66.22 buy point within a long, first-stage, bottoming base-like pattern.Monolithic Power (MPWR) gained around 0.7% to 91.77 and is beating the major indexes with a 12% year-to-date gain. Like Cavium, Monolithic owns a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD.Wall Street sees Monolithic's earnings rising 23% to $2.82 a share this year and then another 23% to $3.48 the next. Monolithic also sports improving return on equity (21.6% in FY 2015, 24.1% in FY 2016, up from an average ROE of 15.7% in the prior three years).Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), members of IBD Big Cap 20, also sport healthy gains since the market staged a rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30 last year, triggering a buy signal for investors.

291,LRCX,"A host of semiconductor capital equipment vendors saw their stocks surge Thursday as the chip-gear industry continues to show healthy growth.Lam Research (LRCX) stock notched a record high of 174.37 in intraday trading. It ended the regular session up 0.6% to 172.58 on the stock market today. Lam stock broke out of a cup base at a buy point of 170.10 on Monday. That followed a failed breakout on July 26 and a fresh consolidation.In a report Wednesday, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Weston Twigg outlined five reasons investors should own semiconductor-equipment stocks:First, chip-gear companies are generating a lot of cash, and they'll likely accelerate returns to shareholders.Second, valuations are still attractive, particularly for fast growers like Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam.Third, end-market demand appears robust, led by the expansion of cloud service providers, machine learning, and data generation, analysis and storage. The sector also is seeing tailwinds from growth markets like automotive and the Internet of Things.Fourth, even with deceleration in 2018, semi-cap demand should remain at a very high level, especially amid scaling of 3D Nand memory-chip production and growing process complexity.Fifth, China remains a huge buyer of semiconductor gear as it ramps up domestic production of computer chips.IBD'S TAKE: Lam Research is currently No. 13 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Twigg said his favorite stocks in the chip-gear space now are Applied Materials, Lam, MKS Instruments (MKSI), Teradyne (TER) and Entegris (ENTG).Investment bank Goldman Sachs on Wednesday said it expects spending on semiconductor equipment to rise just 1% in 2018, compared with its early forecast of 3%. It sees spending rising 27% this year, up from its prior view of 16% growth.""From an investment perspective, we reiterate our Attractive coverage view on Semi Cap Equipment and recommend investors to own the winners,"" analyst Toshiya Hari said in a report.Hari upgraded Applied Materials stock to buy from neutral and upped his price target to 52 from 49.Applied Materials rose 2% to 47.05 on Thursday.He also is bullish on Lam Research and Entegris, both of which he rates as buy.Hari downgraded KLA-Tencor (KLAC) to neutral from buy.RELATED:Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

293,LRCX,"U.S. stock indexes rebounded midday Wednesday on a bullish durable-goods report and on news that President Trump will unveil this afternoon his plan for tax cuts and changes to the tax code.XThe Nasdaq charged ahead 0.6%, while the S&P 500 added 0.1% after paring gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was flat, but the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.6%.Volume in the stock market today was higher vs. the previous session's pace.Economic news set a bullish tone before the market's open.Durable goods orders for August rose 1.7% vs. the consensus view for 1.5%. The surprise in the report came in core capital goods. The increase was 0.9%, three times better than the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Core capital goods is a proxy for business investment.Meanwhile, Trump will release the details of his tax-cut plan in a speech this afternoon in Indianapolis. The Indianapolis Star reported that the plan would double the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly and to $12,000 for individuals; cut the corporate tax from 35% to 20%; and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.However, some taxes would go up. Bloomberg News reported that the federal tax deduction claimed for state and local taxes would be eliminated. This would mainly affect people in states controlled by Democrats, such as California and New York — states that did not support Trump.The tax talk comes with a dose of skepticism because the Republican Congress has not yet shown the ability to unite on policies.In the Nasdaq 100, tech stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Data storage firm Micron Technology (MU) gapped up 7% to a new high. Chip equipment providers Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) each popped 3%.Blue chips were mostly down. In the Dow Jones industrial average, losers led winners by a 9-to-7 ratio. Nike (NKE) scored the biggest loss, down 3.5% on a mixed quarterly report. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 1.6% and 1%, respectively.Banks led the stock market in the weeks after the November election. From Nov. 8 to Dec. 9 the money-center industry group rose 21% vs. 5% for the Nasdaq and 6% for the S&P 500. Money centers peaked in March with a 32% postelection gain and then corrected by 12%. In May, money centers began a rebound that took the group 13% above the May low.Bank of America (BAC) was a few pennies away from clearing a 25.45 buy point midday Wednesday. Other major banks, including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS), also were near buy points. Morgan Stanley is No. 2 among its industry group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com.Small caps also have seen a resurgence recently. From Election Day to Dec. 9, the small-cap S&P 600 jumped 18% but became a laggard this year. Yet, since Aug. 21, small caps have led the market's rebound — up 8% vs. 3% each for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.The action among banks and small caps raises the question of whether investors aren't seeing a return to strength among some aspects of the so-called Trump trade. Moves in interest rates also have influenced banking stocks.Before the market's open Thursday, the final number on second-quarter GDP will be released. The Street's consensus view, according to Econoday, calls for 3.1% growth, up from the second take's 3% and the first reading of 2.6%.

294,LRCX,"Semiconductor, software, fiber-optic telecom gear and other tech issues helped boost the Nasdaq composite to its highest levels of the session in afternoon trading Wednesday. Apple (AAPL), up 0.6% to 154.04, also helped push the Nasdaq and other key indexes higher.XApple, which has joined a pilot program that is meant to get health-related apps on a fast track for potential FDA approvals, remains a touch below a new breakout point at 156.75, 10 cents above the left-side high in a 10-week flat-base pattern, one of the most bullish chart patterns seen in leading growth stocks.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite back off session highs but was still up 1.2% as it gained further distance above its critical 50-day moving average. At 6472, the tech-rich index at one point looked poised to post an all-time closing high.Meanwhile, small-cap indexes were faring especially well as banking shares of virtually all stripes also rallied ahead of details from President Trump's tax cut proposal, expected later today during a speech in Indianapolis.Late on Tuesday, some of the tax cut plans were previewed among members of Congress and included a slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, a cut of the top individual income tax rate of 39.6%, a doubling of standard deductions for filing tax returns, and higher child tax credits.The S&P 500 rose 0.4% and notched a new all-time high before easing a bit. The large-cap benchmark is getting weighed down a bit by losses in utility, food, drugstore chain, gold mining and other defensive-oriented industry groups.The Dow Jones industrial average edged up nearly 0.3%, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least seven of the 30 components in the index, including Goldman Sachs (GS) (still forming a saucer-type base), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (trying to overcome upside resistance near 94) and McDonald's (MCD) (which triggered a sell signal with a sharp break of the 50-day moving average near 157).The small-cap S&P 600 surged 2.2%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 1.9%. Strength in the auto, airline, trucking and shipping sectors held up, as the Dow Jones transportation average rallied more than 0.6%.The Dow utilities are off 1.2% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond soared to 2.30%, the highest in weeks.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday, a bullish sign for the market. All of the major indexes are also trading near all-time highs.Going back to Apple, if the megacap tech cannot quickly rebound back above its latest buy point of 156.75, expect the stock to take more time in forming a potential new base. Also, watch to see if its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which has fallen to a poor grade of E on a scale of A (superior accumulation) to E (heavy selling), can improve.Apple is seeing a slow-yet-steady pickup in the top line, a critical factor in its future stock potential. Revenue rose 3% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in December 2016, ending a three-quarter slump, then grew 5% and 7% in the next two quarters.The Street sees Apple's revenue climbing at a faster rate again, up 9% to $50.93 billion in Q4 of this current fiscal year, then 11% in Q1 of fiscal 2018 to $86.71 billion.Within the semiconductor sector, Nvidia (NVDA) expanded its gains, rising more than 2% to 175.89 in above-average turnover. Shares of the expert in graphics processors and chips for artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles backtracked after surpassing a new flat-base buy point at 174.66 a few weeks ago, but are now back above that proper entry.Sometimes a high-quality stock such as Nvidia, a member of the IBD 50, needs more than one attempt to break out successfully. And keep in mind that the big-cap tech play has already boomed more than 420% from a 33.16 cup-with-handle breakout back in March 2016, before the latest base formed.Another concern is how Wall Street will react to the inevitable slowdown in earnings and revenue growth in the next few quarters. From Q3 (ended in October) of fiscal 2017 to Q2 (ended in July) in the current fiscal year, Nvidia's EPS growth has been astonishing, rising 720%, 89%, 183%, 126% and 124% on an adjusted basis, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.When earnings grow that fast, it's very hard to keep up such a hot pace.Revenue at Nvidia, which also makes semiconductors for data centers, jumped 24%, 54%, 55%, 48% and 56% vs. year-ago levels over the same five-quarter span.Nvidia benefits from being in a strong chip sector, which through Tuesday's close ranked No. 2 among 33 sectors as seen in IBD's stock research tables. The 33 sectors are ranked every day in terms of a blend of mid- to long-term price performance.IBD's chip sector is up 26.8% since Jan. 1, slamming the 11.5% gain of the S&P 500.Other notable chip companies with excellent fundamentals and strong price action include Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT), ASML (ASML) (98 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup) of the Netherlands, wafer fabrication titan Applied Materials (AMAT) and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX).Applied Materials stretched its gain to more than 7% to 49.16, quickly getting back above a 47.69 early buy point within a cuplike base. Shares remain in buy range up to 50.07.Watch to see if Applied Materials' volume runs well above the 50-day average by day's end. With less than a half hour to go in the session, turnover is running nicely at a pace 76% above its 50-day average. Among big-cap names, it's preferable to see volume bulge at least 40% higher than normal at the breakout or soon after. Applied has 1.07 billion shares outstanding and a $51.9 billion market value.Applied's base is later stage; the rally got going with a breakout from a bottoming-base pattern at 21.77 in May 2016, and that base was first stage. Keep in mind, though, that a select number of companies with truly outstanding fundamentals, the best products and services, and top management are capable of staging nice gains from third-, fourth- and even fifth-stage bases.Applied is expected to grow fiscal 2017 earnings 83% to $3.20 a share, extending three years of increases. In fiscal 2018, which ends in October next year, EPS growth is seen slowing sharply, up 12% at $3.60 a share. However, analysts' estimates for a full year out are often conservative.Ultra Clean of Hayward, Calif., rallied more than 9% to 29.41 in fast turnover. Shares in the small-cap name are extended past a new cup buy point at 26.30. The proper buy zone extends up to 27.62. It's especially important to buy chip stocks within the right price zone, no more than 5% above a proper entry, because they tend to swing more quickly and more violently than the average company on Wall Street.Buying a stock that's too far extended in price can force a new investor to exit a stock with a sharp loss during a normal price pullback.Lithography systems expert ASML rose 2.9% to 167.61 in brisk trading, and has now rallied 21% following a July breakout past a 137.37 buy point in an eight-week flat base.In a good flat base, the correction from head to toe should not exceed 15%. In ASML's case, the stock dipped from 137.27 on May 16 to 126.03 on June 12, a mere 8.2%. Notice, too, how the megacap tech firm had a solid prior uptrend before sculpting the new base.IBD's TAKE: One of the keys to a breakout from a solid base, including the cup with handle, is to see a prior uptrend of 30% or more before a stock forms its next base. Read this Investor's Corner column to become more acquainted with using charts to get an edge on Wall Street and improve your market timing in both stocks and the major indexes.Microchip Technology (MCHP), currently in IBD's Big Cap 20 screen, rose 1.2% to 88.68 and is in buy range from an 86.04 handle entry in a shallow cup.The Chandler, Ariz., expert in flash memory and microcontrollers for multiple markets has shown steady profit growth since fiscal 2014 (ended in March that year). Earnings have jumped from $2.45 a share in FY 2014 to $3.99 in FY 2017. In the current fiscal 2018, analysts see earnings rising another 32% to $5.27 a share.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Why Apple's Rally Isn't Over YetThe Big Picture: Will The Nasdaq's Lead Diminish?How To Trade Stocks: Why A Flat Base And Square Box Represent Bullish MovementHow To Spot Major Market Tops: Here Is The Easy Way

298,LRCX,"The highflying chip gear sector likely will face a near-term pullback, but the long-term outlook looks bright, an analyst reported Tuesday.Needham analyst Edwin Mok said in a report to clients that he expects sales of semiconductor wafer fab equipment, or WFE, to pull back 10% to 20% in the second half of 2017, but longer term the current growth cycle in the sector could extend to 2019. The current cycle started in early 2016.""We expect some near-term softness (in the semiconductor capital equipment industry) as we expect business to pull back after a series of sequential quarterly growth, but we are increasingly bullish for the long term,"" Mok said.IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is ranked No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked. Several leading chip-gear stocks hit multiyear highs on Monday, including Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA-Tencor (KLAC), Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).""Historically, WFE stocks would decline 20%-plus on near-term softness, but we see a smaller pullback in the coming months as we expect investors who missed the recent run-up to become incremental buyers, picking up shares if they pull back,"" Mok said. ""Within our coverage, we highlight our Top Pick KLAC (strong buy).""Semiconductor capital equipment stocks are being helped by the shift to 3D chips from planar chips, he said.End markets for semiconductors are robust, Mok said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes seven chip industry stocks, including three chip gear makers: Advanced Energy Industries, Applied Materials and Lam Research.""With declining costs and ongoing performance improvements, semis are increasingly being deployed in new applications in markets such as Internet of Things, automotive, augmented/virtual reality, and artificial intelligence,"" Mok said. ""Moreover, the significant increase in digital content has led to data center investments to manage and store data, further bolstering demand for semis. We believe these trends will further expand overall semiconductor sales on top of demand from foundational markets such as PC, mobile and communication.""Needham rates Advanced Energy as buy with a price target of 70, Applied Materials as buy with a price target of 43, and KLA as strong buy with a price target of 105.

299,LRCX,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

314,LRCX,"Like New England Patriots Super-Bowl winning quarterback Tom Brady calling an audible, the managers of $422 million Victory Munder Multi-Cap Fund (MNNAX) are barking signals about what they want to do next.Those signals reveal that the managers like semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies, automakers, leisure stocks and media names. They've also been adding to health care stocks like contract manufacturing operations, which the managers don't think will be hurt by alterations to ObamaCare. And they've been trimming banks and adding to capital-markets stocks.The managers' loudest signal is their weighting in information technology, which is the fund's largest sector by far with 26% of their shareholders' money as of Sept. 30. Consumer discretionary — like autos, leisure and media — are their second-biggest sector, with a 17% weighting. Both were overweight vs. the S&P 500, Gura notes.""Our philosophy is bottom up, not top down,"" said lead manager Michael Gura, meaning each stock is chosen or rejected on its own merits, not by whether it fits in a macroeconomic trend. But sector weightings show where the managers feel most likely to score with individual stocks.In tech, Gura and manager Tony Dong are favoring semiconductor and semiconductor equipment names. They're positioned to get lots of work as the industry transitions to more complex manufacturing processes for next-generation chips used for 3D flash memory, the Internet of Things and OLED glass (flexible glass), Gura says.""That's where we're finding a lot of companies that meet our criteria of significant earnings growth at reasonable valuations,"" said Gura, who does not comment on individual stocks.But fund holdings speak volumes. The managers' thinking is reflected in holdings such as Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), which they owned as of Dec. 31. The fund began its current stake in Applied Materials in 2016 and has increased its position. The stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating from IBD. Earnings per share hopped 17%, 52% and 128% the past three quarters. Last Monday, UBS analyst Stephen Chin reiterated his buy rating on the chip-gear maker and raised his price target to 40 from 37.50, IBD's Patrick Seitz reported.Lam, also a newcomer to the portfolio, has very strong 98 Comp Rating. Shares are up 75% in the 12 months going into Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Like Applied Materials, Lam Research is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.In consumer discretionary, the managers are emphasizing autos, leisure and media stocks. Among auto stocks, they hold General Motors (GM). GM has a so-so 72 Comp Rating. But shares fell nearly 5% on Tuesday when the carmaker reported a disappointing 8% decline in fourth-quarter EPS. It rallied on Wednesday.IBD's Bill Peters reports that the automaker says it has had ""very constructive"" dialogue with the Trump administration, but it forecast ""relatively flat"" 2017 results in Europe. Trump has threatened reprisals such as import tariffs and border taxes against U.S. carmakers that create jobs outside the U.S.Victory Munder Multi-Cap also holds Tenneco (TEN), which makes clean-air and ride-performance products. Its Comp Rating is a strong 87. The company reported adjusted Q4 earnings per share of $1.67 on Tuesday. The results beat Wall Street expectations. The auto parts maker reported revenue of $2.15 billion, which also topped Street predictions. Still, shares fell 4.4%.Gura says he is not worried about the prospect of new import duties or border taxes on cars or car parts. That and related issues have pulled down prices on auto-related stocks, a development he sees as a glass half full. ""Those are keeping (share-price) valuations reasonable,"" he said. ""Growth rates still look good, so we're sticking with our exposure.""Marriott Vacations World (VAC) is a leisure holding. The stock joined the portfolio recently. The managers nearly doubled their stake in their latest reporting period. The stock has an 87 Comp Rating. Shares broke out from a cup-with-handle base on Wednesday.CapitalCube noted that Marriott Vacations' dividend yield and dividend payout both lag a group of peers, which could spur Marriott to up its payout.CBS (CBS) is a media holding, with an 87 Comp Rating. Regarding media holdings in general, Gura says he wants content providers whose content will remain desirable by viewers even if they disconnect from or trim usage of traditional cable companies. ""We want content companies that we believe can grow through this era of disconnects and skinny bundles,"" he said.In addition, in the aftermath of the election, the fund has added to holdings in finance. ""We have been trimming banks into this rally because some have had a phenomenal run,"" he said. ""So we're talking some money off the table because valuations are stretched. But we're adding to brokerages and asset managers.""The fund has also added to its health care exposure. ""We've added to managed care and pharmacy benefit managers and also to contract research organizations and contract manufacturing operations (CMOs),"" he said. ""Those areas will be the least impacted by any changes in ObamaCare.""He added, ""With the Trump push to manufacture more in the U.S., there are opportunities for CMOs to pick up share. They should benefit if drug companies want to do more manufacturing in the U.S. to appease Trump.""The fund's 9.27% average annual gain over the three years going into Thursday topped 74% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.The market's tilt in favor of value stocks early last year blew a headwind toward the fund. The rotation back toward growth provides the fund with a tail wind. ""In a market like this, there's no shortage of ideas for us,"" Gura said.RELATED:AllianzGI Fund's Bets On Regional Banks Are Paying OffLeading Stocks That Are Driving A Hot Mutual Fund's Rally

315,LRCX,"ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple (AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure to this sector.This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far this year suggests that ETF investors are ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by 27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names include Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) — tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven, Internet of Things era — as well as chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texas Instruments (TXN), Microsemi (MSCC), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Outliers included Alphabet (GOOGL) and Qualcomm (QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6% expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism about improving industry fundamentals.While earnings season has put technology companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows and consumption increases, tech companies will be the beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches — 3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies, including more small- and microcap stocks than most other broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366 stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike but offer very different exposures, which affects their performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy, given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on the stock market on Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As Trump Takes The Wheel

316,LRCX,"Stocks rolled higher at Friday's open,  gathering strength after a disappointing August payrolls report heading into the holiday weekend.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 clocked early 0.2% gains. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.3% as it closed in on a new high just above 6.460.X The Labor Department's August payrolls report showed a gain of 156,000 new jobs in August. That was well below the downshift to 180,000 new jobs forecast by economists. The report also cut its July estimate to 189,000, down from an initial 209,000 estimate.The change lifted the unemployment rate to 4.4%, from 4.3%, although the participation rate remained stable at 62.9%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.1%, vs. 0.3% in July — below estimates for a 0.2% gain. A bright spot in the report was manufacturing payrolls, which swelled by 36,000, far above consensus views for 9,000 new jobs. The report also raised its July hiring estimate among manufacturers to 26,000, up from an initial tally of 16,000 workers added.Later this morning, manufacturing indexes from Markit and the Institute of Supply Management are due at 9:45 a.m. and 10 a.m. ET, respectively.

317,LRCX,"The Nasdaq composite led the stock market higher Monday, as the technology sector spearheaded the advance.XThe Nasdaq rose 0.5% but remained in a sideways trend that is now more than a week old.

While many other chip-equipment stocks have not recovered from that slide, the ones forming handles managed to recover.Nvidia (NVDA), which is in the chip designers group, pushed above the 168.60 buy point of a base.

339,LRCX,"With its Q2 earnings report on tap for Jul. 31, Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) is forming a new base with an 86.35 entry.The consolidation comes after the semiconductor equipment maker rose nearly 200% from a February 2016 breakout.Advanced Energy Industries has been finding support at its 50-day line and its 10-day moving average is close to getting back above that benchmark line.

340,LRCX,"Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP) is forming a base with an 81.95 buy point as it gets set to report its next round of earnings on Jul. 27.The chip sector stock is forming a first-stage cup without handle and has been showing support at its 10-week line. Cabot flashed a bullish reversal Monday and its 10-day moving average has moved back above its longer term 50-day line.X Be aware that buying a stock close to earnings is risky, since an EPS or sales miss could send it sharply lower. You can minimize your risk by waiting to see how the company reports and how the market reacts.

That's also good news for rival Applied Materials, the analyst said in a research note Monday. He increased his price target on Lam Research stock to 119 from 111.Leading the better outlook, said Ahmad, is the firm's equipment used to make 3D and flash chips, the cutting-edge technology that cuts costs but increases performance for flash chips used in smartphone and many consumer electronics and other products.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Relative Strength Rating rates stocks from 1 to 99 vs. all the other Nasdaq and NYSE stocks in performance over the past 12 months, but a stock's Relative Strength line compares its price performance to the S&P 500.

350,LRCX,"Investors should follow the action of the major averages and leading stocks. So what did they tell us on Thursday? 1. The dollar is a big market driver, especially for multinationals. 2. Apple (AAPL) and a slew of iPhone-related stocks continue to lag and break key technical levels. 3. Overnight trading is not always confirmed in the next day's regular-session trades.X S&P 500 index futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value in early Friday morning trading. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.45%.Stocks opened higher in Thursday's market trading in part on overnight comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that ""a weaker dollar is good"" for U.S. trade, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. But President Trump told CNBC on Thursday afternoon that Mnuchin's comments were taken out of context and he sees the dollar strengthening. That sent the dollar higher, closing little changed. The major averages pulled back on Trump, then steadied at the close along with the currency.A weaker greenback makes U.S. exports more competitive and flatters companies' overseas profits in dollar terms. So shares of U.S. companies with big exposure to foreign markets tend to do better with a falling dollar.Apple's relative weakness has been a steady theme in the evening Stock Market Today column. A day after falling below a recent flat-base buy point in heavy volume, Apple slid 1.8% to 171.11 on mounting concerns over iPhone X demand. The stock closed modestly below its 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, slumped to its worst level since July. (The RS line is the blue line in the chart below.)That underperformance is magnified by the action of iPhone-related stocks.Broadcom (AVGO) fell below its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly two years, joining fellow iPhone chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO). All three stocks' RS lines are at 52-week lows.Universal Display (OLED), which makes technology used in making OLED screens for high-end phones like the iPhone X and other devices, tumbled 5.7% to 168.25. That's part of a 19% five-day sell-off, plunging Universal Display below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. That follows another failed OLED-related breakout: laser maker Coherent (COHR).There's an old Russian proverb that morning is wiser than the evening. That's certainly something to keep in mind with after-hours action. In the midst of earnings season you'll see dozens of stocks soaring or tumbling after the market close or before the opening bell. Sometimes that carries over to the next regular trading session, but sometimes the action is radically different.There are many reasons why. Extended trading, even when relatively heavy, is thin compared with activity in regular exchange hours. Investors may miss key details initially that are picked up on later. Companies sometimes hold conference calls the next morning or after the opening bell.In late trading Wednesday, Lam Research (LRCX) and Xilinx (XLNX) rallied on earnings and looked set to at least test buy points. But after opening higher, the chip stocks reversed sharply lower, both closing down about 5%.Keep that in mind for Friday's regular session. Industry giant Intel (INTC) rallied in extended trading on its earnings report and sales guidance. That's a hopeful sign for how Intel will trade in normal hours, but no guarantee.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Blue Chips Advance, But Breakouts Sparse After Facebook And Google Breakouts, This Internet Stock May Be Next 3 China Names In Buy Range; Can You Find The Strengths, Flaws?Where To Look For Dominance In The Stock MarketHighflying New Issue Looks To Add To Its Big 2017 Post-IPO GainsIntel Rises Late On Strong Earnings, Guidance

Commodities moved moderately higher, crude oil was among the fastest early movers, although West Texas Intermediate had narrowed its early gain to less than 1%.Intel (INTC) and Boeing (BA) stepped up to lead the Dow, up 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Caterpillar shed its early 1.8% advance to trade effectively flat. Its fourth-quarter results showed earnings comfortably above expectations, after reporting Wednesday its overall sales growth accelerated to a 34% gain during the quarter,  a six-year high.

The maker of radiation therapy and imaging systems reported late Wednesday its fiscal first-quarter earnings spiked 113%, with revenue and full-year guidance also topping forecasts. The gain marked a breakout past a 114.19 buy point in a first-stage flat base.Tal Education (TAL) spiked almost 11% at the open. The China-based chain of test preparation and tutoring centers scored a strong fiscal third-quarter performance, although fourth-quarter revenue guidance was below consensus views. But an 85% surge in student enrollments lifted its total student base to above 1.5 million.Tal's stock has been fighting to retain support at its 10-week moving average, and remained 13% below a 36.26 buy point in a very late-stage base.In economic news, first-time unemployment claims rose to 233,000 in the week ended Jan. 20, the Labor Department said, up from 216,000 claims in the prior week, but well below economist forecasts for 240,000 applications.The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators and new homes sales numbers from the Commerce Department, both for December, are due at 10 a.m. ET.Asia's markets came under pressure, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ending down 0.9% to snap a seven-day advance — only the index's second decline in the past 23 sessions.

But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled on guidance that fell short of estimates.X S&P 500 index futures and Dow futures climbed nearly 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.45%.Apple shares fell 1.6% to 174.22 in Wednesday's stock market trading, dropping back below a 175.34 flat-base buy point. The stock did find support at its 50-day moving average, as it has since the last days of 2017. But volume was the highest since Nov. 3 and was the heaviest trade in a down session since September.Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, fell yet again. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Already at consolidation lows, Apple's RS line is now approaching longer-term levels. Apple's stock hasn't made much headway vs. the S&P 500 for several months.Apple shares rose a fraction in early Thursday trading.A growing number of Apple analysts are warning of weak iPhone demand. Perhaps the bad news is being priced, or overpriced, into the stock ahead of earnings next week.Lam Research earned $4.34 a share in its fiscal second quarter excluding various items including a tax-related charge, up 94% vs. a year earlier and well above views for $3.69 according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose 37% to $2.58 billion, just above analyst forecasts for $2.57 billion.For fiscal Q3 ending in April, Lam Research expects EPS of $4.20-$4.50 and revenue of $2.73 billion to $2.98 billion. Wall Street was looking for EPS of $3.81 and revenue of $2.66 billion.Lam Research shares rose 4.7% to 219.50 in early Thursday trading after falling 2.5% to 209.73 on Wednesday. The stock had rallied in the prior six sessions.Lam's after-hours action suggests the stock could test its 219.80 cup-base buy point. Lam's RS line remains off its highs near the left side of the consolidation. But the RS line has made some progress, clearing some short-term highs.Lam's results follow strong earnings and a bullish outlook from ASML Holding (ASML) last week, as well as strong preliminary revenue figures and sales guidance from Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific (ESIO).KLA-Tencor (KLAC), which is at the edge of a buy zone, reports earnings Thursday.Xilinx earned 76 cents a share excluding various items and a tax-related charge, up 46% vs. a year earlier. That was the best gain in four years and easily beat fiscal third-quarter views for 63 cents. Revenue rose 8% to $631.2 million vs. views for $630 million. That's just OK, but is the best top-line growth in five quarters.For the current quarter, Xilinx sees revenue of $635 million to $665 million. That $650 million midpoint is above Wall Street forecasts and would be a 6.7% yearly gain.Xilinx rose 4.8% to 78 in premarket trading, suggesting a move back above a 75.24 buy point. Xilinx fell out of buy range on Wednesday, losing 2.7% to 73.48.The RS line is definitely a concern. It's well below the consolidation's high and hasn't made headway for the past year. A powerful price move Thursday could push the RS line over short-term levels.Teradyne earned 46 cents a share in its fourth quarter on sales of $479 million vs. views for 34 cents and $438 million, respectively. The chip-equipment maker also hiked its quarterly dividend by 29% to 9 cents a share.But Teradyne gave EPS and revenue guidance that, at the midpoint, is below the consensus.Teradyne shares fell 5.7% to 44.99 in late trading but were not yet active early Thursday. The stock had closed down 3.4% to 46.79, moving back into buy range from a 44.72 entry.Extended trading doesn't always carry over to the next regular session, but Teradyne looks set to test its buy point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: What The Market's Wild Day Tells UsThese 5 Stocks Are Racing To Buys From The Hottest Group Right NowIs This Hot Chip Name Ready To Break Out From Early-Stage Base?Apple Sits As Bulls Run; Another OLED Play Falls Below Buy PointIs This IPO With 322% Growth Following In Facebook's Footsteps?These Are The Top 20 Stocks That Millennials Own, Says Robinhood

353,LRCX,"Chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) initially got a lift from the Bitcoin mining craze in the December quarter as it topped sales and earnings estimates for the period, but couldn't hold on to those gains.Meanwhile, STMicroelectronics (STM) also beat Wall Street's targets for the fourth quarter.Xilinx late Wednesday reported adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, up 29% year over year, on sales of $631 million, up 8%, in its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 30. Analysts had expected 63 cents and $630 million.""We delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth with December-quarter revenues establishing a new record for Xilinx and we achieved our operating-margin target of 30% one quarter ahead of schedule,"" Xilinx Chief Executive Moshe Gavrielov said in a news release.Xilinx shares jumped 2% at the opening bell, but then fell sharply into negative ground. At the close, Xilinx was down 5.1% to 60.74 on the stock market today.Upside in the quarter was driven by about $12 million in Bitcoin-related sales of field-programmable gate arrays, ""without which the company might have missed"" estimates, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report. Its FPGA chips are being used for cryptocurrency mining in Bitcoin rigs, Rolland said.Xilinx likely booked over $8 million in Bitcoin-related FPGA sales in the first few weeks of 2018 as well, he said. However, Rolland believes the Bitcoin boost for Xilinx will be temporary.""We still contend that crypto-related currency is less durable than their other end-markets ... and that this revenue can disappear fully over two quarters,"" he said. Rolland rates Xilinx stock as neutral, but raised his price target to 70 from 65.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.San Jose, Calif.-based Xilinx received 47% of its revenue from industrial, aerospace and defense applications in the December quarter, 35% from communications and data center, and 18% from broadcast, consumer and automotive. Xilinx includes its cryptocurrency-related sales in its consumer segment.For the March quarter, Xilinx guided to sales of $650 million, vs. the consensus estimate of $643 million. It did not give an EPS target, but analysts said its implied guidance should top the consensus of 68 cents.Meanwhile, STMicroelectronics early Thursday reported adjusted earnings per share of 41 cents, up 156% year over year, on sales of $2.47 billion, up 33%, for the fourth quarter. Analysts expected 35 cents and $2.36 billion.""We continue to see solid demand across product groups and geographies and, in the first quarter, we anticipate a better-than-seasonal trend for Smart Driving and Internet of Things applications, and the unfavorable seasonal dynamics for smartphone applications,"" ST Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti said in a news release.Geneva-based ST expects sales to rise 22% year over year to $2.22 billion in the first quarter, slightly below views for $2.23 billion.ST shares dropped 1.8% to close at 22.91.Elsewhere in the semiconductor sector, chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) got an early bounce from its December-quarter earnings report, but those gains evaporated.Lam Research stock was up as much as 4.2% in early trading, but by afternoon it reversed and was down 5% to 199.25.Fremont, Calif.-based Lam delivered better-than-expected December-quarter sales and earnings late Wednesday and gave March-quarter guidance above views.RELATED:Qualcomm Slapped With Antitrust Fine; TI Dips On Growth ConcernsLam Research Stock Jumps On Beat-And-Raise QuarterApple Falls Below Buy Point; These Two Chip Stocks Soar On Earnings: S&P 500 Futures

355,LRCX,"Semiconductor stocks fell Monday after Morgan Stanley issued downgrades on several chipmakers, including Western Digital (WDC), on concerns that prices for memory chips will fall.XMorgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty cut her rating on Western Digital to equal weight from overweight, based on an expectation that prices of Nand flash-memory chips are peaking and could fall as much as 15%, starting in the first quarter. Huberty cut her price target on Western Digital to 117 from 90, which was also based on uncertainty around the outcome of Western Digital's joint venture with Toshiba.Western Digital shares dropped 6.7% to close at 86.55 on the stock market today.Among other chipmakers, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was lowered by Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan to equal weight from overweight, while Morgan Stanley analyst Shawn Kim lowered his rating on Samsung Electronics to equal weight from overweight.""We think now is the time to reduce exposure to Nand (flash memory) and Asian semiconductor names as the industry has benefited from sizable demand tailwinds and unprecedented pricing power, which we see reversing soon,"" Kim wrote in a research note to clients Sunday.

Bookmark this page to stay on top of the latest news in chips.Micron Technology (MU), another big supplier of memory chips, was down 3.4%, near 50.

Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) popped 6% higher in heavy volume but this came after a 34% gap down Friday. The small cap company recently beat the Street's consensus number on earnings by about 17% but offered soft guidance for current quarter revenue.Earnings in Q2 rocketed 862% on a 112% revenue increase but that wasn't enough to counter the guidance disappointment. Applied may have run into the priced-for-perfection scenario. The stock broke out in January from a 27.38 buy point and topped 100 in late July.Chip equipment maker Brooks Automation (BRKS) rose more than 9% after losing 12% over the past two weeks. Fellow chip sector stock Lam Research (LRCX) rose 3% after pulling as much as 12% off its recent high.The restaurant stocks cooked up some selective gains.Wingstop (WING) cleared a 33.35 buy point in the first five minutes of trade but then pulled back mildly under the entry. The stock has an EPS Rating of 97, which puts it in the top 3 percentile in earnings growth.Burger King and Tim Hortons operator Restaurant Brands (QSR) also tried to clear a consolidation, as the big-cap stock headed toward its fourth daily gain in a row.Many of the restaurant stocks are damaged goods. Starbucks (SBUX), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Sonic (SONC) are among restaurant stocks trading under their 50-day and 200-day lines.Apple (AAPL) crept above an odd consolidation, but volume was soft. The stock broke out in January and advanced about 33% before beginning the current consolidation. Apple is expected to grow earnings 8% in fiscal 2017 ending in September but then pick up growth to 20% in fiscal 2018.RELATED:Two China-Based Stocks Test Buy PointsIs This Sector Poised For A Trump Bump?Also In Stock Market Today: 3 Reasons Why Apple Could Rise Another 20%

373,LRCX,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

Gilead Sciences (GILD) reported that its hepatitis C drug franchise declined 27.5% but was partially offset by 16.1% growth in HIV and hepatitis B drug sales. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) said total cystic fibrosis sales gapped up 20.7%. Celgene (CELG) and Alexion (ALXN) also beat views with the latter busting EPS expectations by 30 cents.AstraZeneca (AZN) crashed 15% Thursday after reporting that its Mystic lung cancer trial of an immuno-therapy combination failed. The U.K. drugmaker also announced a deal with Merck (MRK) to gain access to the latter's I-O blockbuster Keytruda. Merck rose 3% on Thursday. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which has had several setbacks for its I-O drug Opdivo, slid 3% on concerns that the Mystic failure bodes ill for a similar Opdivo-combo study.Wall Street soured on casino players like MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) as the sector overall put up mixed results and guidance. Concerns about mass-market gaming in Macau weighed on Wynn, whose Q2 results nonetheless beat estimates. MGM offered a weak revenue-per-available-room outlook. It also cited ""higher-than-anticipated disruption"" at the Monte Carlo, which is being revamped into Park MGM, and a ""challenging comparison"" on the Las Vegas Strip in Q3. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped; results from Melco and U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) were mixed.Shares in AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) soared after the telecoms reported better-than-expected wireless results amid stiff competition. AT&T narrowed its losses of high-spending postpaid phone subscribers while Verizon added more than forecast. AT&T says its strategy of packaging video and wireless services is jelling. Verizon says consumers are willing to pay a premium for its unlimited data services because of its high-performing network.Comcast (CMCSA) reported second-quarter profit and revenue that topped estimates, as NBCUniversal's filmed-entertainment business delivered strong box office results, but video subscriber losses were higher than expected. Citigroup speculated that Comcast could acquire Verizon. Charter Communications (CHTR) missed on earnings and sales, but shares soared amid speculation that it could be acquired as well.McDonald's (MCD) Q2 earnings and same-store sales topped estimates, helped by cheap drink offerings and ""premium"" menu items. Chipotle (CMG) is testing queso but faced concerns that its sales recovery had stumbled following a food-borne illness scare that began in 2015; the sales impact from reports of customers who fell ill in July remained unclear. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed in part on disappointing Q2 international comps, lower margins, an EPS helped by the tax rate and an already-high stock valuation. Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth. Caterpillar (CAT) surged to a 52-week high after the company saw EPS of $1.49, up 36.7%, on revenue of $11.33 billion, up 9.6%. United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million. For the current quarter, the China-based education company sees revenue of $428.4 million to $433.8 million, above views for $424.8 million, per Yahoo Finance estimates. Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion. Shares of the Chinese search giant rose 9.45% on Friday.Electronic Arts (EA) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, but the video game publisher gave cautious revenue guidance. EA shares rose Friday after briefly falling below a recent buy point.

381,LRCX,"The Dow Jones industrial average ran ahead of the stock market again Wednesday, as Boeing (BA) gave the industrials a market-leading gain.The Dow was up 0.4% and climbed to a record high. The average was the only major index that had not made a record high already this week. Dow component Boeing gapped up more than 8% to an all-time high after the aerospace and defense giant reported quarterly results and gave a bullish outlook.XThe S&P 500 rose a fraction and the Nasdaq 0.1% as both reached record highs as well. Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE compared with the same time Tuesday. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 off by 0.2%.Energy stocks were one of the day's leaders as U.S. crude prices jumped 1.5% to $48.61 a barrel, the highest in nearly eight weeks. The Energy Department reported today that U.S. crude inventories fell sharply last week.Chip stocks also drew some institutional interest, accounting for some of the gains in higher-than-normal volume.Broadcom (AVGO) moved just past the 256.88 buy point of a flat base. The price increase seemed limp and volume was well below normal — two characteristics that dampened an otherwise bullish move. Lam Research (LRCX) is trying to break out past a 167.15 buy point.In the software sector, Electronic Arts (EA) climbed above the 116.14 buy point of a flat base. Afternoon volume was about one-fourth higher than normal, not quite as much as you normally find with successful breakouts. BofA/Merrill Lynch upgraded the video game publisher to buy from neutral and hiked the price target to 131 from 125.

382,LRCX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and especially the Nasdaq 100 rallied early Thursday, fueled by Facebook (FB) rallying late on its strong Q2 earnings. Facebook's fellow FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) is on tap Thursday evening, with Amazon shares currently in buy range. Electronic Arts (EA), Baidu (BIDU) and Mastercard (MA) also are in buy zones with earnings set for Thursday.XAmazon, Electronic Arts and Mastercard all have stellar Composite Ratings of 95 or above, while Baidu's is a solid 83. But three of the four stocks have already moved into the upper half of their 5% chase zones, with Amazon's chart offering additional reasons to be wary.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.55%, with Facebook trading 4% higher in the after-hours session. PayPal (PYPL) and Lam Research (LRCX) also contributed with after-hours earnings gains. Futures for the Dow industrials ticked 0.1% higher.All eyes will be on the e-commerce giant Thursday. Economists expect a 21% earnings per share drop to $1.40, with revenue up 22% to $37.214 billion.Amazon apparently had a successful Prime Day on July 10, with big sales of its Alexa-enabled Echo speakers as well as new Prime memberships. But those won't be included in Q2's results.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Amazon rose 1.2% to 1,052.80 in Wednesday stock market trading. That's above a 1,016.60 flat-base buy point. The 5% chase zone rises to 1,067.43, so Amazon is still buyable. However, it's always better to buy as close to the entry point as possible to minimize the potential losses. Amazon is 3.6% above the entry as of Wednesday, and was trading at 1,061.50 in premarket trading.Meanwhile, Amazon cleared a fourth-stage base. Late-stage patterns are more prone to failure. Also, Amazon's breakout came on lackluster volume.On the upside, Amazon's relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign and reflecting the stock's outperformance of the S&P 500.Amazon has a 98 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 98% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental criteria. Big stock winners often have 95+ Composite Ratings near the start of their big runs.The Chinese search giant has struggled in recent quarters, especially in comparison to many other Chinese internet giants. Baidu is making a big throw on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. In the meantime, analysts expect Baidu to report Q2 EPS of $1.42, up 16%, on revenue of $2.78 billion, up 1%.Baidu climbed 2.1% to 201.17 on Wednesday. The stock was still within buy range from a cup base at a 193.84 entry, though it's nearly 4% above that point. You could also view Baidu as being within a pattern going back into 2016, but the buy point would remain the same.Baidu has the opposite problem of Amazon. Baidu is in a first-stage base, but because the stock has largely gone sideways over the past year, its relative strength line is lagging.Electronic Arts is expected to report EPS of 28 cents, up 300% vs. a year earlier. Revenue should climb 12% to $766 million.The video game publisher's stock broke out on Wednesday, rising 3.8% to 118, clearing a 116.14 flat-base buy point with volume that was 41% above normal. Electronic Arts has a 95 Composite Rating and a strong RS line.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is at new-high ground, while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) cleared an entry point on Tuesday.Mastercard reports before the market open. Analysts expect an 8% EPS gain to $1.04 with revenue up 10.5% to $2.978 billion.Mastercard rose 0.8% to 130.99, its 14th straight gain, mostly in small doses. The stock cleared a flat-base entry of 126.29 on July 14 and is now 3.7% above that level. Mastercard has had a few above-average-volume days in its breakout move, but not many.Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), which reported earnings last week, are in the upper end of buy ranges. PayPal, which topped views late Wednesday, and Square (SQ), are among the other recent stock breakouts in the finance-payment group, though they are both extended.RELATED:Facebook Earnings Soar; Users Hit New Milestone4 Big Earnings You Can't Miss Thursday: Investing Action PlanVideo Game, Chip Stocks Climb To New Buy PointsHere's What Analysts Are Saying About Amazon Ahead Of Earnings

383,LRCX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point. Edwards Lifesciences has fallen back below a buy point in a big cup-with-handle base, undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), D.R. Horton (DHI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Fortinet (FTNT) are among the many other top-rated stocks set to report earnings Wednesday.RELATED:Texas Instruments, AMD Beat Q2 Targets, Guide HigherAT&T Q2 Adjusted Profit Beats, Pay-TV Video Subscribers FallWill Facebook Earnings Support Its Strong Stock Growth?The Big Picture: Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials LeadHow To Win With Growth Stocks Like Netflix, Nvidia During Earnings

385,LRCX,"Chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) saw its shares jump to record high territory on Wednesday after the Netherlands-based company posted better-than-expected sales and earnings during the second quarter.ASML stock was up 4%, near 149, intraday on the stock market today. On Wednesday, the company reported earnings per share of $1.23, up 34% year over year, on sales of $2.4 billion, up 23%. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.02 a share and $2.2 billion.The news ushered others in the sector to substantial gains as well, with Lam Research (LRCX), Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) all up more than 2% in midday trades. Advanced Energy, in particular, pushed above its 50-day moving average.ASML makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment with a focus on lithography systems, which etch circuits onto chips.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes four companies from the semiconductor capital equipment sector, including Lam Research and Applied Materials.""With these strong results in the second quarter, ASML is on track to achieving net sales growth of about 25% for the full year,"" ASML Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink said in a prepared statement.

387,LRCX,"The recent sell-off in shares of semiconductor-equipment makers has created some attractive buying opportunities, Needham analyst Edwin Mok said Friday.IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group peaked on June 9 and has fallen 16.7% through Thursday's close. The group is currently ranked No. 15 out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. Just a month ago, it was the No. 2 group.""After reaching an intraday high on June 9, the (semiconductor capital equipment) stocks have been selling off with the tech sector, with the group declining more than the rest of the market,"" Mok said in a note to clients. ""We have multiple investors asking us if anything has fundamentally changed for the group. As we stated in our June 27 note, we believe the fundamentals of the group remain strong, but we expect volatility for semi-cap stocks to increase in the coming months.""Mok recommends using the near-term weakness in the sector to buy select stocks ahead of the Semicon conference July 11-13, which is usually an upbeat event and could be a potential catalyst to turn the tide for sector stocks.On his buy list are Lam Research (LRCX), Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) and Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP).IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Lam Research shaved early losses of as much as 1%; at the session low of 140.83, the big-cap tech and IBD 50 member was off as much as 15.7% from its all-time peak of 167.05 hit last month. This means the current correction is too deep for a flat base, but a cup or double-bottom pattern could eventually form.Advanced Energy was flat, near 65.20. Axcelis sank 1.5%, near 21, falling further below its rising 50-day moving average, which is near 21.89. Cabot Microelectronics was down more than 1%, near 73.76, and has been hovering right below its 50-day line for more than two weeks.Mok attributes some of the sell-off in the sector to profit-taking, because the group was up 28.3% year-to-date through Thursday.""Some investors fear the group is peaking, and this will likely keep semi-cap stocks volatile in the near term,"" Mok said. ""While second-half 2017 is unlikely to deliver much growth for most semi-caps, we remain confident in our long-term view that the industry is only at the middle of a three-year growth cycle (starting in 2016), with China potentially an incremental driver that could extend this cycle further to the 2019-2020 time frame.""Separately, Stifel analyst Patrick Ho also believes the recent pullback in chip-gear stocks is a buying opportunity in the sector for investors.Strong spending on 3D Nand memory chips has positive ramifications for Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research and Nanometrics (NANO), Ho said in a report Friday. Component suppliers like MKS Instruments (MKSI), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT) also should benefit from the trend.Applied Materials, Lam Research and Ichor are on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.RELATED:Micron Technology Gets Slew Of Price-Target Hikes, But Shares Fall

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average had more muted advances, up 0.2% and less than 0.1%, respectively.XAmong the Dow industrials, DuPont (DD) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) paced the advancers, rising about 1% each. DuPont remains in buy range from a 82.40 double-bottom entry, while UnitedHealth touched a new high as its gains from a 164.10 flat-base entry approach 20%.On the downside, IBM (IBM) reported earnings late Tuesday, prompting a 4% fall in shares. Shares reached a new 2017 low, almost 20% off its highs.Among other companies reporting earnings, investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) jumped 2.5% in the stock market today on its way back above a 46.08 cup-with-handle entry. The company reported stronger-than-expected Q2 results early Wednesday.In the meantime, railroad operator CSX (CSX) dropped 5% to trade under its 50-day line. The company topped Q2 targets late Tuesday, but suggested that shareholders returns may not be as plentiful.Among analyst actions, PayPal (PYPL) was downgraded to hold from buy at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Shares fell 2% early as shares slipped back into the 5% buy range from a 55.24 flat-base buy point.Meanwhile, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) received dueling analyst opinions following reports Tuesday that customers were sickened at one of its restaurants in Virginia. BMO Capital Markets and Wells Fargo Securities downgraded the stock to market perform, while Telsey Advisory Group upgraded it to outperform.

389,LRCX,"The Nasdaq looked poised for its ninth straight gain in afternoon trading Wednesday, helped by strength in fiber-optic, networking and chip-equipment stocks.The Nasdaq composite rose about 0.7%; the S&P 500 added 0.5% as oil and gas stocks outperformed, while the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.2%, weighed down by weak earnings from IBM (IBM). Small caps did well with the Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking a tad higher than Tuesday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, August West Texas Intermediate crude oil rallied 72 cents, or 1.6%, to $47.12 a barrel, about a six-week high, after weekly U.S. supply data showed a sharp drop in stockpiles last week. Meanwhile, production climbed to the highest level since July 2015, according to the Energy Information Administration.In the stock market today, fiber-optic stocks outperformed again. The outright leader in the group is Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), but it's too late to buy because the stock is extended in price after a 25% gain last week. Shares are up an additional 13% this week.Earlier today, Crown Castle International (CCI) announced plans to buy Lightower for $7.1 billion. The deal will nearly double the miles of fiber that Crown Castle controls to 60,000 from 32,000, allowing it to expand its cellular service in key markets, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia.Chip-equipment firms got another lift after Dutch firm ASML Holding (ASML) jumped 4.5% on strong earnings. Industry-group peer MKS Instruments (MKSI) was featured in Tuesday's Sector Leaders column.Inside the IBD 50, chip-equipment firms, Ichor (ICHR), Nova Measuring Instruments (NVMI)and Lam Research (LRCX) outperformed with gains of 3% to 4%. The IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks looked poised for another day of outperformance, with 20 names up 1% or more.Also in the IBD 50, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) popped 2.5% to 119.42, making a good case for support at the 50-day moving average as it trades just below a 120.84 alternate-handle entry.Elsewhere, U.S. spice maker McCormick (MKC) slumped 5% on news it's acquiring Reckitt Benckiser's North American food business for $4.2 billion. Some of Reckitt's more popular brands include French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce.Meanwhile, Discovery Communications (DISCA) gapped up but was off sessions on reports that the company is in talks to acquire  Scripps Networks (SNI).

390,LRCX,"A day after the Nasdaq rebounded forcefully but in weaker turnover, the tech-heavy composite got smacked by institutional-quality selling Thursday with an hour to go in a dismal market session. However, some last-hour bargain hunting took a little sting out of the broad decline.X The Nasdaq, a 1.4% gainer Wednesday, had dropped more than 2% in afternoon trading and undercut its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 18. Yet the tech-weighted composite shaved that loss to 1.4% by day's end, closing a hair below the key support level.In a strong bull market, the major indexes hold above their 50-day moving averages, which in turn run above their slower-moving 200-day moving averages.Fiber optic telecom gear, semiconductor, chip equipment, enterprise software, e-commerce and Chinese internet companies led the decline, as did gold mining, automaker and homebuilder stocks. All of these groups fell 2% or more.The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1.7%. At the session low of 5599, the gauge of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange dipped 5.1% off its June 9 peak of 5897.That's large enough of a decline to justify IBD's decision Tuesday to downgrade the current market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" after the Nasdaq suffered its fifth distribution day in recent weeks.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost around 0.7% to 0.8% as volume picked up on both main exchanges vs. the same time Wednesday. The 500 scored a nice bounce off its 50-day line.With one trading day remaining in the first half of 2017, the large-cap S&P 500 sports a year-to-date gain of 8.1%, vs. gains of 2.2% for the S&P SmallCap 600, which dropped less than 0.6% in the stock market today.An uptrend under pressure doesn't necessarily mean a full-blown correction is guaranteed, but the prospects are certainly higher. A pullback would in fact be healthy for U.S. equities, given the strong gains since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The last time the Nasdaq 100 dropped 5% or more was during a nine-day selling streak from Oct. 25 to Nov. 4, just ahead of the elections. The index slumped below its 50-day moving average, yet kept well above its critical long-term 200-day moving average.Within the IBD 50, Lam Research (LRCX) signaled it's time to take at least some profits as shares dived further beneath the 50-day moving average.The chip equipment expert slid more than 6% to 141.23 and is now 15% below its all-time peak of 167.05.But other leaders in the IBD 50 continue to hold up pretty well.Arista Networks (ANET), Nvidia (NVDA) and Veeva Systems (VEEV), representing innovation and leadership in the computer networking, graphic processors and medical software markets, continue to trade on the north side of their 50-day lines.Apple (AAPL) slumped as much as 2.5% to as low as 142.28, then whittled the loss by day's end to 1.5% at 143.68. Apple is 8% off its all-time peak of 156.65; volume grew just 8% above its 50-day average.Steeper declines would justify those shareholders who recently bought shares to sell them, in order to protect those gains made since the iPhone maker's Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12. Apple is also barely above a 3-weeks-tight follow-on entry that was highlighted in IBD Leaderboard.However, holders with a large profit cushion can afford the luxury of watching for the potential development of a new base, which would mean that Apple would again attract strong buying to the point of getting shares back to a high enough price level in which to break out again to new highs.Despite some ongoing analyst concerns about the Cupertino, Calif., firm's ability to make good on a pledge to double its services revenue by 2020, Apple continues to be good at lowballing its forecasts and overdelivering. Keep in mind that the Street is expecting another quarter of low double-digit earnings gains for the June-ended fiscal third quarter, up 11%.Apple's profit had slumped 18%, 23% and 15% vs. year-ago quarters during Q2, Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, but then rebounded 2% in Q1 (December) and 11% in Q2 (March 2017).In other financial markets, government bond selling continued and the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose again to 2.27%, the highest since May 23. Higher interest rates allow lenders, especially those with a low cost of attaining deposits, to expand their profit margins.Therefore, as seen in today's New High List, banks and other large insurers gained ground.However, homebuilders got smacked with losses, and IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group slumped hard, down nearly 3.8%.MDC Holdings (MDC) reversed just a day after its breakout past a five-week flat base at 36.09, falling more than 3% to 35.34 in above-average turnover. The Denver-based builder, however, is still in a handsome uptrend since clearing a longer cup-type base at 26.37 in November last year. The stock is also still on the north side of its fast-rising 50-day moving average, a sign of strength.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, MDC boasts excellent SmartSelect ratings, including a 98 Composite, 91 EPS and 93 RS.RELATED:When Did The Nasdaq Score Its 5th Distribution Day?Know This Sell Rule: The Biggest Single-Session Point Decline Since The BreakoutWhere Is The Market Headed?

391,LRCX,"The Nasdaq composite led the stock market lower Tuesday afternoon, though the selling certainly wasn't limited to that index.The Nasdaq was off 1.1% after semiconductors and other technology stocks sold off, including the FANGs. Netflix (NFLX) fell nearly 4% and slid right back below the 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 lost 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.2% as indexes traded near session lows. The small-cap Russell 2000 was down 0.4%.Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Monday. Losers led winners by 9-to-7 across the board.Chip stocks and related industries, such as contract manufacturers of electronics, were in full retreat. Those group were down 1.7% to 2.3%.Three tech stocks fell below the 50-day moving average, and in each case it was the first time they violated that price indicator in many months.Lam Research (LRCX) this week is closing below the 50-day line for the first time since November. Applied Materials (AMAT) dipped below the 50-day line for the first time since the September-November basing period. Coherent (COHR), a laser technology company, had not fallen below the line since November also.None of the moves amounted to a sell signal, and they came in mild volume. Nonetheless, they mark a change in the stocks that may lead to a longer change in direction.In the internet sector, Grubhub (GRUB) triggered a sell rule after it fell more than 8% below the buy point. The stock has not been able to shake off sellers that swarmed after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock Monday.Biotechs also contributed to the Nasdaq's slide. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotech (BIB), an ETF that doubles the performance of its underlying index, dropped nearly 4% and was one of the most active stocks in today's market.Financials were doing better, as were energy and some other industry groups in the lower reaches of the performance table.Charles Schwab (SCHW) broke out past the 42.71 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But volume was merely average, and the relative strength line has yet to make a new high.On the IBD 50, also keep an eye on another broker, Lazard (LAZ). The stock is nearing the 47.19 buy point of a flat base.RELATED:Dow Component Merck Fails To Impress With Cholesterol-Busting Drug Chip Stock Breaks Out On Likely Apple iPhone 8 Contract Win

392,LRCX,"Electronics firms paced a sharp decline in the tech sector and the Nasdaq composite dropped the hardest among the major indexes on Tuesday, down 1.6%.Volume grew on both main exchanges, according to early data, signifying a new distribution day, or unusually heavy institutional selling.XThe Nasdaq composite gave back more than half of last week's stout 1.9% gain. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, at least five electronics-related groups sank 1.5% or more, including semiconductor equipment, fabless semiconductors, contract manufacturing and chipmaking.IBD'S TAKE: Which were the best 10 industry groups in the market today? And the 10 worst? See the price changes of all 197 industry groups by viewing the entire ""Industry Sub-Group Rankings,"" available at Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com.The S&P 500 slipped nearly 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%. A rebound in department store, home furnishings retailing, jewelry, discount and variety retail, consumer lending, superregional bank, oil field services and hospital stocks helped cushion the blow.Investor demand for banks rose as the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond jumped 6 basis points to 2.20%. The sharp sell-off in bond prices came on the back of comments by Fed chief Janet Yellen that appeared to favor additional interest-rate hikes this year.The Dow utility average, also sensitive to interest rates, caved almost 1.4%. At 720.66, the sector gauge is still up an impressive 9.2% since Jan. 1.Investors who are sitting on large gains in the semiconductor sector need to keep a hawklike eye on sell signals or other indications that these leaders are ready to take a significant break.Lam Research (LRCX), KLA Tencor (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT) and ASML Holding (ASML) are all leaders in the Chips sector, which through Monday's close ranked second among 33 IBD broad sectors; Electronics took the top spot.Lam, a member of the IBD 50, dropped more than 2.9% to 144.62 in heavy volume. The supplier of systems for wafer etching and cleaning slid further below its rising 50-day moving average. The undercut of the key support line is Lam's first significant move below that line since late April of 2016.Given Lam's big run over the past year, it's sensible now to take at least partial gains.Lam initially broke out of a long first-stage saucer-with-handle base at 83.61 in June 2016. After a slow start, the large-cap tech began to accelerate its gains and show heavy turnover in July through October of the same year. At its recent peak of 167.05, Lam gained as much as 99%.KLA, meanwhile, is also issuing a sell signal as it fell even further below its 50-day line. Shares dropped more than 2% to 93.8 and are now 14% off the 52-week peak of 109.59.Applied Materials, the $45 billion large-cap leader in IBD's semiconductor equipment group, also took out its 50-day moving average with a nearly 3% loss to 41.89 in volume that grew 25% above normal levels. ASML, down 1% to 132.37, is also testing its 50-day line.In IBD's Electronics-Scientific/Measuring industry group, Coherent (COHR) slid nearly 5% to 225.68 in fast turnover and gouged its 50-day line for the first time since October 2016. In the fabless semiconductor industry group, Broadcom (AVGO) fell 3% to 235.33 and is testing support at the intermediate-term support line for the second time since April.Elsewhere in the chip sector, thinly traded Power Integrations (POWI) bucked the widespread decline, rising nearly 3% to 74.90 after winning a supply deal from Apple (AAPL). Volume shot more than five times Power's 50-day average of 163,000 shares.Fund sponsorship in Power Integration, a small cap at $2.2 billion, has risen over the long term. At the end of the first quarter, a total 370 mutual and hedge funds owned shares, up from 319 in the year-ago quarter.Apple sank more than 1% to 143.74 in quiet volume. A further drop below the 50- and 10-week moving averages would affirm a pair of sell signals triggered two weeks ago: a sharp drop through these key support lines, and a round-trip of gains after Apple rushed past a 141.12 three-weeks-tight follow-on entry point.RELATED:Fed Chief Yellen Bullish On Banks Ahead Of Stress Test No. 2How To Track The Market's Prime Direction: What Does The Big Picture Say?The Easy Method To Spot The Most Important Stock Market TopsHow Are The Top Stocks Performing?

393,LRCX,"Major indexes ended mixed on Monday, and the Nasdaq composite kept losses small. Apple (AAPL), down roughly 0.3% at 145.82 in dull trading, is hinting that it's now possibly forming a new shallow base.XThe Nasdaq tech leader recently topped at 156.65 on May 15, then posted two IBD sell signals when it slumped below its 50-day and 10-week moving averages in heavy volume two weeks ago. However, even after Monday's mild drop to 145.82, the mega-cap tech is hovering relatively near its 10-week moving average, an indication that the institutional crowd isn't bailing out of the consumer tech innovator in droves.The maximum decline from a high of156.65 to a near-term low of 142.20 is less than 10%. This means that further sideways price action could set up a new base such as the flat base pattern. A further decline, however, would likely mean that the stock is headed toward a longer consolidation of its hefty gains since Apple's Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.The Nasdaq composite, rising nearly 1.9% last week, gave back just 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average logged gains of less than 0.1%. Volume fell slightly on the Nasdaq and rose modestly on the NYSE, according to early data.The S&P SmallCap 600 led the major benchmarks by a trace, up less than 0.2%. It was up as much as 0.5% in the stock market today.Breadth was positive on both exchanges, with winners beating losers by more than 2-to-1 on the NYSE, and nearly 4-to-3 on the Nasdaq. As seen in the large daily charts PDF that is linked to IBD's Big Picture column, the NYSE advance-decline popped higher late last week and is close to reaching new high ground, a good sign for market bulls.Going back to Apple (81 Composite Rating, 86 RS Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup), there have been no significant changes to the iPhone maker's fundamental outlook. Earnings in the June-ended fiscal third quarter are seen rising 11% to $1.57 a share on a 6% bump in sales to $44.88 billion.That appears to signal a true turnaround is in place; in the year ago quarter, earnings slumped 23% on a year-over-year basis. But in Q2 (ended in March), Apple posted an 11% gain in profit to $2.10 a share, its best increase in six quarters.Elsewhere, numerous leading stocks, including those in the IBD 50, are facing critical tests of the 50-day moving average.Lam Research (LRCX), ranked No. 5 in the IBD 50, backed off an intraday high of 153.61 and fell 1.8% to 148.99  in slightly above-average turnover. The last time the expert in semiconductor etching equipment touched its 50-day moving average came in early December.Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) cratered 6.5% to 61.59 in stout volume and is poised to test its 50-day line for the second time in nearly three weeks. The laser component and module supplier for fiber-optic networks has made a huge gain since it broke out past a 27.38 buy point on Jan. 12 in monster trade.NetEase (NTES) reversed wildly, hitting a new high of 337.55 before dropping almost 4% to 320.70. Volume ended slightly above average. The stock is still up more than 6% past a 301.92 cup-with-handle buy point.Among new IPOs, Canada Goose (GOOS) dropped as much as 6.8% intraday on news of a secondary offering but trimmed losses by the close, down nearly 3% to 21.31. Still, the retail play staged its first gap down in price since debuting on the NYSE on March 16 at 12.75 a share. Shares still hold a 15% gain from an IPO-base breakout at 18.50.The high-end winter wear and outerwear firm shows choppy numbers, due in part to the seasonality of its merchandise. However, revenue has grown sharply in six of the seven past quarters (+65%, +74%, +123%, -34%, +17%, +81% and +22%).Canada Goose plans to sell 12.5 million subordinate voting shares that are owned by Bain Capital and members of senior management. CIBC, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and RBC Capital Markets will underwrite the offering. The company has 106 million diluted shares outstanding.Canada Goose also sports a strong 93 RS Rating and an A+ for Accumulation/Distribution by IBD Stock Checkup.IBD's TAKE: Read this article from Investor's Corner to weigh all the pros and cons of investing in IPOs.

394,LRCX,"Today we'll feature another two large-cap ETFs that set up a new buy opportunity Wednesday on a rebound off the 50-day moving average.First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX (FEX), which tracks the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Core Index, has attracted $1.6 billion. The 10-year-old fund's biggest sector weightings are consumer cyclical and financial services at about 17% each, technology 15%, health care 13% and industrials 11%.XTop holdings skew toward tech with three chip stocks making the top five as of July 12: Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX). All three have been big performers with year-to-date gains of 40% or higher. By comparison, the S&P 500 was up 9% and the Nasdaq composite 17% through Thursday's close.FEX has slightly outpaced the S&P 500 as of July 12, according to Morningstar Inc., with a 10.7% gain vs. a 10.3% advance for the benchmark index, including dividends reinvested. Its three-year average annual return of 8.1% trails the S&P 500's 9.8%, and the ETF's five-year and 10-year returns are in line with the S&P 500's.The fund first began rebounding off its 50-day average last week and is 2% above the support line, well within a potential buy zone. It has a 0.61% expense ratio.Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity (GSLC) closed 1% above its 50-day line on Thursday. The fund, which will mark its second anniversary in September, has gathered nearly $2.3 billion in assets.GSLC aims to invest in stocks that meet four performance metrics: good value, strong momentum, high quality and low volatility. It counts among its top holdings Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Technology accounted for its biggest sector weighting, at 21% of assets. Health care was next at 15%, followed by roughly 13% each in financial services and consumer cyclical, and 12% in consumer defensive.The ETF made a solid bounce off the 50-day line on Wednesday and is 1% above the support line. GSLC has returned 10.3% this year, in line with the S&P 500. It carries an expense ratio of 0.09%.Of Wednesday's picks, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) is still seeking support at its 50-day line, while Schwab U.S. Large-Cap (SCHX) remains in buy range from a rebound off its 50-day.RELATED:2 Big-Cap Plays Set Up Buy Opportunity As Market RalliesChance To Own These 4 Top Tech Stocks And Much, Much More?

395,LRCX,"Major stock indexes ended mixed and mostly unchanged Tuesday, a decent performance considering the S&P 500 was down 0.6% at one point after more details emerged about Donald Trump Jr.'s emails related to Russia and his father's election.General Electric (GE) and Boeing (BA) outperformed in the Dow, with gains of around 1%. Nasdaq 100 outperformers included data storage firms Western Digital (WDC) and Micron (MU) with gains of 3% to 4%.The Nasdaq composite picked up 0.3%, the Dow rose less than 0.1% and the S&P 500 eased 0.1%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Monday's levels.Oil and gas-related industry groups outperformed as oil prices rose. August West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled at $45.04 a barrel, up 1.4%, after the EIA lowered its U.S. output forecastIn the stock market today, Leaderboard name Trade Desk (TTD) continued to make a case for support at the 50-day moving average, rising 2%. Volume rose from Monday's level but remained below average.Square (SQ) popped 6% to 25.44 in heavy volume, clearing flat base with a 25.07 buy point. Competitor PayPal (PYPL) tried to clear a flat base Monday with a 55.24 buy point, but volume never came into the stock. It closed just above the entry Tuesday.The news hasn't been all that great in retail lately, but Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) continues to hold its own. Shares rose 3% to 42.30 as the stock works on a flat base with a 44.17 buy point.On the downside, former leader Ulta Beauty (ULTA) had a tough day, falling nearly 5%. It breached longer-term support at the 200-day moving average after giving up the 50-day line last month.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will be speaking on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and Thursday, updating politicians on current monetary policy and the outlook for inflation, among other things.Bond yields have moved sharply higher in recent weeks.

396,LRCX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average rose early Wednesday ahead of Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Investors will be looking for more hints about when the Fed will start whittling down its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, the Dow closed flat and the S&P 500 fell 0.1%. Three chip plays are now close to buy points: Apple (AAPL)-supplier Broadcom (AVGO) and chip-equipment makers Applied Materials (AMAT) and ASML Holding (ASML).XIt's important to see these chip stocks faring well. All three are highly rated, and if the market is going to find its footing and go much higher it will need top stocks to lead. Chip stocks overall were among the biggest losers in the recent tech selloff, so it's good to see them bounce back. That's especially true because chips are in the guts of just about tech product, from the Apple iPhone, data centers, auto electronics and just about everything else. If chips are doing well, that's a good sign for end products.Several other chip stocks are acting constructively, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Lam Research (LRCX). Nvidia never even fell below its 50-day line, but both Nvidia and Lam Research need to consolidate longer to form proper consolidations after their relatively large sell-offs in June.Futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.3% vs. fair value. The Dow industrials climbed 0.2%. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.5% vs. fair value.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei slid 0.5% and China's Shanghai composite 0.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.6%. In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE rose 0.9%, Germany's Dax 0.7% and France's CAC-40 0.9%.The Apple supplier was one of the better-performing chip stocks from the June 9 tech reversal. Shares fell sharply on June 9, but Broadcom held its ground for the next few weeks. Finally on June 29, the company fell below its 50-day moving average. It retook that level on July 7 and has found support at that line, though the recent rebound hasn't been on strong volume. Broadcom is now in a flat base like many other stocks, including Apple, ASML and Applied Materials.Shares dipped 0.4% to 240.89 in Tuesday stock market trading, about 6% below a 256.88 buy point.(Apple for its part rose 0.3% to 145.53 but is still below its 50-day moving average, which is now leveling off. Apple is about 7% off a potential 156.75 entry.)Broadcom has a Composite Rating of 96, which means that the stock outperforms 96% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. Big stock winners through history have often had a Composite Rating of 95+ near the start of their big price moves.ASML Holding is in a flat base going back to May 16, with a possible entry at 137.37. The Dutch maker of lithography systems tumbled below its 50-day line on June 9, where it largely stayed through July 6. But on July 7 shares just retook that support area. ASML continued to climb, including a 0.75% rise to 135.82 on Tuesday.ASML will report second-quarter results on Wednesday, July 19, before the market open.ASML has a Composite Rating of 96.Applied Materials, another big maker of chip equipment, rose 2.7% to 45.40 on Tuesday.

397,LRCX,"Tech stocks continued to lead the U.S. market higher Monday. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, showed potential of recouping some of the nearly 9% decline suffered over the prior two weeks and continuing its solid uptrend since its January breakout past an early-stage cup-with-handle base at 118.12.The stock rebounded 4.12, or 2.9%, to 146.39 in volume that edged 2% above normal levels. Apple is also up 26% since Jan. 1, more than double the 9.5% gain for the S&P 500. Both the 500 (up 0.8%) and the Dow Jones industrials (up 0.7%) hit all-time new highs in the stock market today.But at the market's close at 4 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite reaffirmed its market leadership, stretching its gain to 1.4% and holding practically at session highs, and extending its year-to-date gain to 15.9%.Small caps lagged, as the S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 0.5%.In the Dow 30 industrials, as many as nine members are up one point or more, including top-tier banks JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Reuters reported an estimate by a Morgan Stanley analyst that the main banks have as much as $150 billion in idle cash that could be funneled toward future dividend hikes and share buybacks.The Federal Reserve is set to release initial results on Thursday of a two-part annual stress test of major Wall Street banks. The stress test, created in the wake of the 2008-2009 subprime debt debacle, offers investors the central U.S. bank's view of how the nation's biggest lenders would handle a future economic or financial shock that could rattle the banking system.IBD analyzes the market action based on the movement of 197 industry groups and subgroups each day. Among the top 10 performers on Monday, six six hailed from the medical, computer and electronics sectors, including biotechs, generic drugs, integrated computer systems, computer networking and fabless semiconductors. You can check the individual stocks and ratings for all of these industry groups by going to MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock screening and charting service.Integrated oil, water utility, oil drilling and gas distribution companies led the market's downside, falling 0.9% or more. WTI crude oil futures slid 1.2% to $44.20 a barrel, while NYMEX natural gas futures collapsed more than 4% to $2.89 per 1 million BTUs, a new 3-month low. The Dow utility average slipped 0.4%. Long-term interest rates edged up, with the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury benchmark bond rising to 2.19%.Market breadth is positive, with winners beating losers by a nearly 9-5 ratio on the Nasdaq and an 18-11 ratio on the NYSE. Volume was down sharply on the main exchanges vs. the same time Friday. Stock and index options expired Friday, resulting in higher volume. This column last week noted that Apple posted a pair of sell signals for short-term investors: 1) dropping sharply below its 10-week moving average in accelerating volume; and 2) giving back all of its gains from a four-weeks-tight entry at 141.12. But the iPhone maker could also have been held by longtime holders who have a big enough profit cushion to give the stock a chance to rise back above the 10-week line or possibly test the longer-term 40-week moving average, roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart.Apple is now less than three points away from retaking the 10-week line.Another fellow tech component in the Dow 30, Microsoft (MSFT) is holding up firmly since it broke out of a base-on-base setup at 58.80 in the week ended Oct. 21, 2016. The Xbox and business software firm, up 1% to 70.87, has gained nearly 24% since that October breakout. The S&P 500 has risen 14% over the same time frame. Both Apple and Microsoft pay dividends, and the annualized yields are 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The S&P 500 has a 1.91% yield. Microsoft's long-term cash payout growth is 15% each year, according to calculations by William O'Neil + Co.An ongoing rebound in fundamentals for both Apple and Microsoft, plus the outperformance of the tech sector in 2017 so far, are two reasons why the two megacap names have good prospects for beating the S&P 500's return this year.Among the top five sectors in IBD's daily ranking of 33 broad sectors, three of the top five are from tech land: Electronics (No. 1), Chips (No. 2), and Computer (No. 4). The other two in the top five are Leisure (No. 3) and Building (No. 5).IBD's TAKE: Apple, due to the majority of its revenue now coming from the iPhone, is part of the Telecom sector, which is now ranked No. 14 out of 33 broad industry sectors. A strong sector performance often helps a growth stock achieve above-average returns. See the entire list of sectors, ranked daily, via the Stock Lists section at Investors.com.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Microsoft ranks No. 3 within the desktop software industry group in terms of its 82 Composite Rating.

408,LRCX,"Investment bank Morgan Stanley on Thursday selected nine ""high conviction"" stocks that have near-term catalysts that could move their shares higher.Of the nine, four are technology stocks: Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Amazon.com (AMZN), IBM (IBM) and Lam Research (LRCX). And a fifth, Align Technology (ALGN), is a medical-products (teeth alignment) company.Two of the companies are currently featured on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks: Activision and Align. And one, Amazon, is on IBD's Leaderboard list.The others are wireless tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), commercial bank SVB Financial Group (SIVB), and energy services firms Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Parsley Energy (PE).IBD'S TAKE: Investors.com offers a host of proprietary stock lists to give investors actionable ideas about companies worth considering. The IBD 50 is IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals. Leaderboard provides a select group of stock picks showing the most potential for big gains.""Our analysts believe that one or more imminent events will drive the share price (of the nine stocks) materially over the next 15-60 days,"" a group of Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research report.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak expects video game publisher Activision to beat Wall Street's estimates when it reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 3. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company is benefiting from a shift to higher-margin game downloads, vs. packaged media sales, and online and mobile-game traction, he said.Potential catalysts include a faster-than-anticipated shift to full-game downloads and indications that Activision is monetizing its King Digital user base through advertising.""Currently 15% to 20% of games are downloaded digitally, and we expect this to increase to 40%-plus in the next five years,"" Nowak said.Align Technology, which makes teeth-straightening systems, is set to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 7.Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Beuchaw is looking for San Jose, Calif.-based Align to report strong results. Catalysts for the stock include inflections in discretionary spending, the rollout of Align's G6 feature set, and collaboration with more digital scanner partners.E-commerce leader Amazon is likely to report its Q3 results in late October. Nowak is expecting Amazon to beat Wall Street's consensus expectations.""Our estimates are driven by higher gross profit per customer, which more than offsets our expectations for higher forward streaming-content (spending) and increased fulfillment deleverage from Amazon's large expected warehouse build this year,"" Nowak said. ""We also see potential for further upside due to ongoing strength in Amazon's AWS cloud-computing business.""Amazon is moving into a phase of improving profitability in its core e-commerce business, even as it takes market share, he said.Potential catalysts include Amazon's Q3 results, acceleration of e-commerce penetration in core markets, Prime membership growth, and enterprise cloud adoption hitting an inflection point, Nowak said.Tech services giant IBM could see a lift as it makes progress transitioning from mainframe and other legacy businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said. IBM is becoming more exposed to its emerging businesses in Watson, cloud, analytics, mobile and security, which have double-digit growth profiles, she said.IBM's potential catalysts include an accelerated transformation and recent acquisitions helping to achieve a faster path to revenue growth and improving profit margins, she said.Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research is set to report its September quarter results on Oct. 19 and will hold an analyst meeting on Nov. 16.""We would expect both events to be positive for the stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore said. Investors are likely to take a fresh look at Lam in the wake of its failed merger with inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor (KLAC).

Check out the largest company in the sector, Applied Materials, on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 52-weeks.""We anticipate order declines and limited demand growth for semiconductor equipment names as 3D Nand equipment demand is likely to peak in 2017, while logic/foundry demand remains mixed and DRAM demand remains low,"" Pacific Crest analyst Weston Twigg said in a research report late Tuesday. ""Sector valuations are reasonable, so we do not see meaningful near-term downside risk, but further stock appreciation may be limited.""He reiterated his overweight ratings on Applied Materials (AMAT), MKS and Entegris (ENTG) for longer-term opportunities.""We remain Overweight on AMAT due to good long-term positioning, MKSI due to strong earnings leverage and non-semiconductor growth opportunities, and ENTG due to its unique position to benefit from slowing node transitions,"" Twigg said. ""We are downgrading LRCX and NANO to Sector Weight, both of which are near our price targets and may stall if 3D Nand spending peaks in 2017.""Lam Research stock rallied after its planned merger with KLA-Tencor (KLAC) fell apart on Oct. 5 because of antitrust objections.Twigg says chip-gear orders peaked for the current capital-equipment investment cycle in June.

417,LRCX,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) likely ""cranked up its resistance"" to Lam Research's (LRCX) pending $11 billion KLA-Tencor (KLAC) acquisition, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said Monday.Lam stock, though, continues to trade at record highs, touching an all-time best Monday.Rivals Applied Materials (AMAT) and Tokyo Electron have weaker voices with the U.S. Department of Justice given that they are the competition, Arcuri said. Clients like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) are less likely to oppose the acquisition.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials stock rocketed earlier this month on fiscal Q3 sales and fiscal Q4 guidance that easily topped Wall Street's expectations.Samsung has pushed Lam and KLA to collaborate on 3D flash-memory yield challenges, and TSM seems fairly ambivalent, Arcuri wrote in a research report.""Thus, we are left with Intel, (a customer) whose management generally doesn't like when suppliers merge,"" he wrote. Intel ""may have cranked up its resistance and gained traction on the matter with regulators.""Lam's attempt to buy KLA has been stalled since May, when U.S. regulators sent a request for more information about the merger. Analysts have suggested the DOJ is concerned with antitrust matters. KLA's products rate tools created by Lam and its rivals.""A merger theoretically could help Samsung more than Intel given Samsung's 3D Nand (flash memory) leadership,"" he wrote in his research note. ""Also, Lam is ramping -- albeit very strongly -- with Intel, but has historically tended to have a very strong relationship with Samsung.""But the DOJ hasn't blocked a ""conglomerate"" transaction in more than 40 years. Doing so in this case would arguably set a precedent, Arcuri wrote. The idea of regulators blocking the deal on regulatory grounds is a 50/50 proposition at best, he said.Arcuri upgraded KLA stock to an outperform rating, with an 80 price target. He kept his 95 price target on Lam stock, but added that ""Lam is, without a question, a better stock with KLA.""Since the merger was announced on Oct. 21 of last year, Lam stock has lifted 33% and KLA stock 6%. KLA was near a sell zone Monday, down 6% from a 73.69 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 20.Lam stock, on the other hand, is now far extended from an 83.93 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 20.

418,LRCX,"No. 2 chip-gear-maker Applied Materials (AMAT) reported record earnings late Thursday and fiscal Q3 sales near Wall Street's expectations, as the company's guidance handily beat views, prompting shares to rocket in after-hours trading.Applied Materials stock was up 4.5% in after-hours trading, after the chip-gear maker released its earnings report and after closing up 1.4%, at 27.68, during the regular session in the stock market today, closing just below a 14-year high touched Monday. Shares are up 48% this year, amid IBD's 34-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group's 15.5% rise.For its fiscal Q3 ended July 31, Applied Materials reported $2.82 billion in sales and 50 cents earnings per share minus items, up 13% and 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped analysts' model for 48 cents. Sales neared the $2.84 billion forecast.Three months ago, Applied Materials' implied guidance was for $2.79 billion to $2.89 billion in sales and 46-50 cents EPS ex items.New orders jumped 26% to $3.66 billion. Its backlog of $4.95 billion rose 60% vs. the year-earlier period.Current-quarter guidance for sales to rise 15%-19% sequentially implies $3.24 billion to $3.36 billion, which would be up 39% vs. last year at the midpoint. Applied Materials' guidance crushed the consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.8 billion.Applied Materials also models 61-69 cents EPS ex items, up 124% and topping analysts' views for 48 cents.Applied Materials trails only ASML (ASML) in terms of market cap in IBD's 34-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment industry group.At one time, Lam Research's (LRCX) pending merger with KLA-Tencor (KLAC) appeared poised to overtake Applied Materials. Now, Applied Materials' $29.7 million value would still swallow a combined Lam-KLA by more than $4 million. ASML leads the group with a whopping $44.9 billion value.IBD'S TAKE: Lam's attempt to buy KLA is currently stalled on regulatory concerns with analysts saying earlier this month that Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron could put up an antitrust fight, pummeling the $10.6 billion merger.

419,LRCX,"Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron will likely mount a regulatory attack on Lam Research's (LRCX) $10.6 billion bid to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), but that's only if U.S. regulators don't kill the deal that would unite two of the largest makers of chip-manufacturing equipment, analysts said Thursday.KLA stock fell 2.8% to 67.51 in the the stock market today after toppling 10% on Wednesday when Lam said that regulatory hurdles in South Korea, China and/or Japan might extend the merger's close beyond the Oct. 20 deadline.Lam stock fell 4.5% Wednesday, and closed down 0.25% to 88.89. Shares are 6% extended from an 83.93 entry point achieved June 2. KLA stock, on the other hand, is down more than 8%, in a sell zone, from a 73.69 buy point hit June 20.The Lam-KLA merger has been riddled with antitrust concerns since its announcement last October. This is the third time the deal has been delayed, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research report Thursday.Shah downgraded Lam stock to neutral from buy and cut his price target to 85 from 95.IBD'S TAKE: Lam stock has a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it performs in the top 10% of all stocks. KLA stock trails with a CR of 84.In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA, likely over antitrust issues.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $25 billion market cap, trailing leaders ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) with $46.9 billion and $29 billion, respectively. The duo would have 21% market share and be No. 1 or No. 2 in three out of four major manufacturing process steps.""This announcement reinforces a growing trend of skepticism from the DOJ that merger remedies will be sufficient to prevent higher prices,"" Shah wrote. ""Recent examples include Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), Sysco Foods (SYY)-US Foods (USFD) and Albertsons-Safeway.""Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire noted KLA could ask Lam for more money or terminate the deal. Unlike Applied Materials abandoning its bid on Tokyo Electron in the face of antitrust concerns, Lam can't easily walk away from KLA.And foreign regulators are just as apt as U.S. regulators to question the antitrust angle, Maire wrote in a research note.""We are sure that Samsung is pushing Korean regulators for two pounds of flesh,"" he wrote. ""And Japanese regulators are probably well aware of the 'fox guarding the hen house' problem from both Tokyo Electron and Hitachi.""

420,LRCX,"Japan's Renesas Electronics could encroach on No. 1 automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) with a $3 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Intersil (ISIL), the Nikkei Asian Review reported early Monday.Intersil stock rocketed 19.8% to 18.74, hitting an eight-year high in the stock market today. NXP stock dipped 0.3%. At Friday's close, Intersil stock already was 7% extended from a 14.65 entry point out of consolidation achieved July 26.Renesas is expected to spend 300 billion yen ($3 billion) to acquire Intersil in an all-cash bid that values the U.S. chipmaker at a 42% premium to Friday's closing stock price. Intersil makes power chips for automobiles, industrial machinery and smartphones.But Renesas could face regulatory hurdles. Semiconductor consolidation went rampant in 2015 on the shrinking industry, but chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) have struggled to merge, due to antitrust concerns. Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS), meanwhile, turned down a Chinese bid earlier this year.Overall, the global semiconductor industry is expected to fall 2.3% to $324 billion in sales this year, industry tracker IDC said in May. One reason is that smartphone sales are slowing, slugging Apple (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics alike.IBD'S TAKE: Sales to Apple are key for chipmakers like Intel, which is sidling up to the Cupertino, Calif., smartphone giant via a partnership with ARM Holdings, announced last week during the Intel Developer Forum.As smartphones decline, chipmakers are making deeper grabs for the automotive market. Last year, NXP acquired Freescale Semiconductor, becoming the top automotive chipmaker. Some 40% of its total sales stem from that unit.But NXP is facing competition from rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC), which are shoring up their offerings to pull business from tech giants like Tesla Motors (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Autonomous driving, while still nascent, will continue to drive the industry.Intersil, too, is making automotive strides. On the company's Q2 conference call July 28, CEO Necip Sayiner told analysts that automotive sales brought in 13% of total revenue. For 2016, he models north of 20% year-over-year growth in that segment.At 13% of total revenue, Intersil pulled in north of $17 million in automotive sales for Q2. Renesas reported 73.6 billion yen ($733 million) in fiscal Q1 automotive sales. Together, that $750 million between Renesas and Intersil still trails the $858 million NXP reported for its Q2 automotive segment.""We are expecting yet another record quarter in Q3 in our automotive business,"" Intersil's Sayiner said on the call. ""I think it's a little too early to call out Q4, but we don't see anything on the horizon that will shake the strength in that business.""An Intersil spokesperson declined to comment on ""rumors and speculation,"" and a Renesas spokesperson also said the company does not comment on speculation.RELATED:

421,LRCX,"Applied Materials' (AMAT) OLED opportunity is nearly three times that of traditional LCD, CEO Gary Dickerson said Thursday as the No. 2 chip-gear-maker prepares to milk Silicon Valley's push for autonomous cars and virtual reality.Meanwhile, the smartphone and TV opportunities are burgeoning, he said. Apple (AAPL) and Samsung are reportedly considering swapping their liquid crystal display (LCD) smartphone screens for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.OLED screens are lighter, thinner and more flexible. Applied Materials unveiled two systems last year for high-volume production of OLED displays. Chipmakers like Intel (INTC)and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) use Applied Materials' equipment.""We're still in the early innings (in) this smartphone transition to OLED,"" Dickerson told analysts on the company's earnings conference call. ""The display is a key differentiator for mobile devices.""Early Friday, Applied Materials stock bolted to a nearly 16-year high on Wall Street, at 29.74, following its late-Thursday fiscal Q3 earnings release. Shares closed up 7% at 29.64 on the stock market today. Applied Materials stock is up nearly 50% this year.For its fiscal Q3 ended July 31, Applied Materials reported $3.66 billion in new orders, up 26% and topping Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad's outlook for $2.78 billion. The chip business, Applied Materials' bread and butter, accounted for 61% of revenue but grew only 10%.The chip business, though, will benefit from Silicon Valley's push toward autonomous cars, virtual reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Applied Materials CFO Bob Halliday said on the call. Tech giants like Tesla Motors (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel are digging their heels in on those spaces.IBD'S TAKE: No. 1 chipmaker Intel is making a swift move into the virtual reality space with a ""merged reality"" headset that could rival Facebook's Oculus Rift, Google's Daydream and the HTC Vive by removing the cords and controllers.By far, display orders outperformed every segment. Display orders, which include OLED, jumped 153% vs. the year-earlier period to $803 million, though they only accounted for 22% of the total. Display sales rose 69%, to $313 million.On a sequential basis, Applied Materials guided to 19%-23% growth for its fiscal Q4 chip business, 3%-6% services growth and a whopping 30%-40% growth in displays. The company said total sales are expected to rise 15%-19%, implying $3.24 billion-$3.36 billion.At least six analysts boosted their price targets Friday on Applied Materials stock, and three of those analysts see Applied Materials gaining share vs. key rivals like ASML (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). Lam and KLA are in the process of merging.Pacific Crest analyst Weston Twigg expects Applied Materials to grow 18% in calendar year 2016 vs. a mere 5% growth for the broader semiconductor fab equipment industry. Twigg has an overweight rating on Applied Materials stock and has upped his price target to 33 from 28.""Applied continues to benefit from new TAM (total addressable market) growth and share gains related to process complexity in NAND (flash memory), foundry/logic and display,"" he wrote in a research report.RELATED:

422,LRCX,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp and ""less bad"" PC sales will lead to an in-line second quarter for chipmakers, but Brexit-fostered macro worries could play out in October-quarter earnings, Credit Suisse and MKM analysts said Friday.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer's top picks include Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Lam Research (LRCX), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).""Importantly, (the second half of 2016) should be up 2.5% year over year after four quarters of year-over-year declines,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report. But overall he expects 2016 chip sales will be flat vs. earlier expectations for 3.8% growth.IBD's TAKE: IBD's 33-company Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is currently No. 48 out of 197 groups tracked, having made big moves over the last eight weeks from No. 169. It's led by ASML in market value, but KLA-Tencor tops the group in terms of Composite Rating. KLA has a CR of 92, meaning it outperforms 92% of all stocks in key metrics.Apple iPhone suppliers -- including Broadcom and Analog Devices -- could benefit from a ""lackluster iPhone 7 cycle"" still likely to grow 55%-60% from 80 million units shipped in the first half of the year.""Overall, handsets (are) better,"" he wrote. ""Slowing Samsung Galaxy S7 and weak high-end China (are) offset by mid- to low-end iPhone 7 builds.""More PC-oriented Intel and Microchip could benefit from marginal improvements in shipments, Pitzer wrote. During Q2, units declined 4.5% vs. last year, but topped the four-quarter average of a 12% decline. Still, expectations for PC builds to fall 8% this year would be conservative.Industrial trends improved modestly over the last 90 days, but appear seasonally weaker in the second half of 2016 -- likely impacting Lam. Lam, which is trying to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), competes against ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) in the chip gear-making sector.Mellanox, on the other hand, could benefit in the second-half on infrastructure improvements by Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Mellanox's products are used to connect servers, provide storage and tie hyper-converged infrastructure -- a necessity for major cloud operations.The real risk is in Q3, when the effect of the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union are likely to play out, Pitzer says. Global stock markets toppled on the Brexit vote and Q3 expectations that are already above seasonal quarter-over-quarter growth leave plenty of room for disappointment.MKM analyst Ian Ing sees the Brexit effect slugging Xilinx (XLNX), Texas Instruments (TXN), Intersil (ISIL), ON  Semiconductor (ON) and Analog Devices -- which have high distribution-channel sales ""which are a proxy for European and industrial market exposure.""Xilinx and Texas Instruments derive about 60% of their sales through the channel, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Intersil, ON and Analog Devices take in more than half of their revenue from distribution.""Industrial markets which are served by distributors are expected to have seasonally weaker second half of demand compounded by perceived Brexit risk and uncertainty,"" Ing wrote in a report. ""Q3 and Q4 are expected to be down seasonally and likely further exacerbated by customers' Brexit uncertainties.""The most obvious effect is in currency adjustments. Following the vote, the British pound fell 9.3% vs. the U.S. dollar to its lowest point in decades. The euro fell 1.6%. That could result in some inventory destocking followed by customers scrutinizing order run rates, Ing predicts.Competitively, U.S. semiconductors have a small advantage post-Brexit.""U.K. semiconductor markets were already soft before the Brexit event,"" Ing wrote. ""Longer term, we think Brexit has some offsetting impacts on U.K. semiconductor design and activity.""

423,LRCX,"The stock market held strong gains with about one hour remaining in Friday's session, cheered by a healthy June employment chart. Growth stocks outpeformed, with IBD 50 names  MaxLinear (MXL), Dave & Buster's (PLAY) and Universal Display (OLED) leading the charge. Nearly half of the IBD 50 rose 2% or more.Lam Research (LRCX) was a top gainer in the Nasdaq. Shares rose nearly 4%. After some volatility last month, it reclaimed an 83.93 buy point.The Nasdaq jumped 1.6%, the S&P 500 added 1.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.4%. Small caps did well, with the Russell 2000 up 2.4%. The S&P 500 flirted with an all-time high, while the Nasdaq approached the 5000 level.Nasdaq volume was tracking higher than Thursday's level in the stock market today, while NYSE volume was on pace to be close to Thursday.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark crude oil for August delivery added 0.6% to $45.41 a barrel.

425,LRCX,"Feverish chip-sector M&A spiked late Wednesday as ASML (ASML) announced its plan to acquire Taiwan's Hermes Microvision for $3.1 billion, and Cavium (CAVM) unveiled a $1.3 billion bid on networking firm QLogic (QLGC) -- upsetting investors on nearly all sides.Cavium stock toppled 17.5% to a 20-month low on the stock market today. ASML stock closed up 1.5%, and shares of ASML rivals Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) -- which are struggling to complete their merger -- gained 0.3% and fell 0.2%, respectively.QLogic stock surged 9.3% on its acquisition, set to close in Q3.ASML's massive bid on Hermes Microvision is a technology play, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote Thursday in a research report. ASML is angling to combine process control with wafer processing steps at leading-edge process nodes, he says.Not long ago, KLA-Tencor dropped its EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) mask inspection program, which ASML needed to make its EUV tool viable, Robert Maire of Semiconductors Advisers wrote in a research note. Lam benefits from multi-patterning at EUV's expense, so ASML had no choice but to go on an M&A hunt.ASML could have outbid Lam for KLA, but instead it did ""the next best thing and bought the competitor that had beat KLA in the market,"" he wrote. Now, ASML is unlikely to work with Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA, and it will instead ""try to choke off"" competitive products from Applied Materials and KLA.Like the Lam-KLA merger, ASML's acquisition of Hermes Microvision could face U.S. Department of Justice antitrust concerns, Maire said. Mok, on the other hand, says ASML's bid could benefit Lam's deal.""It counters anti-competitive concerns as KLA's competitors come together,"" he wrote. ""Also, it highlights the increased need to combine process control with other types of equipment at the leading edge, supporting Lam's rationale in acquiring KLA.""The ASML deal could spark further consolidation in the chip-gear market, Mok said. He sees Nova Measuring Instruments (NVMI) and Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) as potential takeover candidates.

426,LRCX,"Ride-hailing app Lyft tapped the Silicon Valley matchmaker that wheeled Microsoft's (MSFT) $26.2 billion LinkedIn (LNKD) acquisition to help it raise funds or find a buyer, anonymous sources told the Wall Street Journal.Qatalyst Partners founder and Executive Chairman Frank Quattrone, a well known Silicon Valley deal maker,  has contacted companies, including carmakers, about acquiring a large stake in Lyft, the sources said. That stake could be a total takeover.Qatalyst has nearly $190.5 billion in deals listed on its website since 2008, including $41.6 billion in pending deals. Notably, it helped broker the $10.6 billion acquisition of KLA-Tencor (KLAC) by Lam Research (LRCX) and Microsemi's (MSCC) $2.5 billion PMC-Sierra buy against rival bidder Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Lyft, which declined comment to IBD, is Uber Technologies' largest U.S. rival but pales in size, according to Fortune's list of unicorns. Lyft was last valued at $5.5 billion vs. Uber's $62 billion valuation (likely near $68 billion now) and Didi Chuxing's $16 billion value.Apple (AAPL)-backed Didi is giving Uber a greater run for its money in China, where Didi's ride-hailing app dominates in more than 400 cities to Uber's 60 cities. Didi's recent fundraising added $7 billion and includes infusions from Apple, Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY).Lyft's Qatalyst hire could mean it's seeking a sale or doubling down on its fundraising efforts against Uber. Recently, No. 1 carmaker General Motors (GM) invested $500 million for a 10% stake in Lyft -- a sixth of Lyft's total estimated value.Toyota Motor (TM) bet an undisclosed amount on Uber, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) is said to be in talks with Uber to make autonomous vehicles. Fiat is also developing a self-driving minivan with Google (GOOGL) and has said it would partner with Apple.Tesla Motors (TSLA), too, is grinding away on the self-driving car route and chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are champing at the bit with autonomous driving platforms.Other investments in this field include a $300 million investment by Volkswagen (VLKAY) in Israeli ride-hailing app Gett, and Google's expansion of its Waze app to test out a carpooling service in San Francisco.

427,LRCX,"Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) could be forced to trim competitive segments to push through the $10.6 billion merger that threatens to swallow rival Applied Materials (AMAT), Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire said Monday.And unlike Applied Materials' failed attempt to acquire Tokyo Electron, Lam only sees $250 million in initial savings and therefore has less wiggle room to negotiate potential antitrust remedies, Maire wrote in a research report.""Both Lam and KLA are already superbly run companies without a lot of cleaning up to be done,"" he wrote. ""This suggests that there is not a lot to be gained in efficiency by the combo as they are already quite profitable as separate entities.""The synergies, however, have likely prompted antitrust concerns. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request,"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA. Now, the duo could be forced to sign a ""plea bargain,"" Maire said.KLA products measure competitors' dep and etch tools, leading to a ""fox guarding the hen house"" paradigm where a Lam-owned subsidiary would be charged with rating rivals' tools. Under the DOJ consent decree, KLA could be forced to divest those businesses or license its technology.""The range (of potential remedies) is quite broad, from almost zero cost to deal-killing cost and everything in between,"" Maire said.Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron eventually called off their merger in the face of stringent regulatory concerns.After the DOJ rules, the Lam-KLA deal still faces potential fights from regulators in Japan, China, Korea and the Netherlands, where a number of rivals operate. And major chip manufacturers Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) also will likely have objections, Maire says.""We would imagine that they are concerned about their suppliers gaining too much leverage against them and holding too much consolidated power,"" he wrote. ""Both are probably happier with the status quo.""On the stock market today, Lam and KLA stocks each rose a fraction, trailing a 1% rise in Applied Materials stock. No. 1 chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) stock also rose a fraction Monday.
"
428,LRCX,"No. 2 chip-gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) toasted Wall Street's current-quarter guidance expectations late Thursday and reported in-line Q2 metrics, prompting shares to rise in after-hours trading.Late Thursday, Applied Materials stock was up more than 4% in after-hours trading Thursday, after the company posted its Q2 earnings results. Shares closed down a penny in the regular session in the stock market today, at 19.91. Top rival ASML (ASML) stock fell 1.3% Thursday.Soon-to-merger KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) stocks split the difference, down and up less than 1% each in the regular session. IBD's 34-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group fell nearly 1%.For the quarter ended May 1, Applied Materials reported $2.45 billion in sales and 34 cents earnings per share ex items, flat and up 17%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales edged analyst views for $2.43 billion and EPS beat the consensus for 32 cents.Three months ago, Applied Materials guided to a 5%-10% sequential increase in sales, implying $2.37 billion to $2.48 billion, and 30-34 cents.Applied Materials guided to a 14%-18% quarter-over-quarter jump in current-quarter sales, implying $2.79 billion to $2.89 billion and topping the consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.51 billion. Sales would be up 14% vs. the year-ago quarter.EPS minus items guidance for 46-50 cents was a dime above Wall Street at the low point, and would be up 45.5%.

429,LRCX,"Applied Materials (AMAT) could surf the ""rising tide"" of 3D Nand, but rival Lam Research (LRCX) will likely outgrow the No. 2 chip-gear-maker, a Needham analyst said Wednesday ahead of Applied Materials' Q2 earnings report, due after the close Thursday.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Applied Materials stock was up 2%, near 20, leading soon-to-merge rivals Lam and KLA-Tencor (KLAC), whose shares were up 1.8% and 1%, respectively. The three trail ASML (ASML) in terms of market value. ASML stock was up 1% Wednesday afternoon.For its fiscal Q2 ended in late April, Applied Materials is expected to report $2.43 billion in sales and 32 cents earnings per share minus items, flat and up 10%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. That would come off 4% declines for both metrics in Q1.Three months ago, Applied Materials guided to a 5%-10% sequential jump in sales ($2.37 billion to $2.48 billion) and 30-34 cents EPS ex items.Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok reiterated his buy rating and 22 price target on Applied Materials stock. Mok and Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad both expect Applied Materials to report an in-line Q2.But Mok sees potential upside to Applied Materials' Q3 guidance on strength in 3D Nand flash memory demand. Lam recently guided to 9% quarter-over-quarter shipment growth for Q2. Mok expects Applied Materials to ""grow similarly, although likely at a slower pace than Lam.""He sees Applied Materials guiding to 2%-7% sequential growth for Q3 vs. consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which models 3% quarter-over-quarter sales growth.Ahmad, on the other hand, expects in-line Q3 guidance. For the second half of the year, display revenue could be guided up 10%-20% vs. last year's flat quarter, but DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) guidance could disappoint.""DRAM second-half revenues could be ticked down to flat (vs. the prior period),"" he wrote in a research report. ""Expectations are relatively high. Most investors expect a beat than a miss,"" but DRAM has been macroeconomically slogged for several years on slowing PC sales.He kept his outperform rating and 23 price target.

430,LRCX,"Stout competition to take a chunk of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy business drove Applied Materials' (AMAT) Q2 display orders to grow nearly sixfold, and Applied Materials CFO Robert Halliday doesn't see that slowing this year.On a year-over-year basis, display orders soared a whopping 483% to $700 million, accounting for 20% of Applied Materials' record-busting $3.45 billion in Q2 orders. For the year, mobile will push more than 70% of those display orders, Halliday predicts.""The great majority of that is focused on the OLED market this year in terms of the order rate,"" he said late Thursday on Applied Material's fiscal Q2 earnings conference call with analysts. ""It's not a one-quarter event, and we see the concentration in mobile.""In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Applied Materials stock rocketed more than 13%, near 22.50, touching a 14-month high. Chip-gear rivals Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) stocks jumped 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively. ASML (ASML), the No. 1 maker of chip manufacturing gear by market cap, was up 2%.Applied Materials' equipment enables chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Intel (INTC) to produce chips. Last year, Applied Materials unveiled two systems that enable high-volume production of OLED displays.OLEDs, organic light-emitting diodes, are used to create thin, flexible displays and lighting panels for TVs and mobile. Apple is reportedly switching to OLED iPhone displays and might have tapped Samsung to make them, according to AppleInsider.com.The OLED opportunity is huge, Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson said on the call.""New display technology, such as OLED, are enabled by materials innovation,"" he said. ""This is creating significant new market opportunities for Applied.""At least four investment banks boosted their price targets Friday on Applied Materials stock, with Needham and Credit Suisse analysts noting Applied Materials' huge opportunity in China, where the company has a 30-year-plus relationship.During Q2 ended May 1, Applied Materials reported $1.97 billion in silicon orders, up 15% year over year. Nand (flash memory) accounted for 49% of those orders, as companies like Micron (MU) and Intel ramp their 3D Nand technology.""The almost $1 billion in Nand bookings confirmed Applied Materials' strong positions around 3D Nand with multiple products,"" Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote in a research report, as he boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 26 from 22. Mok rates the stock a buy.Chinese orders hit $903 million, accounting for 26% of the total, as memory customers transition to solid-state drives (SSD) from hard-disk drives (HDD), Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad said Friday.Dickerson noted Thursday that the company has doubled its sales in China over the last two years. Chinese customers are talking about spending $20 billion to $30 billion over the next four to five years, Halliday added.Ahmad boosted his price target on Applied Materials stock to 25 from 23 and kept his outperform rating.

431,LRCX,"Chinese, Japanese and South Korean regulators could gum up Lam Research's (LRCX) attempt to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) by following in the footsteps of the U.S. Department of Justice, which is asking for more information on the proposed merger, an analyst said Monday.Late Friday, the companies said the DOJ had sent a ""second request,"" digging deeper into Lam Research's $10.6 billion plan to acquire KLA-Tencor. Only 2%-4% of merger proposals get a second request, Semiconductor Advisors president Robert Maire says. Of those, he says about a third go through as planned but the other two-thirds either get challenged by the DOJ or get a consent decree, which is approval with conditions.In the Lam-KLA deal, the likely concerns revolve around antitrust. Together, the companies would be close to matching the market cap of Applied Materials (AMAT), which is No. 2 among makers of chip manufacturing equipment, behind ASML (ASML).Also, together they could pressure etch pricing for major players like Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the latter an Apple (AAPL) supplier. Tokyo Electron and Hitachi (HTHIY), which compete against Lam in etch, might oppose having KLA continuing to inspect their tools and processes.""While not good news, a second request is certainly not a death sentence for the merger, but at the very least (it) means more time and money and scrutiny to get approval,"" Maire wrote in a research note. The 30-day clock for DOJ approval has now been reset.In midday trading on the stock market today, Lam Research and KLA-Tencor stocks were down nearly 2% and 1.4%, respectively, both near three-month lows. IBD's 34-company Electronic Semiconductor-Equipment industry group was down a small fraction midday Monday.Maire says the DOJ could ""ask for the kitchen sink of information.""""The (second request) is not just a simple test of overlapping product lines,"" he wrote. ""It looks at things like market concentration and anti-competitive issues. (Lam-KLA) would certainly have a large concentration of the overall market.""The chip industry is most concerned about KLA's standing as an ""impartial arbiter"" of others' tools, he says.""Will Lam dep and etch tools get an unfair advantage? An early look at results? A more complete look?"" Maire asked. ""(It's) kind of a lot like insider trading.""Lam and KLA already have the go-ahead from Germany, Ireland, Israel and Taiwan, but they still needs a slew of other foreign approvals. This DOJ action can ""snowball into a problem"" if it becomes too costly, Maire says. Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron called off their merger in the face of strong regulator scrutiny.The request further delays the merger's close, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok noted in a research report, saying he expects the deal to close in Q4, as opposed to the companies' target for Q3. Western Digital (WDC) closed its $19 billion SanDisk acquisition last week, a merger that was announced within hours of the Lam-KLA match-up.Neither Mok nor Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri worry about the Lam-KLA deal getting approval, however. In his report, Arcuri called the second request ""more procedural in nature.""""There is no overlap here, and certain big customers have been pushing these companies together for several years, especially around the issue of yield ramp in 3D,"" he wrote. ""We continue to see the deal closing in (the) August time frame.""Arcuri cut his price target on Lam stock to 85 from 93. Lam and rival ASML recently indicated minor timing delays for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory)-related shipments, he wrote. Lam has guided shipments up for the second half of the year, but Arcuri isn't that confident.""Weakness for Lam seems focused on the memory side, with some signs of a less aggressive 3D Nand (flash) shipment cadence to Toshiba, seemingly due more to capital constraints at this customer rather than any fundamental change in the 3D Nand ramp itself,"" he wrote.But Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron (MU) and Intel Dalian haven't experienced any mirrored slowdown, he wrote.

But they had to overcome a lead that the value-oriented funds initially held for several years.Large-cap growth funds did not take the lead decisively until the third quarter of 2013.Before that, when large-cap value funds outperformed, many of them got a tailwind from investors seeking the relative safe haven of funds holding stocks that paid dividends. Many funds like that are value-oriented.Overall, during the past 10 years large-cap growth funds averaged an annual return of 6.80%, according to Morningstar Inc.Large-cap value funds averaged a 5.39% yearly gain.If you had invested $10,000 on March 31, 2006, in a cross section of large-cap growth funds, after a decade your money would have ballooned into $19,504.The same amount invested in a cross-section of large-cap value funds would have grown to $17,259.That difference would have added a higher octane to your retirement plan's gas tank.In that decade, the now-$1.4 billion Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) was the best-performing large-cap growth fund with $100 million or more in assets.It racked up an 11.17% average annual gain vs. just 7.17% for the S&P 500.What is it that revs Parnassus Endeavor's engine?

Small caps also did well, with the Russell 2000 up 1.7%. The S&P 500 added 0.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.6%.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Tuesday's levels. Money flowed into bonds, as the 10-year Treasury yield tumbled 7 basis points to 1.82%.In a speech to the Economic Club of New York, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that it is appropriate for U.S. central bankers to “proceed cautiously” in raising interest rates.Big gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included chip-equipment firm Lam Research (LRCX). It surged past an 80.53 cup-with-handle buy point, rising 3% to 81.77. The stock is well within buy range.In economic news, consumer confidence came in better than expected, according to the latest data from the Conference Board. The index rose to 96.2 from a prior reading of 92.2. Economists expected a smaller increase to 94.

438,LRCX,"Applied Materials (AMAT) filled a Lam Research (LRCX)-size hole in Q1 market share, but likely didn't snag a chunk of KLA-Tencor's (KLAC) customer base, Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire said Friday.The ""zero sum game"" pits Applied Materials against a Lam-KLA combination. Analysts theorize that once Lam and KLA merge -- expected later this year -- the duo could surpass Applied Materials as the No. 2 chip gear maker.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $21.5 billion market value to Applied Materials' $21.4 billion, as of Friday. ASML Holdings (ASML) leads with a $37.8 billion. Shares of all four rose Friday on Applied Materials' Q1 beat and Q2 guidance surprise late Thursday.Applied Materials stock gapped up as much as 10% In early trading on the stock market today, and was up 9%, near 19, in afternoon trading Friday. Shares of Lam and KLA were up 3.5% and 2%, respectively. ASML stock was up more than 2.5%.Collectively, IBD's 36-company Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment was up nearly 3% Friday afternoon.Maire sees the stock rebound as temporary. Applied Materials' Q1 was ""well short of others in the industry."" Its $2.28 billion in orders and $2.26 billion in sales for the quarter ended Jan. 31 were down 6% and 5%, respectively, from the prior quarter, the analyst notes.Silicon system orders of $1.27 billion and display orders of $183 million fell 12% and 6%, respectively, from the prior quarter. But service orders of $773 million rose 1.5% sequentially and set an all-time quarterly record.Current-quarter guidance for $2.37 billion to $2.49 billion in sales,  and 30-34 cents earnings per share ex items, easily topped analyst consensus. Maire expects chipmaking tool orders to rise 25% this quarter, but suggests that 30%-40% sequential growth would be stronger.Lam's March-quarter guidance was weak, however.""Applied Materials looks to have orders up substantially in the current quarter,"" he wrote. The guidance ""begs the question of whether there was some shift from Lam to Applied Materials in the current quarter.""Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg says the math supports a market share gain by Applied Materials. Wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending fell 4% in 2015 vs. Applied Materials' 2% year-over-year growth in silicon systems.He models 3% silicon sales growth over 2016 vs. a 2% year-over-year increase in industry-wide WFE sales. Applied Materials, however, says equipment demand will be flat in 2016 vs. 2015.Twigg maintained his overweight rating and 20 price target on Applied Materials stock.Calendar 2016 will split between Nand (flash memory) and DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), Applied Materials said. Nand will dominate the first half of 2016, while DRAM, logic and foundry sales will pack the tail end.Service sales continue to ""rock and roll"" and will likely offset a trough in the tool business cycle, Maire wrote.But Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad sees Applied Materials' bounding on its OLED (organic light-emitting diode) investments. OLED displays don't have a backlight and thus are thinner than traditional LCDs (liquid crystal displays).Ahmad bumped his price target on Applied Materials stock to 23 from 22.50 and reiterated an outperform rating.OLED displays are being adopted into TVs, computer monitors, smartphones and hand-held game systems. Ahmad sees Applied Materials' investment in OLED technology as driving 10% year-over-year growth in 2016 display sales.Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson told analysts during the earnings conference call that the company is ""growing beyond the semiconductor.""""It is clear that the industry is becoming highly dependent on materials innovation, especially as they introduce new technologies like OLED,"" he said. ""This plays to our strengths and significantly expands the market.""OLED expands Applied Materials' total addressable market by a factor of three vs. LCD, Dickerson said.Combined, OLED and LCD technologies put the display business on track to reach $1 billion in fiscal 2018 revenue, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote in a report. Mok upgraded Applied Materials stock to buy from hold and reiterated a 22 price target.

441,LRCX,"Semiconductor equipment makers have jumped up IBD's industry rankings in recent weeks amid acquisitions.The 36-stock group has risen 43 places in the past six weeks to No. 10 out of 197 as of Monday. A quarter of the group's members have Composite Ratings above 90, indicating that they're outperforming 90% of all stocks in five IBD metrics, such as sales and earnings growth.Milpitas, Calif.-based KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Brookfield, Conn.-based Photronics (PLAB) lead the industry with Composite ratings of 97, just below the best-possible 99.Photronics, which makes photomasks used in semiconductor, microelectronics and flat-panel display manufacturing, has seen a revival in profit growth after a string of declines.  Earnings in the latest quarter jumped 257% to 25 cents a share, the third straight quarter of triple-digit increases. Revenue rose 14% to $142 million.The stock is getting support at its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base with a buy point at 13.05. Its relative strength line is hitting new highs, which is bullish, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- indicates strong demand for the shares. However, it has a daily average turnover of less than $20 million, making it somewhat thinly traded.The company has benefited from new products and the proliferation of mobile devices. However, Photronics is expected to lose some business after its  joint venture with Micron Technologies (MU) expires in May, according to a recent New America column.Nevertheless, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, in a Dec. 21 research note, said it expects Photronics to have more than $200 million in excess cash when the Micron tie-up ends, giving the company ""unprecedented flexibility to pursue strategic alternatives,"" such as a small acquisition or expansion into China.Meanwhile, KLA-Tencor has reported three straight quarters of accelerating profit growth after a series of declines. On Thursday,  the company said profit for the fiscal second quarter that ended in December jumped 53% to $1.04 a share, easily beating Wall Street forecasts. Revenue rose 5% to $710 million.In October, Lam Research (LRCX), another industry leader, said it would buy KLA-Tencor for more than $10 billion. The combined company will have a 42% share of the wafer fabrication equipment market. The acquisition is expected to close by midyear.

442,LRCX,"The high cost of developing new products is driving acquisitions in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  Also, research firm Gartner said Jan. 11 that worldwide semiconductor capital spending will likely drop 4.7% this year due to sluggish demand for electronics products amid weak global economic growth, putting added pressure on the industry.Mattson Technology (MTSN), another leader in the semiconductor equipment group, said in December that it had agreed to sell itself to Beijing E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center amid China's efforts to develop a semiconductor industry. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.

443,LRCX,"Stocks shifted into staggered losses as trade bucked higher on Friday, with earnings results and oil prices stirring a fair share of early action.The Dow and the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% apiece. The Nasdaq narrowed its early decline to trade a fraction lower, aided by a rally among chip equipment stocks.Volume rose sharply as options expirations drove early trade up 53% on the NYSE and 16% higher on the Nasdaq.Today's weak start was the stock market's first dip out of the starting gates in this holiday-shortened week. For the week, indexes still hold solid gains, with the Dow trading up 2%, the Nasdaq ahead by 2.8%, and the S&P 500 showing a 2.1% gain. The options expiration trade clouded the view a bit into behavior among institutional investors, as bulls are generally on the lookout for quiet action while leading stocks build bases.Oil prices contributed to the market's early weakness with West Texas Intermediate slipping more than 3%, back below $30 per barrel to traded effectively flat for the week. Baker Hughes (BHI) releases its weekly rig count data at 1 p.m. ET.Nearly all of the Dow index stocks traded lower, with Boeing (BA) and Chevron (CVX) at the bottom of the list, nearing 2% declines. Advancers held to gains of less than 0.2%.Chip equipment makers headed the S&P 500 as Applied Materials (AMAT) rose more than 9% after a narrow fiscal Q1 sales and earnings beat, followed by better-than-expected guidance. Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) were next in line with gains of 5% and 3%, respectively.Yahoo (YHOO) also figured into the mix, jumping 3% after announcing it had formed a committee of independent directors and enlisted services of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and PJT Partners to explore strategic options. The company has been vexed over whether and how to spin off its stake in China's Alibaba Holdings (BABA), valued at nearly $40 billion.Among IBD 50 stocks, Surgical Care Affiliates (SCAI) popped more than 2% after its Q4 earnings met, and revenue easily topped consensus forecasts. The stock has been fighting to hold above its 10-week moving average as well as a 41.09 buy point since a mid-January breakout.Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) retreated 3%, slipping to the bottom of the list.

444,LRCX,"If Morgan Stanley analysts' bets are right, 10 stocks are poised to rally over the next two to eight weeks, based on what they believe will be positive near-term catalysts.Their top picks range from Silicon Valley's social-media icon Facebook (FB) to ""old school"" New Jersey petroleum refiner and supplier PBF Energy (PBF).Others on Morgan Stanley's ""high conviction"" list going into the fourth-quarter earnings season include chip-gear supplier Lam Research (LRCX), enterprise data-storage firm Pure Storage (PSTG), and Canadian telco and media company BCE (BCE).The other five: cable operator AMC Networks (AMCX), paint company Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cloud networking specialist Arista Networks (ANET), dental-tech supplier Align Technology (ALGN) and Shopify (SHOP), which provides a cloud-based management platform to small and midsize retailers.Analysts who cover each of the stocks have views that ""diverge from the Street's,"" the report says.For Facebook, analyst Brian Nowak expects strong ad-revenue growth in the fourth quarter and positive earnings revisions coming in 2016. He also sees 2016 ""as the year of Instagram,"" with the platform adding more than $2 billion in incremental revenue. Another catalyst cited political ad spending.Facebook reports Q4 earnings on Jan. 27. Morgan Stanley views are 2% above consensus on earnings and 4% above on revenue. Its price target is 130.On Lam Research, Morgan expects the company to continue to outpace overall capital spending levels. Potential upside drivers cited are China's interest in chip manufacturing, Intel's (INTC) ramp-up of internal memory manufacturing, and potential competition for new chip-device structures.AMC Networks should deliver above-peer ad revenue growth on recent content success, including the ""near-term durability"" of ad revenue for its ""Walking Dead"" series and monetization of its new original programming, ""Into the Badlands,"" Morgan Stanley noted.It sees Pure Storage benefitting from fast adoption of all-flash arrays and Sherwin-Williams best positioned to gain share in the U.S. architectural paint cycle, which it believes has more room to grow than analysts expect.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

It rates all five stocks as buy.Alphabet and LinkedIn are IBD Leaderboard stocks, while the others are also highly ranked by IBD with Composite Ratings of at least 89 out of a possible 99.Google parent Alphabet will see mobile search, YouTube and advertising technology as revenue drivers next year, Nomura said. Operating expense discipline and share buybacks should boost earnings per share, analysts said. Nomura raised its price target on Alphabet to 900 from 875. Alphabet stock fell 1.6% to 762.55 on the stock market today.Arista's 50% exposure to cloud computing providers leaves it best positioned to benefit from public cloud adoption, Nomura said. It has a price target on Arista of 95. On Wednesday, Arista dropped 1.9% to 71.84.Chip gear maker Lam Research will see its ""transformative merger"" with KLA-Tencor (KLAC) boost its valuation and earnings next year, Nomura predicted. Nomura has a price target on Lam of 100. Lam stock dropped 2.6% to 78.32 on Wednesday.LinkedIn's strong product roadmap, including a new mobile app, refreshed Recruiter product, mobile ads, and Lynda.com should drive greater than 25% revenue growth over the next three years, Nomura said. Nomura has a price target on LinkedIn of 290. LinkedIn stock fell 3% to 231.34 on Wednesday.Microsoft should benefit from its transition to cloud computing — such as Office 365, moderating the declines in its Windows operating system business — and from operating expense control, Nomura said.

Ing retired his 71 price target and buy rating on Qorvo stock.""With the iPhone 'elephant in the room,' we felt investor concerns regarding a smartphone unit slowdown remained only partially addressed and not in Qorvo's control,"" Ing wrote.Slower growth rates are still likely out of China, he added.But Qorvo's overall outlook was positive, Ing wrote. The company revised its long-term target model to 32%-35% vs. an earlier 30% target and outlined plans to recapture Samsung and MediaTek smartphone share in China.A recent $1 billion debt issuance could signal that Qorvo's Industrial and Defense Products segment is becoming acquisitive, Ing wrote. Strategic M&A could help Qorvo's IDP business grow at twice the industry's 7% growth rate.Qorvo would merely be the latest in a series of recently acquisitive chip companies.

544,LRCX,"Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI) could grapple for Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), which is rumored to be on the sales block amid heavy chip industry M&A action.Maxim stock was up 7% Wednesday afternoon on a report that Texas Instruments was looking to acquire the company. Reports last week had Analog Devices doing the same. Texas Instruments stock was down nearly 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Analog Devices stock was up a fraction.Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Texas Instruments is in talks to acquire Maxim. Maxim, which has an $11 billion market value, might not sell unless the company's receives a high premium, sources told Bloomberg.An $11 billion offer would actually be on the low end in terms of big chip industry deals this year. Broadcom (BRCM) is being acquired by Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago (AVGO) for a whopping $37 billion.That deal, announced in May, was the biggest pure-tech merger — until this month's announced $67 billion merger of Dell and EMC (EMC).In June, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR) for $16.7 billion.This month, Lam Research (LRCX) announced it plans to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC) for $10.6 billion. That same day Western Digital (WDC) said it agreed to acquire SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.Also this month, Microsemi (MSCC) leaped over the bid by Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in a battle to acquire PMC-Sierra (PMCS), making a $2.4 billion offer.Chip M&A action has ramped amid an industry downturn with slowing growth, increasing costs and competition, and macroeconomic concerns, particularly in China, analysts say.Maxim makes sense for Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, analysts say, and both figure in on the M&A speculation.Texas Instruments CEO Kevin March, however, seemed doubtful of joining the M&A move, in comments during the company's recent Q2 earnings conference call with analysts.""We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being analog and embedded processing,"" March told analysts. ""So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.""MKM Partners analyst Ian Ing suggested in a research report that Texas Instruments might want to change its M&A tune.""Assuming robust M&A activity, we think the potential exists for the creation of an analog competitor with comparable scale and cost leadership,"" he wrote. ""Texas Instruments may need to respond pre-emptively and become acquisitive.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter and on Facebook.

545,LRCX,"Inphi (IPHI) stock gapped up Wednesday on Wall Street after the chipmaker reported Q3 earnings that, for the eighth consecutive quarter, more than doubled year over year.And at least one analyst now sees Inphi as a potential M&A target.For its fiscal Q3 ended Sept. 30, Inphi reported 25 cents earnings per share ex items, up 108% year over year, and above the consensus which modeled 24 cents. Three months ago, Inphi guided to between 22 cents and 26 cents.Although Inphi has more than doubled its EPS in each of the last eight quarters, Q3 was the fourth in a row showing deceleration.Revenue of $62.4 million, up 72%, also beat the consensus of 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which saw $61.3 million. Inphi previously guided to $59 million to $63.6 million.In the current quarter, Inphi expects 25 cents to 27 cents EPS on $63.3 million to $65.3 million in sales. Sales would be up 17% at the midpoint while earnings would fall 13% at the midpoint vs. the year-earlier quarter.At least five analysts boosted their price targets on Inphi stock on Wednesday.Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan rates Inphi stock a buy and issued a price target of 31. He was ""cautiously optimistic"" on Inphi's return to business in China.Inphi CEO Ford Tamer said Tuesday that the chipmaker saw depressed Q2 mobile sales out of China reverse in Q3.""We have seen a resumption of the China demand,"" Tamer told analysts during the Q3 earnings conference call. ""We feel confident that Phase II of the China mobile infrastructure has resumed. So, based on the data we have today, we're seeing obviously orders flowing back in.""Sundararajan sees ""significant chances that Inphi could become a target of acquisition."" M&A action within the chip industry hit a fever pitch this year with the multibillion-dollar acquisition deals selling SanDisk (SNDK) to Western Digital (WDC), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) to Lam Research (LRCX), Altera (ALTR) to Intel (INTC) and Broadcom (BCRM) to Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO).Inphi stock carries a high IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99 in its Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group, putting it alongside other top-performing stocks like Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), ARM Holdings (ARMH), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Cavium (CAVM).Cavium stock, set to report its fiscal Q3 after the close Wednesday, was up nearly 1.5% in early trading. Integrated Device Technology stock, which beat forecasts in its Q2 report and announced an acquisition Tuesday, was up more than 3%.In morning trading on the stock market today, Inphi stock was up nearly 8%, trading near 30.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

577,LRCX,"Applied Materials (AMAT) stock hit a nearly two-year low Friday after the No. 1 chip gear maker late Thursday reported Q3 revenue that missed Wall Street's forecast and offered lackluster Q4 guidance.CEO Gary Dickerson blamed unexpectedly floundering foundry sales for the Q3 revenue miss and lowered Q4 guidance. Thrifty customers have become adept at reusing their tools rather than ordering more, he said during the Q3 earnings conference call.""So what we see in foundry is, in our fourth quarter, it's less than we anticipated,"" he said. ""And we even saw, as we mentioned in my notes, that we had about an $8 million push-out of a foundry booking — or a cancellation, rather.""In its fiscal Q3 ended July 26, Applied Materials reported $2.49 billion in revenue, up 10% vs. Q3 2014, but still short of analysts' forecast $2.54 billion. The company met Wall Street's earnings views of 33 cents per share ex items, up 18%.Orders Up SignificantlyThird-quarter orders were up 17%, led primarily by a $2 billion jump in silicon system orders, CFO Robert Halliday said on the call.Nand flash memory orders hit an all-time high, helped along by healthy demand for 3D chips, Halliday said. For 2015, Dickerson sees DRAM memory chip spending to grow 20% — despite a potential 10% drop in 2016 — as the mobile market continues to flourish.3D chips, used in 4K TVs, will have a long life in the semiconductor industry, Halliday said.""You can't keep shrinking; electrons in a cell, you can't get any smaller. ... So they're going to go to 3D,"" he said. ""So I think if anything, you've got a solid baseline of predictable spending that's pretty healthy in 3D Nand for a number of years.""For Q4, the chipmaker forecast flat revenue but also said that it could drop as much as 7%. The company forecasts EPS minus items of 27 cents to 31 cents, which would be down 12% at the midpoint vs. Q3.Secular Or Cyclical Problem?Analysts latched onto the foundry dilemma. At least three lowered their price targets on Applied Materials stock.Cowen and Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri urged Applied Materials management ""to shake things up with something bold."" Applied Materials should be ready for a major industry shakeup should tool reuse become the norm, he wrote in a research report.""Even as 3D Nand continues to upside, lingering confusion around whether or not there are secular changes underway in foundry/logic continue to hit AMAT,"" he wrote. ""The time is now to shake things up.""Arcuri recommended competitor LAM Research (LRCX) over Applied Materials and lowered his price target on Applied Materials to 24 from 25. He rated Applied stock outperform.Weston Twigg, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, worried that the foundry ""headwind"" could continue for several quarters.But, he wrote in a report, ""there's a lot to like with AMAT."" He pointed to Applied's growing etch business as another order winner in Q3; he added that operations expenses were under control and that gross profit margins were improving.Twigg lowered his price target on Applied Materials stock to 23 from 27 and rated the stock overweight.Mahesh Sanganeria, an RBC Capital analyst, rated Applied Materials stock sector perform and dropped his price target to 16 from 19.Sanganeria sees Applied Materials being too optimistic heading into 2016.""Management expects DRAM spending down 10% and Nand to remain at a high level, driven by continued 3D Nand investment,"" he wrote in a report. ""In our opinion, memory spending will likely see a significant decline after three years of growth.""JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur lowered his price target on Applied Materials stock to 25 from 26. Based on the company's ""impressive orders,"" Deutsche Bank analyst David Folkerts-Landau reiterated a buy rating on Applied Materials stock.In early afternoon trading in the stock market today, Applied Materials was down more than 3%, trading near 16.50.

732,LRCX,"Dividends have been the consistent source of income for investors seeking regular returns during both bull and bear markets. According to a study, dividends accounted for an average 52% of the total returns over the past seven decades.This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Q2 Dividends Payout Hits Record Overall, the S&P 500 companies declared a record $124 billion in dividend payouts during the second quarter, up 11% from $112 billion in the year-ago quarter. About 89 firms hiked their payouts versus 67 firms a year ago, while 332 have maintained their dividends versus 347 in the same period last year. Notably, 43 companies have retained the ‘aristocrat’ status of 25 years of consecutive dividend raises. This is primarily thanks to a strong economy, solid earnings, historic tax cuts and results from the second round of Federal Reserve stress tests.Among the special attractions were Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), which declared a dividend for the first time with a payout of 35 cents, and Dr Pepper Snapple , which announced a special dividend of $103.75 due to merger activity. Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) were among the firms that hiked dividend payouts (read: 4 Dividend Growth ETFs to Watch as Global Dividends Top).The trend is expected to continue in the coming months as most large companies have huge cash piles on their balance sheet and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. Additionally, the new tax law encourages the companies to bring their overseas cash back home at much more reduced rates and distribute parts of it to their shareholders. Per Bloomberg, an additional 75 companies will boost dividend payouts this quarter.Investors should also note that a company which consistently increases its dividend has stronger fundamentals, suggesting rising cash flows, good liquidity and a strong balance sheet.How to PlayGiven this, investors could tap growing dividends in the form of ETFs.

733,LRCX,"The Trump administration announced plans today for a stronger security review process of foreign investors acquiring American technologies that would rely on existing laws, taking a step back from previous gestures indicating it would specifically block Chinese investments.This move is perceived as more economically friendly to global investors who were concerned the U.S. Treasury was about to create a virtual blockade of firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. companies with ""industrially significant technology.""“Such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity,” Trump said in a statement.Instead of creating new executive powers, the Treasury Department recommended that Trump use the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a 1980s law which already gives the executive branch the power to review foreign investments seen as a national security risk.Loose WH Lips Sink ChipsPart of the volatility for global stock markets the past few months has been due to the unpredictable rhetoric from the Administration. With no less than five voices besides Trump's -- including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, US Trade liaison Robert Lighthizer and economic advisors Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro -- all speaking to the media, many apparently ""official"" statements are later retracted or modified.In the end, any meaningful action on the Chinese threat to US intellectual property is probably a good thing. But it's the short-term uncertainty about how it evolves that has both investors and technology companies on edge.Caught in the middle of the White House ""America First"" agenda are a number of big US companies who complain that the tariffs penalize them for their globe-spanning supply chains. And the Semiconductor industry may be the most vulnerable right now.Global supply chains for Semiconductor manufacturing and equipment are probably some of the most complicated. Tariffs will definitely throw a wrench in the works.Chips are often designed and produced in the US, sent to China for packaging or testing and then returned back to the States. The chips would now be subject to tariffs on the return trip.Earlier this month, a spokesman for the Semiconductor Industry Association made their views clear...""Tariffs on semiconductors would harm, not help, U.S. semiconductor companies, their workers, and American consumers.""In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the last few week's of ""trade battle"" rhetoric that have led to a 9% sell-off in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX), and individual declines (from their June peaks) in these 5 popular investments...Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): -17%Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report): -14%These first 2 companies are wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) makers for the actual chip makers like Intel, Samsung, Micron and even NVIDIA.Micron (MU  -  Free Report): -13.5%NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report): -11%Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report): -11.5%Wait -- Alibaba isn't a chip stock. Why did I include them?Because I can't believe this ""Amazon of China"" is a victim in this trade war. I explain in the video with my thesis on why you buy BABA as the premier gateway to the world's largest middle class.The Threat of ""Made in China 2025""I also explain the motives of the Trump administration and what threat(s) in particular they are combating. This excerpt from a June 15 Wall Street Journal article gives some good background...White House officials said the goal of the tariff fight is to protect high-tech U.S. companies from pressure they face in China to transfer their technology to Chinese partners. Tariffs are necessary, the officials say, to force Beijing to change the way it does business.""We're going to stop, we hope, their transfer of technology -- their forced transfer of technology,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Fox Business Network.What is ""Made in China 2025?"" It's their long-term strategic technology plan, issued by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and his cabinet in May 2015, to comprehensively upgrade Chinese industry.The goals include increasing the domestic content of core materials to 40% by 2020 and 70% by 2025. The plan clearly focuses on high-tech fields including the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries to which China has largely depended on US and European companies for advanced technology.The Council on Foreign Relations has said it believes the plan is a ""real existential threat to U.S. technological leadership.""And so it was no surprise when, on June 15, the Trump administration unveiled a lengthy tariff list mainly focused on the products included in the Made in 2025 plan, including IT and robotics related products.The War to Protect WFE -- And Its Costs Intel, Samsung, Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) have always been big customers for WFE. “But Chinese chip makers are starting to write some large checks as well,"" according to Dan Gallagher of the Wall Street Journal.Applied Materials CFO Dan Durn in his company's quarterly earnings call last month confirmed this sentiment from their business...""China is emerging as a spender. Their strategic intent is clear, and the financial resources they have are clear.“But as Dan Gallagher wrote in his June 25 article Chip-Equipment Makers in Crosshairs of Trade War...“Wars are generally good news for arms dealers. In the burgeoning trade war with China, the semiconductor-equipment industry may turn out to be a notable exception.“To be sure, China isn't the only driver of growth for the chip-equipment sector. Strong spending in memory and process-node upgrades at the major chip makers are also fueling increased spending on equipment. But Krish Sankar of Cowen & Co. estimates that China accounted for about 14% of trailing 12-month revenue, on average, for the eight semiconductor-tool companies he covers.""That means the loss of future sales could be significantly more. War is hell.”While I have believed that we are in the midst of a Technology Super Cycle (email Ultimate@Zacks.com to get a free copy of my December 11, 2017 special report) driven by exponential data and memory demands, exponential mobile and connected/IoT device growth, artificial intelligence, and automation including ADAS vehicles, it looks like the ""war on China"" is throwing a big wrench in the works after all.But I still think it will set up terrific buying opportunities in all these companies as the pessimism peaks this summer. Here’s to a short battle with China instead of an all-out war.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA, AMAT, MU, and BABA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

734,LRCX,"Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for LRCX broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 15.4% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for LRCX stock.If that wasn’t enough, Lam Research isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 2 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this into a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for LRCX.

735,LRCX,"Recently, KLA-Tencor Corporation’s (KLAC  -  Free Report) rating has been downgraded by Needham’s analyst Y. Edwin Mok to “hold” from “buy”.This downgrade comes on the heels of lower customer spending on foundry products and memory pushouts. Moreover, KLA’s customer concentration poses a serious threat to its shipment growth.Following this announcement, the company’s share price declined 3.4% at market close on Jun 22.Coming to the price performance over the past 12 months, shares of KLA have returned 10.9%, outperforming the industry’s rally of 30.9%.Factors in DetailPer the analyst, the ongoing sluggish trend in customers’ investments on 7 nanometer (NM) and 5 NM foundry products is likely to persist throughout the second half of 2018. This poses a serious threat to the KLA’s shipments.Further, Samsung, one of the most important customers of KLA, has decided to postpone some of its 10 NM DRAM production and related equipment purchases. Notably, Samsung has accounted for more than 10% of KLA’s total revenues for three consecutive years since fiscal 2015.This is likely to impact the demand for KLA’s wafer equipments adversely. Its shipments in the third-quarter of calendar year 2018 will be hurt, which will further hinder the company from meeting its shipment expectations.Further, fall in wafer demand from major customers will hurt the fundamentals and profitability of the company. Consequently, restricted number of customers remains a major issue.Moreover, this decision of Samsung has resulted in share price declines of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report).Further, the recent trend of transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND remains negative for wafer demand since the latter requires less wafer and provides higher density.KLA’s Performance & Positive OutlookDespite of the cyclicality in consumer investment pattern and major transitions in the semiconductor industry, KLA managed to perform well in the third-quarter fiscal 2018.KLA reported revenues of $1.02 billion which improved 5% year over year. Product revenues came in $797.8 million, accounting for 78% of revenues. This can primarily be attributed to increased investments from memory and logic customers for next generation technology as well as capacity-related investments.Additionally, shipments were $1.041 billion, which went beyond the guidance of $945 million to $1.025 billion. Memory, foundry and logic contributed 78%, 13% and 9%, respectively.Moreover, we remain optimistic about the company’s positive outlook for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 in which the company expects revenues between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and shipments in the range of $1.01-1.09 billion.Memory shipments are anticipated in the range of 60-70% of the total shipments, foundry is likely to account for 24% while logic is expected to account for 8% o the shipments. Further, in foundry segment, KLA expects orders for the first wave of investment in 5 NM in the second half of 2018.Consequently, the positive business outlook, strong fundamentals and continued momentum in China are likely to aid the stock rebound in the upcoming quarters.KLA-Tencor Corporation Revenue (TTM) KLA-Tencor Corporation Revenue (TTM) | KLA-Tencor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, KLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock that can be considered in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

736,LRCX,"Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) reported tepid top- and bottom-line results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s non-GAAP earnings per share of 51 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents and also declined 40% year over year. Reduced revenues and higher operating expenses were the main reason behind the dismal bottom-line results.Quarter DetailsTotal revenues decreased approximately 7.5% year over year to $303.2 million mainly due to lower-than-expected smartphone unit volumes. Quarterly revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326 million.Segment wise, Portable audio product revenues (86.7% of the total revenues) came in at $262.8 million, down 9.6% year over year.  However, non-portable audio and other products (13.3%) increased 8.6% year over year and came in at $40.4 million.Non-GAAP gross profit was $153.1 million, which decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin improved 30 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 50.5%.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 17.4% on a year-over-year basis to $106.8 million. As a percentage of revenues, the same increased 750 bps from the year-ago quarter to 35.2%. This in turn negatively impacted operating results.Cirrus Logic’s non-GAAP operating income was $46.3 million, down 37.2% year over year, primarily due to higher operating expenses. Also, operating margin contracted 700 bps on a year-over-year basis and came in at 15%.On a non-GAAP basis, Cirrus Logic reported net income of $33 million compared with $56.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. This marked a decline of 41.8%.The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $235.6 million compared with $226.6 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $100.8 million compared with $217.6 million in the last quarter. Notably, it did not have any long-term debt during the quarter.Full-Year HighlightsFor fiscal 2018, the company reported revenues of $1.53 billion, almost flat as compared to the year-ago level of $1.54 billion. Cirrus Logic reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.27 for the fiscal that declined 4.9% from the prior year.Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Cirrus Logic, Inc. QuoteGuidanceCirrus Logic provided guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2019. Owing to the ongoing sluggishness in the smartphone market, the company provided a tepid outlook for the current quarter. The company expects revenues in the range of $210–$250 million (mid-point $230 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $312.6 million. The company predicts GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 48-50%. Combined GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are anticipated between $133 million and $139 million.Bottom LineCirrus Logic, a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions, ended fiscal 2018 on a dismal note with reporting disappointing results for the fourth quarter. Moreover, revenue guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2019 was unimpressive.Management expects the sluggish demand in the smartphone market to continue for sometime now, which will eventually hurt the company’s top-line. Management is a bit conservative about visibility as the markets to which Cirrus Logic caters to are maturing, thereby recording decelerating growth.We anticipate sluggish iPhone demand to negatively impact the company’s results, with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) reportedly being one of the largest customers of the company.Nevertheless, management remains optimistic about the company’s product portfolio, aiming a variety of smart home applications, digital headsets and smartphones. Audio amplifier design wins along with lead design win with first generation haptic products and discussions in progress with customers for second generation products are encouraging.Moreover, it is looking to penetrate the Android market, which we believe will reduce its dependence on Apple and broaden its ability to cater to a larger customer base.However, it seems that it will take a long time for these initiatives to practically offset the ongoing headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCirrus Logic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology, Inc.

737,LRCX,"The FOMC is poised to raise the Fed funds target rate by a quarter point in about an hour. And this is with over 95% certainty as this morning's PPI inflation data came in hotter than expected.But what market players will be most focused on is the ""dot plot"" of the pace of future hikes. Will they show that two more rate increases are more likely this year?Or will they show that some committee members think the economic growth and inflation data warrant 3 more hikes?In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the market psychology of large investors and why any fear-driven stock market sell-off about the Fed's views should be seized as a buying opportunity.In addition to explaining the things that investors are worried about, like a flattening yield curve and rising inflation data, I give my 3 probability-weighted scenarios for the stock market's reaction.I also share some wisdom from one of my favorite economists, Brian Wesbury of First Trust.While I have been an astute Fed-watcher for a couple of decades, I'm leaning on Brian here to help us navigate what level of interest rates this economy can handle and still support expansion and investor optimism.I come away completely confident in my conclusion to buy whatever sell-off unfolds over the coming days, or weeks.And some of my favorite stock targets will be Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Centene (CNC  -  Free Report), and Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report), the latter two which have been making great new all-time highs this month.I may even add some more CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report) as the fear about ""gene editing gone wrong"" gets over-done.Disclosure: I own BABA and LRCX shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio and CNC, EW, and CRSP for the Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

738,LRCX,"The popular adage “Sell in May and Go Away” proved wrong this year as Wall Street is on track to log the best May in nine years. With just one trading session left to the month, the S&P 500 gained 3.3%, Dow Jones is up 3.1%, and Nasdaq Composite Index has moved up by 5.1% in May.Power-packed earnings and easing U.S.-China trade fears led to the rally though bouts of political news like deepening crisis in Italy and renewed sanction on Iran as well as higher yields continued to keep the market at check. In particular, rising oil prices infused optimism in the energy sector and gave a huge boost to the broad stock market.That said, a few sectors have easily crushed the market this month. Below we have highlighted such sector ETFs that have gained handsomely in May and could be better plays in the months ahead should the trends prevail.ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF (ARKG  -  Free Report)The biotech sector got a dual boost from encouraging fundamentals including a wave of mergers & acquisitions, and its non-cyclical nature, which provides a defensive tilt to the portfolio in a turbulent market. Additionally, Trump’s most-awaited plan to lower drug prices has added to the strength. While almost all the healthcare ETFs surged, ARKG emerged as the winner, climbing 13.6% (read: Pharma & Biotech ETFs Soar on Trump's Drug Plan).This is an actively managed ETF focusing on companies that are expected to benefit from extending and enhancing the quality of human and other life by incorporating technological and scientific developments, improvements and advancements in genomics into their business. The fund holds 38 stocks in its basket with heavy concentration on the top firm at 11.2%. Other firms hold no more than 7.52% share. The product has amassed $176.2 million in its asset base and trades in a good average daily volume of around 93,000 shares. The expense ratio comes in at 0.75%.First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL  -  Free Report)After taking a huge beating, the semiconductor corner of the broad technology market once again heated up in May due to reduced tensions between the United States and China. This is because U.S. chipmakers have the largest sales exposure to China. Additionally, the string of better-than-expected results from industry players such as Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), MKS Instruments (MKSI  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report) instilled optimism in the space.FTXL offers exposure to the most-liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index. Holding 30 stocks in its basket, it has diverse exposure across components with each holding less than 10% of the assets. FTXL has accumulated $44.4 million in AUM while average trading volume is light at around 19,000 shares. It charges 0.60% in expense ratio and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The ETF is up 11.9% in May (read: Winners of Q1 Earnings: 5 Best ETF Charts).PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples Portfolio (PSCC  -  Free Report)The consumer staples gained on the dual benefits of strong earnings and investors’ flight to defensive sector, which generally outperforms during periods of low growth and high uncertainty. In particular, Q1 earnings for the 73.8% of the small-cap consumer staples sector market capitalization are up 54.9% on higher 10% revenue growth.PSCC, which targets the small-cap segment of the sector, has gained 11% in May. The fund follows the S&P SmallCap 600 Capped Consumer Staples Index, holding 20 stocks in its basket with a tilt toward the top firm at 12.71%. Other firms hold no more than 8.65% of assets. From an industrial look, food products take the chunk 45.1% share, followed by household products (15.4%), personal products (14%) and food and staples retailing (12.7%). The ETF has managed assets worth $45 million and trades in average daily volume of 4,000 shares. It charges 29 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Solid Small-Cap Earnings Put Spotlight on These Sector ETFs).PowerShares S&P SmallCap Energy Fund (PSCE  -  Free Report)The oil price rally has brought back the allure for energy ETFs. As such, PSCE, which provides exposure to the U.S. small-cap segment of the energy sector by tracking the S&P Small Cap 600 Capped Energy Index, has gained 9.2% in May. Holding 31 securities in its basket, it is highly concentrated on the top firm with 12.2% exposure while other firms hold less than 9% of total assets.

739,LRCX,"Investors in Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 15, 2018 $100 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Lam Research shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Lam Research is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry that ranks in the Top 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.59 per share to $5.00 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Lam Research right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

741,LRCX,"The liquidity of a company often indicates whether its business is going in a profitable direction. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 13.Here are six of the 13 stocks that qualified the screen:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

742,LRCX,"Though the prospect of faster-than-expected rates hikes and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal of dividend stocks, applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns in a rising rate environment.In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth are usually of high quality and deliver excellent risk-adjusted returns in the longer term. When compared with the ones that pay out high yields, dividend growth stocks form a healthy portfolio, with more scope for capital appreciation.Inside Dividend Growth StocksStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks pose a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth a promising investment as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Furthermore, these have a long history of outperformance over the long term. However, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio:5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:California-based Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 78 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending June 2018) and has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.75%.

743,LRCX,"If you are looking to invest in potential stocks from the semiconductor space, you can’t ignore NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report).For the past two years, NVIDIA has been impressing investors with its stellar performance, wherein the company’s quarterly revenues have been advancing at a rate more than 50%, earnings have tripled and shares have displayed more than six-fold growth, consequently.Moreover, in the year so far, the stock has rallied 26.9% as against growth of 1.4%, 8.1% and 8.3% recorded by the S&P 500, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK), respectively.The share price rally highlights that the slew of bad news related to the company, such as sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners and Uber’s driverless-vehicle test incident, which prompted NVIDIA to suspend test drives for all its driverless vehicles, did not have any negative impact on investors.We also believe Uber’s driverless-test mishap will lead to increased investment by vehicle makers to make driverless cars safer. Hence, demand for NVIDIA’s chips will remain unaffected, in our opinion. Moreover, this March, the company unveiled the Constellation driving simulator which enables companies to test self-driving systems in a virtual environment.Although NVIDIA doesn’t expect the new simulator to fully replace real-world testing of self-driving cars, the number of trials will likely come down, significantly. We believe the latest simulator will enhance NVIDIA’s competitive position in the self-driving car market space, particularly against chip makers, like Intel and Advance Micro Devices.Furthermore, although NVIDIA predicts a slowdown in crypto-specific GPUs revenues in the near term, we believe this will be immaterial to its financials. The company foresees demand for its GPUs to shift from miners to gamers, going forward, which will boost the gaming business revenues and offset loss of revenues from miners.NVIDIA, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the preceding four quarters, the average positive surprise being 40.1%. The company witnessed sharp upward estimate revision over the past 7 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 5.4% (9 cents) to $1.77 per share, during the same time frame, and reflects year-over-year growth of more than 75%.Of course, NVIDIA is our first choice in the semiconductor industry, however that does not mean the list ends here as several companies in the space are likely to benefit from the rising demand for chips.Solid Industry Growth ProjectionThe semiconductor industry has been benefiting from the rising demand for chips used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017. It is believed the semiconductor industry will continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, marking 7.7% growth.Additionally, the U.S. chip-equipment makers’ earnings and cash flow are likely to get further boost from President Trump’s business-friendly tax-cut policies. The tax reform will make semiconductors repatriate significant amount of cash held abroad and eventually drive after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities.Therefore, it is wise for investors to have some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio which have potentials to provide better returns.4 Semi Stocks for Rest of 2018Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) takes the second position in our list after NVIDIA. Micron has turned out to be one of the best performers in the semiconductor industry, in the year so far. The company’s shares have appreciated nearly 31.3% during the period, a much better performance than the S&P 500, iShares PHLX Semiconductor and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETFs.This outperformance can be primarily attributed to Micron’s robust revenue and earnings growth, as well as expanding margins. We note that the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8% in the past four quarters.We believe the company will continue its splendid growth performance in the quarters ahead. The optimism surrounding the stock comes from the fact that the DRAM market is still witnessing a huge demand-supply gap which has been escalating prices.It should also be noted that as Micron generates nearly 70% of its revenues by selling DRAM products, the company is the biggest beneficiary of this supply shortage. In the last reported quarter, sales from DRAM products witnessed a massive 76% year-over-year increase.Micron, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has also witnessed significant earnings estimate revision in the past 60 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 3% (8 cents) to $2.84 per share during the same period.Our next pick is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). The company is anticipated to benefit from the improving WFE market, elevated demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology in the near future. This is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities, and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, coming up with an average positive surprise of 9.1%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 8.9% (41 cents) to $5.00 per share, in the last 30 days. The stock has ascended 9.8% in the year-to-date period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The next stock in our list is KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report). KLA-Tencor is likely to benefit from an expanding product portfolio. Furthermore, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth for the company’s process control and yield-management solutions.KLA-Tencor’s shares have gained 6%, in the year so far. The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, over the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 7.5%. Moreover, the EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 9.2% (18 cents) to $2.14 per share, over the past 30 days.The next stock on our radar is Texas Instruments, Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report). The company’s continued focus on adding new products in the industrial and auto space is estimated to effectively address the increasing demand for semiconductor content in these markets. Additionally, Texas Instruments’ solid presence in other end markets, stable revenue stream and rising demand for its products will broaden the company’s clientele and addressed market.Results of this Zacks Ranked #1 company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and came in line in the other, over the preceding four quarters. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 7.5%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 5.7% (7 cents) to $1.30 per share, over the past 30 days. The stock has ascended 4.6% in the year-to-date period.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

744,LRCX,"Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 loss of $2.24 per share, wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of $1.14.Revenues increased 11.9% from the year-ago quarter to $811.8 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $778 million. The growth was driven by higher services (up 20.7%) and instant game sales (up 7.1%). Product sales increased marginally (0.6%).Quarter DetailsGaming Segment (54.6% of total revenues) revenues increased 0.7% year over year to $443 million. Increase in replacement unit shipments of 30% in the first quarter was offset by lesser number of new casino openings in the global market. Gaming operations and Gaming Machine sales decreased 6.4% and 7.3%, respectively.However, strong growth in Gaming Systems and Table Products of 22% and 24%, respectively, backed results. Table Products improved from a rise in installed base of proprietary table games, new shufflers sales and other table game products. Moreover, acquisition of Tech Art in January 2018 also drove results.The year-over-year growth in Gaming Systems revenues was driven by increased system installation in casinos based in Alberta and Ontario as well as a rise in hardware sales backed by shipment of new iVIEW4 player-interface display units.During the quarter, replacement unit shipments in the United States and Canada increased 30% on a year-over-year basis to 4,667 units, driven by high adoption of the TwinStar cabinets and Pro Wave cabinets. International shipments declined 25.3% to 2,201 units.Gaming Operations revenues fell due to a decline in installed base of WAP and premium participation gaming machines. However, replacement of older cabinets with news ones such as Gamescape, TwinStar V75 and TwinStar iReels cabinets led to an increase in install base by 21 units, sequentially.Lottery Segment (24.8% of total revenues) revenues were up 6.7% from the prior-year quarter to $201.7 million. Revenues from Instant Products and Lottery Systems increased 6% and 8.6% from the year-ago quarter, respectively. Instant games such as Willy Wonka Golden Ticket increased revenues in the United States by 8%. The rise in Lottery systems revenues was driven by an increase in revenues from multi-state games in the United States and rise in systems maintenance contracts in international markets.The company has sub-divided the earlier Interactive business segment into Social and Digital. The results of recently acquired NYX are integrated in the Digital segment.Social Segment (12% of total revenues) revenues increased 21% year over year to $97.4 million on the back of robust performance of Bingo Showdown apps along with Quick Hit Slots and 88 Fortunes. The relaunch of Jackpot Party Social Casino in the second half of the quarter also boosted revenues.The company’s launch of a new MONOPOLY Slots themed social casino app in mid-April is expected to lend better support to the segment.Digital Segment (8.6%) revenues grew to $69.7 million, of which $49.2 million is associated with the acquisition of NYX.

745,LRCX,"The US stock market has survived the first deadline in the new White House tariff policy via an extension of steel and aluminum exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and the EU beyond May 1.But the malaise still lingers with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all stuck between their 50 and 200-day moving averages despite the strongest Q1 earnings season in 7 years.In the video that accompanies this article, I show all the charts including the Philly Semiconductor Index (SOX) which has a chance to form an inverted head-and-shoulders bottom.I also show the best and worst sectors to be in since the first shots were fired in the trade war: Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Industrials (XLI), respectively.So what's eating the market? Why aren't investors buying more of all the great companies reporting record quarterly sales and profits, and continued strength in their business forecasts?It's the looming trade war. We haven't heard a lot of companies complain on their conference calls about the uncertainty. But the uncertainty is there because so many unknowns are on the table and this breeds some degree of anxiety for corporate managers and strategic planners.And that anxiety is showing up in stocks as investors ponder, calculate and game who could be most impacted by the enactment and escalation of tariffs, especially between the US and our ""frenemy"" China.Besides the potential for a decrease in global sales, with 45% of S&P 500 revenues coming from “exports,” there is also a credit impact. The Financial Times just published an article this afternoon titled US groups warned of credit hit from US-China trade war in which Don Weinland, writing from Hong Kong, shared some research notes from S&P Global...US companies are the biggest losers in Donald Trump’s trade war with China, rating agency S&P Global has warned, with the likes of Tesla, Texas Instruments and Peabody Energy facing greater credit risks than Chinese peers after the exchange of fire between the world’s two largest economies.“Considering the complexity of international supply chains, many market participants are on edge that new tariffs might have damaging unintended consequences,” S&P said.Ross vs. BABAIn my video, I also share some quotes from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross when he spoke at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills on May 1.Basically, Ross is prepared to go to war and thinks any short-term pain for US companies and the economy will be worth it in the long run. Many investors, myself included, hope that he is more right than wrong.But President Trump also has some big investors in support of his goals and methods. Speaking on a panel at the MIG conference was Thomas Barrack, a Trump friend and chairman of the $43 billion asset management firm Colony Northstar.“Look, we’re going to practice a little bit of dynamite diplomacy,” said Barrack. “You need to blow up the system sometimes to make the system work and it starts at home.”I agree that some unfair practices by China need to be addressed and that we should use our position of strength -- we help create their trade surplus and wealth with our appetite for Chinese goods -- to negotiate better terms and agreements in many areas, especially regarding intellectual property.But we also need to approach the ""war"" very strategically because China now has the world's single-largest middle class, with a consumer population of over 500 million.I've been speaking about this ""big picture"" view for years as an investor in companies like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), the ""Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) of China.""When BABA CEO Jack Ma did a PR tour of the states in 2017, he was asked if his goal was to get US consumers to buy more Chinese goods. He emphatically stated the opposite; he wanted American businesses to see their access to sell to the Chinese consumer through a gateway like Alibaba.In this way, you could think of BABA as offering services to US businesses much like the online mall of store sites Shopify (SHOP  -  Free Report).So it was especially exciting for me to hear that Alibaba co-founder Joseph Tsai spoke at the MIG conference. Barron's reporter Reshma Kapadia was posting live quotes on Twitter Tuesday and she caught some great ones from Tsai...""Alibaba’s Tsai re: trade: Can see it devolving into tit for tat; time for cooler heads to prevail to look at what real issues are; ironic US producers facing greatest opp to sell to China’s middle-class, US deciding to put down gate""She later paraphrased in an article on Tuesday morning...Tsai found it ""ironic"" the U.S. was picking this point for a trade war since the growth of the middle class in China created a large group of consumers that could be a big market for U.S. companies.Can the Bullish Structure Survive the Month of May?The next inflection point for the ""trade war"" is likely May 21 when the US Treasury is due to recommend new rules to block Chinese takeovers of America's advanced-technology assets.As if May wasn't tricky enough as the proverbial month to ""sell and go away"" until the market typically resumes its bullish nature in Q4. And the ""mid-term"" election curse every four years isn't helping either.Here's what I told my TAZR Trader group earlier this week...As I've been talking about, the SPX and the NDX still have bullish structure with higher lows, despite the weak chop and insisting on hanging out between the 50 and 200-day MAs.Even the SOX chart has a decent shot at turning up from its bullish structure of an inverted head and shoulders pattern (see video for the chart).If I'm right about the charts being able to pull up from this slow-motion malaise, even this persistent ""correction in time"" is overall good for the market in the long-term.All the economic, earnings, tax, and trade issues are getting washed, wrung, and hung out to dry.See my video and article from last week The Not-Good-Enough-Yet Earnings Season for more details on why the fundamentals are still bullish.We want to see lots of investors throw in the towel in impatience over this slow process and the maddening chop that we've all experienced.The difference for us is that we have a less-stressed and more-seasoned view of it all.(end of TAZR commentary on 5/1)So what exactly is my “less-stressed and more-seasoned view of it all?” Right now, it mainly involves being long-term bullish and short-term very nimble. Strategic and tactical.Here are more details on that “strategic and tactical” approach…If these charts do break down and bring an extended correction into the summer months, I still believe it will be a terrific buying opportunity.That's why I have a very high cash balance in TAZR, waiting either to join a confirmed move to new highs or to pounce on new lows with bargains galore.Disclosure: I own shares of BABA and LRCX for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

749,LRCX,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. Companies that emphasize on sales management have a competitive advantage, as solid sales generally get converted into growth.Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Stagnant or declining sales indicate obstacles at the company and offer limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust sales growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering expenses, sustainable bottom-line improvement typically requires impressive sales growth.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future prospects. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily translate into profits.Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Kingsport, TN, Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) manufactures and sells materials, specialty additives, chemicals, and fibers. Expected sales growth rate for the current year is 4.9% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC  -  Free Report) provides software products and software-enabled services. This Windsor, CT-based company’s expected sales growth rate for 2018 is 99.8% and it sports a Zacks Rank #1.AMETEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report), headquartered in Berwyn, PA, manufactures and sells electronic instruments and electromechanical devices. Its current year expected sales growth rate is 8.4% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2.Headquartered in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment.

750,LRCX,"In December, I wrote a special report for Zacks Confidential titled ""The Technology Super Cycle.""Today, in this article and the embedded video, I weave some excerpts of that report into my observations about Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and their recent Investor/Analyst Day that inspired research analyst Kevin Cassidy of investment bank Stifel Nicolaus to raise his price target on the stock to a Street-high $106.My summary idea of The Technology Super Cycle was this: Innovation is driving earnings growth in unseen productivity and efficiency that keeps inflation low and investment high.Every smart tech analyst on Wall Street is always looking for good ole' pc-driven technology to still be ""cyclical"" and inevitably peaking soon, and so they have been busy climbing over the top of each other to be the first to ""call the top"" quarter after quarter.But they've been wrong ever since the Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded Broadcom (AVGO) in October of 2014 at $70. And I've been buying stocks like that ever since, quarter after quarter. In fact, I led my Zacks followers in AVGO profits all the way to $250.Why So Many Miss the Exponential Revolution Trying to Pick the Top of the CycleWe are all aware on some level that technology innovation is changing our world, and the global economy, at ever faster rates. But have the impacts for technology investors become stretched, over-valued and about to decline?Both as citizens and investors we benefit from high tech: smartphones, apps, the cloud and HPC (high performance computing), semiconductor efficiency and software automation, biotechnology and even advanced energy tech like fracking.But we haven't really seen this powerful growth show up in the GDP of our 2% economy for the past 8 years or so.It's almost as if you could believe the pessimists who say that technology innovation is somehow hurting economic productivity by burdening us with systems that are complex to learn, susceptible to failure, and vulnerable to hacking. Or maybe they think that productivity only causes jobs to go overseas and profits and wages to go down.But in mid-November I offered a better answer to Zacks Ultimate members in our monthly ZU Strategy Session. In the ""Agree to Disagree"" segment, I challenged our Director of Research to a debate about whether ""This Time Is Different"" with respect to growth and equity valuations.My thesis: Technology was actually accelerating growth but we didn't see it in government data because productivity was also accelerating in ways uncaptured (or unpublicized) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, thus changing both the numerator and the denominator of several derivative measurements.In more detail in my December report The Technology Super Cycle, I broke the ""problem"" down into two distinct and very important puzzles: productivity and inflation. Here's how I cracked the codes of these missing links...Missing Link #1: ProductivityAs I explained to investors over the past 10 years why we still needed to buy Tech and Biotech growth, there was one piece of the puzzle that I couldn't quite explain: if innovation was so high, why wasn't GDP higher?That's when I found the answer from Brian Wesbury in the summer of 2017: productivity, defined as Change in Outputs / Change in Inputs, has over 40% of the numerator dominated by Federal and State/Local government in the equation! Those areas do not produce productivity. Nor do their subsidies.In the video that accompanies this report, I share a wonderful bit of serendipity as Wesbury provided some great research ""artillery"" on the very same day I published my report, December 11, with his report “The Fallacy of Weak Productivity.” Missing Link #2: InflationWhile I felt lucky to have this great update from Wesbury on the day of my report, I also felt incredibly fortunate to discover an article by the chief economist of Vanguard two weeks ago (November 27, 2017) which completed my economic thought process about technological productivity.Dr. Joseph H. Davis titled his piece something very simple and provocative... The Federal Reserve versus Moore’s Law.In the piece, Dr. Davis further describes how semiconductor power, efficiency, and miniaturization keep shrinking the cost -- and increasing the productivity -- of everything. Here is an excerpt...“Moore’s Law is about more than smartphones, TVs, and Amazon Prime. Its knock-on effects restrain the need for higher prices in every corner of the economy, not just in high-tech products. Prices are a markup over marginal costs, and in an increasingly digitized world, that marginal cost inches closer to zero. That’s the story told by our analysis of detailed industry data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.”Also in the video and my December report, I explain why NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) CEO Jensen Huang says we have entered a new super-charged version of Moore's Law with GPU chips that create massively parallel architecture for data processing. You can learn more in my video Get Your MPA In Deep Learning.Memory Creates the FutureMicron is an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions. Backed by nearly 40 years of technology leadership, their memory and storage solutions enable disruptive trends, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles in key market segments like cloud, data center, networking, and mobile.This description from the company website helps put their business into the context of the larger technology world...The world is moving to a new economic model, where data is driving value creation in ways we had not imagined just a few years ago. Data is today’s new business currency, and memory and storage are emerging as strategic differentiators that will redefine how we extract value from data to learn, explore, communicate and experience.My top two Semiconductor recommendations in my December Technology Super Cycle report were NVIDIA and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) to capitalize on the former's leadership of burgeoning AI industries and the latter's command of the ""picks and shovels"" to create silicon gold with high-tech wafer fabrication equipment (WFE), along with peer Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report).Lam and AMAT are highly-dependent on the cap-ex budgets of Micron, Samsung, and Intel and their demand for WFE exceeding $60 billion this year keeps these stocks attractive as both growth and value plays.So in late December, I was excited to hear Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra talk about similar themes. Here's what I wrote to my TAZR Trader members on December 20...I happened to catch the CEO of MU on Squawk Alley this morning, interviewed by the excellent Jon Fortt, and it was a clinic in not only the specifics of DRAM and NAND flash semis but also a wider commentary on my Tech Super Cycle. Here's the video link that you should watch if you consider yourself any kind of Semi investor...""We have barely seen the tip of the iceberg in Artificial Intelligence.""As long as Mehrotra and Co. keep executing at the heart of Technology and delivering superior growth, I'll keep listening to them.(end of TAZR excerpt)Micron Feeds the Mega Memory MonsterOn Monday May 21, Micron held an Investor/Analyst Day in New York where CEO Sanjay Mehrotra dropped a Godzilla-size 150-slide deck on Wall Street. Analysts will still be digesting it all this week. In fact, as I type this, Needham and Co. just raised their price target on MU shares from $76 to $100.In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the other two banks who've been competing this spring for the Street-high target on MU shares. More importantly, I explain the ""valuation"" conundrum that i-bank analysts have with a memory chip maker trading at 5 times when everyone is calling the top of the cycle.More importantly, I present several of Micron's slides from the presentation deck that sum up not only the growth prospects for MU but the wider implications for The Tech Super Cycle, including the $1.5 trillion market for “smart” cities.Finally, let me remind you about a little memory maker that I call Micron's ""lil' brother."" SMART Global Holdings (SGH  -  Free Report) is a $1 billion DRAM and NAND flash maker that serves several global markets, with a concentration in Brazil memory and mobile applications.The company is expected to deliver $1.4 billion in sales and $6.78 in EPS next fiscal year beginning September. Thus it trades much cheaper than Micron on a price-to-sales basis that make its slight P/E premium at nearly 7 times still very attractive.Speaking of Semi P/E multiples, you might want to also check out my article from last week: Do You Buy NVIDIA at This Valuation?Disclosure: I own shares of MU, NVDA, LRCX, and SGH for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

751,LRCX,"Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) dipped recently on the back of weaker-than-expected guidance after the company reported its second-quarter financial results at the end of last week. However, the chipmaking equipment power posted strong overall results, and the stock looks like a great value at the moment.Recent ResultsApplied Materials reported adjusted Q2 earnings of $1.22 per share, which not only topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents but also marked a 54% surge from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues climbed by 29% to $4.57 billion, also beating our consensus estimate.Investors reacted poorly to Applied Materials third-quarter guidance. The company now expects to post adjusted earnings in the range of $1.13 to $1.21 per share, which, at the time, came in at the low end of our Zacks estimate of $1.14 per share. The firm also called for revenues to fall between $4.33 billion and $4.53 billion, which came in line with our $4.45 billion estimate.Applied Materials’ updated Q3 guidance is not devastatingly low. And the recent stock price dip, coupled with strong overall growth projections has made AMAT stock look rather attractive.Recent Price MovementShares of Applied Materials are up roughly 11.7% over the last year, while the “Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication” industry has surged nearly 30%. Year to date, AMAT stock has dipped 1.8% against its industry’s average climb of 8.6%. Applied Materials stock closed Monday at $50.00 per share or almost 20% below its 52-week high of $62.40 per share.With that said, AMAT stock is cheap at the moment based on its price alone, and also has a long way to go before it must face the added burden of having to jump into a new range. Furthermore, if we go back farther, investors will see that Applied Materials stock is on a stellar run. Applied Materials stock has skyrocketed 243.8% over the past five years, which outpaces its industry’s climb of 205%. Investors will also see that during the last three years, AMAT stock has soared 149%, against the S&P 500’s 28% gain. Clearly, the stock has performed insanely well over the last several years, and its recent dip just makes it a bit more attractive on the value end.ValuationComing into Tuesday, AMAT stock was trading at 10.9X forward 12-months earnings estimates, which marks a major discount compared the S&P 500’s 16.9X average. Diving a bit deeper, Applied Materials has traded well below its industry’s average over the last two years. This industry includes the likes of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS  -  Free Report), and ASML Holding N.V. (ASML  -  Free Report). Applied Materials stock has traded as high as 17.4X over the past two years, with its median resting at 13.7X. The company is also currently trading almost directly in line with its two-year low, which it touched briefly last week. Over the last five years, the lowest AMAT stock has ever traded at was 10.6X forward 12-months earnings estimates—a figure it hit in late September of 2015.Therefore, looking back over the last several years, investors can say with some degree of confidence that AMAT stock is attractive at its current valuation, if not downright cheap.And a major reason that Applied Materials stock currently presents investors great value, on top of its recently declining stock price, is the company’s earnings outlook. Applied Materials is projected to see its adjusted earnings surge by nearly 35% this quarter, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by nearly 41%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

752,LRCX,"TiVo Corporation (TIVO  -  Free Report) reported dismal results for first-quarter 2018, wherein its revenues declined year over year and earnings were flat.It should be noted that TiVo Corporation was formerly known as Rovi Corporation. Upon successful completion of the acquisition of TiVo Inc. in early September 2016, Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name. Notably, the company has completed synergy actions of $100 million out of the total $110 million and the remained is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter.Quarter in DetailTiVo’s revenues decreased 7.7% year over year to $189.8 million and also missed the zacks Consensus Estimate of $193 million. The decline in the revenues was primarily pertaining to the lowering revenues from the Legacy TiVo Time Warp IP deals that slipped 62.8% from the year-ago quarter.The company’s revenues from the Licensing, services and software division dropped 2.3% year over year to $186.2 million. The division contributed 98.1% to total revenues.Hardware division’s revenues declined to $3.7 million from $15.2 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and contributed 1.9% to total revenues. Owing to the expiration of the Time Warp deal, the company is trying to transition away from analog and hardware products. This quarter was the last one in which the company recorded MSO hardware revenues as it has fulfilled the orders that were placed last year.Excluding the impact of the Time Warp deal, hardware revenues and other revenues, the company’s top line came in at $174.8 million, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter when the same items were excluded.In terms of business segments, Product revenues were up 1.6% to $116.8 million. Revenues from Platform Solutions increased 8.8% to $95.9 million. However, Software and Services declined 26.9% to $18.5 million and Other categories surged 52.9% to $2.4 million.Notably, Product revenues were up owing to the company’s shift to ASC 606 revenue standard that per management resulted in an “$18.1 million net increase in revenue from our [its] European MSO customers.”However, the company’s exit from hardware manufacturing and the absence of Comcast as a metadata customer partially offset the benefits gained from the adoption of the new accounting standard.IP Licensing revenues declined approximately 19.6% year over year to $72.9 million. Under the IP Licensing segment, revenues of the U.S. Pay TV Providers, New Media, International Pay TV Providers and Other and Consumer Electronics Manufacturers decreased 21.2% to $49.9 million, 14.7% to $14.1 million and 17.36% year over year to $8.9 million.IP Licensing revenues were negatively impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, mostly related to the Legacy TiVo Time Warp deal. Consumer Electronics manufacturing revenues declined due to expiration of license with a customer. Additionally, its new licenses with Google’s YouTube TV and Starz were offset by lower revenues from existing licenses.The company’s total cost and expenses decreased 4.8% to $130.8 million from $137.5 million incurred in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $58.9 million compared with $68.2 million registered in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP pre-tax income was $46.3 million compared with $53.9 million in the same period last year.TiVo exited the reported quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $140.3 million compared with $269.8 million at the end of the previous quarter.TiVo Corporation Revenue (TTM) TiVo Corporation Revenue (TTM) | TiVo Corporation QuoteConclusionThe company is banking on new agreements signed with companies like Vizio, Argos and Mediacom Communications and its new solution TiVo Experience 4 that was launched in the fourth quarter. It is also optimistic about its shift from hardware and other products.However, we are apprehensive about its near-term performance due to the expected expiry of the Time Warp deal, with only around $11.2 million to be recognized in the next four months. Additionally, the company expects a reduction of $30 million in revenues for fiscal 2018 due to the adoption of ASC 606. Moreover, the company’s ongoing litigation with Comcast is also a major headwind for the company. TiVo currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Lam Research Corporation ( (LRCX  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

While the industry gained 27.5%, CACI outperformed with a return of 28.6% during the same time frame.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a market cap of $3.95 billion, it looks like a stock that investors need to add to their portfolio if they are looking to reap gains going ahead.Let’s take a look at some of the factors aiding the company’s performance.CACI International is gaining from its alliance with the Department of Defense (DoD) and exposure to expanding DoD and Department of Homeland Security budgets are key growth catalysts for CACI International.

756,LRCX,"Shares of Advanced Energy Industries Inc. (AEIS  -  Free Report) have gained almost 9.7% over the past two weeks. However, looking at a longer period, the stock has declined 1.6% year to date versus the Zacks Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication industry’s rally of 13%.  Can the stock keep the recent price momentum alive and catch up to the industry rally soon?There is actually no major fundamental headwind that could stop the stock from moving higher. In fact, the potential benefits from rising demand in the semiconductor end-market might help the stock gain traction.Moreover, Advanced Energy’s prudent capital deployment, which includes strategic buyouts and share repurchases ($70 million remaining under the current program as of Dec 31, 2017), should keep supporting its bottom-line. Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus  Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus | Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Quote The only factor that could affect Advanced Energy’s growth profile is its customer concentration. Two large Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) — Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) — accounted for 33.5% and 23.1% of 2017 sales, respectively.However, this is a risk to its business model and unlikely to have any bearing on the forces that could drive the stock higher in the near term. After all, these two customers don’t appear to have any tangible issues with Advanced Energy’s services so far.Positive Growth ProjectionsInterestingly, estimates for the company’s current quarter and current year earnings have moved higher over the past three months, depicting analysts’ optimism over its earnings growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its full-year 2018 earnings of $5.21 per share represents a year-over-year increase of 9.2%. For the next quarterly report, the company’s earnings is expected to grow 26.9% over the year-ago quarter to $1.32 per share.The earnings growth is expected to come on the back of solid sales. The consensus sales expectations for the first quarter and full year 2018 are $187.7 million and $741.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 25.7% and 10.6%, respectively.        Continuing Semi-Demand to Drive Top LineAdvanced Energy is a leading supplier of power subsystems to the semiconductor end-market. Management now targets sales of $1 billion, which it expects to reach over the next three-years, driven by continuing organic growth as well as solid contributions from acquisitions ($150-$200 million over the same time frame).The demand for Advanced Energy’s solutions is being driven by increasing investments in complex 3D NAND devices, DRAM and logic. Notably, Semiconductor Capital Equipment sales (68.8% of total sales) surged 41.5% to $461.7 million in 2017. The company commenced shipping of its next generation solid-state match during the fourth quarter.Moreover, Advanced Energy’s top-line is expected to benefit from improving dollar content per stack, as NAND manufacturers focuses on adding more layers. The additional layers are also driving demand for the company’s power control modules. Also, continuing adoption of the company’s plasma-based processes is expected to drive segment growth.Non-Semi Business Grows on International Customer Win It is also encouraging to note that Advanced Energy’s non-semi business outperformed management expectations in 2017.Industrial Capital Equipment sales (17.4% of total sales) soared almost 39% year over year to $117 million. The acquisition of Excelsys (completed in July 2017) expanded the company’s product offerings in specialty power business and market share.Moreover, Global Support (13.8% of total sales) increased 26.3% to $92.4 million. The company’s strategy of offering engineered service products drove this growth.Increasing international customer base and new design win present significant growth opportunity for Advanced Energy’s non-semi business. During fourth-quarter 2017, Advanced Energy won solar manufacturing contract in China and lithium ion battery manufacturing design order in Korea.Advanced Energy is rapidly penetrating into the flat panel display market in China, as demand for OLED enabled mobile devices has been increasing significantly. The company’s Ascent product has also gained significant traction in the glass coating market.Valuation Indicates Plenty of UpsideAdvanced Energy currently trades at 13.89X its 2018 EPS estimate, lower than the industry average of 16.67X. Over the past year, the stock’s forward P/E ratio has been as high as 23.07 and as low as 12.66, with a median of 17.76. So it appears that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead for the stock.Currently, Advanced Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

757,LRCX,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

758,LRCX,"With the start of May, investors have turned cautious given the long history of weak performance during the summer months (May to October) per the old adage “Sell in May and Go Away.” Amid such a scenario, honing in on the dividend growth strategy seems to the best practice. This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation irrespective of market conditions.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Texas-based Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) is a vertically integrated international manufacturer and supplier of petrochemicals, polymers and fabricated products. It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 13 cents for this year over the past one month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 55.76%.

760,LRCX,"U.S. tech companies can finally breathe easy, at least for the time being. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said that the U.S.-China trade conflict has been put on hold. This certainly is good news for U.S. tech companies, particularly chipmakers, which have been reeling under pressure since the two countries sparked fears of a trade war by imposing tariffs and counter tariffs on imports from the two countries.U.S. tech companies generate an estimated more than $100 billion in revenues from China annually. Understandably, the tech sector stands to suffer the most, as the trade war has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights. However, both countries are now initiating talks and making efforts to pull back from an undesired trade war. Given this scenario U.S. chipmakers stand to gain the most. So, it makes good sense to invest in semiconductor stocks.Sigh of Relief for Tech Companies  President Donald Trump in late March announced that the United States would be imposing tariffs on Chinese imports worth $150 billion for alleged violation of intellectual property rights. Consequently, China too announced retaliatory tariffs. However, both countries since then have cooled down on their stance and are now negotiating to avoid a much-feared trade war. On May 20, Mnuchin said, “We are putting the trade war on hold.”This certainly will bring a sigh of relief for U.S. tech companies, as tech companies stand to suffer the most if trade war takes place. U.S. tech companies generate an estimated $100-$150 billion in revenues annually from China, with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) alone generating $105.5 billion from China. Other companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Qualcomm, Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) too make a significant portion of their revenues from China.U.S. tech companies have been reeling under fears of a trade war for quite some time now, which saw their shares taking a hit. However, now that both the United States and China are working on a possible solution to avoid a trade war, it definitely will boost the morale of tech companies.Biggest Gainers if Trade War is AvertedTech companies undoubtedly will be one of the biggest gainers if a trade war is avoided. From large caps to medium and small caps, a number of U.S. tech companies have operations in China. Naturally, companies who have their assembly plants in China stand to gain the most if the trade negotiations fall into place.Also, the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to Chinese company ZTE for seven years, accusing it of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran.While this made the company announce that it was ceasing operations, the ban can also have an adverse affect on American chipmakers, as an export ban would definitely hurt the revenues of U.S. chipmakers. However, with Trump tweeting on Sunday that he is working with Chinese president Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business, U.S. chipmakers have ample reasons to party.Our ChoicesIt goes without saying that after suffering over the last couple of months as a result of huge selloffs owing to fears of a trade war, U.S. chip stocks will stand to gain from a mutual agreement between Trump and Xi Jinping. While we wait for an amicable solution through negotiations, let’sadd tech stocks for quick gains.Now, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is the worldwide leader in graphics processors and media communications devices.

761,LRCX,"In value analysis, though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are most preferred by investors, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value.What is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:PCM, Inc.

762,LRCX,"By their very nature, growth investors are primarily focused on finding companies whose earnings and revenue are expected grow at a rate that outpaces the market.

Also, the Communications and Data Center market is likely to be up in the upcoming quarter, driven by 100G optical products for high-speed rack to rack connectivity.However, Consumer revenues are expected to decrease in the quarter ending June, due to significantly lower unit shipments of flagship smartphone products, partially offset by growth in tablets and wearables.Maxim’s automotive business has been growing lately.

764,LRCX,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled to be released on May 1, are likely to be hurt by dwindling iPhone demand.However, the company’s expanding ecosystem and diversified product portfolio that include offerings like Apple Pay, Apple Watch, Apple Music and Apple TV are expected to lend solid support this quarter as well.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q2 performance is likely to be.Robust Performance of WearablesEvidently, in the last reported quarter, Apple’s Other Product segment, which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats headphones, iPod touch and other accessories, witnessed a 36% increase year over year, the highest among all its segments.

765,LRCX,"On Apr 28, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the first advanced estimate of the first-quarter 2018 U.S. GDP growth rate. While the U.S. economy fared better than the first-quarter consensus, the growth rate was significantly lower than the last nine months of 2017. Lackluster consumer spending, which constitutes nearly 70% of the U.S, GDP, was the primary reason for slowdown in first-quarter 2018 GDP.Considering recent history, U.S. GDP growth rate remains weakest in the first quarter of any year. Despite weak GDP growth, personal disposable income and private domestic investment have increased significantly in the first quarter. Moreover, full effect of massive reduction on both personal and corporate tax rate are yet to be derived as people received those benefits only in January.The above mentioned positives are likely to push the U.S. economy on a strong growth trajectory in the second quarter and there on. At this stage, investing in good value stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks is a lucrative option.First-Quarter GDP DeclinesPer the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. GDP expanded at 2.3% in first-quarter 2018, better-than the consensus estimate of 2%. However, this rate of growth is significantly lower than the average GDP growth rate of 2.9% in the last three quarters of 2017 and well below President Trump’s targeted GDP growth rate of 3%.Personal consumer spending grew at 1.1% in first-quarter 2018. This was the slowest pace of growth experienced in nearly five years and significantly below the fourth-quarter 2017 pace of 4%.Moreover, business spending on equipment slowed to 4.7% following double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. Further, investments in homebuilding have declined in the first quarter after rebounding in the fourth quarter of 2017. Government spending has also dipped after witnessing growth in the last two straight quarters.Economy Likely to Bounce Back in Q2The first quarter GDP estimate generally remains weak due to seasonality. First-quarter U.S. GDP tends to be soft because of a seasonal quirk. Consequently, the BEA’s tepid first-quarter growth outlook may not be a true reflection of the U.S. economy.The full benefit of massive personal and corporate tax cut is yet to be realized. The $1.5 trillion tax cut measures is yet to be reflected as it has implemented only in January 2018.Moreover, U.S. private-sector workers experienced their highest increase in income in 11 years during the first three months of 2018. The latest Labor Department data revealed that employment cost index for wages and salaries in the private sector rose 1% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Notably, this was the biggest gain since the first quarter of 2007.Meanwhile, disposable personal income has increased 6.2% in the first quarter compared with 3.8% in the previous quarter. More wealth, in the hands of consumers will likely bolster personal spending going forward.Our Top Picks The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong despite a slowdown in the GDP growth rate.

771,LRCX,"Investors in search of great value opportunities in the semiconductor industry might look no further than Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT’s size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 50% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company’s improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT’s full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock’s recent surge, AMAT’s positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What’s more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here’s Applied’s Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group: AMAT’s peer group includes ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS  -  Free Report). Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT’s P/S of 4.1 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now—about 40% less than its industry’s average.Still, the foundation of AMAT’s is only getting stronger right now, and the stock’s Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Want more market analysis from this author?

Favorable foreign currency exchange also impacted revenues by $6.3 million.During the quarter, replacement unit shipments in the United States and Canada increased 23% on a year-over-year basis to 4,421 units, driven by high adoption of the TwinStar J43 and Pro Wave cabinets.

Average Selling Price (ASP) increased nearly 3.6% year over year to $16,858 in the reported quarter.The year-over-year growth in Gaming Systems revenues was driven by increased system installation in casinos based in Alberta as well as a rise in hardware sales backed by shipment of new iVIEW4 player-interface display units.However, Table Products suffered from a decline in new shufflers sales and other table game products. In the last year, international sales due to opening of new casinos mainly in Asia had driven results.

Revenues from Instant Games, Services and Product sales increased 7.5%, 3.3% and 31.8% from the year-ago quarter, respectively.

773,LRCX,"At Mobile World Congress (“MWC”) and Embedded World, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) unveiled two new NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSDs namely Western Digital PC SN720 and Western Digital PC SN520. This addresses the need of storage system that enables the fast data applications and new technologies.Western Digital PC SN720 3D NAND will be available in 256GB, 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities on a single-sided M.2 2280 form factor. Western Digital PC SN520A with NVMe performance will be available in 128GB, 256GB and 512GB capacities on single-sided M.2 2280, M.2 2242, or M.2 2230 form factors. It is an exceptionally fast and cost-effective addition to the Western Digital 3D NAND portfolio, consequently providing adequate storage.According to the press release, manufacturers of IoT devices, computing devices and monitoring systems will benefit greatly from these two new products. The new products will enable the capture and transformation of the massive quantities of data in real-time at the edge of smart city, smart home and personal data environments.With such launches, we expect Western Digital to strengthen its market position against the likes of Seagate Technology.According to Cisco GCI estimates, the machine, people and other things will require about 850 zettabytes (ZB) of storage by 2021. The growing demand requires a new storage standard and easy accessibility. We believe that the latest Western Digital’s NVMe client architecture and product portfolio will benefit from pent up demand in the storage market.With the increasing use of 5G, fast data applications, VR, 4K video editing etc, comes the demand for power efficient high capacity performance storage solutions. Western Digital NVMe 3D NAND SSDs cater to this need and promises enhanced user experience.These product additions will enhance the company’s existing product portfolio.It will also aid Western Digital in getting a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which per latest data by TechNavio is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.In a separate press release Western Digital also unveiled the world’s fastest UHS-I microSD card and PCIe-enabled flash memory card technology, the 400GB SanDisk Extreme UHS-I micro SDXC card at MWC. It will enable users to better capture, preserve, access, share, transform and enjoy their personal content.It offers up to 160MB/sec sequential read and write speeds, which is more than 50% faster than its previous SanDisk Extreme UHS-I microSD cards. With A2 specification, this storage device is expected to enhance overall drive capacity, reliability and performance.The company has also expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (“NAS”) hard drives.

The acquisition expands the company’s gaming portfolio by adding table games namely Super Fun 21 and Bet the Bust as well as strengthen its foothold in the international market with Tech Art’s MAXTime 4H.In the same month, the company also acquired Canada-based NYX Gaming Group (NYX) that will enable it to broaden its product pipeline in digital gaming and online lottery markets. NYX’s sport betting platform OpenBet Sportsbook will further position it well for the online gambling market.In July 2017, the company announced the acquisition of Bristol, UK-based Red7Mobile Ltd., which provided Scientific Games with access to a large portfolio of mobile and interactive game titles, including slot games, instant win/scratch cards, and table games.The company’s buyout of DEQ Systems in January last year is also driving results.

777,LRCX,"Year 2018 so far has been marked by increased government borrowing costs. This is especially true as growing inflationary pressure is building up the case for aggressive rate hikes, pushing yields higher. According to CME, there is 51% chance of four interest rates hike this year.The 10-year Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, jumped to a 7-year high of 3.12%. The latest spike came on the heels of higher oil price, which is back to $80 per barrel level, and upbeat April retail sales. Worries about growing supply of government debt are also causing the spike in yields (read: ETF Strategies to Play the 7-Year High Benchmark Yield).Pros and ConsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology, industrials and consumer discretionary. Banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. If interest rates rise, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Also, insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds.Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which in turn leads to greater consumer power. An improving economy coupled with higher consumer confidence is making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields. The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace, leading to increased IT spending (read: 5 Niche Tech ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs).Although higher rates would attract more capital to the country, boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies, it would have a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit, given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates. Additionally, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom would also be impacted by higher rates.Further, higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.Given this, we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from the sectors that will benefit from higher rates and the ones that will be badly impacted.Sectors to WinFinancialsThe ultra-popular Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report), with AUM of $32.9 billion and average daily volume of 61.6 million shares, offers broad exposure to the sector with banks making up for 44.9% of the portfolio.

779,LRCX,"Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 17. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.6%.The surprise history has been impressive in Lam’s case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 9.16%.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in the recent times, increasing 64.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 50.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLam Research has a high exposure to the memory segment that is likely to witness strong growth in the coming quarters. The strength is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT.In the fiscal second quarter, total system shipments were $2.63 billion, up 11% year over year and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. For the to-be-reported quarter, management expects shipments to be around $3.175 billion (+/- $125 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.18 billion.The company is doing well and expects to succeed in areas such as device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections.The company also continues to witness increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies. All these factors could positively impact the top-line figure of the company.For the quarter to be reported, the company expects revenues of approximately $2.850 billion (+/- $125 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.85 billion.However, volatility in the PC market remains a major concern. Weakness in the PCs could offset the expansion in the 3D NAND, impacting upcoming results.Also, the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.35 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.36. Hence, the difference is -0.15%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lam has a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with -0.15% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lam Research Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Netflix, Inc.

780,LRCX,"“The trend is your friend” is an age old saying that most momentum investors live by. The main concerns in momentum investing are simple: when will the trend end if a stock is going strong, and when will it start for an up-and-coming stock. Today we’ll look into LAM Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) to see if we can find a solution for this particular company.LAM Research is a leading semiconductor company based in Fremont, California. Known for its wafer fabrication equipment and services, the company has been a strong stock for the past five years and on. It currently holds a “B” grade in Value, a “C” grade in Growth, and an “A” grade in Momentum. This earns LAM Research a “B” overall VGM grade in our Styles Score System.LAM Research has been holding strong in the Style Scores, but the key factor is its “A” grade in the Momentum category. Let’s take a look at what the stock has done to deserve this mark.A Closer LookLAM Research’s stock price has been on the up-and-up for a considerably long span of time, and all signs point to more of this. Five years ago, its stock was at $41.81 per share. A 461% increase in price over that span has shown just how strong the momentum of this stock has been over this longer period of time.This past year alone, stock prices increased 90% from $120.60 to $228.65 per share, marking the highest it’s been since the company went public.There have been several concerns in regards to recent drops in the stock, but LAM Research always seems to bounce back. In November of last year, shares were priced at $218.91, and dropped to $184.23 by early December, only to return to $215.07 by mid-January of this year. Following this high, the stock plummeted to $162.23 in a matter of weeks, again only to return to its peak price of $228.56 in early March.These fluctuations may scare some investors, but considering that LAM Research has repeatedly stabilized, even exceeding its highest price after these drops, helps to prove that its shares are stable. Couple this with the fact that the tech industry as a whole has been in a slump over the past few weeks, and it is quite impressive the company has been able to do what it is doing.Cash Flow/ Share can also be a strong indicator of stock prices. LAM Research yields $13.19 in cash per share, almost twice its industry average of $6.33/share. This sheds a positive light on the state of the business as is, and in the time to come.For those momentum investors who prefer to ride a trend into the long run, LAM Research’s EPS Growth for the next three to five years is expected to reach an annualized rate of 17.9%, meaning investors can feel secure knowing that any short- term drops might be overridden in the long run.  Another great bonus to consider is that, despite its amazing statistics and domination over its competitors in the industry in a number of categories, LAM Research’s P/E of 11.6 is still under the industry average of 12.3. Growth investors will usually pay a high price for investments like these, but for LAM Research there is no need.Bottom LineLAM Research holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It trades for a fair price relative to the industry and has numbers to support its stability. Its stock price increase, cash flow per share, and expected EPS Growth for the next three to five years suggest its share price will continue to rise. LAM Research appears to be a solid momentum option for both the short and long run investor.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

781,LRCX,"Shares of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) sunk on Thursday as markets rebounded. But with the current overall turmoil, investors should focus more on the company’s quarterly earnings outlook than Lam’s recently fluctuating stock price.  Despite Lam’s recent downturn, shares are up nearly 58% over the last year. The wafer fabrication equipment company has consistently impressed investors with its ability to post solid earnings and strong sales.Going forward, Lam’s products, which are essential to the semiconductor industry, will likely become even more valuable in the rapidly growing information age. In fact, CEO Martin Anstice said at a recent conference that “the fundamental future of Lam Research is inextricably linked to the rising importance of a data economy.”With that said, let’s look to see if the Fremont, California-based firm will benefit from the proliferation of connected devices in its soon-to-be-reported quarter.Latest Outlook Lam’s quarterly revenues are expected to surge by 32.4% to reach 2.85 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company is projected to see its quarterly earnings soar by 55.7% to hit $4.36 per share.However, within the last 60 days, there has been zero earnings estimate revision activity for Lam’s upcoming quarter.ValuationLRCX’s Forward P/E of 12.2 currently marks a substantial discount to the “Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication” industry average, which is trading at 15.9x forward earnings at the moment. Lam’s present valuation also marks a discount compared to the median Forward P/E of 13.8 it traded at over the last year.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of LRCX’s upcoming financial report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.Lam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lam Research Corporation QuoteWe can see that Lam has posted strong results when it comes to topping earnings estimates over the last few of years. Investors should note that these earnings surprises don’t always lead to strong stock price momentum in the immediate aftermath of a report.In fact, last quarter, shares of Lam plummeted after posting a 17.6% earnings surprise.Bottom LinePast performance is no indication of future success, and projecting becomes increasingly hard in a volatile market. With that said, it is worth remembering that both Lam’s top and bottom lines are expected to surge this quarter. Furthermore, Lam is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Lam is scheduled to report its March quarter 2018 financial results after market close on Tuesday, April 17.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

782,LRCX,"The first quarter of 2018 was a bumpy ride for the technology sector, thanks to the slew of bad news, which includes the Russian hacking of computers at the 2018 Olympics, data misuse scandal at Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and the first casualty by a driverless car. This has come as a massive blow to the share prices of tech heavyweights, including Facebook, Apple and Alphabet, dragging the entire sector down.However, in the technology sector, semiconductors remained the most stable industry. During first-quarter 2018, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) gained 6.1% as against the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK  -  Free Report) return of just 2.3%.The semiconductor industry has been benefiting from the rising demand for chips used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Higher demand for chips, sensors, RFID, etc has been driving the top-line growth of various well known semiconductor companies. This, in turn, is boosting investors’ confidence as reflected in the companies’ share-price movement.Additionally, the U.S. chip-equipment makers’ earnings and cash flow are likely to get further boost from Trump’s business-friendly tax-cut policies. The tax reform will make semiconductors repatriate significant amount of cash held abroad and eventually drive after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities.Therefore, it is wise for investors to have some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio which have potentials to provide better returns in highly volatile situations.Micron: One of the Best ChoicesMicron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) turned out to be one of the best performers in the semiconductor industry in the first quarter of 2018. The company’s shares have appreciated nearly 26.8% during the period, a much better performance than the iShares PHLX Semiconductor and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETFs.The outperformance can be primarily attributed to Micron’s robust revenue and earnings growth, as well as expanding margins. We note that the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8% in the trailing four quarters.We believe the company will continue its stellar growth performance in the quarters ahead. The optimism surrounding the stock comes from the fact that the DRAM market is still witnessing a huge demand-supply gap which is escalating prices.It should also be noted that as Micron generates nearly 70% of its revenues by selling DRAM products,the company is the biggest beneficiary of this supply shortage. In the last reported quarter, sales from DRAM products witnessed a whopping 76% year-over-year increase.Micron, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has also witnessed significant earnings estimate revision in the last 30 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 4% (11 cents) to $2.84 per share during the same period.3 Other Stocks in FocusApart from Micron, there are few other semiconductor stocks that have the potential to outperform in the current quarter. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), and have witnessed significant estimate revisions.Another semiconductor stock which is in our list of favorites is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report). Although recent developments like suspension of test drives for all its driverless vehicles and a likely sluggish demand from cryptocurrency miners has dented stock price, we believe they have least impact on the company’s financial performance.Although tests have been suspended, vehicle makers will continue to invest in making driverless cars safer. This keeps the demand for NVIDIA’s chips unaffected. Moreover, sales generated from cryptocurrency miners contribute a meager part to the company’s overall revenues, therefore any slowdown in demand will have no material impact.Furthermore, last month Uber’s driverless vehicle test incident has once again pressed the need for safer technologies, which NVIDIA is capable of offering. The company recently unveiled the Constellation driving simulator which enables companies to test self-driving systems in a virtual environment.Although NVIDIA doesn’t expect the new simulator to fully replace real-world testing of self-driving cars, the number of trials will likely come down, significantly. We believe the latest simulator will enhance NVIDIA’s competitive position in the self-driving car market space, particularly against chip makers, like Intel and Advance Micro Devices.NVIDIA flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 and has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 40.8%. The company has witnessed sharp upward estimate revision in the past 60 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 51.5% (51 cents) to $1.50 per share during the same time frame. The stock rallied 19.7% in the first quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The next stock in our radar is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). Applied Materials’ market share has gained significantly with its strength in 3D NAND and DRAM. Management expects increasing DRAM and logic spending in 2018. The prevailing demand-supply gap for DRAM will continue to benefit the company throughout this year.This Zacks #2 Ranked company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.8%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 13% (13 cents) to $1.13 per share during the same time frame. The stock has gained 8.8% in the first quarter.Our next pick is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). The company is anticipated to benefit from the improving WFE market, elevated demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology in the near future. This is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities, and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.The company, which carries a Zacks Rank of 2, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.2%. The stock has ascended 10.3% in the first quarter.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

784,LRCX,"Tech has hit a purple patch, largely backed by Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Apple’s shares recorded the biggest weekly gain in six-and-a-half years and also the highest five-day price gain in its history on May 4 after Warren Buffett’s company loaded up on the iPhone maker.Given the tech rally sparked by Buffett’s purchase of Apple shares, investing in sound tech companies seems judicious. Also, tech companies are well positioned to register double-digit growth this earnings season which makes it a great bargain.Apple Ends at a Record After Buffett Raises StakeWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) bought 75 million shares of Apple in the first quarter. This was in addition to the 165.3 million Apple shares that Berkshire owned at the end of last year. The recent buyout puts Apple among Berkshire’s largest holding, surpassing its stake in Wells Fargo.Buffett told CNBC that “Apple is an unbelievable company” and he thinksthat “it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States.” He added, “over the last year we’ve bought more Apple than anything else.”Apple had reported net income of $13.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, up from $11 billion a year ago. Chief Executive Tim Cook further added that revenues in all four geographical regions have improved, with more than 20% growth in Greater China and Japan.The Cupertino-based tech giant’s shares popped 3.9% following Buffett’s bet on Apple, bringing its week-to-date advance to 13.3%, the biggest five-day percentage gain since October 2011. Such stellar gains have helped the iPhone maker outperform the Computer - Mini computers industry so far this year (+8.6% vs +8.4%). Apple Powers Tech Gains Buffett’s stake raise in the iPhone maker lent momentum to tech stocks. In fact, the bellwether tech name led the broader tech rally. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) jumped 1.9% on May 4, the highest among all the S&P 500 sectors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished in the positive territory for the week, up 1.3%.The recent tax cut has already given the much needed windfall to tech earnings, while cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data remain growth areas. Tech earnings in the first quarter, largely, continue to be stronger than expected, with total earnings till now up 29.6% from the same period last year on 12% higher revenues. Notably, 90.9% has beat EPS estimates and 93.2% revenue estimates (read more: Is the Earnings Picture Really That Strong?).Tech is Having a Great Earnings SeasonAnd if you look at the tech behemoths, they have put up a spectacular show. Facebook made more ad money from each customer despite the uproar over its user data fiasco. The company posted first-quarter profits of $4.99 billion that topped analysts’ estimate of $4.01 billion, while the social media giant added 70 million users in the same period despite numerous public calls against the social media app.Microsoft’s quarterly sales got a push from its cloud computing and related cloud software. The Redmond-based company posted revenues of $26.82 billion and earnings of 95 cents per share, both of which have topped the consensus estimate.Netflix subscriber growth, in the meanwhile, breezed past estimates and Google somehow managed to stay afloat — thanks to a change in accounting policy. But, it’s the e-commerce giant Amazon that smashed earnings by increasing the value of its Prime membership (read more: FAAMNG Stocks Pack a Punch in Q1 Earnings).5 Top PicksGiven the aforesaid bullishness, investors should double down on the hottest tech stocks.

787,LRCX,"Out of the February correction lows, the strongest charts were in the Nasdaq 100 (NDX), with stocks like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) leading the charge to new highs.In the video that accompanies this article, I show charts of the NDX and the Philly Semiconductor Index (SOX) to point out their bullish structure with higher highs and higher lows. Even trade war fears couldn’t put a lasting dent in semis like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) in March.But the SOX recently gave up its higher low and the overall market looks weak as we head into the heart of earnings season. To wit, the strong quarterly results of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) did little to improve the technical picture for the Industrial sector, whose chart looks like it’s ready to break down below its 200-day moving average.Does Peak Growth Spell the End of the Bull Market?In an April 13 article, I described the dilemma that professional investors find themselves in with tariff uncertainty and the possibility that extraordinary earnings growth could soon be seen only in the rearview mirror.That article, Growth Peak on the Horizon, showed how Technology earnings have led the market higher, but that soon the “comps” were going to get much tougher. I also created some charts on “FRED,” the Federal Reserve Economic Database website, to show how quiet and steady GDP has been – and why that “Plow Horse” pace and slope is a good thing.I update those earnings graphs in the video above and describe why I think that good buying opportunities are coming up as more charts break down and create a new capitulation sell-off by more worried – and just plain exhausted – bulls.Thou Shall Not Pass 2400I don’t know if the correction lows near S&P 2550 get taken out, but I would be a buyer looking to scale-in before then and anywhere below 2500. That’s because, as I’ve been telling my followers since February, my technical work tells me S&P 2400 should hold.That view is based on 2487 being the 50% retracement from the summer 2016 breakout above 2100 to the highs at 2873. And 2394 would be the 62% retracement.My focus on 2400 is also based on some fundamental math that likes the valuation when $155 in S&P EPS are trading for 15.5 times. Even though I’ve held these views all year, I still look at the data and crunch the numbers every week to make sure they add up. Here was my update last week…Has the Stock Market Topped Already?In the video that accompanies this article, I also share an important truth of technical analysis about drawing straight lines on price charts. It can save you a lot of time and money if you can see the “naked emperor” (or sacred cow, if you prefer) that most are blind to.

790,LRCX,"The global technology sector was under pressure in the last one month. A spate of threats emanating from Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data breaches and consequent concerns over stringent regulations over the social media space, a massacre with Nvidia’s self-driving car tests and an acute selloff in Netflix on overvaluation thrashed the space.If these weren’t enough, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security barred American companies from selling to ZTE for seven years as the Chinese company had allegedly “broken a settlement agreement with repeated false statements” and has been involved in exporting telecom equipment to Iran and North Korea (read: Short-Term Pressure Ahead for China Tech ETFs?).Then,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSM  -  Free Report) dealt a blow to the tech industry on Apr 19 after the company reported Q1 results before market open and pointed at a decline in smartphone demand. The company’s revenue forecast target for the second quarter came in the range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, falling shy of the analysts’ expectation of $8.8 billion. International Monetary Fund (IMF) too said that the smartphone-driven tech cycle probably topped in late 2015.The saturation in demand in developed markets and lengthening of upgrade cycles are weighing on the overall smartphone sales. Year over year, Apple logged a decline (5%) in iPhone sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Samsung saw a unit decline of 3.6%. SinceTSMC is big supplier of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), order cuts from the current Apple iPhone X processor took a hit to the iPhone maker too. Also, Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year (read: Should You Buy the Dip in Chip ETFs Ahead of Q1 Earnings?).All these have led Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK  -  Free Report) to lose about 1.1% in the last one month (as of Apr 23, 2018). Most tech ETFs were in the red in the last one month and generated muted returns.ETFs That Were in the GreenAgainst this backdrop, we would like to highlight that there are a few technology ETFs that have stayed steady during this timeframe.ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK  -  Free Report) – Up 5.4%The underlying Prime Cyber Defense Index applies a rules-based investment methodology to pick companies actively involved in the cyber security industry..First Trust NASDAQ CEA Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR  -  Free Report) – Up 3.8%The underlying Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index tracks the performance of companies engaged in the cybersecurity segment of the technology and industrials sectors (read: Forget Tech Woes: Buy These Cybersecurity Stocks & ETFs).SPDR Kensho Future Security ETF (XKFS  -  Free Report) – Up 3.4%The fund looks to track companies whose products and services are driving innovation behind future security which includes the areas of cyber security, advanced border security, and the following areas for military application: robotics, drones and drone technologies, space technology, wearable technologies and virtual or augmented reality activities.iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Technology ETF (TCHF  -  Free Report) – Up 3.3%The fund picks stocks on the basis of a few factors. Those are: inexpensive stocks, financially healthy firms, trending stocks and relatively smaller companies.SPDR S&P Technology Hardware ETF (XTH  -  Free Report) – Up 2.9%The fund gives exposure to the technology hardware segment of the S&P Total Market Index.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

794,LRCX,"Even in times of global uncertainty and market volatility, an increasing number of investors flock the equity markets to invest their hard-earned money. There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks.Among them, price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks which have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.What is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:US Foods Holding Corp.

798,LRCX,"Twilio Inc. (TWLO  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of “$475 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes.” The notes are slated to mature in 2023. The notes will be privately offered to institutional buyers qualifying under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.Notably, the size of the offering was extended from the previous offering of $435 million. The company is looking to grant preliminary buyers the privilege of buying another $75 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes within a period of 13 days (from and including) of the date of first issuance of the notes.Subject to customary closing conditions, the sale of these notes to initial buyers is expected to be completed on May 17, 2018, leaving the company with approximate net proceeds of $463.3 million.These notes, once placed, will be an unsecured senior liability of Twilio, interest for which will be paid in arrears semi-annually at a rate of 0.25% per year. The notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 14.1040 shares of the company’s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes.Additionally, the company made capped call transactions with a few of the initial purchasers, which are expected to aid in the reduction of potential dilution of Class A common stock pertaining to conversion of the notes. These are also anticipated to offset the cash payments that the company might have to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, if need be.We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth. Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. It should be noted that at the end of first-quarter 2018, Twilio had cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $308 million, up from $290.9 million reported at the end of the previous quarter    Share Price MovementTwilio stock has gained 116.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 25.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderTwilio currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some top-ranked stocks in the same sector include Twitter, Inc.

799,LRCX,"The equity markets continued to breathe easy as the U.S.-China trade concerns abated with President Trump pledging support for the beleaguered Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, and the Qualcomm-NXP merger review process getting a roll-on with urgency from the top administration of China. Although apprehensions related to the U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear deal remained a subtle threat, overall markets appeared to be headed for a smooth sail.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm.

801,LRCX,"While there are a host of valuation metrics at one’s disposal, the first to cross one’s mind is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, in case of loss-making companies, the P/E ratio is negative. In such a scenario, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio could indicate the hidden strength in the business.The price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.What is Book Value?To begin with, it is important to understand what book value is. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), a leading global automotive company, has a projected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 8.4%.

802,LRCX,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) has performed well last year. The stock has returned 28.2% during the said time frame, outperforming the industry’s rally of 23.4%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 22% and a market cap of $2.7 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.The company’s Software as a Service (SaaS) based human capital management (HCM) services have aided top-line growth. The company’s revenues came in at $86 million, reflecting an increase of 25% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.We also remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology as the adoption of SaaS HCM solutions is increasing among corporations driven by its ability to minimize data integrity issues.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company enriched its portfolio with two additions namely, Compensation Management and Surveys. While Compensation Management is aimed at improving the process of rewarding employees, Surveys will assist in increasing organizational communication for gaining employee feedback.According to Gartner, the global SaaS market is expected to increase at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (2016–2020) of 18.4%. With its SaaS-based applications, we think that Paylocity is well poised to grab the growth opportunity in the market.Also, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, specializing in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, is a major tailwind for the company.Additionally, the company’s recently announced acquisition of BeneFLEX HR Resources – a privately held employee benefit agency has enriched the company’s product suite with a host of benefit administration related solutions. This inorganic addition is also expected to be a top-line driver going ahead.On the last earnings call, Paylocity management stated that though the company’s R&D expenditure has increased but so has the adoption and usage rate of its platform. Notably, during the quarter, Paylocity had over a million users in a single month and this marked a new record for the company.All these justify the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s retention in investors’ portfolio.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). While Western Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Micron and Lam Research carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term EPS growth rate for Western Digital, Micron and Lam Research is projected to be 19%, 10% and 17.7%, respectively.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

803,LRCX,"Markets are suffering and the tech sector is at the helm of the carnage with share prices of all major players taking a beating. Needless to say, tech stocks have seen a sharp decline since the beginning of last week with Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) leading the rout after it was accused of a data breach.However, Monday saw tech stocks slightly rebounding but the sector nosedived again on Tuesday with most major companies closing in the red. Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) plunged, indicating that volatility in the market may continue for some time. Strategists believe that tech stocks, which have been driving the markets’ bull run for quite some time, are witnessing a rotation that was possibly long overdue.Market volatility has heightened because of changes in government policies that have heightened investor concerns, leading to selloffs. However, the fundamentals which powered the ascent of tech stocks remain firmly in place. This is why it makes good sense to buy sector plays on the dip ahead of their next rebound.Facebook Rattles the Tech SectorFacebook’s data misuse scandal has taken the shape of a global controversy with the company having erased market capitalization by $100 billion in just a week. Shares of the social media giant lost4.9% once again on Tuesday, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its price target on the stock for the second time in five days.Further, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he might have to give a testimony about Facebook’s data-use standards. Although Zuckerberg is going all out to salvage the fast-eroding image of his company, which includes an apology in the form of full-page ads in 10 newspapers in the United States and the U.K., it perhaps came a bit too late.Naturally, the Facebook fiasco is taking its toll on other tech and Internet companies, with the entire sector suffering on fears of a regulatory clampdown on major players. Naturally, this has instigated panic among investors.NVIDIA, Tesla, Microsoft, Apple Take a Beating The Nasdaq declined 2.9% on Tuesday, with shares of NVIDIA suffering a stiff reverse. Shares of the chipmaker declined 7.8% on reports that it is suspending all its self-driving tests. This decision comes after Uber’s driverless car struck down a pedestrian in Arizonalast week. The incident has raised questions on the credibility and future of autonomous vehicles.Meanwhile, shares of Tesla declined 8.2% following news that the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board was carrying out a field investigation into a fatal crash involving a Tesla vehicle, last week, in California. Further, shares of Microsoft and Apple slid 4.6% and 2.6%, respectively. However, there are quite a few other reasons behind this erratic market behavior.Analysts believe that markets do not handle transitions well and are juggling several changes right now. Markets are still adjusting to Fed Chairman Powell at a time when policy is tightening with rate hikes. At the same time, the country is moving toward a protectionist trade policy with President Donald Trump first firm on imposing heavy-duty tariffs on imports from China and then having a more relaxed stance with waivers on the table to stave off a trade war. Naturally, these developments have given rise to volatility and tech stocks are suffering.Our ChoiceGiven the bad phase for the tech stocks amid market volatility, Facebook scandal, the Fed’s recent rate hike and looming fears of a trade war between the United States and China, investor concerns are only natural. However, this sector has been driving the markets this year and was one of the significant beneficiaries of a roaring rally last year. So it will not be too ambitious to expect a rebound in the near term.It does make sense now to buy value stocks from the technology space that could prove to be lucrative finds, going forward. Our selection is also backed by a good Value Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We narrowed down our choices with the help of our new Style Score System.Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value-investing space.Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc.

It has a PEG ratio of 0.95, lower than the industry average of 1.73.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

804,LRCX,"U.S. chip equipment makers have been gaining on superb growth in sales, earnings and cash flow for quite some time. In fact, a business-friendly tax cut policy signed by President Trump encouraged market pundits to upgrade sales and earnings estimates for U.S. semiconductor companies this year. Such a policy will make them more competitive with their global counterparts. The makers of computer chips, utilized in everything from smartphones to self-driving cars, have doubled since the summer of 2016 and have outpaced the broader market by a wide margin. After all, sales were boosted by an ever-increasing number of devices that are connected to the Internet. With escalating demand for personal computers and data centers, chips are required more than ever.The semiconductor-equipment group, semiconductor-manufacturing group as well as the computer-data storage group that includes some chip stocks rose 9.8%, 5.4% and 9% last week, respectively. Given such bullishness, investing in some solid semiconductors stocks having further upside potential won’t be a bad proposition.Biggest Tax Overhaul Boosts SemiconductorsThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, which mostly supported gains among the manufacturers of internal technologies, the semiconductor makers.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States was among the world’s highest. This explains why most of the semiconductor majors stashed a lion’s share of their earnings overseas. QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) used a large portion of its $30-billion overseas cash to acquire Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report), while Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) used its foreign cash to buy Israel-based Mobileye.But, the headline-grabbing move of the bill was slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and that the companies will be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% to bring back money from overseas. This in turn will make semiconductors repatriate trillions of dollars held abroad and eventually drive their after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks). With Trump’s tax reform having a positive impact on the broader U.S. semiconductor industry, we have highlighted four top chip stocks that are on the move right now. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Micron Trends UpwardMicron Technology, Inc.’s (MU  -  Free Report) shares jumped 8.8% on Mar 12 and broke out of a 14-week consolidation period. The stock crossed the $50 mark for the first time since Sep 28, 2000, while a volume of around 57.7 million shares was more than enough to make it the most actively-traded stock on the Nasdaq. Micron has risen 27% over the past three months.Higher dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip pricing, margin increase in Nand chips and expected rise in capital returns were cited to be the major catalysts behind this upward journey. Strong demand for high-end mobile and data center products should also bode well for the provider of semiconductor systems worldwide.Micron’s sales per share soared 47% to $17.61 in fiscal 2017 from $11.97 in fiscal 2016. Earnings per share improved $4.45 from a net loss of 22 cents in the previous year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 7.5% in the last 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year are a whopping 206.7% and 113.1%, respectively. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Data Business to Propel Intel HigherThe world’s largest chip maker, Intel, will certainly benefit from its exposure to big growth markets and strength in investors’ sentiment. But, it’s focus on data-centric business is likely to drive growth in the near future. Emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices is mostly driving demand for Intel’s products. This has led to Intel’s data business jump of more than 20% on a year-over-year basis.Intel has broken above the coveted $50 mark and is up nearly 10% from its early February panic low level. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings advanced 6.7% in the last 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next quarters are 7.6% and 11.1%, respectively. The company has a Zacks Rank #1.ON Semiconductor Rides on Automotive SegmentON Semiconductor Corporation (ON  -  Free Report) is currently positioned to break its January high, banking on improving end markets and successful integration of big acquisitions like AMIS. But, product growth in areas like automotive cameras and IoT offerings are mostly driving the company’s bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings improved 4.2% in the last 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year are a superb 85.7% and 18.5%, respectively. The company has a Zacks Rank #2.Lam Research to Return Cash to InvestorsLam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is trading at the high end of a five-month range near $220. Management’s recent decision to return a minimum of 50% of cash flows to investors in the next five years in the form of dividends and repurchases boosted the share price. Lam Research is also benefitting from robust equipment demand, strong demand in the memory segment, strength in logic and foundry segments and increased adoption of 3D NAND technology.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 15.7% in the last 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year are a stellar 55.7% and 67.7%, respectively.

805,LRCX,"Shares of several major semiconductor industry stocks were down in early morning trading Wednesday after the latest quarterly earnings reports from equipment suppliers ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) caused hesitation.Nevertheless, there were plenty of positives to take away from both of these reports. Lam Research surpassed estimates on the top and bottom lines, reporting total revenue growth of 34.2% on 19% higher shipments.Dutch equipment maker ASML also posted earnings and revenue beats. The firm also notched net sales growth of 35.7% and adjusted earnings growth of 12.3%. However, ASML said it expects gross profit margin to slip to about 43% in the second quarter from 48.7% in the first quarter.Lam Research investors might also be concerned about slumping margins. The company said non-GAAP gross margin for the March quarter was down about 80 basis points from the previous quarter to 46.8%, and it expects that figure to fall in the range of 46.5% to 48.5% for the current quarter.Lam also mentioned that it expects shipments to be between $2.85 billion and $3.15 billion in the quarter, which is slightly sluggish compared to the $3.13 billion in shipments witnessed during the March period.Overall, Lam Research guided for adjusted earnings in the range of $4.80 to $5.20 per share and revenue of $2.95 to $3.25 billion—both of which exceeded our previous consensus estimates.Still, both LRCX and ASML were met with volatility on Wednesday morning. Lam Research opened lower and quickly dipped to an intraday low of $196.50 per share, down about 7.5% from Tuesday’s close. ASML shares slumped as much as $9.70, or 4.6%, in early trading hours.Analysts were quick to declare Lam Research’s post-earnings selloff a buying opportunity, with teams from Evercore ISI, Stifel, and B. Riley FBR all maintaining bullish stances.“At or near $200, we are buyers all day long,” Evercore said in a note. “Put simply, the cost of adding each new memory bit is rising significantly across both DRAM and NAND, which should sustain elevated WFE for years to come.”Stifel elaborated further, saying Lam Research’s shipments outlook “could embolden bears who believe we are at the 'peak' of the cycle and in particular, on the memory front, where there are concerns on oversupply and overcapacity,” but reiterated its buy rating for the stock.But mixed reactions to the reports were enough to inspire selling throughout the semiconductor space early Wednesday morning. Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) opened lower before surging back to Tuesday’s close, Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) was down as much as 1%, and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) dipped nearly 5%.Overall, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) slumped $25.77, or 1.9%, to a mid-morning low of $1331.95 per share. However, the fund bounced of this daily low around 10:30 am EST.Want more market analysis from this author?

806,LRCX,"Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) reported disappointing results for first-quarter 2018, wherein both the top and bottom-line figures fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In the quarter under review, the company’s non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 5 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents per share. The figure however, was in-line with the year-ago quarter’s earnings.Quarter DetailsStratasys’ revenues of $153.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $167 million. Also, on a year-over-year basis, the figure declined 5.7%.The decline in revenues was primarily due to disappointing decline in sales of high end products in North America. Sluggish demand from government and other key vertical customers like aerospace and automotive resulted in the lower-than-expected sales.Segment wise, Product revenues were down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter to $103.9 million. Within product revenues, system revenues dropped 20.7% due to lower sales of high-end products in North America.Revenues from Services increased 3.8% year over year to $49.9 million. The increase in Services revenues was primarily attributed to 7.3% year-over-year increase in support revenues that include revenues generated mainly through maintenance contracts. The growth in installed base of systems and improvement in service contract attach rate led to improved revenues.Stratasys’ non-GAAP gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 52.8%.Non-GAAP operating income totaled $4.9 million, compared with $4 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 3.2% compared with 2.5% in the prior-year quarter.The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $346.5 million compared with $328.8 million at the end of the previous quarter. Inventories came in at approximately $120.1 million compared with $115.7 million last quarter. As of Mar 31, 2017, long-term debt came in at $25.9 million.Stratasys, Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Stratasys, Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Stratasys, Ltd. QuoteGuidanceStratasys reiterated guidance for full-year 2018. The company envisions revenues in the range of $670-$700 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $685.3 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are projected between 30 cents and 50 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 41 cents.Furthermore, the company anticipates non-GAAP operating margin to be in the 4.5%-6% band. Capital expenditures are estimated to lie within the $40-$50 million range.ConclusionStratasys posted unimpressive results for first-quarter 2018 due to lower-than-expected sales of high-end products in North America. However, management stated that they are trying to address the underperformance of this particular section by working closely with channel partners.The company’s operational performance was satisfactory in spite of lower revenues. Management is particularly optimistic about the long-term investments meant for the expansion of the addressable markets. Stratasys’ new hardware and software upgrades are also proving worthy for market expansion for both prototyping and manufacturing applications.Management noted that more than half of the company’s systems are experiencing repeat sales, with existing customers placing larger orders, which is a positive. They also remain optimistic about the growing adoption of newer additive manufacturing technologies, improving customer relationships and deeper market penetration in its markets.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Stratasys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology, Inc.

807,LRCX,"Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) reported loss per share of 17 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 20 cents.The company reported revenues of $230.7 million, which grew 54.1% year over year but missed the consensus mark of $246.1 million.Though revenues increased, the growth rate has come down significantly when compared with the past quarters. The redesign of the Snapchat app, which garnered significant negative response, had an adverse impact on the company’s ad business, which remains the primary contributor.Management expects growth to decelerate further in the second quarter owing to the pricing of both Snap Ads and Creative Tools. Moreover, increase in infrastructure costs due to tests and rollout of app updates will remain an overhang.Quarter in DetailAd revenues of $281 million in the quarter grew 62% year over year but declined 19% sequentially. Revenues from other sources contributed the rest.Strength in Snap Ad backed year-over-year improvement while the company’s Sponsored Creative Tools business was down. Snap Ad impressions, excluding Story Ads, grew 450% year over year while Snap's price per ad impression dropped 65% in the quarter. Of the total Snap Ads, 95% were bought programmatically during the quarter.Moreover, Lens and Filter products were hurt by “negative market narrative.” Snap’s transition to a “programmatic, audience-based buy model” had a negative impact on average order value (AOV) for the products. Although the number of Lenses sold increased 16% year over year, its AOV declined 37%.Snap’s international revenues (26% of total revenue) increased 14% year over year and 23% sequentially.The company’s daily active users (DAU) and average revenue per user (ARPU) witnessed year-over-year improvement.

In the year-ago quarter, the company benefitted largely from sudden robust demand in India, courtesy of demonetization which led to a tough year-over-year comparison.

812,LRCX,"Tech stocks recently faced a severe downturn, sparked off by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.’s (TSM  -  Free Report) weak financial outlook for the second quarter. Adding to investor concerns were persistent worries over weak demand for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhones.In March, the data privacy scandal which hit Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) triggered a broad selloff in tech shares. These concerns had then spilt over into April, spooking tech investors.However, it now seems that strong earnings from the FAANG group of stocks have dispelled lingering concerns surrounding the sector. Tech stocks have rebounded strongly and are lucrative investment options at present.  Apple Consolidates Winning Streak, Facebook Sparks ReboundAhead of earnings on Tuesday, shares of Apple gained 2.3%, powering a 0.9% increase for the Nasdaq. Apple posted second quarter 2018 earnings of $2.73 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69.Revenues came in at $61.1 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.1 billion. iPhone unit sales were up 3% from the prior-year quarter, with iPhone segment revenue coming in 14% higher.

813,LRCX,"Per Reuters, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) will be shifting Chinese users’ iCloud data to local data centers to ensure compliance with the country's newly implemented cyber-security regulations.Moving the cryptographic iCloud account keys to China makes it simpler for local authorities to obtain information on an iCloud user as they will no longer have to seek approval from the U.S. legal system to do so.In order to comply with the rules, Apple established its first data center in China in July 2017, which is operated in cooperation with Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry Co., Ltd. (GCBD), a data management enterprise co-founded by the Guizhou provincial government.Reportedly, in January, the company notified users that the stored information would be moved to servers operated by GCBD.However, the move has raised concerns among human rights activists as they fear that easier access to personal information might lead to arrests of so-called “political dissidents”. Apple was quoted saying, ""While we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were ultimately unsuccessful.""Notably, shares of Apple have gained over 28.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 27.7% rally.China FiguresChina represented 20.3% of Apple’s total revenues in the last reported quarter. The company benefited from improvement in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Wearables sales, leading to a 10.6%  year-over-year increase in revenues.Per market research firm IDC’s latest Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker report for China, Apple shipped approximately 10% fewer phones in 2017 compared with 2016. However, the launch of Apple’s highly-awaited iPhone X was a breather for the company in the fourth quarter as it helped it become a leader in the premium segment.Nevertheless, we note that the smartphone market in China is slowing down, as evident from IDC’s latest data. In fourth-quarter of 2017, the market declined 15.7% year over year. Moreover, it dropped 4.9% year over year in 2017.This doesn’t bode well for Apple amid intensifying competition from regional players who are offering feature-rich smartphones at a much cheaper price.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteConclusionIn a bid to promote domestic manufacturers, the Chinese government has created an increasingly challenging regulatory environment for foreign companies to operate, which is a concern for Apple.We therefore believe complying with Chinese regulations is of utmost importance as the country continues to be an important market for Apple. The company has also stepped up investment in the country to woo the government in a bid to protect its business interests.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderApple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

815,LRCX,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) recently announced that Saratoga Hospital has successfully improved patient safety and clinical outcomes by integrating Philips IntelliVue Guardian with automated Early Warning Scoring (EWS) system. IntelliVue Guardian solution provides better insights to clinicians and helps them to take better decisions, thus improving patient outcomes along with enhancing workflow.Leveraging Saratoga Hospital’s modified early warning score (MEWS) algorithm, the IntelliVue Guardian Solution enables clinicians to discover deviations in a patient's vital signs. The solution also incorporates an automated respiration rate into its EWS calculations that improves quality and accuracy. The implementation of Philips’ patient monitoring technology has enabled Saratoga Hospital to reduce patient transfers to the intensive care unit (ICU) as well as eliminate patient codes within its 20-bed orthopedic unit.Our TakePhilips is gradually evolving as a healthcare company, having grown its presence in the domain over the past couple of quarters. Also, the Healthcare Informatics Solutions & Services margins are improving constantly as the company is transforming this business from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business.In addition, Philips remains optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical owing to positive industry trends as Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment sales are acting as major profit churners. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 2% against the industry’s loss of 1.3%.Moreover, the company is focusing on key opportunities in population health management. This apart, Philips is improving its enterprise wide solutions for health systems and collaborating with health care organizations to enhance its stronghold in the healthcare industry. Meanwhile, the company’s eye on strategic acquisitions and alliances has bolstered its core business.

Moreover, adoption of 100 Gigabit EDR solutions in machine learning, artificial intelligence (“AI”), high-performance computing, database and storage remains a positive. Additionally, InfiBand’s adoption aided Mellanox to retain its leadership position in the high-performance interconnects space.Apart from the Ethernet solutions, strong demand for Infiniband solution has been driver catalyst.

817,LRCX,"When considering valuation metrics, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, in case of companies that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits, price-to-sales (P/S) is a good valuation metric to identify cheap stocks.Other than P/E and P/S, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use tool for zeroing in on low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.What is Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Barclays plc (BCS  -  Free Report), a major global banking and financial services company, has a projected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 28.9%.

The second-generation model is likely to hit the shelves as early as this year.Reportedly, users of the upcoming version of AirPods will no longer have to “double tap” the earphones. Instead, they have to say “Hey Siri” in order to activate the voice assistant. Besides, the upgraded wireless chip will help improve Bluetooth connectivity and facilitate easier transfers.Bloomberg also mentioned that the company is working on a third-generation water-resistant version of AirPods that would probably be available sometime in 2019.We believe the launch of these upgraded versions will help the company expand its foothold in the wearables market where it already enjoys a huge support.Notably, shares of Apple have gained over 26.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 25.8% rally.  AirPods Rule the Roost in Earphones MarketApple launched the AirPods back in December 2016 after a two-month delay since unveiling the product at its Sep 7 keynote.Despite the staggering price tag of $159, AirPods witnessed huge demand in the market, which resulted in initial supply shortages.

821,LRCX,"Voxeljet AG (VJET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 29.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates in the trailing four quarters, recording an average negative surprise of 42.2%. The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 50% in the last reported quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, Voxeljet has been suffering from a decline in order backlog on account of delayed customer adoption rates. For instance, the company’s total backlogs dropped 41% in third-quarter 2017, compared with its level at the end of 2016. Further, depressed oil prices, which have caused investment deferrals by clients, affected the company’s oil and gas extraction equipment business in the recent past. Moreover, of late, some of the company’s key customers have encountered supply chain redesign issues which may further delay investments, going forward.The company has also been experiencing a rise in operating expenses due to higher expenses for the preparation of several financing activities, higher personnel expenses and higher expenses for materials related to various projects. These factors could be a drag on margins and is likely to put pressure on the overall bottom-line performance in the upcoming quarter as well.On the positive side, revenues from the company’s System segment (including sales of 3D printers) showed signs of improvement in third-quarter 2017, the 3D printing industry is yet to fully stabilize. Notably, for the first nine months of 2017, the company’s System segment’s (including sales of 3D printers) revenues declined 8.9% to €8.4 million from €9.1 million in the year-ago period. These apart, other headwinds, including economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity prices vagaries, have also marred the performance of most players in the industry. We expect Voxeljet’s fourth-quarter 2017 results to be adversely affected by these factors.However, increase in the demand of 3D printing equipment in the United States and higher demand for products in China are positives. Impressive market traction of Phenolic Direct Binding process is anticipated to be one of the major catalysts for the quarter. Additionally, the company’s large-scale service centers worldwide, including the subsidiaries in China and India are expected to prove conductive for the fourth quarter and beyond.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Voxeljet this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -21.74% as the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 14 cents is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.voxeljet AG Price and EPS Surprise voxeljet AG Price and EPS Surprise | voxeljet AG QuoteZacks Rank: Voxeljet has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This, combined with the company’s negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.06% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials, Inc.

822,LRCX,"After the closing bell Tuesday, a fresh wave of Q1 earnings reports have come out, across a wide swath of sectors. Among the big names posting actuals this afternoon, all came out with exclusively better-than-expected results.IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), at first glance, appeared to accomplish what analyst had set out for it: a 5-cent earnings beat to $2.45 per share on $19.1 billion in sales, which surpassed the $18.7 analysts were looking for. These figures represent year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in 5 years, but after-market trading is selling off IBM shares roughly 5%, virtually wiping out the company's gains for all of 2018 so far.This sell-off may also provide a drag to the Dow index tomorrow morning, which had just finally dug itself out of its hole over the past month. IBM's guidance for full-year 2018 was reaffirmed at $13.80 per share; apparently investors were looking for something a little stronger on this line.United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by a penny to 50 cents a share, with revenues for the quarter also edging out expectations to $9.03 billion. This marks a 23% upswing in earnings from the year-ago quarter on PRASM metrics up 2.7% in Q1. Full-year guidance have tightened to between $7-8 per share, and the company has beaten estimates on the bottom line for 5 straight quarters.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) also outperformed estimates, though not by as impressive of margins as some of these companies this afternoon. Headline numbers of $4.79 per share on $2.89 billion in sales also mark the fifth-straight earnings beat, and revenue growth year over year was roughly 33%. Yet late trading is selling the news following a strong regular session, down 2.6% since results were posted. For more on LRCX's earnings, click here.CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) easily bettered expectations on the bottom line in its Q1 -- 78 cents per share vs. 66 cents expected, on $2.88 billion in revenues, better than the $2.83 billion expected. This company has also outperformed in the past 5 straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of over 10%. Late trading is pushing up CSX shares 3.78%.Finally, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted arguably the most impressive Q1 report of the bunch, with $2.44 per share far outpacing the $1.99 expected, and revenues of $848 million solidly passing the $767 million in the Zacks consensus.

823,LRCX,"After a blockbuster start to 2018, the Wall Street once again saw a tumultuous ride last week thanks to a tech selloff, Fed rates hike and trade war fears. In particular, the major bourses suffered their worst week in more than two years with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 tumbling 5.7% and 5.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 6.5% (read: Play These Inverse ETFs to Profit From Market Bloodbath).The massive decline came in late last week following Trump’s announcement that he is seeking to impose a tariff of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports in response to intellectual property theft from U.S. businesses. In response, China seems to be preparing for retaliation with a proposed list of 128 U.S. products worth $3 billion. This has made investors jittery, leading to risk-off trading, as tariffs will spur retaliation from China, triggering a global trade war between the world’s two largest economies.However, the fear seems to have abated following the latest reports from Wall Street Journal that both the United States and China have started negotiating to improve American access to Chinese markets. Additionally, Trump exempted South Korea from steel tariffs levied earlier this month, suggesting that the President is using a fierce approach for more negotiating power rather than any real intention to start a global trade war. Given this, U.S. stocks rebounded strongly at the start of this week with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones gaining nearly 2% at the time of writing.Further, strong corporate earnings, optimism surrounding Trump’s tax cut policies, pick-up in growth in developed and developing economies, robust job gains, growing wages, increasing consumer spending, a recovering housing market and a record level of consumer confidence will continue to drive the nine-year bulls (read: Best Performing ETFs of 9-Year Bull Run).Given the bullish fundamentals, the selloff seen last week might charge up investors to snap up ETFs and stocks on the cheap for outsized gains in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we have selected ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

831,LRCX,"Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) is introducing GIF — Graphic Interchange Format — stickers on its messaging application Snapchat by collaborating with Giphy. The GIF stickers will be available in the Sticker Picker menu of the application, reports TechCrunch.Snapchat also introduced a Tab feature on the Friends and Discover pages of the application that will enable users to easily sort the Stories that they wish to see.We believe the new tools and features will help the company combat all odds and boost engagement and user growth.Snapchat Banks on Redesign to Drive GrowthWe note that Snapchat’s recent redesign has not gone down well with users and is a headwind for the business. An online petition with more than a million signatures was filed in order to get users back to the old application.Notably, shares of Snap dropped 9.1% to close at $18.57 on Feb 20. Moreover, shares of Snap have lost 22.7% of their value since its listing date of Mar 2, 2017 against 29.1% growth of its industry. CEO Evan Spiegel defended the redesign decision at the Goldman Sachs Internet & Technology Conference last week saying that it will take time for people to accept the change. He has immense faith in the long-term benefits of the redesign and believes it will “provide a strong foundation for the evolution of our business.”We believe introduction of the Tab feature is a step toward that direction. It will make the platform easier and simpler to use.Interestingly, for the first time, Snapchat seems to be following the footsteps of archrival Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) photo sharing app Instagram, which has earlier copied Snapchat features and made them more popular. Instagram Stories, which is a copy of Snapchat’s feature of the same name, has more than 300 million daily active users (DAUs), while Snapchat has 187 million DAUs.Instagram rolled out GIF on Stories last month. Developed around 30 years ago, GIF is currently one of the biggest marketing trends. Given its increasing popularity, social media services are also expanding its usage. Facebook added the feature back in 2015 in Status Bar and extended the same to other sections eventually.We note that growth of Stories is phenomenal and currently Instagram and WhatsApp are the top two “most used Stories product in the world”, per Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg. We believe introduction of GIF is a positive for Snapchat as it will help increase user engagement and withstand intensifying competition.Snap Inc. Revenue (TTM) Snap Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Snap Inc.

839,LRCX,"In basketball, when a player hits a few shots in a row, he is said to have a “hot hand”. In finance, we call it “momentum”.Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift.At the core, momentum investing works on the principle of “Buy High, Sell Higher.”Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for the momentum strategy to work. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will spring back to their original prices. On the other hand, many investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things gain clarity, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Also, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s. This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) becomes known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.Obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play. Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets. We have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains.Our screen will help you take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which will reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the 50 stocks, we choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter what the market conditions are, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance.

It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume shows that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through this screen:TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) provides securities brokerage and related technology-based financial services to retail investors, traders, and independent registered investment advisors in the United States.

840,LRCX,"Red Hat Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 26.We note that, on an average, the company has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73% in the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, Red Hat delivered positive earnings surprise of 4.29%.Earnings increased 20.2% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by strong top-line growth and operating margin expansion.Revenues increased 21.6% year over year to almost $748 million, primarily on the back of strong demand for hybrid cloud solutions. The figure was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $734 million.Red Hat's top-line growth is benefiting from improving linearity owing to on-time renewal of deals reflecting strong demand for hybrid cloud technology solutions as well as aggressive cross-selling.Buoyed by solid results, Red Hat stock has returned 28.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the 7.8% rally in the industry it belongs to.  Outlook PositiveFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Red Hat expects revenues between $758 million and $763 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues currently stands at $761.96 million, up 21.2% year over year.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 81 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at 80 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 31.15%.Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 24.6%.Strong Partner Base, Acquisitions to Drive GrowthWe believe that Red Hat’s strong partner base that includes the likes of IBM, Intel, Dell Technologies, Google cloud platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) will continue to drive growth. The company’s collaborations with cloud providers like Amazon, Google and now Alibaba positions it for significant top-line growth.This is helping Red Hat to cross-sell cloud-based technology across its customer base. Emerging technologies have also been a driving factor.Additionally, complementary acquisitions have led to a favorable product mix, which is in turn bolstering overall results. The company’s strategy of making acquisitions (3scale, Ansible, FeedHenry, eNovance, Inktank, Codenvy) that can be easily integrated into current business has expanded its product portfolio into higher-growth segments, such as Hybrid cloud and other emerging technologies (Cloud Management, OpenShift, OpenStack, and Storage).Red Hat continued to win customer in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Enterprises like Follett School Solutions, SIX Group, ZTE Corporation, and Elo selected Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as their enterprise Kubernetes solution of choice in the quarter.During the quarter, Red Hat acquired CoreOS, an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solutions, for a purchase price of $250 million.What Our Model Says?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Red Hat has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.24%, which indicates a likely positive earnings surprise.

843,LRCX,"Shares of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) moved slightly lower during morning trading hours Monday, just one day before the company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings results. The red-hot run of the semiconductor market has been challenged lately, so investors will want to pay close attention to the report of a major supplier like Lam.Lam Research provides market-leading equipment and services for the fabrication of integrated circuits. Its products are used primarily in wafer processing—a key step in the manufacturing process that includes the creation of active components like transistors and capacitors. The company also exposure to wafer-level packaging and microelectromechanical systems.The strength of the semiconductor business has created a rise in demand for Lam Research’s solutions, and investors have rewarded this uptick in business by lifting the stock more than 60% over the past year. But what should we expect from Lam Research’s soon-to-be-reported quarter? Let’s take a closer look.Latest Outlook and ValuationBased on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect Lam Research to post adjusted earnings of $4.36 per share and total revenue of $2.85 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 55.7% and 32.4%, respectively.Heading into the week, Lam Research was trading with a Forward P/E of 12.3, which is a noticeable discount to its industry’s average of 16.3. Within the past year, the stock has traded as high as 16.2x forward 12-month earnings and as low as 10.0x. Its median earnings multiple over that time is 13.6x. Investors might conclude that LRCX is cheap ahead of its report compared to its industry peers and where it has traded recently.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Lam Research surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Lam Research is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -0.6%. This means that the most recent analyst estimates have been slightly lower than the consensus. In other words, our model is not conclusively calling for a beat.Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of Lam Research’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. The firm is a consistent earnings performer and has met or surpassed consensus estimates in each of the trailing 22 quarters.But we judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. LRCX has moved higher in three out of the previous four quarters during this window.Want more market analysis from this author?

Excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, revenues jumped 42.3%.Facebook has been under fire from all quarters ever since data misuse allegations surfaced against the company in mid-March. However, this has not impacted Facebook’s performance so far.

The company is also working on making ads more transparent ahead of important elections in many countries. The company expects to expand its security and content review team to more than 20k people by this year end.Although investments on these update may affect profits in the near term, these initiatives are expected to help Facebook build a stronger community in the long haul.Expanding Product Portfolio: A Key CatalystFacebook’s innovative product roadmap that includes Watch, Stories and Marketplace will continue to drive growth. The launch of Oculus Go this year is also encouraging.The company believes that the introduction of Watch Party will help in improving meaningful interactions. Moreover, its focus on expanding “meaningful Groups on Facebook” will help it achieve its goal of helping 1 billion people.To ensure smooth communication between businesses and consumers, the company launched Quick Replies on Messenger and made ads available on inbox for advertisers.  Facebook stated that more than 2 billion messages are now sent between businesses and customers every month. Click-to-Messenger Ads also holds promise for advertisers as it helps them get into direct communication with consumers.Stories continues to be a key growth driver, with WhatsApp Status recording highest number of views. The availability of carousel ads in Stories is also a positive.Between WhatsApp and Messenger, people send nearly 100 billion messages every day. Video and voice calling of more than 3 billion minutes per day has made Facebook “the largest network for video calling.”Facebook recently launched WhatsApp Business, an app designed to facilitate communication between small and medium businesses and customers, which has almost 3 million users.Additionally, the company is also running tests of payments in messaging, which is anticipated to help increase efficiency for businesses.Quarterly Numbers in DetailsMonthly active users (MAUs) were up 13% year over year to a staggering 2.20 billion at the end of the quarter.Daily Active Users (DAUs) were 1.45 billion, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase.

DAUs increased in the United States and Canada by 1.6% on a year-over-year basis and 0.5% when compared sequentially.Slowdown in DAU growth in the Rest of World market owing to Internet shutdown in Ethipoia among other factors was an overhang.Advertising revenues soared 50.1% year over year to $11.795 billion. Mobile ad revenues surged 60% year over year to $10.7 billion, contributing 91% to total ad revenues.Facebook has over 6 million active advertisers and Instagram has 2 million.

The growth was driven by feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. Average revenue per user was $5.53, up 30.7% year over year.Payments and other fees declined 2.3% year over year to $171 million.Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Facebook, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Facebook, Inc. QuoteMarginsThe company’s gross margin was 84%, down 200 basis points (bps) year over year, due to increase in investment on video content and the impact of change in accounting for Instant Articles product from net to gross.Cost and expenses increased 38.5% to $6.52 billion driven by an increase in sales and marketing and rise in workforce. Facebook hired 2,600 people (highest in history) during the quarter. The company focuses primarily on strengthening its technical team apart from various other fields. The company’s sales and marketing expenses increased 50.9% year over year to nearly $1.6 billion, due to increase in investments on quality and safety initiatives.However, robust revenue growth provided enough cushion to operating margins.

Rollout of GDPR is likely to impact European MAU and DAU growth in the second quarter.Facebook projects total expenses to increase between 50-60% in 2018 compared with the prior guidance of 45-60%. The increase in mid-point is attributed to rising investments in safety, security, content acquisition for Watch and long-term innovation efforts related to AI, augmented and virtual reality and connectivity.Capital expenditure is expected to be around $15 billion compared with the prior range of $14-$15 billion, driven by increased investment in data centers, servers, office facilities and network infrastructure.Management expects tax rate in the mid-teens range for the second quarter as well as 2018.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

850,LRCX,"The technology sector has lately been spooked by a spate of negative news from some of its key companies. Among the worst hit were FANG stocks as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data scandal raised concerns over stringent regulations for the social media space, and a series of allegations from Donald Trump via Twitter on its business practices spurred Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) sell-off.The attack from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM  -  Free Report) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) added to the latest chaos. Taiwan Semiconductor warned of waning mobile demand for the second quarter and thus reduced its sales growth target for this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year.Notably, TSM is Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) biggest supplier and the negative news has taken a toll on shares of the technology giant. Apple shed $60 billion in two days following the news. Several global chipmakers also lost market value, including Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report).While a number of these headwinds have spread negative sentiments in the space, the rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology and solid corporate earnings are expected to fuel growth. In particular, Q1 earnings from 29.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 36.3% on 13.7% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating on earnings and 85.7% exceeding top-line estimates. Overall, earnings and revenues for Q1 are expected to grow 22.6% and 11.9%, respectively.Given the optimism, a number of stocks in the sector have seen their Rank surging to the top-most rung in a couple of days. These are also backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others. Any of these could be a compelling choice to beat the ongoing tech turmoil and make for great picks this earnings season.

Quote Fiscal 2019 GuidanceNotably, for fiscal 2019, the company will implement ASC 606 revenue standard but will report results under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 revenue standards. However, CA provided guidance for fiscal 2019 per ASC 605 revenue standard for ease of comparison.The company anticipates total revenues to range between flat to up 1% on a reported basis and  down 1% to flat on a constant currency basis.

Considering the exchange rates as of Mar 31, 2018, this translates to cash flow in the range of $1.14-$1.18 billion.The decline in the projected cash flow can primarily be attributed to restructuring charges, U.S. tax reform and adoption of ASC 606 revenue standard.Bottom LineCA posted impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results and management was particularly optimistic about the Mainframe segment.

856,LRCX,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is working to bring high-end, noise-canceling, over-ear headphones by the end of 2018. However, development challenges might delay the launch, reports Bloomberg.Reportedly, the new product is facing similar problems like Apple’s speaker-like home automation device, HomePod, which was released on Feb 9 after months of delay. Furthermore, there are chances of redesigning the product or discontinuing it.Notably, the news comes on the heels of Apple working on updating its highly popular wireless AirPods headphone with improved hardware feature, reported last month. The new device is likely to hit the shelves as early as this year.We believe the launch of these products within the stipulated time will help Apple cash in on the holiday season (October-December), which per market research firm NPD is “The Most Wonderful Time of The Year – For Headphone Sales.”iPhone Losing SteamRevenues from iPhone segment have always been the mainstay behind Apple’s top-line performance. Last quarter, iPhone’s revenues accounted for 69.7% of sales and improved 13% from the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to higher iPhone average selling price (ASP), which increased to $796 from $695 a year ago, while total shipment declined 1% year over year.However, the expensive price tag might prove as an impediment in the markets like China, which remains an important market for Apple, given the growing number of middle-class customers. Also, intensifying competition from regional players, who are offering feature-rich smartphones at a much cheaper price, remains a major headwind.In a year’s time, shares of Apple have gained 26.9% underperforming the industry’s 27.1% rally.Focus on a New Revenue StreamApple’s focus on developing innovative products in order to generate new revenue streams is prudent in our view.We note that the diversification is already yielding positive results for the company. Evidently, in the previous quarter, Apple’s Other Product segment which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats headphones, iPod touch and other accessories witnessed a 36% increase year over year, the highest among all its segments. In fact, the segment recorded a new all-time high with revenues of more than $5 billion for the first time in a quarter.This was followed by the Services segment — comprising revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services — which registered a 18% improvement year over year.Total revenues from wearables increased almost 70% year over year. Notably, it was the second largest contributor to Apple’s revenue growth after the iPhone.Per NPD’s latest Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker report, Apple has become the leading player in the wearables market in 2017, courtesy Apple Watch. We believe enhancement of its product offerings might help the company expand its foothold in the wearables market and also increase its market share.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc.

857,LRCX,"Shares of Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $116.04, eventually closing at $115.51 on Mar 5.It has been four weeks since Proofpoint reported fourth-quarter 2017 results. The stock has been on the rise following the release. To some investors, choosing the stock may appear to be a no-brainer because right after an earnings release, a company is almost always on investors’ radar.While better-than-expected results make the stock a good pick, lower-than-expected results dampen investors’ spirit. So, the period following earnings releases is often marked by high market activity. Since its last quarterly results announcement on Feb 6, Proofpoint has gained 12.6% so far.The company delivered non-GAAP earnings of 29 cents for the recently reported quarter, recording an impressive year-over-year jump of 61%. Earnings also came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents as well as management’s guidance of 19-21 cents per share.The company reported total revenues of $145.4 million, up 36.1% year over year, primarily driven by customer additions, improved add-on-sales and strong renewal rate. The company’s revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $140 million and also exceeded the guidance range of $138-$140 million.Proofpoint, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Proofpoint, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Proofpoint, Inc. QuoteWe believe the company’s sustained focus on launching new products like Domain Discover and acquisitions with the likes of Cloudmark and Weblife.io have helped it perform well. The company also maintains a high renewal rate of more than 90% which signifies that it has a better product portfolio and loyal customers.Moreover, the last reported quarter witnessed improvement in margins, driven by higher sales and efficiency improvements across the company’s cloud operations. Further, it was aided by decreased operating expenses as a percentage of sales.Additionally, the company raised full-year 2018 revenue guidance. Proofpoint now expects revenues in the range of $660-$665 million (mid-point $662.5 million), up from $644-$648 million (mid-point $646 million) predicted earlier.Apart from strong quarterly results, the recent optimism surrounding the stock can also be attributed to the acquisition of Wombat Security Technologies. The acquired entity is a prominent name in the security awareness and the phishing simulation industry. Consequently, its integration is anticipated to be a top-line booster.We believe all these have positively impacted the company’s share price momentum. Notably, investors are optimistic about the stock’s prospects. Proofpoint’s stock has gained 47.2% over the last year, substantially outperforming the 29.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderProofpoint has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some top-ranked stocks in the space include NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report), all of which sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

858,LRCX,"The Dow emerged from four straight sessions of losses to finish in the green on Monday. The ascent was largely attributable to a reduction in fears triggered off by President Trump’s recent tariff announcements. Key members of his administration remained evasive over the likelihood of such plans actually reaching fruition. Additionally, leading Republicans strongly voiced their opposition to such a move.Meanwhile, a section of analysts have questioned whether such tariffs will actually come into force. They have repeatedly pointed at Trump’s own tweets on the issue, where he more or less indicates that this could merely be a bargaining tactic to gain leverage ahead of future NAFTA negotiations.Also, Trump has been extremely sensitive to market movements, taking credit for equity gains on more than one occasion. This is why he is also likely to take further market losses caused by his remarks into account before taking the final call on the issue. Taking these factors into account, stocks could soon begin racking up steady gains. This is why it makes sense to pick up great value stocks while the situation remains volatile.GOP Leaders Critical of Tariffs, White House EvasiveHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was among the leading GOP leader to voice his resentment on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan said the Speaker was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war.” Strong added that Ryan was “urging the White House to not advance with this plan” since it could “jeopardize” the economic benefits reaped from recent tax cuts.Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross remained largely evasive when questioned during a television interview as to whether Trump would actually go ahead with the proposed tariffs. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also provided inconsistent responses on the issue, giving the impression that the tariffs were far from a done deal.Tariffs Only a Negotiating Tactic?The President himself indicated that the decision to actually go ahead with the tariffs was contingent on the amount of headway made on NAFTA negotiations. Trump suggested that fresh terms from Mexico and Canada could exempt these countries from the import taxes. On Monday, the President tweeted that “Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.""A significant section of analysts also felt that the trade tariff impasse could end with a diplomatic solution. They pointed toward the fact that Caterpillar (CAT) and Harley-Davidson (HOG) gained 3.2% and 2.3% on Monday. Both these stocks are expected to be hugely be impacted by these import taxes. Traders also felt that Trump’s NAFTA related comments showed that he was ready to adopt a flexible approach.Targeted, Muted Response LikelyOver the weekend, Trump had argued that trade wars may actually be good for the U.S. economy. But on Monday he changed tack, saying: “I don’t think we’ll have a trade war.” Trump’s rationale throughout this episode has been that the United States is too large a market to ignore or rile up beyond a certain point. And given the initial response of the countries likely to be most affected by his tariffs, this seems to be largely true as of now.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump on Monday to say that tariffs could only impede NAFTA stocks further. Canada and Mexico have threatened to retaliate, but only in a targeted fashion.Meanwhile, the EU has said that it will impose tariffs on classic American products such as bourbon, jeans and Harley motorcycle, but doesn’t seem keen on further measures at this point. China has asked Trump to be cautious on the issue but has stopped short of specific trade-related measures.Our ChoicesTrump’s NAFTA related comments show that the President is yet to make up his mind on tariff related announcements. Meanwhile, though Trump has received some bipartisan support on the issue, the GOP remains largely opposed to the idea. More importantly, countries that will be severely impacted by such tariffs have largely issued a targeted and muted response.These developments suggest that fears surrounding a tariff war may be largely overstated. Hence it makes sense to buy value stocks in the interim that that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes in earnest.

859,LRCX,"There are several different ways to find value stocks. Among these, the most popular are price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). However, investors often overlook the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), a leading global automotive company, has a projected 3–5 year EPS growth rate of 8.37%.

At the end of the quarter, daily active users went up to 172 million, up 23.7% from the year-ago quarter.Weibo non-ad revenues grew a whopping 81% to $45.1 million, mainly attributable to the hike in membership fees and live broadcasting business.Weibo's ad and marketing revenues grew 77% to $332.3 million in the reported quarter, backed by robust growth in mobile advertisements.

Non-GAAP operating margin of 30% expanded 400 basis points from the year-ago quarter on the back of Weibo’s operating leverage as well as increase in margin from non-Weibo business.However, increase in sales and marketing expenses to increase Weibo and SINA news app users and a rise in product development cost remain dampeners.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowSINA exited the quarter with cash & cash equivalents (including short-term investments & restricted cash) of $3.6 billion compared with $2.6 billion as of Sep 30, 2017.Cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $76.3 million.

861,LRCX,"It seems that this isn’t the best of times for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Uber. And the markets have reacted sharply with tech stocks taking a hit. While the social media platform has been embroiled in a data misuse scandal accounting for the breach of personal data of millions of users, the world saw its first casualty by a driverless car in Arizona, when a pedestrian was run over by an Uber vehicle.Tech stocks have seen a decline over the week with Facebook at the helm of the carnage. The social media giant’s shares fell nearly 7% on Monday, making it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500. Meanwhile, analysts are of the opinion that tech stocks are most overvalued relative to the market since 2009. While it’s a bit too early to predict if shares of Facebook and other tech giants will further decline, it makes good sense to pick up great value stocks while the market stays volatile.Facebook, Uber Rattle Tech StocksOn Mar 19, 28-year-old data scientist Chris Wylie, provided whistleblower accounts about Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy that was hired for President Donald Trump’s campaign. Wylie, who worked for Cambridge Analytica, alleged that the firm harvested data from more than 50 million Facebook accounts without the consent of the users. The allegations were enough to break the trust of millions of users who started deleting their Facebook accounts, resulting in the company’s shares taking a hit. Facebook lost about $50 billion of market value over the next two days.Moreover, Facebook’s scandal has taken the shape of a global controversy with Germany’s justice minister Katarina Barley reportedly summoning Facebook to clarify if the personal data of 30 million Facebook users in that country were protected from unlawful use by third parties. Brazil too has started an investigation if Cambridge Analytica acted illegally there too. And India’s IT minister said that the government is ready to launch an enquiry to see if Facebook had any role to play in unfairly influencing election in that country. If required, India will summon Zuckerberg.On the other hand, Uber’s driverless car, which struck down a pedestrian in Arizona, has raised questions about the credibility and future of autonomous vehicles. The recent incident has raised doubts in the minds of people if the world is still ready for driverless cars. A number of other tech and auto giants like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), General Motors Co. (GM  -  Free Report) and Baidu are pumping in billions of dollars to develop autonomous-vehicle technology.However, after the accident at Tempe, AZ analysts are apprehensive that testing at Alphabet’s Waymo unit, which is worth $70 billion, could slow and delay commercialization of autonomous vehicles. The recent loss of trust in both Facebook and Uber was enough to see tech stocks plummet and unsettle investors. Also, other tech stocks like Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined 2.3% on Wednesday, while Alphabet  dipped 0.6%, thus affecting the overall tech sector.Tech Stocks Are Most OvervaluedTechnology stocks are trading at an 11% valuation premium to the broader market, the highest since 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. Meanwhile, the valuation of the S&P 500 is at its lowest level since late 2016, with the recent decline in stocks. Moreover, the S&P technology sector has increased 7.6% year to date compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 1.5%.The primary reason for this is that technology stocks have outperformed the broader market both last year and this year, and its price gains have outpaced earnings growth. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also said that with the recent decline in share prices, the valuation of S&P 500 stocks has fallen to a level last witnessed in 2016. Given this scenario, it is always wise to buy stocks on the dip, as technology is an overweight sector.Our ChoicesFacebook’s recent data misuse scandal coupled with Uber’s driverless car accident has seen tech stocks plunging. Shares of other tech giants like Apple and Alphabet too have seen a decline in the last few days.Overall, it’s too early to predict how the tech sector will perform in the days to come. As it is, the sector remains overvalued given that price increases continue to overshoot earnings growth. Given this scenario, it makes sense to identify value stocks that that could prove to be lucrative going forward.

862,LRCX,"Shares of Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) surged over 3% on Wednesday as part of a run that has seen the company’s stock price climb nearly 19% in the last 12 weeks alone. The wafer fabrication equipment company has consistently impressed shareholders over the last year, so let’s take a look at why Lam looks poised to continue its current run of success.Recent NewsLam manufactures products that are essential to the semiconductor industry and help fuel the information age. The company recently highlighted some of the biggest factors that are set to contribute to its growth at its 2018 investors meeting.Lam noted that 67 zettabytes—equal to 67 trillion gigabytes—of data will be generated by 2020. “We are literally just scratching the surface of what is possible in the world of data,” Lam CEO Martin Anstice said at the conference. “We believe that the fundamental future of Lam Research is inextricably linked to the rising importance of a data economy.”Lam also recently unveiled a plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders over the next five years. Starting in the June quarter, Lam will also increase its quarterly dividend by 120% to $1.10 per share.On top of those initiatives, Lam announced an additional $2 billion share repurchase program, which brings its total authorization to $4 billion since Nov. 2017. The Fremont, California-based company hopes to execute this plan over the next 12 to 18 months.Growth Fundamentals Lam is expected to see its current-quarter earnings skyrocket by nearly 56% to $4.36 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The tech firm is also expected to see its quarterly revenues surge over 32% to reach $2.85 billion.The company’s full-year earnings are expected to skyrocket by nearly 68% to reach $16.74 per share, while Lam’s full-year sales are projected to jump by 35% to hit $10.85 billion.Looking even further down the road, Lam is expected to see its EPS figure expand at an annualized rate of 14.9% over the next three to five years.Investors will also be happy to note that the company has experienced a slew of estimate revisions recently, with 100% agreement to the upside for both its current quarter and full year.Solid ValueShares of Lam have skyrocketed over 76% in the last year and surged 13% in the last month, yet its stock price currently rests below its 52-week high. Despite this climb, Lam is also currently trading at 13.1x forward earnings, which falls slightly below the “Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication” industry’s average P/E of 13.5.  Lam has also consistently traded at a discount to its larger peer group, which includes Applied Material (AMAT  -  Free Report), during this same time frame.Bottom Line Lam is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The company is also projected to grow both its top and bottom lines at sizable rates this year. Meanwhile, the stock looks undervalued at its current level, leaving plenty of room for profits.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.

863,LRCX,"Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the technology sector, and an increase in share price and strong fundamentals signal it’s bull run. Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.The company has performed extremely well this year and has potential to carry on the momentum in the near term.Why an Attractive Pick?Share Price Appreciation: A glimpse of the company’s price trend shows that the stock had an impressive run on the bourses over the last year. Applied has returned 53.5%, comparing favorably with the S&P 500’s market gain of 15.9%. Solid Rank & VGM Score: Applied sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: Seven estimates for the current year have moved north over the past 60 days against one southward revision, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the stock. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8%. Also, for fiscal 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has inched up 5% over the same time frame to $4.55.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Applied has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.76%.Strong Growth Prospects: The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings of $4.39 reflects year-over-year growth of 35.1%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 3.6% growth in fiscal 2019. The stock has a long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 12%.Growth Drivers: Applied continues to witness technological advancements in semiconductor and display areas. The rising demand for semiconductors and displays aided by the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), big data and artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, virtual reality and smart vehicles, is a tailwind.Further, the company is well positioned for NAND supply that is required for the growing data storage market. Applied Materials’ market share has gained significantly with its strength in 3D NAND, DRAM and patterning. Management expects increasing DRAM and logic spending in 2018. It is significantly improving its memory market share as well.In the most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year. Also, the company provided an improving outlook. Management expects robust double-digit growth in semiconductor, display and service businesses in 2018. It expects wafer fab equipment (WFE) market’s combined spending in 2018 and 2019 to reach around $100 billion.We believe that Applied Materials is in a great position to grow sustainably and profitably based on its strong pipeline of enabling technologies, supported by expanding opportunities on the semiconductor, service and display fronts.Applied Materials, Inc.

864,LRCX,"Watts Water Technologies, Inc. (WTS  -  Free Report) is likely to benefit from higher volume, pricing and restructuring actions, new product innovation and impact of the tax reform despite raw material inflation. Currently, the manufacturer of water safety and flow control products for the water quality, water conservation, water safety, and water flow control markets carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Here's why investors should hold on to the stock at present. Positive Estimate Revisions, Growth Projections The Zacks Consensus for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has gone up 7% and 5%, respectively, over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 reflects year-over-year growth of 20% and 10%, respectively. The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%, higher than the industry’s rate of 11% which holds promise. Price Performance  The company outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past year. The stock has gained 32% while the industry rose 20%. Value Growth Momentum (VGM) Score The company currently has a VGM score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A along with some other key metrics makes the company a solid choice for investors. Positive Earnings Surprise History The company has an impressive earnings history having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average beat of 4%. Upbeat Guidance For 2018, Watts Water expects organic sales to increase approximately 3%. In the Americas segment, revenues will grow organically in the range of 3-5% in 2018, with solid growth across most of its product lines. Furthermore, the company predicts organic sales growth in the range of 1-3% in Europe segment for the full year. It anticipates witnessing improved performance in both fluid solutions and drainage product lines based on continued positive end markets. In the Asia-Pacific segment, Watts Water projects organic sales to grow between 7% and 10% for the year, with strong growth both inside and outside of China. Watts Water is also poised to benefit from the tax reform in 2018. Watts Water estimates its consolidated operating margin to expand in the range of 50-70 basis points, which includes approximately $10 million of incremental investments. Operating margin expansion in 2018 will be driven by higher volume and continued productivity increment efforts, including restructuring savings. The company continues to reinvest a portion of the productivity savings in selling and marketing, R&D and IT systems to fund future growth. Pricing actions taken in the fourth quarter should also aid it to partially mitigate commodity inflation. Growth Drivers in Place Notably, Watts Water has successfully completed its transformation efforts. The company has started to realize the expected benefits of portfolio rationalization, footprint optimization and global sourcing while simultaneously reinvesting for future growth. With completion of these efforts, the company is likely to focus on bolstering growth through new product development, geographic expansion and key account management. In the Americas, the company expects the residential and non-residential markets to grow year over year in 2018. The indicators are trending positively in the non-residential market as well. Furthermore, institutions require more complex plumbing and heating solutions, so growth in the sector is particularly beneficial to Watts Water, given its expanded product offering. In Europe, the overall outlook is generally stable. Total Europe construction spending is anticipated to grow further. In the Asia-Pacific region, the economy is expected to remain steady with China’s GDP slightly down, but still at robust levels, while the Middle East GDP is expected to be up in 2018. Notably, total construction spending in China is expected to moderately improve in 2018. Other Asia-Pacific regions will remain relatively stable. Bottom Line Investors might want to hold on to the stock at present as it has ample positive prospects of outperforming peers in the near future. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include DST Systems, Inc. , Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report). All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

865,LRCX,"Price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor’s mind while zeroing in on undervalued stocks. Though underrated, price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?To begin with, it is important to understand what book value is. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), a leading global automotive company, has a projected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 8.4%.

866,LRCX,"It’s not an easy job to find value stocks. Being aware of a company's key financial numbers, like earnings per share and sales growth, can help investors identify stocks that are trading for less than what they're worth. However, a proper analysis of the fundamentals with the help of a number of metrics is required to determine whether a stock is a good bargain or not. For narrowing down the list of undervalued stocks, price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor’s mind.

In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), a leading global automotive company, has a projected 3-5 year EPS growth rate of 8.37%.

867,LRCX,"Treasury yields have been on a tear in recent week with the 10-year yield almost touching the important 3% threshold, which caused jitters in the financial stock market in 2013. Notably, the 10-year Treasury yields hit its highest level in more than four years at 2.998% on Apr 23, pushing the gap or spread to German bonds to the widest in 29 years. Meanwhile, the two-year yields rose to high of 2.483% — the highest since September 2008.Worries about growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from the recent spike in commodity prices, especially oil and metals, triggered the rise. Per the latest CME's FedWatch tracking tool, the market is projecting 50% chances of a total of four interest rate hikes this year. This compares with 33% probability a month ago and less than 40% late last week.A Reason to WorryHigher rates would attract more capital to the country, thereby boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies. This would leave a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. Higher rates would result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.Winning SectorsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial to cyclical sectors like financial, consumer discretionary, technology and industrials.In particular, banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. If interest rates rise, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Also, insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds.Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which in turn leads to greater consumer power. An improving economy coupled with a surging stock market will continue to add wealth effect, resulting in higher consumer confidence, and making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields. The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace, leading to increased IT spending.While there are several compelling options in these sectors, a few of them have potentially superior weighting methodologies with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a Growth Score of B or better and a projected this year double-digit earnings growth. Below, we have presented a bunch of stocks that will thrive in the rising rates environment.Commerce Bancshares Inc.

868,LRCX,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market was badly hit last week amid a spate of negative news from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research LRCX.Taiwan Semiconductor reduced its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Notably, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3% on Apr 19, marking the biggest one-day drop for the index since Feb 8. In the past week, the index was down 4.4%.Additionally, the analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch dampened the mood by cutting the price target on chipmakers with heavy exposure to Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report). The analyst expects chip stocks to go 4-7% lower (read: Should You Snap Up Downtrodden Semiconductor ETFs Now?).As a result, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) shed more than 4% each last week and clearly underperformed the broad technology fund (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK lost just 0.2% in the same time frame. The weak trend might continue this earnings season given the lack of positive Earnings ESP but a series of positive estimate revision could provide some upside.According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Most of the chipmakers like Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT are less likely to surprise this quarter while NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) is poised to beat estimates. Let’s delve into the earnings picture of those that have a higher allocation to the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q1 earnings unfold. SOXX is largely concentrated on the five firms, with a combined share of 35.5%, followed by 27.8% for SMH and 24.5% for PSI.Inside Our Earnings PredictionTexas Instruments is set to report on Apr 24, after market close. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -1.39%, indicating lesser chances of beating estimates this quarter. The earnings estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter has gone up by couple of cents in the past 90 days. The earnings surprise track over the past four quarters is also good, with an average beat of 7.04%. The stock has a VGM Score of B (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -3.12%, indicating a lower chance of beating estimates this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 has been revised downward by 18 cents over the past three months. However, the stock delivered a positive surprise of 8.54% in the last four quarters. It has a VGM Score of C. The company is expected to report results after the closing bell on Apr 25.Intel is slated to release earnings after market close on Apr 26. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.21%, implying a beat cannot be predicted this quarter. The stock has seen a negative earnings estimate revision of couple of cents over the past 90 days for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.81% on average over the last four quarters. It has a VGM Score of A.NVIDIA, expected to report on May 8, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.65%, indicating reasonable chances of beating estimates this quarter.

The stock has a VGM Score of C (read: 6 Solid Reasons Why You Should Buy Semiconductor ETFs).Applied Materials has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, making surprise prediction difficult.

869,LRCX,"U.S. stock markets have remained highly volatile so far in April. After a fabulous run throughout 2017, market fluctuations commenced in February and have only intensified as the year has progressed. A series of political issues, escalated by protectionist policies of President Trump, have taken a toll on the stock markets.However, a closer look of the major indexes’ performances provides a silver lining. All the major indexes – Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite – provided positive returns of 4%, 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively in the last one month. Both Dow 30 and S&P 500 are trading in the green with a return of 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively, so far in April. Only Nasdaq is in negative territory with a loss of a marginal 0.1%.  The abovementioned data is clear indication of the transitory nature of volatility plaguing the stock market. In fact, tech-heavy Nasdaq is likely to return to the positive once the tech behemoths start releasing their first-quarter earnings results. At this stage, investors will be better-off picking great value stocks to stabilize their portfolio returns.Strong Economic FundamentalsU.S. economy is on a strong footing as evidenced from several recently released macro-data. In the first quarter of 2018, the labor market added 202,000 jobs on an average per month, better than the comparable period of previous two years. The ISM index for national factory activity was recorded at 59.3 in March. Notably, a reading of more than 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. This reflects that the U.S. heavy industrial sector is forging ahead with a strong momentum.  On Apr 16, the U.S. Commerce Department reported retail sales growth of 0.6% for the month of March reversing the trend of decline in last three consecutive months. On Apr 17, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s measure for industrial production rose 0.5% in March. Moreover, capacity utilization rose 0.3% in March to reach 78.0. Notably, this March reading is the highest level in three years.Robust Earnings MomentumFirst-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. In fact, investors have pinned high hopes on first-quarter 2018 earnings. Total earnings of the S&P 500 index is expected to be up 18.3% from the same period last year backed by 7.7% year-over-year growth in revenues. (Read More: Positive Revenue Surprises Lag Previous Quarter Levels)A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Three Factors May Create Immediate TurmoilDespite above mentioned positives, market volatility is likely to escalate due to three persisting factors.First, any escalation of tariff related issues between the United States and China or any other country will reignite the fear of global trade war. The U.S. government recently banned the country’s semiconductor giants to sell chipset to Chinese state-owned telecom majors, paving the way for a likely Chinese retaliation.Second, the 10-year Treasury Note yield reached 2.956% on Apr 20, its highest since January 2014. This fueled investor’s fear that inflationary pressure will be more than market expectation compelling the Fed to raise interest rate.The U.S. unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82. Moreover, Trump’s tariffs will raise general price levels. Both wage pressure and price pressure may bring back the fear of inflationary situation.Third, investors have pinned high hopes on first-quarter 2018 earnings. These massive expectations may result into short-term market volatility. High investors’ expectation may result in lofty valuations of the U.S. stock market, which, if they fail to fructify may backfire.Our Top PicksThe U.S. markets remain volatile so far in 2018. Trade related concerns, lower-than-expected earnings results and return of inflationary pressure will certainly cause more fluctuations at least in the short-term.At this juncture, it will be a prudent decision to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

874,LRCX,"Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) has further expanded its push in the global video streaming market with its first Philippine series to be released on Apr 9.The company collaborated with Filipino media company, TV5 Network to stream the 12-episode mini-series Amo, which is based on the controversial drug war of President Rodrigo Duterte, per media reports.Netflix’s vice president of Content Acquisition, Robert Roy, was quoted saying, ""Amo is a bold and suspenseful show that has the potential of capturing thrill-seeking audiences worldwide.""International Expansion – A Key Growth DriverNetflix’s strengthening international content portfolio has been the key growth driver in recent times. The diverse content portfolio is what makes the platform so attractive to users.We note that Netflix’s expanding original content portfolio and improving penetration in international markets were the key catalysts behind its strong performance last year. Subscribers in the International Streaming segment increased 41.6% year over year to 62.83 million. Paid members were 57.83 million, up 40.4%.The company has been progressing really well in India, Southeast Asia and Japan. Talking about the Asian markets, CEO Reed Hastings mentioned on the last conference call, “We’re seeing growth penetrations that look like the first couple of years of Latin America which as you know has worked out very well for the company.”We therefore believe that in order to grow in the Asian market, which has very good prospects, the company needs to expand regional programming further.Notably, Netflix plans to release 30 international original series this year, including programs from India, Korea and Japan. The company intends to produce/acquire 80 films throughout the year.Netflix has set a budget of $7.5-$8 billion for production/acquisition of original content in 2018.Although international expansion and content additions result in cost escalations in the form of technology investments and marketing expenses, it will help it to fend off competition from other content providers and help it maintain its lead, in our view.Netflix, Inc.

875,LRCX,"Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) launched Express Wi-Fi app on Google Play Store that will help users to locate nearby Wi-Fi networks and buy data packs, reports TechCrunch.While the company’s Express Wi-Fi service is already live in five countries namely India, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and Indonesia, the app is currently available in Kenya and Indonesia.We believe Facebook’s initiatives to provide “simple and secure way to access fast, affordable internet” will help the company expand its reach beyond the saturated domestic market and increase penetration in developing regions that remain under penetrated.Focus to Expand User BaseFacebook’s strategy to boost its user base is evident from the continuous efforts it has been undertaking to solidify its position in developing nations.For its Express Wi-Fi service, the company worked with carriers, Internet service providers and local entrepreneurs to help ""expand connectivity to underserved locations around the world."" Facebook launched it in India in 2017 after testing the service for two years.Facebook also launched trimmed down version of applications called Facebook Lite in 2015 and Messenger Lite in 2016 to target users in emerging nations where data connection is weak and bandwidth lower.In 2013, Facebook initiated its Internet.org project in partnership with major phone and equipment makers to increase Internet usage in developing countries. Subsequently, the company also persuaded mobile operators to join the program. Facebook has also taken measures like beaming network though satellites or even solar-powered drones in remote areas to address the lack of conventional technological infrastructure in these regions.Facebook’s growth opportunity in the emerging markets is evident from its last quarterly results. The social media giant recorded 14% year-over-year increase in Daily Active Users (DAUs) to a staggering 1.40 billion, which was primarily attributed to growth in markets like India, Indonesia and Brazil. Notably, these markets represented 66% of 2.13 billion MAUs in the fourth quarter.Moreover, we believe these initiatives will attract more advertisers to the platform and propel the company’s advertising revenues by expanding its audience base.Facebook, Inc.

876,LRCX,"Investors in search of great value opportunities in the semiconductor industry might look no further than Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT’s size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 50% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company’s improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT’s full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock’s recent surge, AMAT’s positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What’s more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here’s Applied’s Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group: AMAT’s peer group includes ASML Holding (ASML  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), and Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS  -  Free Report). Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT’s P/S of 4.1 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now—about 40% less than its industry’s average.Still, the foundation of AMAT’s is only getting stronger right now, and the stock’s Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Want more market analysis from this author?

877,LRCX,"Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) is launching Facebook Lite application in more countries including developed nations like United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand.The trimmed down version of the Facebook application was introduced by the company in 2015 to target users in emerging nations where data connection is weak and bandwidth lower.Talking about the necessity of the app in developed nations, Reuters quoted a company representative saying, ""We've seen that even in some developed markets people can have lower connectivity, so we want to make sure everyone has the option to use this app if they want,""The app is currently available in 100 countries. We believe that with the recent launch, the company will be able to cater to a larger audience and expand its user base further.Notably, Facebook has gained 31.3% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 23.3% rally. Expansion to Drive GrowthFacebook is leaving no stones unturned to target more users. The company’s user base continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve engagement.Like Facebook Lite, the company offers another stripped down app, Messenger Lite, which is designed for users with poor network speed and limited storage.In December 2017, the company unveiled a new messaging application called Messenger Kids for children below the age of 13 in the United States.In the last reported quarter, the company’s Daily Active Users (DAUs) increased 14% year over year to 1.40 billion. We note that in the quarter, almost 700K DAUs declined in the United States and Canada sequentially due to the company’s News Feed changes to limit public content, news and video.We believe the latest initiative of Facebook will allow the company to significantly boost its user base and solidify its position in both developed and developing markets, despite severe competition from prime players like Google and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).

879,LRCX,"Logitech International S.A.’s (LOGI  -  Free Report) brand, Logitech G, recently expanded its range of high-performance gear portfolio with the roll out of two products.The company introduced Logitech G560 PC Gaming Speaker and Logitech G513 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, both designed for the requirements of gamers. The latest G513 keyboard and G560 speakers with LIGHTSYNC would complement the company’s G502, the best selling gaming mouse globally, in creating a complete gaming solution.Notably, the Logitech G560 is the first gaming speaker system to boast Logitech G LIGHTSYNC technology that helps in synchronization of light and sounds to gameplay. With the LIGHTSYNC technology, Logitech G560 synchronizes RGB lighting and powerful audio to on-screen gameplay. Moreover, this gaming speaker features multiple connection options that include USB, 3.5mm and Bluetooth. These features combined with the built-in Logitech Easy-Switch technology allows users to switch flawlessly between any four connected devices.Additionally, the Logitech G513 features LIGHTSYNC RGB, that offers options for two Romer-G mechanical key switches and a premium palm rest. Both the Logitech G560 PC Gaming Speaker and G513 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard are likely to be accessible from the beginning of April 2018, at retail outlets.Our Take We believe that increased adoption of new mobile platforms, in both mature and emerging markets, is fueling the demand for Logitech’s peripherals and accessories. For instance, this leading computer peripherals company realized its highest quarterly sales ever and maximum sales growth in seven years in third-quarter fiscal 2018. This outperformance was driven by robust sales across product categories and strong momentum in Gaming, Mobile Speakers and Video Collaboration businesses. Consequently, shareholders seemed to be impressed with the company’s prospects. In the past three months, shares of Logitech have rallied 18% significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.9%.  Furthermore, the company is intending to tap the high potential market for accessories by pursuing innovation and expanding its product lines. Already, it has manufactured innovative offerings like fastest performing mouse and keyboard switches, and wireless mouse with longest battery, among others. Some of the notable products introduced over the past few months include Pro Gaming Mouse, upgraded version of Boom and Megaboom product line, Ultimate Ears Wonderboom and SmartDock. Additionally, Logitech is highly optimistic about the strong demand for Jaybird products. With such a strong product roster and excellent demand, the company remains very confident about the market traction of its offerings in coming times.Meanwhile, Logitech has been able to leverage its software and go-to-market capabilities to drive market share gains and growth. Encouragingly, the company is focused on venturing into new businesses and over the past three years. It has grown successful businesses including Bluetooth Speakers and Video Collaboration via advanced offerings. Moreover, Logitech’s cloud-based video conferencing services were among the key growth drivers.Despite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the rising trend for smaller, mobile computing devices with touch interfaces and the declining popularity of desktop PCs have rapidly changed the market and usage models for PC peripherals and webcams. Also, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s revenues are prone to be affected by the adverse impact of currency translation as the majority portion of it comes from outside the United States.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc.

883,LRCX,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8.

The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 285.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter earnings is pegged at 12 cents per share.

Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $84.94 billion, showcasing 23.7% growth from the year-ago quarter actual figure.Factors to ConsiderThe company enriched its portfolio during the quarter with two additions namely, “Compensation Management and Surveys”.

884,LRCX,"Qorvo Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) recently unveiled QPD1025 RF transistor. The company asserts that it is the world’s highest power transistor functioning at 65 volts with 1.8KW. This futuristic — gallium nitride on silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC) RF transistor — is likely to find significant application in defense and avionics.QPD1025 features remarkable 15% drain efficiency improvement over LDMOS. It enhances duty cycle performance and pulsed power of silicon bipolar and silicon LDMOS devices. The high power density product renders the practice of combining amplifiers redundant. The innovative transistor excludes diamond integration for thermal management, making it economical as well.The aforementioned features combined with reduced size, extended gain and reach, and exceptional signal integrity makes the solution an ideal choice for ‘‘L-band avionics and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) applications.”Upbeat Q3, IDP Outlook PositiveThe company’s shares have returned 20.5% year over year, outperforming the 10.6% rally of the industry. The growth can be attributed to strong top-line growth driven by a robust portfolio.In third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues on a non-GAAP basis increased 2.4% year over year to $844.8 million. The company’s Infrastructure and Defense (“IDP”) segment reported revenues of $203 million which grew 20% year over year. Growth can be attributed to strong demand for the company’s solutions in defense (advanced radars and other electronic warfare products), surge in GaN revenues and connectivity (Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications).For fiscal year 2019, the company projects robust IDP growth, driven by higher trends in defense IoT and GaN.What Investors Need To Know?Specifically catering to RF GaN market for 2016-2021 time frame, The Strategy Analytics Strategic Component Applications (SCA) group estimates the revenue to reach $733 million in 2021 implying a CAAGR (compound annual average growth rate) of 14.1%.Per a MarketsandMarkets report, the GaN power device market is projected to grow at CAGR of 29.1% to reach $1.89 billion by 2023. The base year, 2016 valuation was $0.327 million and the time period under consideration is 2017-2023.Introduction of QPD1025 strengthens Qorvo’s GaN portfolio. Deliverance of high maturity processes along with high reliability gives the company’s product a competitive edge in the market. The company is capitalizing on the lucrative prospects developing in defense and avionics by rendering effective GaN solutions.However, significant exposure to China is a significant headwind for Qorvo.

886,LRCX,"A stock at a 52-week high level is perceived a winner. This level works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.Quite often, investors start wondering if this level has made the stock an overpriced one. While they are not totally incorrect, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, a decision to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels makes an investor miss out on most of the top gainers.A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception.

887,LRCX,"When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits, one should explore another time-tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks. Translated, one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.At the core, momentum investing is buying high, selling higher. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift. Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does the momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works. For instance, there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in the prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period of time and across markets. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the eight stocks that made it through this screen:Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), which operates as a retailer of technology products, services, and solutions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, has gained an impressive 59.3% over the past year.

This was driven primarily by solid results from satellite and space applications, and slightly by the Vectron acquisition.The data center segment generated revenues of $109 million, accounting for 22% of the total revenues, down 4% sequentially and up 2.5% year over year. This was contributed by the acceptance of telemetry interface devices based on the Bluetooth low-energy standard.The industrial sector reported 16% of the total revenues, which stayed flat sequentially and was up 6% from the prior-year quarter.

R&D expenses are expected to increase from $3.5 million to $7.5 million primarily due to a full quarter of expense from Vectron and key product tapeouts.The company believes that revenue growth, and improved operating efficiencies as well as margins will increase free cash flow generation.

893,LRCX,"DST Systems Inc.  reported impressive fourth-quarter 2017 results, beating expectations on both counts.The company’s non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.11 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. It also registered a year-over-year increase of 33.7%.Quarter DetailsTotal revenues in the fourth quarter came in at $593.9 million, up 48.9% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 47.9% year over year to $552.7 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $527 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining portion of Boston Financial Data Services (""BFDS"") and International Financial Data Services U.K. (""IFDS U.K.""), which generated $179.7 million of additional operating revenues during the quarter.In first-quarter 2017, DST changed its reportable segment structure, which splits the previously reported Financial Services segment, into two new segments — Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services. The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 27.3% year over year and came in at $315.9 million. This segment was positively impacted by ALPS that received a reimbursement of an insurance claim that was wrongly generated in the year-ago quarter due to a processing error. Additionally, BFDS revenues boosted the performance of the segment. Management noted that during the quarter, the company signed a new contract  spanning 7 years with one of its most prominent customers and also entered into a 10-year contract with a new client for providing retirement servicing and mutual fund related solutions.Non-GAAP operating income of the segment increased 4% from the year-ago quarter. However, operating margin contracted 400 basis points (bps) from fourth-quarter 2016 to 17.9%. Though additional revenues from the BFDS acquisition were beneficial, operating expenses surged due to increased costs for supporting the company’s information technology transformation, other infrastructure needs and higher non-cash stock-based compensation.International Financial Services Segment increased from $28.5 million in the year-ago quarter to $145.1 million, primarily owing to the acquisition of the remaining portions of IFDS U.K. However, management is a bit worried about the news of two of its major clients leaving the platform by 2018 end.The additional revenues from the buyout led to the $20 million year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating income. However, the investments related to the clients of the company’s wealth management platform slightly offset the increase. Non-GAAP operating margin for this segment increased 330 bps from the year-ago quarter to 16.3%.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 5.9% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $105.3 million, primarily due to client migrations and lower consulting and professional services revenues, pertaining to healthcare regulations related uncertainties. Nevertheless, management is optimistic about the renewal of a contract with the second largest client of this segment till Dec 31, 2020.Non-GAAP operating income for the segment increased 0.4% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by organic growth and increase in high-value services. Non-GAAP operating margin increased 150 bps to reach 23.9% in the quarter. Consolidated non-GAAP operating income increased 26.8% year over year and came in at $105.5 million. However, operating margin was down from 22.3% reported in the year-ago quarter to 19.1%.DST Systems reported non-GAAP net income of $67.5 million compared with $53.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the quarter with $80.5 million in cash and equivalents compared with $140.7 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $537.1 million compared with $644.8 million in the previous quarter.During the fourth quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 1.3 million shares worth $75 million. The company has $150 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase program.DST Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DST Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DST Systems, Inc. QuoteFull Year 2017 FiguresFor full year 2017, the company reported operating revenues of $1.9 billion that witnessed an increase of 35.2% from the previous year.

The acquisition, which is subject to approval by shareholders, regulatory authorities’ clearance and other closing conditions, is anticipated to close by the third quarter of 2018.Our TakeDST Systems reported stellar fourth-quarter results backed by the acquisition of the remaining portions of BFDS and IFDS U.K.We believe that the Financial Services segment of the company will boost the company’s top line going forward.

Facebook also revealed that it has tweaked News Feed ranking, which will “help surface videos people are proactively seeking out and coming back to on Facebook.”Two new metrics that include Ad Break impressions and Ad Break CPMs at the video level have been introduced by Facebook to help advertisers gauge the performance of ads.The company is also encouraging longer videos, spanning a minimum three minutes. Publishers will be able to insert advertisements after a minute’s gap. Previously, ads were placed after a gap of 20 seconds in a video with a minimum duration of 90 seconds. The company also struck a deal with Universal Music Group to make videos more attractive.Facebook also increased investments in producing more video content for the Watch tab, launched in August last year, exclusively dedicated to video viewing.All these factors are expected to increase user engagement and attract more advertisers to the platforms, thereby giving a significant boost to its top line.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

897,LRCX,"On Jan 12, we issued an updated research report on GoDaddy Inc. (GDDY  -  Free Report).GoDaddy is engaged in the designing and development of cloud-based technology products for small businesses, Web design professionals and individuals.Growth DriversNotably, GoDaddy has outperformed the industry on a 12-month basis. Shares of the company have gained approximately 46.2% compared with the industry’s growth of nearly 45.8% in the same time period.GoDaddy has a well-diversified product portfolio, which will continue to drive its revenue base. The most important among these is the growing demand for security products. Given that cybercrime is increasingly becoming a concern, GoDaddy has been continuously investing in security and compliance technology.Recently, the company announced the expansion of its security product portfolio with the launch of GoDaddy Website Security. Also, GoDaddy's new mobile-optimized website builder, GoCentral, has been gaining momentum and will be contributing to the company's top-line growth.GoDaddy’s focus on international expansion keeps the growth prospects high. The company has more than 5 million customers outside of the United States, notably Canada, India and the United Kingdom. In 2016, GoDaddy derived approximately 28% of the total bookings from international sales compared with 25% and 26% in 2014 and 2015, respectively.In order to continue expanding its international presence, the company is investing in technology, marketing programs and customer care teams. Moreover, the acquisition of HEG will help the company in increasing its customer base by more than 40%, thus further expanding its international business.GoDaddy is quite active on the acquisition front. Last year, the company completed the acquisition of Host Europe Group (“HEG”), a European web hosting provider, for €1.69 billion (US$1.79 billion). The deal will strengthen GoDaddy’s foothold in the European market. In 2016, the company acquired Serbia-based WordPress site management tool maker, ManageWP. This deal will enable GoDaddy to provide a single destination for web professionals to manage their WordPress sites. The acquisition was intended to augment GoDaddy’s portfolio and build its global market share.Positive Earnings Surprise History: GoDaddy has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 120.8%.HeadwindsThe company has a high debt burden of more than $1 billion. This in turn will take up a lot of cash flow to cover interest payments and make it difficult for the company to navigate if the economy weakens. The debt has to be paid off or refinanced in 2019 and 2021. There remains a risk that lenders might be unwilling to finance the company then and interest rates could also Increase. This will make it harder for GoDaddy to earn profits.GoDaddy faces intense competition in domain, hosting and presence markets from companies like Endurance, Rightside, and Web.com, as well as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which provide web-hosting and other cloud-based services.  Along with these big cloud companies, a lot of small hosting companies offer extremely affordable services.GoDaddy Inc.

901,LRCX,"Value investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, in case of loss-making companies that have a negative Price-to-Earnings ratio, the Price-to-Sales or P/S ratio is considered in determining their true value.However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityNow let us understand the concept of book value.What is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), an automotive, financial services and mobility company, has a Zacks Rank #2.

902,LRCX,"Debt financing is a common practice among corporates to ensure smooth operations and business expansion. This is because depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is impracticable.Although companies may raise capital through equity financing, debt financing has always been a favored choice. While debt financing brings with it the liability of interest payment, it provides funding at lower rates than equity financing, especially in periods of historically low interest rates. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Yet, debt financing has its drawbacks. Since too much debt increases the cost of capital for the company, bearing huge debt tends to shoot up the company’s risk of bankruptcy, especially in times of economic crisis.With the Federal Reserve having raised their benchmark interest rate last December and two more hikes expected by analysts this year, the debt scenario does not seem very favorable for U.S. stocks.The fact that only a fortunate few can avoid taking debt, should not dissuade investors from betting on stocks. Instead, a prudent investor will try to pick stocks that are less financially leveraged as companies with high debt load are risky options.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to save investors from debt traps. The debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company’s credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.With the Q4 reporting cycle about to begin, investors will tend to target stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth.But choosing stocks that boast earnings growth only might not be a wise investment strategy. A higher degree of leverage can turn an attractive investment option into a nightmare in times of financial crisis.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen.Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP  -  Free Report): This is a midstream energy company that owns, operates, develops and acquires midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin.

904,LRCX,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 1. All eyes will be on the performance of the company’s latest flagship device — iPhone X.iPhone, since its launch in 2007, has been the mainstay of the tech giant’s revenues. On an average, 50-60% of Apple’s quarterly revenues come from iPhone.Apple’s first smartphone to feature a full-screen organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, the 10th anniversary iPhone started selling across the globe on Nov 3, 2017. Hence, first-quarter revenues will include almost five weeks of sales including the crucial Black Friday and Christmas week.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q1 performance is expected to be.Lackluster iPhone X Demand The premium device received warm welcome from customers initially. According to data from analytics firm Mixpanel, quoted by Business Insider, iPhone X adoption was at 4.76%, better than iPhone 8 Plus at 3.59% and iPhone 8 at 2.78% in late November 2017.However, the device failed to catch up later due to significant supply constraint issues, which affected Apple’s delivery schedules. Further, premium pricing — iPhone X starts at $999 — has also lowered demand, particularly in cost sensitive regions like South East Asia.According to Nikkei, which was quoted by The Inquirer, Apple recently slashed its production target by half from almost 40 million projected at the time of iPhone X release. Apple has cited sluggish holiday season salesfor its decision to cut production.Although the production cut will have no imminent negative impact, it is to be noted that slower-than-expected holiday season sales in key markets like the United States, Europe and China doesn’t bode well for the company’s top-line growth.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. Quote However, demand for the low-priced iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 continued to be strong during the holiday season. According to TechCrunch, which quoted data from Flurry Analytics, older devices took the top spots in terms of activations during the holidays, primarily due to heavy discounts.Higher ASPs to Boost SalesNevertheless, Apple’s premium pricing strategy along with brand loyalty is likely to boost the top line in the quarter. iPhone X’s premium pricing drives average selling price (ASP), which will offset a decline in unit volume sales. This will drive top-line growth in the quarter.This is well reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate. For the first quarter, total revenues from iPhone and related products and services are projected at around $59.3 billion, up 9.1% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderApple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and The Trade Desk (TTD  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

905,LRCX,"Shutterfly, Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) stock witnessed an upside after the company announced robust fourth-quarter 2017 results and the acquisition of leading online photography company, Lifetouch on Jan 31.Shares of the online photo-based product retailer jumped to an all-time high of $68.28 the same day, before closing a tad lower at $68.15. The stock gained 27.8% on the day.The turn of events is quite significant for the company as it has been grappling with a soft consumer spending environment due to considerable consumer debt levels, uncertainty in real estate markets and home values, fluctuating energy and commodity costs and limited credit availability.The stock has returned 31.7% in the past year, significantly underperforming the industry’s massive 61.6% rally.Fourth Quarter Earnings and Revenues BeatOwing to the seasonal nature of its business, Shutterfly usually incurs losses in the first three quarters followed by earnings in the last quarter of the year, which is good enough to make up for the three previous quarter losses and put up some notable yearly earnings.Shutterfly, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Shutterfly, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Shutterfly, Inc. QuoteAdjusted EPS of $3.11 witnessed strong growth, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.9% and increasing 18% year over year. Moreover, the figure came ahead of the company’s own guided range of $2.60 to $3.00. The improvement came on the back of a higher top line and expense control.Net revenues of $593.8 million increased 6% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of $557 million by 6.6%. The top line also came ahead of the guided range of $538 million to $568 million.In fact, the fourth-quarter marked the 68th consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue growth. The solid growth was driven by strong performance across both consumer and Shutterfly Business Solutions (SBS) segments.A Massive Strategic AcquisitionConcurrent with the earnings announcement, Shutterfly said that it has reached a deal to acquire Lifetouch, a privately held online photography company for $825 million cash. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.We believe that the buyout will help Shutterfly significantly expand customer base and boost its consumer segment revenues. On the strength of that deal, the company expects to add approximately $935 million to its net revenues and $100 million to its adjusted EBITDA over the 12 months following the closure of the deal. By 2020, the company targets a minimum $450 million of adjusted EBITDA.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderShutterfly sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

910,LRCX,"The Driehaus strategy is one of the best investment approaches for those with a high-risk appetite. Using this strategy, investors can pick momentum stocks, in order to get great returns. Richard Driehaus formulated this strategy using the buy high and sell higher principle, which eventually helped him secure a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

911,LRCX,"Symantec Corporation's (SYMC  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the guidance. Non-GAAP revenues however missed the consensus mark and also fell short of the company’s expectations.Management attributed the dismal revenue performance to a faster-than-expected shift to ratable and subscription-based revenue model, wherein revenues are recognized at a later date. However, management is optimistic about the shift as it promises long-term growth opportunities for the company.The company’s dismal top-line performance sends it shares down 2.3% during yesterday’s after hour trade. Notably, the stock has significantly underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the last one year period. Symantec has lost 0.1% of its value in the said period while the industry is up 42.2%. Quarter in DetailOn a non-GAAP basis, Symantec generated revenues of $1.234 billion, up 13% on a year-over-year basis. The figure also fell short of the mid-point of management’s projection of $1.250-$1.280 billion (mid-point $1.265 billion).Symantec’s revenues of $1.209 billion on a GAAP basis jumped 16% year over year but could not meet the mid-point of its guidance of $1.227-$1.257 billion (mid-point $1.242 billion).Moreover, revenues, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.278 billion.Notably, with a move toward a “more ratable product mix” in the Enterprise revenue model, the company is focusing on implied billings and deferred revenue growth as it provides better predictability as revenues are not recognized upfront.Segment wise, Consumer Digital Safety witnessed an increase of 4% while Enterprise Security division declined 1% from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, deferred revenues, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures for Consumer Digital Safety grew 5%. Enterprise Security segment increased 23% on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP implied billings grew 32.1% on a year-over-year basis.Symantec’s non-GAAP gross profit of $985 million was up 15.5%. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin increased 140 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 79.8%.Furthermore, non-GAAP operating income surged 40% year over year to $463 million, while margin expanded 710 bps to 37.5%. Moreover, non-GAAP operating margin was above the high end of the company’s guidance range of 36¬¬–37%. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by increasing operational efficiency “including the completion of the net cost reduction and synergy programs.”Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $328 million compared with $209 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Notably, as a result of the recent tax reforms, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was reduced from 29.5% to 26.8% and the year-to-date tax rate was adjusted accordingly.Management noted that the company received a tax benefit of around $1.6 billion, pertaining to certain “adjustments to previous deferred tax liabilities related to foreign earnings and re-measurement of U.S. deferred income taxes.” However, it was partially counterpoised with a one-time transition tax of $800 million.    The company reported earnings of 49 cents per share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share and increased 53.1% on a year-over-year basis. The figure was positively impacted by elevated operating margins and the changes in effective tax rate.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowSymantec exited the fiscal third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.532 billion compared with $2.026 billion recorded in the prior quarter. The company ended the third quarter with gross debt of $5.7 billion. Long-term debt was $5.587 billion at the end of fiscal third quarter.During the quarter, Symantec generated operating cash flow of $294 million.GuidanceConsidering the effect of faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition”, the company lowered its revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.For the fiscal, Symantec now expects GAAP revenues in the range of $4.790-$4.820 billion (mid-point $4.805 billion) and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $4.915-$4.945 billion (mid-point $4.930 billion), down from the previous guidance of $4.877-$4.977 billion (mid-point $4.927 billion) and $5 -$5.1 billion (mid-point $5.087 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged at $5.04 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between $1.60 and $1.64, down from the earlier forecast of $1.66-$1.76. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.68.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Symantec anticipates GAAP and non-GAAP revenues in the range of $1.164-$1.194 billion (mid-point $1.179 billion) and $1.175-$1.205 billion (mid-point $1.190 billion), respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.28 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 33-34%. However, on a GAAP basis, it expects to report an operating margin between (1%) to break-even. Further, management estimates earnings between 37 cents and 41 cents on a non-GAAP basis for the fiscal fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 50 cents.Bottom LineThe company’s cross selling strategies are proving to be worthy. Realignment of the sales force increased deals worth above $1 million from 37 in the first quarter to over 100 in the third quarter. The accelerated adoption of the company’s Integrated Cyber Defense Platform and cloud proxy solution is a major tailwind for the company.Notably, Symantec’s acquisition of BlueCoat, which assisted the company in winning a deal with a prominent construction company during the quarter, is encouraging. The addition of a Fortune 500 financial services company to its clientele is yet another positive.However, management slightly disappointed as it was not able to properly assess the faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more “ratable revenue recognition”. Nevertheless, management is extremely optimistic about the long-term performance of the company due to the shift in the subscription-based revenue model as customers are increasingly preferring the same.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSymantec has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report),  The Trade Desk Inc. (TTD  -  Free Report) and Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

912,LRCX,"The year 2017 was a blockbuster year for investors as all the three major indices indicating the health of the U.S. market closed at record levels. An improved economic data for GDP, steady job additions, a favorable Consumer Confidence Index as well as factory activity data kept investors optimistic about the economy.The Tech sector was one of the largest beneficiaries of this rally, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) registering a return of 32.2% in the last year, on top of a 12.9% gain it registered in 2016.Tech Stocks Poised for Further GrowthThe technology sector is likely to grow further in 2018, as evident from the recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) on worldwide IT spending. The latest report from the independent research firm projects global IT spending to reach $3.7 trillion this year, representing an increase of 4.3% from $3.5 trillion projected in 2017.The sector will continue to benefit from the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.However, in our opinion, the major push will come from the recently-passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax bill as it will bring double benefit for tech companies. Firstly, it will lift corporate earnings and secondly, as companies across other sectors might utilize savings from lower tax as well as cash repatriations for technological upgradation this will again be conducive for the tech stocks.Naturally, investing in the tech space makes perfect sense at this point.Where to Put Your Money?Today, we’ve zeroed-in on some tech stocks using our premium screen “VGM Style Score” which had performed phenomenally last year and have the potential to carry the momentum this year as well.Our first choice is the world’s leading memory chip maker — Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report). The main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improved prices for DRAM and NAND chips. This is primarily due to imbalances between industry demand and supply, which are leading to periodic shortage and temporary price hike. We believe Micron will continue its outperformance as long as demand for memory chips remains ahead of supply.Based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Micron is anticipated to finish fiscal 2018 with EPS growth of 102.2% and sales growth of 36.9%. Micron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock and has a VGM Score of A. Last year, the stock rallied 87.5%.

DXC Technology is a result of the merger between Computer Sciences Corporation and Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which was concluded on Apr 1, 2017.The merger has opened up avenues of growth and will help the combined entity become a leading player in the IT services domain. Post merger, DXC Technology became the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc. Since April 1 through Dec 29, 2017, shares of DXC Technology gained 37.6%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, DXC Technology has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10.5%. On top of this, the stock currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 13.2x, which is lower than the industry average of 29x.

914,LRCX,"With a major overhaul in tax laws in more than 30 years, U.S. corporates are expected to see a significant increase in their cash pile. While the slashing of the corporate tax from 35% to 21% will lead to a rise in profit after tax, a cash repatriation window will allow multinational corporations to bring in cash stashed in foreign countries. Boosted by the surge in domestic cash, many companies may opt for mergers & acquisitions (M&A), share buybacks or dividend pay-out next year or beyond.Here we will focus on stocks, which are expected to pay better dividends in 2018 than their industry peers and also have growth prospects. While the upside momentum of the market may continue amid strong manufacturing data, rising corporate profits and interest rates, risks of a downside remain. In such an environment, investors can add these stocks to their portfolio to enjoy a steady stream of cashGenerally, companies paying dividends are financially stable accruing profits in established markets. Share buyback programs and dividend payouts boost investor confidence in the company, thereby raising its market value. However, with interest rates rising in the United States, some amount of cash may flow to the debt market. However, this does not weaken the prospects of dividend investing. With investors getting worried about the Bull Run and many even expecting a correction, dividend paying companies are better bets for 2018.7 Amazing Dividend StocksIt is no easy task to select outperformers given the vast size of the market. Therefore, we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, we are also taking into account VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. With our Style Score system, we have identified stocks that have potential to beat the market.The score allows one to streamline their search to select winners by eliminating the negative aspects. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM score, we have chosen large-cap companies. This lowers the risk of the portfolio as these companies are less susceptible to market volatility. Moreover, the companies have seen EPS, sales and dividend payout increase in the last five years. Although, past growth is not an indicator of future movement, it helps to select companies that have a higher probability of paying dividends. The companies have also performed better than the S&P 500 this year. However, these have a low PEG ratio, which suggests room for upside.Here are seven of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and sells computer, networking, and communications platforms worldwide.

917,LRCX," Welcome to Episode #74 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.This is the last podcast of 2017. That means it’s a great time to look back at what worked, and what didn’t, this year.And while growth stocks had a phenomenal year, it wasn’t all bad for value stocks either.The Hottest Value Stocks of 2017 Two industries, the semiconductors and the homebuilders, had magical years and they also happened to be mostly value stocks throughout 2017.The Semiconductor ETF SOXX has gained about 41% year-to-date while the SPDR Homebuilders ETF XHB is up roughly 30%. If you were in the iShares US Home Construction ETF ITB you’re up even more, gaining 56%.Those are extraordinary gains in an extraordinary year for stock investors.But what will happen to stocks in those two industries in 2018?Are they still values? And can they keep the momentum?The Homebuilders are Still out of FavorThe homebuilder stocks don’t get any love from mom and pop investors, even though they have soared in 2017. That’s a bullish sign for 2018.Here are two homebuilder stocks that are still cheap and have attractive earnings growth.1.     DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) is up 85% year-to-date but still trade with a forward P/E of just 16. It’s one of the largest homebuilders, with a $19 billion market cap. Earnings estimates are on the rise over the last 2 months. Earnings are expected to grow 17.4% in fiscal 2018 and another 14.6% in fiscal 2019.2.    TRI Pointe Group (TPH  -  Free Report) united 6 home building brands after the housing bust to build homes in 8 states. It’s now one of the 10 largest homebuilders in America. Despite shares soaring over 55% on the year, TPH still trades with a forward P/E of just 13.5. It’s expected to have double digit earnings growth in 2018.Is the Semiconductor Cycle Peaking?No sector was hotter, in either growth or value, than the semiconductors in 2017.But the question plaguing the industry heading into 2018 is if the cycle has peaked. Historically, when demand outstrips supply, the industry has ramped up production so much that it has brought down prices.But Micron recently reported earnings and it said it still saw demand outstripping supply through 2018.The semiconductors, despite their incredible gains in 2017, are still dirt cheap.3 Semiconductor Stocks for 20181.     Micron (MU  -  Free Report) reported another solid quarter in December 2017. Earnings are expected to rise 98% in fiscal 2018. With the sharp increase in the earnings estimates, it’s now trading with a forward P/E of just 4.3. Whoa.2.    Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report) is often overlooked by investors probably because its headquartered in Pennsylvania. Yet earnings are expected to rise 66% in 2017 and another 6% next year. It’s still cheap, with a PEG ratio of only 0.7.3.    Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) is still expected to see earnings growth of 47% in fiscal 2018. Shares are still a value with a forward P/E of just 12.5 and a PEG of 0.9. Investors even get a 1% dividend yield.Neither of these industries are showing the signs of being value traps. On the contrary. Both continue to see rising earnings estimates, not declining.While it’s hard to buy in after a big run like they’ve had in 2017, the valuations are still attractive. Remember, to do your research before jumping into any stock.What else should you know about these two hot industries?Tune into this final Value Investor Podcast of 2017 to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

918,LRCX,"The semiconductor industry has been one of the outperformers of 2017. Notably, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), which represents semiconductor stocks, has witnessed a year-to-date (YTD) gain of approximately 38.9%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report), which represents the overall technology sector, has returned 32.6% during the same time period. This gain is way higher than the YTD returns of 19.7% and 28.9%, respectively clocked by the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) remains one of the outstanding performers in the semiconductor space. The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of the year and has appreciated more than 92% in the YTD period. This robust performance has been mainly spurred by the company’s phenomenal results in last few quarters.Notably, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, generating an average positive surprise of 10.2%. Micron recorded significant top- and bottom-line year-over-year growth, during this period, primarily driven by improved pricing as well as elevated demand for DRAM and NAND chips.Nevertheless, we fear Micron’s remarkable run might not continue into the next year as the stock’s forward price-earnings multiple is hovering near to its industry average. The company’s shares currently trade at a forward P/E multiple of 5.3x, while the industry average is 5.6x. Therefore, we believe the stock will definitely go up in 2018 but not as much as it did in the current year.Therefore, as we approach 2018, we should look for stocks that have the potential to record significant growth like Micron did in 2017.Other Picks in the IndustryAs the U.S. economy is rebounding, we believe there are tremendous growth opportunities for the semiconductor stocks in 2018. The industry is poised to benefit from the increasing demand for chips that are used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Also, the recently-passed Tax Cuts And Jobs Act will benefit the technology sector as companies across sectors might utilize savings from lower tax as well as cash repatriations for technological upgradation. This will again be conducive for the semiconductors space.Additionally, as per latest predictions from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor sales are likely to increase 7% in 2018.Right now, the semiconductor segment has several promising stocks to choose from. Here we have picked four semiconductor stocks that have performed well in the year so far and have the potential to retain the momentum in the coming year as well. These stocks also have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), VGM Style Score of A or B, and lower P/E multiple than the industry average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Four Promising StocksOur first choice is the world’s largest chip maker — Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report). Though this stock came late to the party, it is poised to witness tremendous growth in 2018 due to its strategy of focusing on fast-growing data-centric business model. Notably, for the last few quarters, Intel has been benefiting from the robust performance of the Data Center Group, IoT Group, and Non-Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group.Further, in a move to boost its PC market share, the company has been continuously bringing in new advanced products such as Xeon Scalable, Core 8 chips, Myriad X and next-generation desktop processors. The latest desktop processors are expected to back Intel's gaming endeavors amid stiff competition from AMD and NVIDIA.In addition, anticipated improvement in the company’s cost structure and lower spending, primarily due to its improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Style Score of A. Moreover, Intel currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 14.2x, which is lower than the industry average of 20.2x. Year to date, the company has gained 27.1%. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Another pick is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), which supplies wafer fabrication equipment (“WFE”) and services to the semiconductor industry. The improving WFE market, strong demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology will continue to propel the company’s growth. The stock has rallied 74.3%, in the year so far.Based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Lam is anticipated to finish fiscal 2018 with EPS growth of 48% and sales growth of 50%. On top of this, the stock currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 12.5x, which is lower than the industry average of 20.1x. Lam is a Zacks Rank #2 stock and has a VGM Score of B.Our next pick is Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report), which is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market and has been benefiting from the rising demand for SSD products. The storage market is witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume and especially exponential growth in unstructured data. We believe the company is well positioned to grab this opportunity.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B. Also, at a forward P/E multiple at 21.5x, the company currently trades at a huge discount to the industry average of 27.0x. The company has gained 57.5% in the YTD period.The next stock which makes to our list is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) which is one of the largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD and solar PV cell manufacturers. The company is currently riding on inflection-focused innovation strategy — its key growth driver.It continues to witness technological advancements in semiconductor and display areas. Applied Materials is in a great position to grow sustainably and profitably, based on its robust pipeline of enabling technologies, supported by expanding opportunities on the semiconductor and display fronts. Also, 3D NAND, DRAM and patterning have led to significant market share gains.Applied sees significant opportunities from emerging trends on the semiconductor and display fronts, such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud infrastructure, IoT, virtual reality and smart vehicles.The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B. Also, at forward P/E multiple at 12.6x, the company currently trades at a huge discount to the industry average of 20.1x. Year to date, it has appreciated 58.2%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

919,LRCX,"Under the Trump administration, one thing that has been constant in the U.S. markets so far is uncertainty. From policy reforms affecting corporate taxes and infrastructure spending to the abolishment of Affordable Care Act to the Mexican wall, investors have always been on guard. Apart from domestic events, issues like escalating North Korea-Japan tension and terror attacks in Spain also raised concerns.However, beating the odds on the back of a rising rate environment, progress on tax reforms and improving economic backdrop, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have soared 19.9% and 25.3%, respectively, so far this year. Interestingly, the Bull Run is expected to continue into next year with markets reaching new highs.Key Catalysts for 2018Many analysts seem to harbor a bullish sentiment for 2018. Not one, but many factors are expected to support the current momentum in the markets. Let’s take a sneak peek into what’s driving the optimism.Improving U.S. Job Market Trump’s efforts to improve the country’s job scenario are remarkable. Per reports, the U.S. unemployment rate was pegged at 4.1% in November, the lowest since February 2001. Notably, the unemployment rate is projected to be 3.9% for 2018 and 2019 (per an article published on FOCUSECONOMICS).Fed Rate Hike in the CardsThe central bank plans three more rate hikes in 2018 after it recently hiked interest rates for the fifth time since the 2008 financial crisis. Moreover, it expects inflation rate to remain below the Fed’s 2% goal in the near term but “stabilize” around the target in the medium term in 2018.Notably, at the end of its latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed projected economic growth of 2.5% for 2018 (up from the prior guidance of 2.1%). Thus, continued strengthening of the labor market, rise in household spending, reduced unemployment rate and increase in business activities are expected to drive growth in 2018. This will automatically pull the market further up.U.S. Tax Reform   Overwhelmed by the victory, after the House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code since the 1980s, President Trump commented, “' We are making America great again!.”On Dec 22, President Trump signed the $1.5-trillion tax bill into law and described it as, “a bill for the middle class and a bill for jobs."" It slashes the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and will be implemented next year, instead of being delayed until 2019. The Republicans propagated the tax reform on the grounds that not only it will cut corporate taxes but also provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans.Thus, the implementation of tax legislation is expected to kindle the market with increased job creation and rise in inflation rate.President Trump’s Focus on Emerging Markets - Icing on the CakeThe United States' trade plans with emerging countries are likely to favor domestic companies. In this regard, investors may find President Trump’s 12-day Asia trip last month interesting. The visit was aimed at boosting inter-country trade relations, particularly with the emerging nations.Trump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills confidence in his APAC policies. He also emphasized “free and open Indo-Pacific trade” with a focus on the nations of Japan, Australia and India.The Winning StrategyAt this point in time when the economy is on a rebound, it seems prudent to invest in stocks that are currently trading cheap. Such stocks may not make it to the list of bigwigsIn light of this, value stocks are expected to hold enough potential to rake in more returns, unlike expensive growth stocks.Our Screening ParametersIn order to help investors identify the ideal investment choices, we have used the Zacks Stock Screener.First, we have shortlisted stocks with a Value Score of A.

920,LRCX,"In the world of business finance, leverage refers to an investment strategy that involves borrowing of funds to finance the expansion of the business, purchase of inventory and other assets as well as supporting other aspects of business operations. Now financial leverage is the amount of debt that exists in the capital structure of a company.While there exists option for equity financing, historically, debt financing has achieved more popularity among corporations when compared to equity financing. This is because, on availing debt financing, the company’s equity does not get diluted as a result of issuing more shares of stock. In other words, the borrower has no claim in the company’s shares.Yet, debt financing has got its own drawbacks. It tends to shoot up the company’s risk of bankruptcy.  This is because companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns.Nevertheless, this should not discourage one to invest in stocks. Instead, to be on the safe side, investors should measure the extent of financial leverage a company is bearing before putting their hard-earned money in its stock.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap. Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company’s credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.As we have reached almost the end of Q4, the growth picture seems to be improving compared to what we saw in the year-ago quarter. Naturally, investors are gearing up to pour money in stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth.But in the uncertain world of investment, markets can falter anytime, particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage. Therefore, blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 17 stocks that made it through the screen.Norbord Inc. (OSB  -  Free Report): This corporation is a producer of wood-based panels. It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 0.28% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #1.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

921,LRCX,"The price-to-book (P/B) ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median:A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five stocks that qualified the screening:Xcerra Corporation (XCRA  -  Free Report) engages in designing, manufacturing, and marketing automatic test equipment for the semiconductor industry.

922,LRCX,"There’s no looking back for the technology sector, as its players continue to thrive on the growing popularity of cloud-based platforms, AI solutions, AR/VR reality devices, autonomous cars and Internet of Things (IoT).The year is coming to an end with a remarkable stock market run. The NASDAQ Composite (IXIC), the S&P 500 (GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) have rallied 24.9%, 18.5% and 23.2%, respectively, so far in 2017 (till Dec 14).Among the various sectors, technology continues to shine, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) returning 32.5% year to date.Substantial growth in cloud computing and Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and launch of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech is not to end anytime soon.What is Driving Technology Sector?Factors fueling the technology sector are the emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones and virtual reality devices.High demand for power-efficient as well as high performance chips — essential for running cloud-data centers and processing massive data by using Big Data analytics — machine learning and deep-learning tools has been a key driver of technology stocks.Moreover, escalating demand for sensors and software for autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR) and Internet of Things (IoT) are noticeable catalysts to growth.The lighting pace at which the 5G platform and technology are evolving is also worthy of mention. Additionally, growing incidents of cyber attack is anticipated to drive demand for cybersecurity software.Momentum Likely to ContinueWith the global economy gathering strong momentum, technology stocks will continue to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation. The twin tailwinds of President Donald Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are driving the stocks higher. This is because the tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's proposed tax reform policy. In fact, the top five U.S. hoarders are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s.Further, most tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment. Adding to the strength is a pick-up in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.In view of these bullish sentiments, investing in stocks with big positive year-to-date returns can be a winning strategy.Key PicksUsing our easy-to-use Zacks screener, we have zeroed in on five technology stocks, which have outperformed the market and gained more than 70% year to date.

The index has been up 27.4% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 gains of 24% and 18.5%, respectively.This can be attributed to the outstanding rally of tech stocks which constitute over 50% of weightage in the index.

924,LRCX,"The top news for last week included earnings reports from Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) as well as published statements from the senate committee investigation into Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) to determine Russian meddling on their platforms. Here are the details- EarningsIntel: Intel reported strong fourth quarter numbers, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The Data Center Group (DCG) was the primary driver, and at nearly a third of the business grew 19.6%. The Internet-of-Things Group (IOTG), Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG) and Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) segments that together contributed around 13% also grew strongly.At over half its total sales, the PC-centric Client Computing Group (CCG) remained the primary drag with desktop volumes and prices being down significantly and notebook volume growth coming at the cost of much weaker pricing. The outlook remains more or less consistent with ongoing trends of a stronger data centric business partially offset by weaker PCs.The company provided for taxes on previously untaxed foreign earnings payable over eight years, which raised the GAAP tax to $5.4 billion. Tax reform has however lowered the tax rate significantly and allowed the company to raise the annual dividend by 10%.

Being a subscription service, the company’s results are driven by the subscription charge and the number of subscribers. So the 10% increase in subscription charges in the U.S. and Europe for some plans and the 24.1% increase (international grew 41.6%) in the subscriber base both contributed to the results. International subscribers now make up the larger group.Netflix’s focus on growing its roster of original and regional content as well as its acquisition of popular movies and shows has enabled it to raise the subscription charge and helped it attract more customers. Read more: Netflix Q4 Earnings In Line, Revenues Top EstimatesLam Research: Lam Research topped the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both revenue and earnings. Guidance was also much better than expected. The company expects continued strong spending this year, driven by increased adoption rates of 3D NAND, FinFETs and multi-patterning that it expects will generate continued growth. Cost cutting will ensure higher profitability.

President Trump has called the effort a witch hunt. Nonetheless, the companies appeared before the committee to submit comments that were published last week. And they seemed to have a lot to say-Facebook: Facebook stated that Russian agents created 129 events on its platform during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, that 338,300 different Facebook accounts viewed the events, that 62,500 agreed to attend and that it wasn’t aware how many events actually took place. The events were apparently on controversial and divisive issues.As regards evidence of collusion between Trump and a Russian group on social media, Facebook said it ""does not believe it is in a position to substantiate or disprove"" such allegations. As far as making money from content produced by Russia’s Internet Research Agency, or IRA is concerned, it said, ""Ads generally did not run on IRA Pages, and we expect that any revenue from such ads would be immaterial.""Facebook has also released an online tool that tells users if they followed or liked Facebook pages or Instagram accounts associated with the IRA that it would notify its users about in the coming days. Facebook said it no longer promotes Kasperky’s antivirus offerings because of the government’s espionage concerns although it is still in the process of phasing out a Kaspersky product it uses internally that doesn’t transmit data back to Kasperky Lab. It can’t however determine how many Facebook users downloaded Kaspersky software.Twitter: Twitter said that there were 2.12 million automated, election-related tweets from Russian-linked accounts that garnered 455 million impressions within the first seven days of posting. It mentioned 677,775 people in the U.S. that followed, retweeted or liked content from IRA-associated accounts at election time. Twitter will be emailing these people the facts.These accounts engaged in various activities like masquerading as local American news sources, content from which were then quoted by more than 100 news outlets, they also apparently attempted to organize rallies and demonstrations, and some were even abusive and resorted to harassment. Moreover, Russia-linked Twitter bots retweeted @realDonaldTrump posts 470,000 times (constituting 4% of the re-tweets he received from Sept. 1 to Nov. 15, 2016) and Hillary Clinton’s account nearly 50,000 times.In September, Twitter suspended about 200 Russia-linked accounts and in October, suspended ads from media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik. It is now in the process of setting up a “transparency center” that will display how much political campaigns spend on advertising, the organization funding the campaign and the targeted demographics. Twitter did say it wasn’t aware of ""any specific state-sponsored attempts to interfere in any American elections in 2017, including the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections."" Twitter said it doesn’t use products made by Kaspersky Lab.Alphabet: Alphabet earlier told the Congress that it had discovered that Russian agents spent about $4,700 on ads and launched 18 channels on YouTube, posting more than 1,100 videos that had been viewed about 309,000 times. Google also doesn’t use products made by Kaspersky Lab. Like the others, it is building a new dashboard displaying information about who buys some campaign advertisements.Amazon Go LaunchesAmazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) chose Seattle to launch the first of its checkout-free convenience store concepts dubbed Amazon Go. Built on computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning, the store promises a unique and hassle-free shopping experience: people download the app and scan it as they pass through a turnstile at the entrance to the store. Cameras and sensors fitted all over the store keep track of what they pick up or put down until they leave the store.The shoppers' Amazon accounts are charged for whatever they take with them. That’s it. The concept is interesting, and Amazon has picked up enough real estate with its book stores and the Whole Foods acquisition (although it isn’t saying Go will reach those places yet) to roll it out more broadly. But one thing to note is that it places a lot of reliance on those cameras, which can malfunction or be deliberately turned off, or simply generate incorrect results because of a heavy traffic situation, impacting the security of the store/merchandise and the customer experience. But Amazon no doubt has those details ironed out given that it has been testing the concept with its employees over the past year or so.TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL-3.9%+16.4%FB+4.8%+14.0%GOOGL+3.9%+17.8%MSFT+4.5%+24.8%INTC+11.7%+33.5%CSCO+3.1%+32.1%AMZN+8.3%+31.1% Other Stories-CorporateMS Lowers Apple Price Target: Katy Huberty and other analysts of Morgan Stanley lowered their price target to $200 from $205 while maintaining an upbeat view on the company's prospects. The analysts say that rumors about weak supply chain orders in the first half of the 2018 calendar year are ""largely noise"" and higher-end phones will make up a larger part of the mix. They therefore have their blended average selling price at $815, much higher than the consensus $752.Apple Rating Downgrades: Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell lowered his rating to neutral from overweight, but retained the $190 price target because of signs that iPhone demand is starting to soften and ""limited visibility into the potential for future iPhone cycles."" Instinet's Jeffrey Kvaal pointed to Verizon’s earnings release comments about its upgrade rate of 7.2%, which is meaningfully below what it has been after other recent iPhone launches.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that based on checks with supply chain vendors, Apple’s iPhone shipments are likely to decline about 33% sequentially in the March quarter to 51-57 million units (last year it sold 51 million units). A 30% decline in the March quarter is normal seasonality, indicating that iPhone X didn’t result in any super-cycle. JP Morgan was more pessimistic, saying the sales decline would be as much as 50%.Google Invests in Spain, France: Google will open a new support center for Europe, Middle East and Africa in the town of Oeiras on the outskirts of Lisbon in Portugal this year. The amount of Google’s investment remains unknown, but the center will create up to 500 high-skill tech jobs, according to Prime Minister Antonio Costa. Separately, CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post that Google will also be expanding operations in France.First, it will add 6,000 square meters of office space (64,500 square feet) to its Paris headquarters, taking the total headcount to a thousand. Second, it will open a new research center dedicated to artificial intelligence to tap into the local talent. Third, it will be creating Google Hubs with local partners around France, the first of which will be in Rennes. Three other hubs at unspecified locations will also be coming up soon with the goal of teaching people digital skills.Alphabet’s New Cybersecurity Unit: Alphabet has spun out a new cybersecurity unit called Chronicle from its moonshots factory called X Labs. The goal of the company is to increase “the speed and impact of security teams’ work by making it much easier, faster and more cost-effective for them to capture and analyze security signals that have previously been too difficult and expensive to find.”Based on the Google infrastructure and delivered through its cloud, Chronicle’s security intelligence and analytics platform will leverage the company’s own machine learning and search capabilities so businesses can analyze their security data more efficiently. The company also has an online virus/malware scanner on offer that came through Google’s 2012 acquisition of VirusTotal.Amazon Banking in India, Mexico: Amazon has already been offering some banking services such as more than $3 billion in loans to small businesses that sell on its platform since 2011, according to a new research report by CB Insights via Bloomberg. Moreover, over 33 million people currently use its payments service and its recently-introduced Amazon Cash service allows customers to load cash into their Amazon accounts.But Amazon has apparently made more aggressive moves in India and Mexico. In India for example, it has launched a system for customers to load cash into their digital wallets at their doorstep. It has also acquired or invested in several startups like Emvantage Payments and BankBazaar. In Mexico, Amazon’s cash payment service works as an alternative to using a debit or credit card.Amazon Pharmacy Team: Amazon’s recent job listings have hinted at its growing ambitions in the pharmacy business. Now, a new research report from Leerink via CNBC states that Amazon’s team of specialized persons for that market has grown from 7-8 people to 30-40. Its initiatives make perfect sense given its successful platforms (the marketplace as well as the Echo and Dash devices) and the fact that it’s a $3 billion opportunity, according to Leerink.Unlike other markets, Amazon’s goal for this market will be to match the lowest price rather than beat it. Amazon has been meeting with generic drug makers for some time now, so there must be good reason for this. It appears that Amazon will make for the generics market first simply because it will be easier to capture.Twitter COO Departure: Anthony Noto is resigning from his position as Twitter's Chief Operating Officer in order to accept the CEO role at troubled finance startup SoFi from Mar 1. Noto has been the most important executive at Twitter after founder CEO Jack Dorsey and inspired Twitter’s live video push, so the departure will be a blow for the company. His role will be played out by existing Twitter executives.HPE-Aruba Growth in India: HPE-owned wireless networking company Aruba is looking to generate double-digit revenue growth in India this year, on top of the 67% growth last year, according to top company officials. The strength was attributed to mobile growth in the country. Aruba focuses on sectors like education, health care, hospitality, retail and manufacturing in the country and even has an R&D center in India’s Bengaluru. It is particularly strong in the government vertical that contributed 48% of its 2017 business, according to Santanu Ghose, Country Manager, HPE Aruba.MS Upgrades HPE: Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty raised her rating on HPE stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and also bumped up her target price from $14 to $19. The main reason for the upgrade is the impact of the new tax law on HPE financials where the average effective tax rate goes down to 9% and repatriated cash increases financial flexibility.Legal/RegulatoryU.S. Rules on Streaming Services: The Copyright Royalty Board of the U.S. Library of Congress has issued a written decision altering the formula for revenue share between music streamers, song writers and music publishing companies. The National Music Publishers Association announced the decision, which hasn’t reached the public yet.The Association claims that over the next five years, streaming companies like Apple and Spotify will have to pay out 15.1% of their revenue, a big jump from the current 10.5%. The Copyright Royalty Board decides the rate to be paid for mechanical licenses (i.e. the amount to be paid to the publisher every time a person streams a song).EU Fines Qualcomm: At the end of its investigation (initiated in 2015) into Qualcomm’s business practices between 2011 and 2016, the European Commission has come to the conclusion that the company’s agreement with Apple to pay it to use only its own chips and not those by rivals like Apple, was anti-competitive. The EU has therefore fined Qualcomm 997 million euros ($1.23 billion).Qualcomm has seen turbulent times of late as governments all over the world took it to task for misusing its dominance in mobile technology for anti-competitive deals and arrangements. Apple in particular has played a big role in getting its customers together to stop making payments. Meanwhile, chipmaker Broadcom is trying to take hostile control over the company, promising shareholders improved relations with key players like Apple.Facebook Privacy Settings Hub: In an attempt at compliance with the EU’s very comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandate that goes into effect on May 25, Facebook has brought a new privacy center that will put the core privacy settings for Facebook in one place and make it much easier for people to manage their data.It is also publishing its privacy principles for the first time and rolling out educational videos that will help users choose who has control over their information. The GDPR drastically increases the level of fines for companies found to be in breach of data protection law, which can be as high as 4% of their global annual turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is higher.The new law also allows users to export their data and delete it and makes it mandatory for companies to report data breaches within 72 hours among other things. So users are currently seeing “privacy checkup” prompts in their newsfeeds that will direct them to make their choices.Products/TechnologyApple eBooks: Apple is revamping its ebooks feature to make the interface simpler and include a “reading now” tab and another one for audio books. The audio initiative will get a boost from newly hired Kashif Zafar, a former senior executive from Amazon Audible who will be heading the effort. The corresponding store from where people can buy ebooks is also being designed to look like the App Store.Apple Insider says that Apple’s iBooks name may also be changed to simply Apple Books like Apple Music. Amazon has the lion’s share of the ebooks market, which has kind of stagnated since 2013. Apple’s actions may have something to do with Tim Cook’s stated goal of generating $50 billion in annual revenue from its services business by 2021, up from $30 billion last year. Apple doesn’t say how much of services revenue comes from ebooks, or how that business is tracking.New Titles for Xbox Game Pass: Xbox Game Pass, the $9.99 subscription game service, will now feature new, Xbox-exclusive titles from first party studios, meaning that important new releases like Sea of Thieves, State of Decay 2 and Crackdown 3 will launch on the platform on the day they are released. This should help it woo new users and keep them from moving away to competing platforms like Sony and Nintendo.Google Audiobooks: Google added audiobooks to Google Play Stores across 45 countries (most of Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, India and a select number of Asian countries) and in nine languages (English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Korean, Japanese and Polish).According to Greg Hartell, Google Play Book's head of product management, “Play Books has also been around for a long time, offering over 5 million ebooks in 75 countries, and interest in audiobooks is on the rise, along with audio content generally (e.g. digital music, podcasts, etc.). But most importantly our users are asking for them.” Most available titles cost less than $10.Collaborations & M&AGoogle, Tencent, Sequoia China Funding XtalPi: Boston- and Shenzhen-based artificial intelligence (AI)-based pharmaceutical firm XtalPi Inc raised $15 million in a series B funding round led by Sequoia Capital China. Google and Tencent also invested. XtalPi, which uses AI, cloud computing and quantum physics to improve drug design processes, has raised $20 million thus far. Google has been increasing its investments in China and recently even entered into a patent cross-licensing deal with Tencent that should increase collaboration between the two.Amazon Acquires Sqrrl: Sqrrl, which was founded in 2012 by a team of seven former U.S. government workers, including six from the National Security Agency, has now been acquired by Amazon AWS for an estimated $40 million. The firm has raised $28.5 million to date, including a Series C round last June that fetched $12 million. The acquisition, including the talent acquired may help AWS generate more business from U.S. intelligence agencies.Amazon Acquires Stake in StarTrek: An Amazon subsidiary called Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC has entered into a deal to acquire up to 4 million shares in a Colorado call center operator and customer-engagement outsourcing company called StarTrek. According to bizjournals, StarTrek will issue a warrant to acquire up to 4 million shares of its common stock with Amazon paying $9.96 a share. Along with additional commercial services to be supplied by the company, Amazon could end up paying up to $600 million to the company.Some NumbersShazam Will Add to Apple Streamers: DN Capital analyst Mark Mulligan has said in a note that he expects Shazam to add between 1.5 million and 7.5 million users to Apple’s music streaming service. If just 5% of Shazam’s monthly users choose Apple Music, it could add 7.5 million users. Shazam used to be one of the most popular apps in the App Store and Apple has plans of integrating it into Apple Music at some future date.Amazon Monthly Subscriptions Rise: Amazon just raised its monthly Prime subscription charges from $10.99 to $12.99, meaning that monthly subscribers are now required to pay $156 for a year, compared to the annual membership charges of just $99. This definitely seems to be a move to lock in the more sticky customers while forcing the fence sitters to take a decision to go or not to go with Prime. It can also check the churn inherent in a monthly system.Cowen & Co estimates that 30% of Amazon’s 60 million Prime subscribers in the U.S. pay monthly (including students and low-income users who pay a lower rate), which works out to an additional annual income of $300 million for Amazon.Some Companies That Reported Last Week: Western Digital, F5 Networks, Xilinx, Avnet, Texas Instruments, Teradyne, Maxim, KLA-Tencor, Trimble Navigation.Some Companies Reporting This Week: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Alibaba, eBay, PayPal, Advanced Micro Devices, Electronic Arts, CA, Checkpoint, Symantec, Seagate, Juniper, Automatic Data Processing, CDNS, QRVO, Ametek, DATA and ROP.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

926,LRCX,"Shutterfly, Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results.This personalized products and service provider usually incurs losses in the first three quarters followed by earnings in the last quarter of the year. This is due to the seasonal nature of its business.In sync with this, Shutterfly reported adjusted earnings of $3.11 that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.91 by 6.9% and increased 18% year over year. The figure came ahead of the guided range of $2.60 to $3.00. Evidently, the improvement came on the back of a higher top line and expense control.Net revenues of $593.8 million increased 6% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of $557 million by 6.6%. The top line came well ahead of the guided range of $538 million to $568 million. In fact, the fourth-quarter earnings season marked the 68th consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue growth. The solid growth was driven by strong performance across both consumer and Shutterfly Business Solutions (SBS) segments.Shutterfly, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Shutterfly, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Shutterfly, Inc. QuoteConcurrent with the earnings announcement, Shutterfly said that it has reached a deal to acquire Lifetouch, a privately held online photography company for $825 million cash. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.The acquisition is expected to add approximately $935 million to Shutterfly’s net revenues and $100 million to its adjusted EBITDA over the 12 months following the closure of the deal.

Loss of revenues from the non-Shutterfly brand as a result of brand shutdowns was significantly offset by growth of the Shutterfly brand.Shutterfly Business Solutions (SBS) segment revenues surged 81% year over year to $71.9 million driven by faster ramp up of a multiyear deal signed with an existing client in the third quarter.Unique customers declined 2% year over year to 6.1 million and total orders decreased 14% year over year to 10.5 million, primarily due to platform consolidation. On the contrary, average order value increased 4% to $49.9 on the back of product mix.Operating Performance Gross margin (excluding restructuring charges) increased 180 basis points (bps) to 57.2%, chiefly due to higher consumer gross margins.Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of $215.6 million grew 11% year over year. The reported figure was above the high end of the guided range of $191.5 million to $211.5 million backed by careful expense control.Operating expenses totaled $160.5 million, down 10% year over year. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses declined 460 bps year over year to 27%. The decline was owing to platform consolidation as well as strong expense control.

929,LRCX,"Two major developments dominated market proceedings on Wednesday. On the one hand, tech stocks suffered losses, with chip stocks in particular bearing the brunt. Meanwhile, a nationalist stance on trade and the dollar emerged in Davos through statements of key members of the Trump administration.On the one hand, a section of analysts believe that tech stocks are running out of steam and would find it difficult to replicate last year’s gains in 2018. On the other hand, a weaker dollar is likely to weigh on U.S. exports.Chip Stocks Weigh on the MarketsTech stocks weighed on the bourses over the last session with chipmakers in particular feeling the heat. Shares of Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) lost 8.5% after the company released dismal projections for the current quarter. Other chipmakers followed suit, with Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) declining by 1.6%.Meanwhile, shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) also lost 1.6% after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said iPhone sales might come in weaker than expected in the coming spring. Also weighing of the broader index was a decline of 1.5%, 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively, in shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Over the last few months, chipmakers have made massive strides. For instance, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is up 5.9% year to date and has gained 40.9% over the last one year.However, a section of analysts believe that it may be difficult for the sector to sustain such gains. Analysts from Citi Investment Research feel that chipmakers’ business conditions have softened after a series of strong results.Nationalist Position EmergesMeanwhile, key members of the Trump administration espoused a nationalist position on trade and the dollar at the World Economic Forum in Davos. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross firmly elucidated the current administration’s muscular stance on trade. Ross also blamed China for been hiding its practice of trade protectionism under the veil of free trade.Even more noteworthy comments were heard from his colleague U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who said that the Trump administration favored “bilateral trade agreements.” Mnuchin added that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling below the 90 mark for the first time since December 2014.Can Chip Stocks Gain from a Weaker Dollar?Mnuchin’s comments are something of a first, more so from a Treasury Secretary. In the past, U.S. administrations advocated a stronger dollar and urged other countries to work toward lowering their barriers to free trade. This new protectionist stance is a double edged sword. It could trigger off a trade war, leading to retaliations from the likes of China.Further, a fall in the dollar could lead to a contraction in capital inflows which in turn could send yields shooting upward. This in turn could lead to unwelcome shocks for equity markets. Of course, Ross tried to backpedal on the Treasury Secretary’s remarks later, telling CNBC television that Mnuchin wasn’t calling for a weaker dollar.However, such a scenario seems to be a little far-fetched at the moment. If a sovereign bond selloff does come about, it will be triggered by China which recently denied Bloomberg reports on the matter. In any case, such a move would be against China’s own interests in the long run.So, as of now a weaker dollar would only be beneficial for major U.S. exporting sectors like semiconductors. In 2016, semiconductors were the third-largest exports, amounting to around $43 billion. This was likely the case for last year as well and despite alarms being raised over exorbitant valuations and a weaker business environment, chipmakers are likely to have another banner year.Our ChoicesChipmakers have got off on the wrong foot in 2018. But this false start in no way detracts from their astounding performance last year as well as their future prospects. The slump in the dollar is likely to add to the luster of this major exporting sector.Adding select chip stocks to your portfolios continues to make for a profitable option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

930,LRCX,"Although rising rates and a skyrocketing stock market have dulled the attractiveness for dividend stocks, Trump’s biggest tax overhaul in decades is luring investors to these. This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies’ profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn outperformance of stocks having a history of dividend growth year over year.Inside The StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:New York-based Evercore Inc. (EVR  -  Free Report) operates as an independent investment banking advisory firm in the United States, Europe, Latin America and internationally. The company has a P/E ratio of 14.36 compared with the industry average of 17.58 and an expected earnings growth rate of 30.61% for this year. It has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Style Score of A.

931,LRCX,"Investors in Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 26, 2018 $185.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Lam Research shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Lam Research is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry that ranks in the Top 7% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.67 per share to $3.69 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Lam Research right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

932,LRCX,"Believe it or not, Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) is looking to buy Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), at least according to people familiar with the matter. But if the rumors are right, the company could pay $70-$80 a share in cash and stock, valuing the company at over a $100 billion, the largest semiconductor deal ever. It’s possible that regulators will not approve the deal on competitive considerations, but just in case they don’t, there’s much going for both the companies-  Rationale for the DealThere are a number of reasons why the deal makes sense.  First, Qualcomm is one of the largest semiconductor companies, as is Broadcom, so their combination will create a semiconductor giant like Intel or Samsung with greater resources to tap emerging opportunities.Second, being the leading supplier of modem chips having also made some progress in 5G, Qualcomm brings Broadcom important technology to round out its portfolio. Not only that – there is very little product overlap despite the fact that both target the market for mobile devices. Smartphone growth rates have been coming down recently because of increased penetration, but other markets like IoT, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and cloud computing continue to emerge. A combined company with much greater product breadth, a larger client roster and scope for greater integration of technology should do better in this landscape.   Third, Qualcomm has a large number of standard essential patents that it licenses on the basis of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. It also has several other patents that do not form part of standards but that it bundles with standard essential patents. So on the one hand, Qualcomm shouldn’t have to license all patents at standard essential rates, while on the other, it needs to offer greater clarity on the amount it’s charging for the non-standard technology that forms part of the bundle. It also needs to allow companies to build or second source their own non-standard technology.The practice has drawn ire from a number of foreign governments and now, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and its suppliers have ganged up against it. What’s worse, Apple is roping in others like Samsung, so Qualcomm’s legal problems are mounting. Apple phones use Qualcomm technology, but Apple and its suppliers have also stopped paying Qualcomm on this pretext while second sourcing from Intel.This has of course been a big blow to Qualcomm’s revenue and profits. The acquisition has the potential to bring another big semiconductor player on Qualcomm’s side. It can also lead to a resolution of the conflict.Fourth, Broadcom management has a lot of experience with acquisitions, which have been the most consistent pillar of growth for the company. The biggest of these was the Avago-Broadcom merger, which retained the Broadcom name post closure. Before that, it made more than 50 smaller acquisitions over the course of a decade. Management is also known for cost control, so the combined entity may see greater fiscal discipline, which could be a good way to extract profits.Fifth, the chances of prolonged litigation have pressured Qualcomm’s share prices, so the deal will be a good return on investment for shareholders.    Possible Deal BreakersBoth Qualcomm and Broadcom are in the middle of other acquisitions. Qualcomm is looking to buy NXP, the shareholders of which are asking for a higher price. Broadcom is trying to acquire Brocade  (a much smaller deal). There could be many glitches along the way.   The second concern is regulatory. Qualcomm is quite a dominant player in its own field and Broadcom further expands that field. In a way, since they aren’t competitors, there may not be anti-competitive concerns. But on the other hand, the two together will be a mobile chip making powerhouse, which may be something regulators will consider.  Last WordsThese may be some of the biggest acquisitions we have talked about, but consolidation in the space will likely continue in the foreseeable future because chip development and verification isn’t getting any cheaper. Also, companies generally compete on their ability to deliver energy efficient chips that are also more powerful, fast and durable while being cheap. This naturally benefits larger players that can invest heavily in R&D and then manufacture on scale.On the other hand, some of the biggest propositions have been shot down by regulators, such as Applied Materials’ attempt to buy Tokyo Electron, or more recently, Lam Research’s (LRCX  -  Free Report) attempt to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report).Broadcom has apparently been trying to acquire Qualcomm for some time, but its previous attempts weren’t attractive to Qualcomm management. Given its current problems, the company may be more willing to go for it.Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

933,LRCX,"The movement of stocks scaling 52-week highs or hitting lows is closely monitored on a daily basis. Now, the question is, how important such stock movements are to investors.Betting on a stock near its 52-week high has its own pitfalls as there is a possibility of it scaling higher or going downhill without forewarning. One of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook, the 52-week strategy, relies on the mantra, buy high and sell higher.A wide group of investors are placing their bets on stocks which are near their 52-week high mark but are still undervalued with strong upside potential. While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52-week high investment technique, many of them believe that 52-week high stocks, which are presently undervalued, can be lucrative bets.An Insight Into 52-Week High StocksStocks near 52-week highs often instill the presumptive “adjustment and anchoring bias” in the minds of investors. This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52-week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor.Many a times, such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers. Meanwhile, news pertaining to robust sales, surging profit levels, bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher.However, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52-week high bar. Wall Street’s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it.Also, recent academic research reveals that if a stock’s current price is near its 52-week high, there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period.  According to researchers George and Hwang, holding 52-week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0.45% between 1963 and 2001. Encouragingly, this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum-based strategies.Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52-week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries. The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum.These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time. Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range and is likely to touch the 52-week high mark soon.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank = 1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily.Here are seven of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen:Idaho-based Micron Technology, Inc.

936,LRCX,"Paycom Software’s (PAYC  -  Free Report) board of directors recently declared amendment of its ongoing share repurchase program. The company will add $100 million of funds to the continuing buyback program and extend its duration till Feb 12, 2020.In May 2016, the company announced a plan to buy back shares worth $50 million over a span of 24 months. Concurrent with the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2016 results, the company announced the extension of the program with another $50 million to be repurchased through January 2019. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, management announced the completion of the “second $50 million” repurchase plan.The company also announced a third buyback plan worth $75 million. During fourth-quarter 2017, the company bought back 538,000 shares. Paycom has repurchased 2.3 million shares since the start of the program in May 2016. The amendment is a testament to the fact that Paycom is returning value to its shareholders.Impressive Balance SheetPaycom has a strong balance sheet. It generated $130.6 million cash from operating activities in 2017, which represents nearly an eight-fold increase from $16.9 million in 2013.  The company exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $46.1 million, compared with $13.4 million in 2013.Net cash (i.e. cash and cash equivalents minus debt) for 2017 totaled $11.7 million, which increased from $1.8 million recorded in 2013. The existing cash can be used for pursuing strategic acquisitions, investment in growth initiatives and distribution to shareholders.We believe that the company’s shareholder friendly approach boosts investors’ confidence in the stock, which has substantially outperformed the industry in the past year. While the industry gained 23.7%, the company rallied 70.3% during that time frame.What’s Going in Favor of Paycom?The company posted impressive fourth-quarter 2017 results driven by the addition of clients and product development initiatives. The company’s client retention rate, which has been hovering around 91% for almost six years in a row, is also a major positive.Paycom’s management is extremely positive about its sales and marketing initiatives, which are increasing its connection with the market and positively impacting the top line. In 2017, Paycom launched its application on Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) App Store and Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Play Store. Additionally, the company received positive feedback on its first national television commercial.The outperformance of the sales team prompted the company’s announcement of the opening of a new sales office in Salt Lake City on the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, which will bring the sales team count to 46.Additionally, the company’s shift to ASC 606 Accounting Standard, effective Jan 1, 2018 is anticipated to be another tailwind for the company’s margins. Previously, the company recognized commission related expenses in the quarter in which a contract was signed. Per the new standards, the commission expense will be recognized ratably over the tenure of a contract. This will lower sales and marketing expenses, which will boost margins.We believe that all these coupled with the accelerated adoption of the company’s solutions will aid growth.Paycom Software, Inc.

944,LRCX,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) plans to further expand its presence in Michigan by opening another fulfillment center in the Charter Township of Shelby, MI.Notably, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 31.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 51.3% in the same time period.More About the DevelopmentThe new 1-million-square-foot fulfillment center is expected to create 1,000 new full-time jobs, once the site gets operational in 2018.This new Michigan facility will focus on large items like household decor, sporting equipment and gardening tools. Amazon stated that employees working in the facility will not only be entitled to get competitive wages, but will also receive other benefits such as generous maternity and parental leaves. The company will also offer 95% tuition reimbursement to its employees.Meanwhile, Amazon has been increasing its investments to build and modernize fulfillment centers primarily to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. Amazon already has a huge presence in Michigan. Since 2016, the online retailer has announced three facilities in this region and a corporate office in Detroit. The addition of the new center in Michigan will bring the total workforce count to more than 3,500.In 2016, Amazon’s capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was utilized in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.Bottom LineFulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important for providing the level of services that customers expect from the company.Additionally, small retailers that are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping are signing up for Amazon’s fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company’s warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul.However, heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) are keeping Amazon’s margins under pressure, thereby negatively impacting its bottom line. Also, Amazon’s retail business is currently facing stiff competition from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), among others.Amazon.com, Inc.

The stock has returned 31.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 24.5%.

These solutions help shippers and carriers to electronically monitor the movement of goods and process freight transactions in a more transparent and an effective way.The acquisition, effective immediately, will enhance Trimble’s capabilities in serving its customers in the transportation business.

954,LRCX,"International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) is strengthening its presence in the blockchain market at a steady pace.After being part of multi-industrial blockchain deals in food supply, fintech, banking, and insurance sectors, the company has now struck a deal in the automotive industry. The new partnership is with automobile manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen.Leading Swiss bank, UBS is also part of the project for the development of the blockchain framework for “Car eWallet”. The system will be based on hyperledger technology.Car-eWallet is a blockchain based electronic payment and charging system for electronic cars. In January 2017, UBS, ZF and a German energy company Innogy first came together for the development and deployment of the project, and IBM is the newest partner on board.We believe growth of the blockchain segment along with the rapid adoption of IBM’s artificial intelligence platform Watson will help the company perform better in the near term. Shares of IBM have lost 9.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s decline of 8.8%.Outcome of the CollaborationBesides making payments and charging easy, Car eWallet makes the parking process smoother and can also authorize vehicle usage by third parties, when it is parked. It can also collect fees for the service. It has a unique feature that makes buying and selling of used cars easy as well. Paying tolls is also taken care of by the system.All these features when combined with the unbreachable distributed ledger of blockchain technology will lead to the creation of a secure wallet. We believe, as the world is fast moving toward advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), Car eWallet is bound to win market share.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteBlockchain Gaining TractionNotably, blockchain technology is witnessing rapid adoption across industries due to secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database.

955,LRCX,"Share price of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $72.33, eventually closing a tad lower at $72.18 on Sep 11. Notably, its shares have gained 28.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 27% rally.What’s Backing the Rally?Cognizant’s domain expertise is a key catalyst. The company is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition, especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Moreover, acquisitions have been a key growth driver for Cognizant. The buyouts have not only led to an increase in new customers but also expanded its capabilities in the healthcare industry and enhanced its overall digital delivery capabilities.Recently, Cognizant announced the completion of its acquisition of TMG Health. TMG Health is a business process services provider to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid markets in the U.S. Reportedly, the integration of TMG Health and the company’s TriZetto platform reinforces its leading service provider position for the government-managed healthcare programs in U.S.Per management, merger with TMG Health will enable Cognizant to expand its healthcare offerings and thereby cater to growing demand from its payer clients. The company’s healthcare segment has a strong growth trajectory and this acquisition will thus prove to be significant revenue driver in our view.Strategies Paying OffCognizant has been witnessing continuous increase in revenues over the past several quarters, which signifies that its growth initiatives are in the right direction.

Seasonality results in considerable variations in Garmin’s quarterly revenues.The Fitness segment decreased 7.7% sequentially and 11.6% year over year.

The year-over-year growth was driven by strength in chartplotter and fish finder products.  The Auto/Mobile segment was down 9.3% sequentially and 11.9% on a year-over-year basis.

970,LRCX,"Texas Instruments' (TXN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.09 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 24% year over year but decreased 14% sequentially.The above earnings per share figure do not include 75 cents in tax-related expenses primarily due to the recently passed tax reform act.Revenues of $3.75 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $11 million, up 9.8% on a year-over-year basis but down 9.8% sequentially. However, it came ahead of the guided range of $3.57-$3.87 billion, driven by strong demand in the auto and industrial markets.Following fourth-quarter results, shares fell 7.01% in after-hours trading possibly on slower-than-expected revenue growth due to softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment. Also, the sluggish top-line outlook could be one of the reasons for the decline in the share price.Also, Texas Instruments’ shares have rallied 47.9% in the last 12-month period, underperforming its industry’s growth of 53.2%.Segment wise, growth of analog and embedded processing applications business was strong. These typically yield a more stable business as well as strong margins. The Other segment declined year over year.Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while expanding its business.The company remains focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Notably, free cash flow in 2017 was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenues, reflecting an increase of 14% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, we remain optimistic about TI’s compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. However, risks associated with a high debt level persist.Let’s see what the numbers say.Revenues in DetailAnalog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated 68%, 24% and 8% of quarterly revenues, respectively.Analog, which includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume products, was up 11% from the year-ago quarter to $2.5 billion. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in product lines — power and signal chain.The Embedded Processing segment, which includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors, was up 20% year over year to $896 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by stronger sales across both the product lines — processors and connected microcontrollers.The Other segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs and calculators, was down 16% year over year to $319 million. The decline was primarily due to custom ASIC and royalties moving to other income and expenses beginning in the first quarter of 2017.Margins Texas Instruments’ gross margin of 65.1% was up 54 basis points (bps) sequentially and 259 bps from the year-ago quarter. The company’s gross margin has been improving consistently as more production shifts to its 300 mm line.Operating expenses of $877 million were up 1.0% sequentially and 8.9% from last year. Operating margin was 41.7%, down 176 bps sequentially and 278 bps from the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCash and short-term investments balance was $4.5 billion compared with $3.4 billion in the prior quarter.The company generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations, spending $231 million on capex, $706 million on share repurchases and $611 million on cash dividends.Texas Instruments is one of the few technology companies that return a significant amount of cash to investors.

Various technology giants, including Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector is benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies are Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How LRCX, TEL, APH, XLNX and FFIV are PlacedSupplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

972,LRCX,"Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.81%.The surprise history has been good in Lam’s case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.3%.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in recent times, increasing 84% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 68.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLam Research has high exposure to the memory segment, which is likely to witness strong growth in the coming quarters. The strength is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT.The company is doing well and expects to succeed in areas such as device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections.The company also continues to witness increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies. All these factors could positively impact the top-line figure of the company.For the upcoming quarter, the company expects revenues of approximately $2.55 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.56 billion. Shipments are projected to be roughly $2.60 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.61 billion.However, volatility in the PC market remains a major concern. The weakness in the PCs could offset the expansion in the 3D NAND, impacting the upcoming results.Also, the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:The Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.66 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.67. Hence, the difference is -0.27%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Also,Lamhas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a -0.27% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lam Research Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Applied Materials, Inc.

973,LRCX,"The stock market has been on a stellar run this year thanks to strong corporate earnings, still lower interest rates, and improving health of economies around the world. Even the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical tensions, North Korean nuclear missile tests and stretched valuations failed to block the road.In fact, Dow Jones crossed the another milestone of 22,000 for the first time in yesterday’s trading session after hitting the 20,000 and 21,000 marks earlier this year and the S&P 500 is less than 1% shy of its major threshold of 2,500. The bullish trend is likely to continue at least in the near term.This is especially true, as the economy has been on a solid growth path buoyed by an impressive labor market, increase in wages, and increasing consumer spending. U.S. GDP growth expanded 2.6% annually in the second quarter, which is double the first-quarter growth of 1.2% and represents the fastest growth since the third quarter of last year when the economy grew 2.8%. Notably, this 96-month growth confirms the eight-year expansion since mid-2009 – the third-longest economic winning streak in American history behind March 1991 to March 2001 (120 months) and February 1961 to December 1969 (106 months).Additionally, consumers now appear to be more optimistic as we enter into the second half of the year. The Consumer Confidence Index, as indicated by the Conference Board, surged to a 16-year high of 121.1 in July from the revised 117.3 in June and is much above the expected 116.5. Further, a weaker dollar helped blue chip companies, most of whose revenues came from international markets, to surge higher (read: 4 ETFs to Ride on 16-Year High Consumer Confidence).    Amid bullish sentiments, momentum investing would be a winning strategy for those seeking higher returns in a short spell. This is because the strategy looks to fetch profits from buying hot stocks that have shown an uptrend over the past few weeks or months.As such, we have presented five ETFs and stocks that could lead to outperformance in the current market environment.

974,LRCX,"3D Systems Corporation’s (DDD  -  Free Report) posted another huge earnings miss – its second after the last quarter’s huge miss ended its streak of three back-to-back quarters of impressive beats. The company reported adjusted loss (including share-based compensation expense) of 7 cents per share for second-quarter 2017, which was way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 6 cents.Non-GAAP earnings came in at 8 cents per share, plunging 33.3% from the prior-year quarter figure of 12 cents, as modest top-line growth was more than offset by a rise in operating expenses.In light of weaker-than-expected results, the company’s management tweaked the full-year 2017 guidance lower.Inside the HeadlinesThe 3D printer maker reported revenues of $159.5 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 0.9%. Strong demand for the company’s healthcare solutions, along with steady demand for the industrial offerings was largely offset by lower revenues from professional printers. The company also saw growth in production printers, materials, software and healthcare revenues, but lower sales in APAC restricted top-line growth. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $163 million by a small margin.3D Systems’ Healthcare revenues were up 25% to $48.5 million year over year, primarily attributable to high demand for printers and materials from medical and dental customers. Software revenues totaled $24 million, up 9% on a year-over-year basis.Materials revenue rose 8% to $43.9 million, thanks to strong production orders and robust contribution from the previously acquired Vertex-Global. The company’s Printer revenues were down 14% to $28 million, while on-demand manufacturing decreased 5% to $26 million.In the quarter, gross margin contracted 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 50.6%. The company plans to drive further reductions in cost of sales from supply-chain betterment initiatives and manufacturing improvements, in order to drive margins higher.In addition, the company’s operating expenses flared up (up 4%) to $87.5 million, as R&D expense rose 17% year over year, mainly on account of a rise in focused investments in production application solutions, including Figure 4, metals and materials.Notable DevelopmentsDuring the first quarter, 3D Systems had rolled out a next-generation additive manufacturing platform, based on the company’s Figure 4 technology and NextDent materials. The company believes that the new platform will bring down cost of operations, reduce fabrication times and produce far less material waste.In the second quarter, 3D Systems launched the Simbionix SPINE Mentor, a hands-on simulated training and practice tool for minimally invasive spine surgeries. The company also released new products, materials and capabilities at RAPID + TCT 2017 to accelerate its leadership in plastic additive manufacturing.3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise 3D Systems Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation QuoteProducts included the new ProJet MJP 5600, offering print speeds up to two times faster, a larger build volume, and part costs that are up to 40 percent less than competing multi-material 3D printers.The company also rolled out VisiJet CR-BK, a new rigid black plastic material for the ProJet MJP 5600 that enables producers to meet the most demanding product designs and models.Also, during the quarter, 3D Systems and United Therapeutics joined forces to develop solid-organ scaffolds for human transplants. The multi-year collaboration will integrate 3D Systems’ profound healthcare printing and precision expertise with the regenerative medicine and organ manufacturing capabilities of United Therapeutics Corporation.Cash Flow and Balance Sheet3D Systems ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $154 million, down significantly from $184.9 million as at Dec 1, 2016. At the end of June, net cash generated from operating activities came in at $18.4 million, significantly lower than the year-ago figure of $31 million.GuidanceConcurrent with the second-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company revised its guidance for full-year 2017. 3D Systems now anticipates revenues in the range of $643–$671 million, which would reflect year-over-year growth of 2–6% in 2017 (earlier projection: $643–$684 million).In addition, the company expects to report GAAP loss per share of around 14 cents for 2017 (compared to prior expectations of GAAP earnings of 2–6 cents per share), while non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be approximately 46 cents per share (earlier projection: 51-55 cents per share).To Conclude3D Systems’ year-over-year bottom-line improvements during second-quarter 2017 are attributable to a host of factors, including solid momentum of healthcare offerings, robust demand for production printers and materials, and higher efficiency in “demand manufacturing services”. We believe the acquisition of Vertex-Global Holding B.V will unlock multiple opportunities for the billion-dollar digital dentistry space.The company is banking on continued double-digit growth in healthcare and sustained growth in software and materials to drive 2017 growth. Even on-demand manufacturing and printer revenues are likely to return to growth.Also, the company’s efforts to streamline its cost structure by focusing on IT infrastructure, go-to-market and innovation are likely to stoke growth. In addition, the company remains bullish about the prospects of Figure 4 technology — the ultra-fast, modular Stereolithography system — designed for the production of plastic parts on the factory floor.Despite these positives, 3D Systems’ broader market concerns have thwarted growth of the premium 3D printing company. The industry is battling a widespread decline in demand for enterprise 3D printers over the past two years. Other headwinds, including economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity price vagaries, also marred the performance of most players in the industry.3D Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (AEIS  -  Free Report). While Lam Research sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

975,LRCX,"Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) shares have traded at a higher valuation than the S&P 500 and also the industry to which it belongs. But in 2016, the shares started widening this lead, a trend that has continued through 2017.  The company’s technological prowess is a given, which can generate solid growth. But given the sharp rise in prices (evident in the charts above), it makes sense to see if the shares are overvalued.   One thing to keep in mind in this respect is the general valuation of shares. The charts below illustrate that both the S&P 500 and the industry are trading close to their respective 52-week highs. So LRCX trading in the same range isn’t an anomaly.  P/EThe forward 12 months price-to-earnings ratio for LRCX is currently 13.04 compared to the S&P 500 average of 18.24 and the X industry average of 16.91. Highs and lows are also lower. The median P/E is also lower at 13.73. Moreover, the trend lines indicate that LRCX is clearly undervalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry.  P/SThe trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells a slightly different story. The P/S ratio for LRCX is currently 3.86, which is higher than the S&P 500’s 3.15 but much lower than the X industry’s 6.25. The median of 3.34 is slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s 3.04 but well below the industry’s 5.78. The highs and lows also indicate that LRCX is overvalued with respect to the S&P 500 but undervalued with respect to the industry.  How About Its Peers?Lam Research’s closest competitor is Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) so let’s consider that first. Historically, AMAT has traded well below its 52-week high, but the current level of demand has changed that. So it is also trading at around its 52-week high. AMAT’s current P/E is lower than LRCX but the median is same. Both the high of 16.50 and the low of 12.37 exceed Lam’s. This indicates a similar valuation for the two peers.   LRCX also compares favorably with ASML Holding NV (ASML  -  Free Report), another semiconductor equipment maker. ASML, which is also trading very close to its 52-week high, has a current P/E of 26.68 and median P/E of 26.63, both of which are significantly higher than LRCX. The price to sales ratio tells a similar tale.   ConclusionFrom the above, we can conclude that Lam Research, which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is undervalued. You can see the the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Applied Materials also has a Zacks Rank #1 while ASML is ranked #2 (Buy).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

976,LRCX,"Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) has announced changes at its management levelThe online travel booking company recently appointed Mark Okerstrom as its new chief executive officer (CEO) and president of the company.Okerstrom succeeds Dara Khosrowshahi, who recently left Expedia and accepted Uber’s offer of becoming its new CEO. However, Khosrowshahi will continue to remain on the company’s board.Following news of Dara Khosrowshahi joining Uber, investors were not happy, leading to a decline in the company’s share price. However, the investors cheered the news of Okerstrom’s appointment as the company’s new CEO, which saw the company’s share price rising by more than 3%.More Into The headlinesGiven that Okerstrom had been working with Expedia since 2006, he knows the business quite well. He had served in responsible positions at Expedia. Most recently, he worked as chief financial officer and executive vice president of operations.Expedia Chairman, Barry Diller, said, “Okerstrom was Khosrowshahi's principal partner in operating the company and therefore this transition is as natural as water flowing down a snow-packed mountain,” adding, “There was no other candidate that the board considered”.Stock Price PerformanceExpedia has built a very strong position and an extensive portfolio across hotel, air and car-related services. Undoubtedly, these have contributed significantly to the company’s impressive 32.4% share price surge over the last one year.However, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have gained only 31.0% compared with the industry’s growth of 49.4%.Bottom LineExpedia Inc. is one of the leading online travel companies in the world. Its growth plan for both domestic and international markets remains encouraging.

981,LRCX,"Given the run-up in stocks in the New Year, the importance of value investing has risen considerably. Value investors have, over the years, preferred price-to-earnings ratio or P/E as a means to identify value stocks. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though used less often, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.This article focuses on the Price-to-Book ratio for finding great stocks at great values.The P/B is simply the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as given below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityWhat is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report), a leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States, has a Zacks Rank #2.

986,LRCX,"Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues came ahead of expectations.Earnings of $1.03 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Revenues of $3.7 billion beat the consensus mark by $139 million.The strong results were driven by strength in auto, industrial, communications and personal electronics markets.Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Internally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), is one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan.At the call, management stated that the company will remain focused on increasing free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. Notably, free cash flow over the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenues. Overall, we remain optimistic about TI’s compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output.However, risks associated with a high debt level persist. Year to date, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to. It gained 11.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.8%.Let’s see what the numbers say.RevenueRevenues were up 8.6% sequentially and 12.8% year over year and came at the higher end of the guidance range of $3.40 billion and $3.70 billion.The automotive market continued to be strong.

Additionally, it has an average positive earnings surprise of 14.96% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTeradata is well positioned in Enterprise Data Warehousing (EDW) solutions market, including enterprise analytic technologies and services worldwide. Further, the company offers a robust product portfolio.We expect the company’s ongoing transition – especially with regards to new subscription pricing programs – to be long-term growth drivers but will continue to impact results in the near term.Also, we believe that restructuring related costs and a sluggish spending environment in the domestic market will continue to weigh on the near term performance. Stiffening competition is an added concern.Teradata has underperformed the industry in the last year. The company’s shares have decreased 2.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 48.1% during the period.The company's management anticipates second-quarter 2017 revenue to be in the $510–$530 million range. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the 25–30 cents range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teradata is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Teradata has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

991,LRCX,"A stock’s price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of its price to book value or in other words how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock.In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.Though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are preferred by investors while choosing value stocks, the P/B ratio has also emerged as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.Take a look at the formula of P/B ratio:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.Understanding Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. It is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this would equate to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Explaining the P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the six stocks that qualified the screening:Magellan Health, Inc.

992,LRCX,"The Trump administration’s failure to push through a new healthcare law has possibly sandbagged hopes of policy measures boosting stocks in the near future. In fact, investors now have little confidence left in the President’s pre-poll promises and are starting to bank on fundamental concerns when evaluating investment options. Needless to say, earnings performance and the state of the economy feature at the top of a list of such factors.Meanwhile, market watchers now believe that a falling dollar is just the tonic markets need. The decline in the greenback could provide equities with fresh upside by boosting earnings of commodity-centric and multinational companies. In a volatile scenario, investing in stocks of this nature, which are large enough to be included in the S&P 500, makes for a profitable option.Policy Paralysis Fells DollarThe dollar’s recent set of declines has provided analysts with an opportunity to determine whether it could have a positive effect on corporate earnings. To understand the gravity of the situation, one need to look no further than the U.S. Dollar Index, which is down 8% year to date. In comparison, the S&P 500% has already gained 10.3% over the same period.Immediately after Trump’s surprise victory, the dollar soared on hopes that the President’s growth-oriented and industry-friendly policies would boost the economy and earnings. However, repeated failures at pushing through policy proposals have left investors somewhat disenchanted. With little headway made on tax reforms, fiscal stimulus measures and a new healthcare law, the so called “Trump Trade” has experienced a reversal, leading to the greenback’s decline.Falling Dollar to Boost EarningsInstead, investors have chosen to focus on the state of the economy, the reluctance of the Fed to raise rates and a likely strong second quarter earnings season. And a clutch of analysts now feel that a softer dollar is just the tonic earnings need.While earnings felt the heat of a soaring dollar last year, a decline could be extremely beneficial this time around. Additionally, this phenomenon illustrates how expectations about the extent to which the Fed could hike rates have undergone a change.A fall in the dollar usually has a positive impact on the price of commodities. This is why companies which stand to gain handsomely from the dollar’s decline are those whose businesses are commodity centric or multinationals with significant overseas exposure. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), S&P 500 earnings could increase by 0.5% for every 1% decline in the dollar.The financial major explained that this factor impacts earnings on a rolling basis and its effects could become apparent in the second half of the year.  By this logic, an 8% decline in the dollar’s value by the end of the current year could boost 2018 earnings by 4%. If, as Morgan Stanley projects, the dollar declines by an additional 5%, earnings could grow by around 6.5%Our ChoicesCorporate earnings are likely to receive a welcome boost from the plunge in the dollar’s value. This is likely to be especially beneficial to those companies which deal in commodities or those with primarily multinational operations.Adding stocks of companies with a high percentage of overseas sales, according to Strategas Research Partners, and which make up the S&P 500 looks like a smart option at this juncture. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Micron Technology, Inc.

993,LRCX,"With President Donald Trump closer to his major legislative move — the biggest tax overhaul in decades — investors have started chasing dividend growth stocks. This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies’ profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn benefit stocks having a history of dividend growth year over year.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report): This Illinois-based full-service real estate firm provides management services, corporate and financial services and investment management services to corporations and other real estate owners, users and investors worldwide. The company has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 30 cents over the past 30 days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 2.21%.

994,LRCX,"On Dec 6, we issued an updated research report on Autodesk Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report).The company recently reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter 2018 results. The top- as well as the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved significantly year over year.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 19.2%.Buoyed by the encouraging third-quarter results, Autodesk revised its full-year revenue and EPS expectations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Autodesk moved upward following the quarterly results and impressive outlook, which reflects the optimistic view of analysts. In the past 30 days, earnings estimates for the fourth quarter have improved from a loss of 13 cents to loss of 12 cents. The projection is also better than the year ago quarter’s loss of 28 cents.Notably, shares of Autodesk have gained 44.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 31.8% rally.Increasing Product SubscriptionsAutodesk’s business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is helping the company to boost subscriptions. We note that Autodesk’s broad product portfolio generates new customers in both domestic and overseas markets.Subscription revenues soared 105.6% year over year driven by strong product subscriptions. The company’s maintenance to subscription (M2S) program recorded 110K subscriptions. New customers represented about 30% of the mix in the quarter and contributed a significant portion of subscription additions.Cloud subscription additions were impressive driven by robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools. The company’s focus to fast integrate new technology into Fusion 360, advancement of BIM 360 platform and the growth of its Forge platform are positives.Moreover, improvement in construction and manufacturing activities in the emerging markets present further growth opportunities.The company’s BIM 360 platform recorded major wins with the construction companies. Management noted on the last conference call that Autodesk signed a $5 million BIM 360 deal with one of Japan’s largest general contractors and a similar deal in EMEA as well.Autodesk, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Autodesk, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Autodesk, Inc. QuoteRestructuring Plans Raise ConcernsAutodesk announced a restructuring plan during its last earnings release. The stock took a beating following the announcement.However, management believes restructuring will drive long-term growth by realigning investments in strategic areas like digital infrastructure, facilitating development of core products and increasing spend on construction opportunities.The company plans to keep spending levels flat this year as well as the next. Autodesk plans to attain this by discontinuing research and development activities that are “not aligned with reimagining construction, manufacturing and production.”Moreover, Autodesk sites that are no more associated with the company’s global location and talent acquisition strategy will be closed.However, a pretax charge of $135-$149 million owing to the restructuring plans is anticipated. Of this, nearly $91-$100 million is expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter and the rest of it in the next fiscal.  We believe this to remain an overhang on the company’s bottom line.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAutodesk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Intel, Lam Research and NVIDIA is projected to be 8.4%, 14.9% and 11.2%, respectively.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

995,LRCX,"(0:30) - Tech Rally Fades: Buying Opportunity or Value Trap?(4:40) - Tracey's Top Semiconductor Stock Picks(12:00) - Takeaways From Recent Sell Off(14:15) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #71 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Things were running smoothly for the technology stocks until December hit. Suddenly, investors and traders started selling the big technology names, including the FANG stocks, and putting the money into other sectors like retail and financials.The hardest hit technology industry, however, has been the semiconductors.They’ve been on a tear in 2017. The semiconductor ETFs are up about 36% year-to-date, and that’s even after the recent weakness. Some individual names are up over 100% in the last 12 months.Is this just profit taking and has it created a buying opportunity for value investors?Or is there something else lurking below the surface that could lead these stocks down the road of being value traps?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, a lot of stocks can look cheap. They may have low P/E ratios or the shares may have taken a dive, giving the illusion of cheapness.What investors need to look at is the “E” part of the equation.What are earnings doing? Are they on the rise or are analysts cutting them?A value trap is a stock that looks cheap but which has declining earnings so it’s not really as cheap as it seems.Tracey decided to take a look at 5 big semiconductor names to see if they were value stocks or value traps.5 Semiconductor Stocks: Are They Values or a Trap?1.     Nvidia(NVDA  -  Free Report) has fallen over 10% since the semiconductor sell off began but it hasn’t been a “cheap” stock in some time. Even with the sell off it still trades with a forward P/E of 45.2. However, for growth investors, is the big earnings growth story still intact?2.    Micron(MU  -  Free Report) actually reports earnings on Dec 19 so The Street will get an update on what the outlook is shortly. Last quarter, the company was still bullish on fiscal 2018 demand. Will they be this time? Shares are still cheap, with a forward P/E of only 5.2.3.    Applied Materials(AMAT  -  Free Report) has fallen over 12% since the semiconductor sell off began. And while one estimate has been cut for fiscal 2018 in the last 60 days, 9 have been raised in that time period. It still has attractive valuations with a forward P/E of just 12.6.4.    Lam Research(LRCX  -  Free Report) has gotten hit for a 15% pullback on the industry worries. That haven’t been any analyst cuts to the fiscal 2018 estimates while 6 estimates were raised over the last 2 months. It has a forward P/E of only 12.2.5.    Intel(INTC  -  Free Report) didn’t see as big of gains in 2017 as others but it also hasn’t sold off as sharply. Shares were down just about 3% on the semiconductor sell off. Analysts continue to be bullish with 14 estimates raised for both 2017 and 2018 while none have been cut.The semiconductor industry is diverse. Not all semis are created equal so investors need to do their research on each company.What else should you know about the semiconductors?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

996,LRCX,"Per Reuters, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) has won the long-pending case against Chinese manufacturer, Xiaomi over the registration of “Mi Pad” as an European Union (EU) trademark.The tech giant had filed a complaint with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2016 over Xiaomi’s application of Mi Pad as an European trademark in 2014. Apple stated that the name is similar to that of its iPad trademark.Following EUIPO’s support to Apple, Xiaomi appealed to the General Court, the second highest court of the European Union. The plea was rejected thisTuesday saying that the similarity of the signs might lead to confusion among users.Per the ruling, “additional letter ‘m’ at the beginning of ""Mi Pad"", is not sufficient to offset the high degree of visual and phonetic similarity between the two signs.""However, Xiaomi can still appeal at EU's highest court, European Court of Justice, against the ruling.Xiaomi - A ConcernApple is facing significant competition from Xiaomi across segments like smartphones, tablets, wearables as well as laptops.To gain market share against Xiaomi and other competitors like Samsung, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, Apple offered significant discounts on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in rapidly growing markets like India and China.We note that Apple has been taking a lot of initiatives to boost its presence in emerging markets like India. In the last reported quarter, Apple sales in India doubled year over year. iPhone shipments increased in double digits, similar to other markets like mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico.Notably, shares of Apple have gained 46.5% year to date, slightly outperforming the industry’s 45.6% rally.According to the latest International Data Corporation (IDC) report released in November, Xiaomi and Samsung are the two leading smartphone brands in India with 23.5% market share each in the third quarter.Although Xiaomi is ranked fifth in the global smartphone market, it recorded maximum growth. While Xiaomi’s shipments nearly tripled on a year-over-year basis, it doubled sequentially doubled in third quarter. IDC pointed out that its strong growth in India market was a key catalyst.We note that a resurgent iPad business backed the impressive results of Apple in the last quarter. Apple sold 10.3 million iPads in the quarter, up 11% year over year.However, competition has intensified with Amazon, HTC, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and others flooding the tablet market.Apple is heavily dependent on iPhone and iPad sales and heightened competition will continue to hurt its top line and profitability.Apple Inc.

997,LRCX,"When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits, one should explore another time-tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks. Translated, one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.At the core, momentum investing is buying high, selling higher. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift. Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does the momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works. For instance, there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in the prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period of time and across markets. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past one year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through this screen:Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report), which engages in the production, processing, marketing, and distribution of fresh, frozen, and value-added chicken products, has gained 81.3% over the past one year.

998,LRCX,"IPG Photonics Corp. (IPGP  -  Free Report), a manufacturer and developer of high performance fiber lasers, recently announced the acquisition of Laser Depth Dynamics (LDD)  to optimize the usage of lasers in the manufacturing industry.LDD primarily monitors and controls solutions related to laser-based welding processes. The company’s flagship inline coherent imaging (ICI) technology allows real-time direct measurement of the depth of weld penetration, thereby making the process accurate and cost effective compared to the indirect techniques.Management believes that this unique feature of LDD when integrated with IPG’s own welding solutions portfolio will boost the adoption rate of the solutions across multiple industries that require automated production facilities. The accelerated usage of these solutions will eventually boost IPG’s top line.Shares of IPG have gained 103.5% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the 79.7% increase of the industry it belongs to. Robust Sales GrowthNotably, IPG posted strong sales figures in third-quarter 2017 results, which surged 47.6% from the year-ago quarter to $392.6 million. The figure outperformed the guided range of $350-$370 million.Materials processing sales jumped 52.1% year over year and accounted for approximately 95.4% of total sales driven by strength in cutting and welding applications. Record laser sales for 3D printing applications also aided growth.Geographically, China, Europe, Turkey and Korea were the highest revenue contributors, driven by massive demand for high-power CW lasers for cutting and welding applications, medium-power lasers for 3D printing applications, pulsed laser sales for marking and engraving as well as high-power pulsed lasers for marking, engraving, and solar cell manufacturing.Will the Momentum Continue?We believe strong adoption of fiber lasers over conventional lasers and non-laser cutting and welding equipment is proving to be a key catalyst for IPG. According to management, higher productivity and lower operating cost of fiber lasers are accelerating the replacement of installed base of CO2 and YAG laser systems, hence driving the company’s top line.Moreover, with a proper blend of improved manufacturing efficiency, cost reductions, favorable product mix coupled with customer credit management and global administration, IPG is poised to enjoy steady growth going ahead.IPG Photonics Corporation Revenue (TTM) IPG Photonics Corporation Revenue (TTM) | IPG Photonics Corporation QuoteZacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderIPG sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

999,LRCX,"Investors who have grown used to the technology sector’s strong rally this year have been rocked over the past few trading periods, as stocks throughout the tech world have struggled—despite progress being made on the GOP’s long-awaited tax bill.Before the current tech selloff began last week, our “Computers and Technology” sector was up over 30% on the year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was resting near its all-time high. Several innovative tech firms are among Wall Street’s hottest stocks of 2017, while established industry behemoths—including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report)—have outpaced the market.But it appears that this rally has finally started to see some volatility. Over the last week, tech stocks across the board have slumped, leading many investors to wonder whether the sector is in store for another bubble burst—similar to that of the dot-com era in the early 2000s.Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons to remains optimistic about tech stocks right now. Unlike during the dot-com rally, today’s sector is supported by real earnings and revenue growth. In fact, stocks in our Computers and Technology group are currently sporting an average P/E ratio of 24.13, while it was not uncommon for the Nasdaq’s average P/E to sit in the hundreds at the turn of the century.And after another strong earnings report season—which not only continued the high-growth trend, but also included positive guidance for 2018—we have no real reason to believe that the fundamental picture surrounding the tech sector has changed.For investors with this continued bullish mindset, the recent tech selloff would be considered an opportunity to buy stocks at a discount. With that said, if you hold that belief, check out these three tech stocks to buy now:1.       Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report)Alongside the expansion of the semiconductor industry, we have seen the suppliers of equipment to the chipmakers—such as Lam Research—really explode this year. But LRCX has also been hammered by the current selloff, and shares of the company have lost nearly 15% in five days.Still, Lam Research remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock also sports an “A” grade in the overall VGM category of our Style Scores system. The company is expected to witness EPS growth of 64% and sales growth of 36% this quarter, and its Forward P/E sits at just 12.74. 2.       Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)Video game makers have been among the hardest hit by the tech selloff, and shares of industry giant Activision Blizzard have lost nearly 11.5% over the past five trading days. But ATVI has emerged as an impressive growth stock this year and should stay that way in 2018, meaning that this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock could be on sale right now.Based on our latest consensus estimates, Activision is expected to post earnings growth of 15% and revenue growth of 6% next year. What’s more, the company has met or surpassed estimates in seven straight quarters. ATVI is also growing its cash flow at a rate of 90% right now, so it is clear that management is using its success to sure up its financial position. 3.       Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)It has been a massive year for GPU behemoth Nvidia, but the company’s remarkable rally has meant that its stock has been hit hard by the tech selloff. In fact, NVDA has slumped more than 13% over the past five days.However, Nvidia remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Next year, the company’s growth is expected to continue, with current projections calling for earnings to expand by an additional 11% and sales growing a further 16%. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1000,LRCX,"Earnings season kicked off last week with the first few technology companies averaging a 9.9% earnings growth rate on a revenues growth rate of 7.1%. The biggest releases were Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), eBAY (EBAY  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report). Here are the details:EarningsNetflix: The video streaming company had a very good revenue quarter, with the top line jumping over 30% from last year. Subscriber additions were impressive with domestic paid members growing 10.5% to 51.35 million. International growth was even stronger at up 43.2% to 52.68 million. But since content costs whether acquired or produced continue to increase, the earnings of 29 cents fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents.The recent price hike will help future results but note that the company has already also earmarked several billions for content. Moreover, it continues to burn cash. Read more: Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Miss, Subscriber Growth ImpressiveLam Research: Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research saw very strong growth in revenue and earnings, both of which also sailed past the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. That’s because the semiconductor market is particularly hot right now, as players scramble to produce more memory to capture the growing demand for data and related services.The company estimates that the semiconductor market will grow 15%+ this year following a 2% average growth rate in the last six years. At the same time, it says that WFE spending has remained rational, implying that there’s unlikely to be a correction any time soon. In this environment, Lam’s early lead in acquiring the capabilities to serve the NAND market will help it gain market share. Read more: Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) Tops Q1 Earnings & Revenue EstimateseBay: The online marketplace reported earnings that matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate (helped by share buybacks) on revenue that exceeded slightly (helped by positive FX). Active buyers increased by a couple of million, the marketplaces business also did well, but promotional pricing for new/small sellers and sluggish growth in StubHub impacted results. StubHub issues are likely to continue, as sporting events restricting tickets is making it harder for the business to generate profits.The guidance for the all-important holiday quarter was also short of exciting: revenue of $2.58 billion to $2.62 billion (or 9% growth at the midpoint) compared to $2.58 billion consensus and EPS of $0.57 to $0.59 (or 7% growth at the midpoint) compared to $0.60 consensus. Read more: eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Match Estimates, Revenues BeatPayPal: PayPal also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both revenue and profits and raised full-year guidance. Apart from registering strong growth in revenue and earnings, the company also reported an increase of 88% in its active customer base to 218 million, including more than 17 million merchant accounts. The total payment volume (TPV) jumped 30% with 35% of the payment volume coming from mobile devices. The P2P business (Venmo) saw a 106% increase in TPV.

Hargreaves raised his fiscal 2018 earnings estimate from $11.07 to $11.68, well above the street consensus of $11.03 while upgrading the stock from Sector Weight to Overweight.The analyst said that Apple’s layered pricing strategy of $999 for the iPhone X, higher prices for the iPhone 8/8 Plus as well as its storage step-up pricing was effectively segmenting its customer base to generate more profit for the company. As a result, his iPhone ASP and gross margin targets are now up to $760 and 39.5%, respectively (the street consensus is at $725 and 38.6%). Prompted by an improved outlook for average selling prices, Lamba raised his price target from $150 to $160, which is close to Apple’s current price and retained his neutral rating on the shares.Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs Unleashed on Toronto: Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs is partnering with Waterfront Toronto, the public agency funded by federal, provincial and city governments, to build a highly digitized neighborhood in the Eastern Waterfront area of the Canadian capital. Quayside, as the area will be called, is currently an underdeveloped region, but the plan is to take it to the forefront of technological progress, teaming with automated transport of various kinds, including bikes, vans and cars for both personal and business uses, and even an automated trash collection system.Waymo and Lyft are expected to help in these efforts and other companies are likely to join the efforts as and when Sidewalk Labs partners with them. Google will be moving its Canadian headquarters and around 300 employees to the site once it is completed. But it expects to employ around 5,000 people in the region by then and support another 5,000 over the following 3-4 years.Amazon Wind Farm: Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has launched the 253 megawatt Amazon Wind Farm Texas, which operates more than 100 turbines – each over 300 feet tall with a rotor diameter more than twice the wingspan of a Boeing 787. Amazon Wind Farm Texas is built, owned and operated by Lincoln Clean Energy, a leading developer of wind and solar projects across the U.S. Amazon has launched 18 wind and solar projects across the U.S., with over 35 more to come. It is second only to Google in its clean energy consumption, having bought more than 1.22 gigawatts to date. Google has bought 1.85 gigawatts.Amazon Expands in Brazil: Amazon has been selling books in Brazil since 2012 but the company has now started selling electronics as well. Products can also be purchased with up to ten interest free monthly installments on the items sold with local sellers handling deliveries. The logistics business in Brazil is reportedly complicated, which makes it difficult for ecommerce companies to get into it.Amazon may eventually open a fulfillment center for sellers, although that is pure conjecture at this point. A Bloomberg report mentioned that Amazon’s easy returns policy might help it gain momentum, as that is a sore point for Brazilian customers and it’s apparently really hard to get your money back.NVIDIA Price Target Hiked: Analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on (NVDA  -  Free Report), while raising his price target to $220, representing around 12% upside from current levels. Some of the positives cited include the rising GPU pricing trend fueled by strength in the gaming and cryptocurrency markets, recent business deal wins in China and growing demand from the self-driving market.HP Estimates, Target Price Up: Amit Daryanani of RBC raised estimates to account for the company’s 2018 guidance. His new EPS estimate is $1.81 (previously $1.74) and revenue estimate $52.0 billion (previously $50.8 billion). The note said that HPQ's ""FY18 guide is inherently conservative and could enable sustained beats/raises over the next few quarters,"" and ""Commodity markets should remain challenging but likely peak in FQ4 (October); that headwind should be offset by cost-reduction initiatives.""Micron Retires Debt, Appoints EVP Global Operations: Micron will be using the proceeds of its recent equity offering to redeem $1.25 billion of its outstanding 7.5% notes due 2023 and $1 billion of its 5.25% notes due 2023. The company also appointed Manish Bhatia as EVP of Global Operations to report directly to Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO. He will be in charge of operations, including the company’s global manufacturing fab footprint, back-end assembly and test operations, supply chain planning and fulfillment, procurement, quality and IT teams to enhance Micron’s agility and responsiveness to meet customer requirements through a tighter coordination and alignment of these critical business functions.Legal/RegulatoryApple Fined $440 Million: After 7 years of winning and losing appeals, VirnetX, which sues on patents held but doesn’t manufacture anything of its own, has finally won another legal round against Apple. The judge and jury found Apple guilty of infringement and willful infringement at that, so they awarded the patent troll, as such companies are sometimes called, $440 million. This includes the jury verdict of $302.4 million awarded last year, additional willful infringement charges of $41.3 million or $1.80 in royalties per infringed device sold, and another $96 million by way of interests, costs and attorney fees. Apple said it would appeal the decision.Qualcomm Sues Apple Again:  An Accesswire report indicates that Qualcomm has filed another patent infringement case against Apple in Beijing. The three patents in question are related to power management and touch screen technology known as Force Touch, which Apple uses in its iPhones. Qualcomm says that since these patents are not a part of any standard, it is not bound to license them.Qualcomm is asking the court to ban the manufacture and sale of iPhones in China. Since this is an employment question, it is very unlikely that the lawsuit will be successful. The Chinese authorities haven’t made the filing public yet. Apple hasn’t denied infringement, but instead called the suit a courtroom maneuver, adding that these patents have never been discussed in the past and that Qualcomm’s effort would fail.New Products/TechnologyApple Watch Connectivity Issue in China: The new Apple Watch was the first one offering cellular connectivity by virtue of an eSIM (subscriber identity module) that Apple has embedded in it. The problem is that in China, the SIM is normally provided by state-owned telecom companies, which also register the person’s name. This therefore made it possible for the government to identify the person using it.Connectivity was first made available exclusively to customers on China Unicom, but was abruptly cut off without adequate explanations. All that China Unicom said on its website was that the cellular feature had been offered on a trial basis. It’s currently believed that since the technology is relatively new and lesser-known in China, regulatory authorities may have required its discontinuation.iPhone 8 Demand Issue: Taiwan’s Economic Daily reported that Apple told its suppliers of a 50% cut in iPhone 8 components for the final quarter of the year because of lower-than-expected demand. This is likely because of customers are waiting it out to buy the more expensive iPhone X, although there could be some customers defecting to other devices. If iPhone X increases in the sales mix, Apple will obviously make more profit, so this weakness could in fact be good news. Nevertheless, it sent shares down.Intel on Autonomous Vehicle Safety: Intel and Mobileye have created a set of standards that if adopted will ensure that self-driving cars aren’t responsible for accidents. At the World Knowledge Forum in Seoul, South Korea, Professor Amnon Shashua, Mobileye CEO and Intel senior vice president, offered his solution.The solution is based on the understanding that the most a vehicle can do to avoid an accident is to ensure that it isn’t the cause. The company seeks to show that computers can precisely calculate the time it takes for another vehicle or pedestrian approaching it to actually make contact with it, so it can take a course of action that will avoid the collision much better than a human.Cisco’s AI-Powered Predictive Services: The two new services are called Business Critical Services and High-value Services. Powered by AI, these services anticipate IT failures, mitigate risk, reduce maintenance costs, and assist organizations in attaining the necessary skills to transform their businesses. ""Business Critical Services,"" uses analytics, automation, compliance and security tools to enable a secure, efficient and agile technology environment, minimize human error and help extract the most value from products and solutions in a secure environment. High-value services offer software, hardware and network support for Cisco systems and processes.YouTube Comedy Video Series: Featuring comedians Trevor Noah, Judd Apatow and Howie Mandel, YouTube has launched its first virtual reality (VR) video series called “The Confessional”. Google offered a grant to Montreal-based production company Felix & Paul Studios as funding. In seven episodes of several minutes each, over the next few weeks, comedians and YouTube stars including Lilly Singh and Grace Helbig will confess about embarrassing and awkward moments in their lives such as first dates gone wrong.YouTube hasn’t said how much it intends to spend on VR content, but it should be a priority for its recently-launched $79 Daydream View headset, which uses the smartphone display close to stream VR content. Earlier this year, it pulled out $30K to launch a training program for video makers with at least 10,000 followers. It also introduced a new video format for semi-immersive videos that is intended to reduce the cost of creation.Google Chip for Consumer Devices: Last week, Google announced a system on chip (SoC) called Pixel Visual Core that will increase the speed and power efficiency of its camera. Google says it’s an image processing unit (IPU), although it is structurally closer to an 8-core processor like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon or Samsung Exynos. Although a part of its latest Pixel offerings, Google will activate the device some time soon, after which third-party developers will get access to it.Google hasn’t said that its relationship with Qualcomm will change as a result of the chip, but its growing prowess in chip design is no doubt a matter of concern for the leading mobile processor company. For Google, this is an important step to more closely integrate hardware and software in its devices the way that Apple does. If anything, these moves are indication of Google’s growing ambitions for mobile and IoT markets. New Twitter Rules for Abuse, Hate Speech: Twitter hasn’t formed any new rules, but the company has come out and said that it’s going to. Its primary goal is to remove unwanted sexual advances, nonconsensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorify violence from the platform and it will frame rules so bystanders can report incidents.Twitter ""will take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause."" The concession comes after Rose McGowan was prevented from posting additional tweets about alleged sexual abuse by Hollywood bigwigs. Twitter said that the 12-hour suspension was because she mentioned a private phone number. Women boycotted the site on her call. This kind of thing is turning out to be unsafe for users and therefore, harmful for business, so the company says it is taking necessary steps.Collaborations and M&AApple-GE Deal: Apple has inked a deal with GE to use its Predix data-collection and analysis tool to launch a toolkit targeted at the industrial sector. The toolkit will help developers build apps for iPhone and iPads that can facilitate collaboration in industrial environments thus increasing the efficiency of operations, lowering unplanned downtime, facilitating better resource allocation and leading to overall time and cost savings.Apple’s role will thus be to develop and promote Predix as the industrial IoT platform of choice, for which GE will standardize on iPhone and iPad and promote Apple's Mac computers as a choice for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees. Apple’s approach has been to build custom solutions for large enterprises and verticals, with each win being a stepping stone, helping it expand deeper into the enterprise segment.Intel-Facebook on AI Chip: Intel announced its Nervana Neural Network Processors at the WSJ D.Live conference last week. The chip has been built specifically for neural networks and is, according to Intel a first of its kind. Intel intends to expand the product line to an entire family over time.Former Nervana CEO Naveen Rao who joined Intel after his company was acquired by the chip giant, said that Intel would ultimately sell the chips in two ways: it will either sell a data center appliance containing several of the new Nervana Neural Network Processors as well as Intel’s CPUs to customers wanting to run deep learning projects within their own data centers. Or, it will rent access to the chips through Intel’s cloud data centers the way NVIDIA does. Facebook, which along with others helped the chip get off to launch, will be among the first to test the chip on its platform.   Facebook Buys tbh: Facebook has bought tbh, or “to be honest,” the anonymous messaging app from parent company Midnight Labs. The app allows you to run polls regarding people’s positive attributes, after which there is an option to connect with the people that chose you. They can, however, choose to remain anonymous even after they are part of your network. The app has been very popular with teens this summer rising to the top of Apple’s app store rankings despite launching only in August. Apple’s app store describes the app as one that has been downloaded 5 million times with 2.5 million daily active users.Facebook’s Deal with Delivery Services: Facebook now has deals with food delivery services like GrubHub, EatStreet, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow and Olo and direct deals with some restaurants that will allow U.S. users to order food from within the app. Facebook says food delivery is a tricky business and promises to remove some of the hurdles in its operation.The goal is, of course, that users never leave its platform by giving them all they might need right on it. The longer they stay, the greater the opportunities to serve them ads and keep them from rival services like Google. In the delivery business too, operations like UberEats and Amazon delivery are likely to see increased competition because of Facebook.Cisco Buying Perspica: Cisco is building on its $3.7 billion acquisition of AppDynamics, which offers tools to better understand how applications are operating to identify which applications or hardware are not providing optimal performance. Now, Perspica, a machine learning startup that has raised around $8.85 million, will expand and strengthen these capabilities so customers can better analyze large amounts of application-related data, in real time and with business context, and irrespective of when an application is deployed in a company's public, private or multiple cloud environments.  Google-Target Deal Expansion: Just as Walmart did a short while back, Target is cozying up with Google to help it battle Amazon in ecommerce. After testing the Google Express delivery service in New York City, the company has announced that it will be expanding it to the rest of the country barring Hawaii and Alaska. So customers can use the Google Express website or app to get their Target stuff delivered.What’s more, Target is quickly bringing more services to Google Express, including its Redcard credit and debit cards that enable free shipping and a 5% discount (this one should be available next year). Although voice ordering hasn’t gained momentum and most people aren’t comfortable using it yet, the deal also lets Target customers voice-order through Google Home.For Google, this is valuable data that gives it insight into customer buying habits and so, can help it better target ads. It also provides it a foothold in the product search space that Amazon has grown quickly to dominate.Some NumbersNintendo Switch: Top-Selling Console in September: Nintendo has come out to say that according to NPD sales data, the company’s Switch game console was the leading one in September, making it the best-selling device in the U.S. for three straight months and five of the last seven months. When combined with the 3DS family of systems and the Super NES Classic Edition system, Nintendo systems claimed two-thirds of the month’s total video game hardware sales.With the first holiday season in progress, the company will no doubt see a very strong year. Nintendo’s return to prominence is commendable despite the fact that both Sony’s PS4 and Microsoft’s XB1 have been around for a few years.Some Companies Reporting This Week: TXN, TER, NLSN, KLAC, EXPE, GOOGL, FTV, AMZN, FFIV, CA, XLNX, NXPI, IRM, TWTR, VRSN, NTGR, GRUB, STX, AMD, AKAM, GLW, JNPR, MSFT, CDNS, INTC, WDCZacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

1001,LRCX,"Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings! Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul.This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

1005,LRCX,"Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 loss of 66 cents per share, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 44 cents but narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of $1.13.Revenues increased 6.8% from the year-ago quarter to $768.9 million. Revenues came in better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $753.6 million. The growth was driven by increases in Gaming, Lottery and Interactive segment revenues. However, unfavorable foreign currency exchange hurt revenues by $2.1 million.Scientific Games’ shares have gained 241.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 22.6% rally.Quarter DetailsGaming Segment (59.1% of total revenues) revenues increased 1.4% year over year to $454.6 million in the third quarter. The increase can primarily be attributed to growth in Gaming Machine sales, Gaming Systems and Table Products of 2.1%, 7.6% and 10.5%, respectively. This was partly offset by lower revenues in gaming operations that decreased 3.5%.

1007,LRCX,"With Q3 earnings season in full swing, one must be looking to pick stocks based on their quarterly earnings as a company’s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum. But overlooking sales growth is not prudent. Earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated and the numbers inflated. That’s why sales should always be considered.Accomplishing sales growth is extremely challenging in today’s multifaceted and fast-changing business environment. So, the companies have stepped up marketing initiatives over digital platforms and have become more professional about sales management to drive their top line.Also, sales growth is an important metric for any company as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making. Unsurprisingly, sales growth gets more attention from investors in the investment process, as a healthy sales growth rate is usually a positive investment indicator.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t reveal too much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily translate into profits.Therefore, consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The company has long-term expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 14.9% and carries a Zacks Rank #1.Xylem Inc.

Earnings were up 20.4% year over year.Following the strong fiscal third-quarter results, share price has increased 4.16% in the after-hours trading. Also, the company’s shares have surged 35.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.3%.During the quarter, the company closed the acquisition of U.K.-based Cobalt Light Systems, which might allow Agilent to strengthen its presence in the high-growth Raman spectroscopy market. The deal complements Agilent’s own product expansion efforts with a promise to help it offer better services to its pharmaceutical and biopharma customers.We also remain positive on Agilent’s broad-based portfolio and increased focus on segments with higher growth potential. Further, the company continues to introduce high-margin products.RevenuesAgilent’s fiscal third-quarter 2017 revenues of $1.11 billion inched up 1.1% sequentially and 6.7% year over year.

China remained strong in the quarter. Also, better-than-expected growth in Europe contributed to the upside.Revenues by SegmentAgilent now has three reporting segments — Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG), Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) and Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG). Its Electronic Measurement Group (EMG) segment was spun off as Keysight Technologies, an independent publicly traded company. Agilent also exited the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business after failing to meet growth and profitability goals. The company divested or shut down underperforming units to streamline operations.In the reported quarter, LSAG was the largest contributor and accounted for $531 million or 47% of total revenue, reflecting an increase of 5% year over year. This was driven by strong performances in the chemical and energy, pharma and environmental markets.Revenues from ACG came in at $386 million or 35% of total revenue, reflecting a rise of 7% year over year. Both services and consumables witnessed growth across all geographical regions.Revenues from DGG came in at $197 million or remaining 18% of total revenue. The segment was up 9% year over year, driven by strength in pharma, diagnostic and clinical end-markets. All businesses under this group (Dako, Genomics and Nucleic Acid Solutions) performed well.MarginsThe pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 53.5%, down 22 basis points (bps) sequentially and 81 bps year over year.Operating expenses (research & development and selling, general & administrative expenses) in the quarter were $395 million, 0.3% lower than the year-ago quarter. As a result, operating margin was 18.0% versus 14.0% in the year-ago quarter.Net IncomeAgilent generated pro forma net income of $191 million (59 cents per share) compared with $160 million (49 cents) in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles and other one-time items as well as tax adjustments.With these above-mentioned items included, GAAP net income was $175 million (54 cents per share) compared with $124 million (38 cents) in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetExiting the fiscal third quarter, inventories were $566 million, up from $548 in the prior quarter.

1009,LRCX,"Following the investment track of Oracle of Omaha, we can see how, in quest of excellence, this pure play value investor gradually shifted to become a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investor. According to him, while picking undervalued stocks, investors also need to focus on its earnings growth potential.GARP combines both growth and value investing principles and offers a mixed investing strategy that has a proven track record of success.What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).And here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock’s P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company’s PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screening:Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF  -  Free Report): This franchise bottler produces, markets, distributes, and sells Coca-Cola trademark beverages. The company offers a portfolio of products, including sparkling beverages, still beverages, juices, sports, and energy drinks, as well as teas, waters, isotonics, and dairy products.

1010,LRCX,"Zillow Group (ZG  -  Free Report) reported earnings of 4 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, which was much better than a loss of 71 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Including stock-based compensation, the company incurred loss of 12 cents, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents.Total revenue increased 28% year over year to $266.9 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $265 million.Notably, shares of Zillow have gained 10.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 19.8% rally.Quarter in DetailsZillow has two reportable segments namely, Marketplace (which includes Premier Agent, other real estate and mortgages) and Display.In the second quarter, Marketplace revenues of $248.6 million increased 30% on a year-over- year basis. Premier Agent increased 29% year on year attributable to increase in platform visits. The rise was primarily driven by an increase in the number of agents and accelerated spending for advertising.Real Estate revenues surged 45% year over year. This segment was propelled by continued demand for the company’s brands such as StreetEasy, Zillow, Trulia, Naked Apartments, Hot Pads and HREO.Zillow Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zillow Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zillow Group, Inc. QuoteMortgages reached $20.9 million, reflecting a 14% year-over-year increase. Since the majority of the consumers are home purchase loan shoppers, fluctuation in interest rates did not affect them massively.On the other hand, Display revenues of $18.3 million increased approximately 9% on a year-over-year basis, with better-than-expected brand sales initiatives and resultant increased traffic being the key driving factors.Reported sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues expanded 140 basis points (bps). Technology and development expenses as a percentage of revenues however contracted 100 bps.As of Jun 30, 2017, Zillow had cash and cash equivalents of $276.5 million compared with $243.6 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceManagement expects third-quarter 2017 total revenue to remain in the range of $273 million to $278 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $235.9 million.The company expects Premier Agent revenues of $196 million to $198 million, other real estate revenues of $40 million to $41 million, and mortgage revenues of $20 million to $21 million, which taken together comprise Marketplace revenues.Display revenues are projected in the range of $17 million to $18 million.Operating expenses are expected to remain in the range of $261 million to $266 million.

The EBITDA outlook ranges between $220 million and $230 million, with a 21% margin at the midpoint.Our TakeZillow posted better than expected top- and bottom-line results. The company’s increased advertising effectiveness, continuous product innovation and effective free marketing channels are helping it to gain audience. Continuous growth in new MLS partnerships is enabling the company to deliver high quality listing information to homebuyers and sellers.However, increasing competition, hiked mortgage interest rates and constrained advertising spend remain headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Zillow has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI  -  Free Report) both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2.

1011,LRCX,"These are tough times for U.S. markets for sure. Investors are smarting from two straight weeks of losses and the Trump administration’s recent actions have only added to their worries. From frequent departures at Trump’s core team to heightened tensions with North Korea, surely markets have had much to worry about.But do political events actually have a major impact on the bourses over a longer period? Jim Cramer certainly doesn’t think so. In a recent edition of his iconic Mad Money show, he explained that upheavals in Washington hardly mattered to markets.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) seem to be in agreement and believes that conditions for a Bull Run remain in place. This is why it makes for a smart move to buy value stocks on the dip and lie in wait of the next wave.Two Straight Weeks of LossesBy Aug 18, markets had endured two straight weeks of losses. The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had lost 1.4%, 2% and 2.3%, respectively, over this period. In fact, the Nasdaq has now posted four straight weeks of losses, losing in excess of 3%. The first week of losses was largely attributable to a further deterioration in U.S.-North Korea relations.Then, on Aug 17, the S&P 500 declined more than 1%, suffering its worst daily loss in more than three months. It was only the third occasion this year that it had gained or lost in excess of 1%. Market watchers believe the session’s losses were largely attributable to speculation over Gary Cohn’s resignation from the position of chief economic advisor to President Trump.Factors Propelling Bully Run Still in PlaceStocks ultimately inched upward on Aug 21, but the Nasdaq continued to trend lower. However, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity Strategist Michael Wilson classifies the Aug 17 selloff as only a “re-test” of the correction which occurred during the preceding week. A “re-test” is market parlance for a second drop which follows an initial drop and recovery. Only, on this occasion, prices are only trying to “re-test” the fresh low.Wilson contends that a successful “re-test” happens only when optimism about price increases exists, a signal which he thinks has been noticed. Morgan Stanley also believes that the factors that power stocks remain firmly in place. These include a resilient economy and earnings growth, easy interest rates and steadily increasing inflation. A responsive Federal Reserve and fair valuations are other positives, according to Wilson.  Cramer, Wilson Ignore Political EventsWhat is worth noting is that Wilson’s set of factors propelling stock gains does not include government policies or legislative action. Politics seem to be only a distraction for investors and investment themes geared to White House policy have been largely set aside. Using this logic, the impact of events such as those which occurred on Aug 17 is limited to the short term.Jim Cramer had expressed similar sentiments while discussing the fallout of Trump’s response to the Charlottesville incident and his decision to disband manufacturing councils. Or lack thereof, as was apparent when all major benchmarks traded higher even after these events. Cramer had also discounted the impact of political events. Instead, he too, ascribed markets’ strength to strong earnings performances, soft interest rates and steady inflation growth.Our ChoicesIgnoring the downturn of recent weeks, Morgan Stanley believes that factors powering stock market gains remain in place. This means that recent losses are only a temporary lull and the market rally could resume soon.

1012,LRCX,"In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks.Among them, price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks, which have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.Understanding Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. It is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this would equate to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Explaining the P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median:A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the six stocks that qualified the screening:Magellan Health, Inc.

1018,LRCX,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of Black Duck Software announced in November. Black Duck is a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. The deal was valued at $547 million net of cash acquired.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. Black Duck’s flagship product, Software Composition Analysis is anticipated to enhance Synopsys’ solutions as well as broaden its clientele, thus boosting the top line.Synopsys’ Software Integrity Platform combines testing technologies and automated analysis for detection and remediation of defects and vulnerabilities at the beginning of the development process to ensure minimal risk and optimum profit levels.Notably, the rapid increase in the use of open source software (OSS) that comprises almost 60% of the underlying codes in current applications has lowered development costs but is plagued by security breach issues. The addition of Black Duck’s software solutions will detect known security vulnerabilities affecting open source code and also generate alerts for the same. This will improve the effectiveness of Synopsys’ solutions.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteAcquisitions: A Key Growth DriverAcquisitions are central to Synopsys’ growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Intense competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Mentor Graphics Corporation has made the EDA market tougher to penetrate. Synopsys’ acquisitions have helped it to boost revenues.Most recently, Synopsys acquired Forcheck, which offers static code analysis tools in Fortran applications. These tools meet the industry coding standards and compliances. Prior to that, the company had added Cigital, Codiscope and Simpleware to its kitty.The acquisitions have expanded the company’s product suite thereby driving the company’s top line. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter revenues that jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million.Synopsys stock has gained 52.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 35.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Influencing Synopsys’ PerformanceWe believe unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys are likely to drive near-term performance of the company. The company’s recent product launches and deal wins will boost results, going ahead.However, a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines. Moreover, escalating costs and expenses, which are putting pressure on margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability.Further, customer concentration risk remains a huge concern for the company. Additionally, a substantial portion of the company’s revenues are generated from outside the United States. This might adversely impact the top line due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and an uncertain macroeconomic environment.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSynopsys has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some top-ranked stocks worth considering in the sector are Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1020,LRCX,"In value analysis, though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are  most preferred by investors, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareP/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Now let us understand the concept of book value.What is Book Value?There are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are four stocks that qualified the screening:Xcerra Corporation (XCRA  -  Free Report) engages in designing, manufacturing, and marketing automatic test equipment for the semiconductor industry.

1021,LRCX,"Leverage, in particular financial leverage, is the amount of debt that an entity uses to buy more assets. In corporate finance, debt financing is a well-known term, which is used as a tool by companies to ensure smooth business operations. Since companies have limited funds, they need exogenous funding to boost their financial resources from time to time for expansion of operations.Even with the option for equity financing, companies prefer borrowing funds as these are easily and cheaply available. Moreover, using financial leverage rather than acquiring more equity capital is favored as equity financing reduces the earnings per share of existing shareholders.Yet the word “debt” is unnerving for many.  This is because while debt brings with it the capacity to spend a little bit more, it also carries the burden of repayment with additional interest in the future.  In fact, the related amount of interest expense may overwhelm the borrower if it does not earn sufficient returns to offset the interest expense. This is a particular problem when interest rates rise or the returns from assets decline.Also when theamount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant, it poses greater risk. In fact, companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt.Considering this and the fact that analysts are currently estimating a hike in U.S. interest rates at the upcoming Fed meet this month, investors may feel shaky. Nevertheless, this does not indicate that one should totally dissuade from equity investment.What investors need now is tochoose stocks prudently, avoiding those with high debt loads. So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to safeguard investors from becoming victims of debt trap. Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company’s credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.As we approach the end of Q4, the growth picture seems to be improving compared to what we saw in the year-ago quarter. Naturally, this would entice investors to pour money in stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth.But in the uncertain world of investment, markets can trip anytime, particularly affecting companies with a higher degree of financial leverage. Therefore, blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen.Norbord Inc. (OSB  -  Free Report): This corporation is a producer of wood-based panels. It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 0.28% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #1.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fiserv, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteOur TakeFiserv’s financial and payment solutions business is backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. Additionally, the strong user base of Mobiliti ASP remains a major growth driver. The company remains focused on expanding its product portfolio.Fiserv completed the acquisitions of Monitise, PCLender and Dovetail Group in the third quarter. The product-oriented acquisitions are expected to further enhance its clientele in the United States as well as in the international markets.Monitise’s cloud-based FINKit platform, which gained significance in a short span of time following its launch in fiscal 2016, will be a growth driver for the company going ahead.Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are also gaining momentum among banks and credit unions. Investment in digital-oriented technologies is likely to improve its competitiveness.Fiserv expects revenues from solutions like DNA and Zelle to drive growth. Further, the company’s new five-year cost cutting program is also likely to prove beneficial.However, lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations are negatively impacting the company’s sales.Additionally, Fiserv’s policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk. The company’s highly leveraged balance sheet will continue to weigh on its profitability.Moreover, intensifying competition from Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) remains a concern.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Fiserv carries Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology Inc.

1023,LRCX,"Scientific Games Corp.

The growth was driven by increases in the gaming and interactive segment revenues.

Unfavorable foreign currency exchange also impacted revenues by $4.9 million.During the quarter, the company shipped 4,367 gaming machines to the U.S. and Canada.

Unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacted revenues by $2.2 million.Lower international revenues and unfavorable foreign currency exchange ($1.8 million) hurt Instant Games revenue growth in the reported quarter.

1024,LRCX,"In the Global Week Ahead, to find the biggest fundamental catalyst for stock markets, target the usual suspect at the top of a month – the latest U.S. non-farm payroll report.On Wednesday, the ADP private payroll report lands. This is a foreshadowing of the preliminary Federal number out on Friday.What’s the backdrop going into the report? Last week’s U.S. unemployment claims remained low at 238K. A lagging indicator is the U.S. household unemployment rate. It rests at 4.1%. That’s low too.So Friday’s economist consensus sees monthly job additions number at around +200K for November. That’s a muddle-through call.Nonetheless, this updated coincident indicator will get studied in great detail.Perhaps the most closely watched internal numbers become the annual wage growth figures. These are a ‘tell’ on any future pickup in U.S. consumer inflation. In turn, that would get the Federal Open Market Committee’s full attention.In the halls of Congress, the U.S. is still a fair distance from enacting a tax plan.The Senate version and House version now go into ‘conference.’ In this set of joint meetings, the House and Senate hash out a common agreement to bridge differences. They will re-submit a single proposal to both chambers.This Friday, there is an expiring deadline on funding needed to keep the U.S. government open. In other words, a debt ceiling and spending appropriation deadline looms. This opens up a rather small possibility of a government shutdown.Not to be put on a back burner, the Mueller investigation can surely intensify.Across the Global Week Ahead, central banks outside the USA will make important policy rate setting decisions.On Wednesday, in Latin America, consensus expects the Banco Central do Brasil to cut its Selic monetary policy rate by 50 basis points.  Last week, South Korea became the first major Asian central bank since 2014 to hike interest rates.That was a sign the ‘great unwinding’ of crisis-era low interest rates are spreading. Resurgent growth in Europe and the U.S. has benefitted Asia.Who is next? Further south, count on Australia to keep rates on hold this week. Focus instead on whether there is any hint of a possible hike next year.Reserve Banks in Canada and India also hold monetary policy meetings prior to the U.S. payroll report. Top Zacks Stock Picks—Some stocks to watch…Rio Tinto (RIO  -  Free Report): China is getting Asia moving. That keeps materials companies busy. This stock is a $67 billion market cap iron ore mining company based in western Australia. The stock carries a Zacks long-term VGM score of A.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report): Don’t forget about the latest rise in global oil prices. This U.S. based oil and gas integrated player is a Zacks #1 Rank now. It has a long-term Zacks VGM score of C.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): Yes, the semiconductor stocks got hit hard last week. This week, keep a close eye on the trading action in this industry. This widely held stock is back to a Zacks #1 Rank, and the long-term Zacks VGM score is A.That set of stock metrics says the fire will be re-lit on semi chip stocks soon.???Key Global Macro—The biggest fundamental catalysts this week come from the U.S. jobs market.On Wednesday, the ADP private payrolls report will be released.On Friday, the key non-farm payroll report for the USA lands. Consensus looks for moderate job gains of around a 200k monthly pace for November.Given the tightness in labor markets, wage growth could accelerate.On Monday, Greece’s GDP growth rate should be +0.8% y/y. Meanwhile, Turkey’s Consumer Price Inflation is running hot at +12.98% y/y.On Tuesday, the monetary policy base rate in Poland gets re-set. It should remain at 1.5%.The Reserve Bank of Australia should keep its overnight rate at 1.5% too.The Irish services PMI rests at 57.5. We get a new reading here.The Spanish services PMI rests at 54.6. It gets re-set too.The German services PMI rests at 54.9. It gets re-set.The Eurozone composite PMI rests at 57.5. We get the final reading. Eurozone services rests at 56.2.Retail sales in the Eurozone stands at +4.7% y/y. We get a fresh reading.On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada (BoC) holds a monetary policy meting. Its latest policy rate is at 1.0% and is not expected to change.The Reserve Bank of India (the RBI) holds a monetary policy meeting too.  The reverse repo rate stands at 5.75% and it is not expected to move.The U.S. ADP employment survey comes out. It was at +235K.The ECB’s Draghi speaks in Brussels.On Thursday, the unemployment rate for Italy comes out. It has been at 11.2%.The unemployment rate for Greece is 20.6%.U.S. initial claims look low at 238K, once again.Mexico’s closely watched inflation rate comes out. It has been at +6.37% y/y and could climb to +6.59% y/y.On Friday, the key U.S. non-farm payroll report lands. The prior reading was 261K, and the unemployment rate was 4.1%.  The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index is at 98.5. We get a fresh reading.

1025,LRCX,"It is hard to ignore stocks that scale 52-week highs or hit the lows as such movements are tracked on a daily basis. But the question here is: what importance does such a stock movement hold from an investor’s perspective?In this screening article, we discuss the 52-week investment plan. One of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook, this strategy relies on the mantra, “buy high and sell higher.” Betting on a stock near its 52-week high has its own pitfalls as there is a possibility of it scaling higher or going downhill without forewarning.While market analysts may be divided in their opinion regarding the 52-week high investment technique, many of them believe that 52-week high stocks which are still undervalued and have strong upside potential can be lucrative bets.An Insight in to 52-Week High StocksStocks near 52-week highs often instill the presumptive “adjustment and anchoring bias” in the minds of investors. This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52-week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor.Many a times, such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers. Meanwhile, news pertaining to robust sales, surging profit levels, bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive the stock higher.However, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52-week high bar. Wall Street’s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it.Also, recent academic research reveals that if a stock’s current price is near its 52-week high, there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period. According to researchers George and Hwang, holding 52-week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0.45% between 1963 and 2001. Encouragingly, this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum-based strategies.Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52-week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries. The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum.These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range and is likely to touch the 52-week high mark soon.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank = 1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000 Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily.Here are seven of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen:Idaho-based Micron Technology, Inc.

1026,LRCX,"Share price of Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS  -  Free Report)) rallied to a new 52-week high of $50.53, eventually closing a tad lower at $50.45 on Nov 17.Notably, its shares have gained 260.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 23.7% rally. The outperformance can be attributed to growth in its Gaming, Lottery and Interactive segment revenues.In the last reported quarter, revenues increased 6.8% from the year-ago quarter to $768.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $753.6 million.Currently, Scientific Games carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has a market capital of $4.2 billion.What’s Backing the Rise?Scientific Games with its innovative product pipeline enjoys a premium position in the gaming equipment space, as well as in the instant ticket and online lottery markets. The company’s top line continues to be driven by robust performance from the gaming and interactive businesses.The company’s gaming segment is benefiting from increasing shipment of replacement units, which is backed by high adoption of the TwinStar J43cabinets.At the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas this year, the company showcased all the innovative new products that are set for launch in the year ahead. The company will introduce three James Bond themed games in its new cabinets, which include Gamefield 2.0, TwinStar J43 and TwinStar V75.The company’s lottery business is also well poised to gain from the growing popularity of the WILLY WONKA GOLDEN TICKET game. On the last conference call, management noted that the game so far has been selected by 16 lottery states. Moreover, in half of the 12 states in which it has been launched, it became the “highest indexing $10 game.”The company’s continuous win and expansion of significant contracts are expected to boost top-line growth going forward. Recently, it replaced a long-time competitor to win a contract from Kansas Lottery to provide lottery gaming systems and related services for a decade.Last week, the company announced the launch of its “next-generation gaming system” for Denmark-based Danske Spil lottery. We note that international expansions also provide significant growth opportunities to the company.Moreover, in the Interactive segment, robust performance of apps like Jackpot Party Social Casino, Quick Hit Slots, 88 Fortunes and Bingo Showdown is also a positive.However, the company’s leveraged balance sheet results in significant interest expense. Adding more debt for funding acquisitions will further enhance its indebtedness and weigh on its profitability.Scientific Games Corp Revenue (TTM) Scientific Games Corp Revenue (TTM) | Scientific Games Corp QuoteKey PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1028,LRCX,"It has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we today call the “momentum effect” in stock markets. Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing.It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift. Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles, this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company, and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future.At the core, momentum investing calls for investors to “Buy High, Sell Higher.”Why Does Momentum Strategy Work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit, and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses, and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will spring back to their original prices. On the other hand, investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares with other styles of investing over time. Recent research indicates that the size premium for small-cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has declined radically since the 1990s. Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) becomes known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.However, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s.Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains. Our screen will help you take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which will reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past one year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the 50 stocks, we choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter what the market conditions are, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Score of B or better: A top Momentum Score cuts short the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000:A substantial trading volume shows that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are five of the nine stocks that made it through this screen:Kronos Worldwide, Inc.

1030,LRCX,"Several semiconductor stocks were hit yesterday after Morgan Stanley downgraded several memory chip makers on concerns of falling NAND prices and weak earnings growth projection for 2018.Analyst Shawn Kim of Morgan Stanley noted that NAND flash memory chip prices are peaking but may start declining from the beginning of next year due to a supply glut. Notably, over the past year, NAND prices have been flaring up due to shortage of supply. Kim has a cautious stance as the supply-demand mismatch will diminish over the next few months. He further projects that there will be no material earnings growth for memory chip makers in 2018 due to fall in NAND prices.Based on these projections, Morgan Stanley lowered its ratings for three semiconductor companies which have high exposure in the NAND memory-chip space — Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report), Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM  -  Free Report). In a note to clients, Kim wrote, “We think now is the time to reduce exposure to NAND [flash memory] and Asian semiconductor names as the industry has benefited from sizable demand tailwinds and unprecedented pricing power, which we see reversing soon.”He further stated, ""Given our view of the cycle, we cannot recommend the sector until the market recognizes mounting pressure on NAND prices and slowing logic chip growth momentum in the near term… This reflects our negative view of prospects for the global memory industry, which is currently at a peak.""Semi Stocks Face the BruntThe recent rating downgrade and comments on the future prospects of memory chips adversely impacted several chip makers, sending the companies’ shares to close in the red on Nov 27. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), which represents the entire semiconductor performance, closed 1.3% lower yesterday.Among stocks, Western Digital and Taiwan Semiconductor were the biggest losers — the companies’ shares plunging 6.7% and 4.4%, respectively. Chip equipment manufacturers like Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) also took the punch, recording a decline of 2.7% and 1.7%, respectively.Another memory-chip maker — Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) — also faced the brunt of the rating downgrade despite having little exposure to NAND. The stock lost approximately 3.3% of its value yesterday even after Morgan Stanley raised its target price. Also, Kim’s encouraging remarks on its main segment —DRAM — failed to boost its performance.Kim noted that investors should not worry about Micron as the supply-demand dynamics for DRAM are still in favour of the company and price of DRAM will top-out in mid 2018. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on the stock.Cash in Your Investment Ahead of the FallKim’s recent comments reflect that the industry is nearing end of the super cycle, where memory-chip makers have enjoyed a remarkable run til last Friday. Therefore, it is wise to cash in your investment before the stocks start tumbling drastically.Citing Morgan Stanley’s analysis, Kim mentioned that investors should offload their holdings three to six months before the memory prices peak.Memory-chip providers Western Digital, Taiwan Semiconductor and Micron Technology have rallied 27.4%, 42.8% and 119.2%, respectively, year to date. This implies that exiting here will generate a good return unless you may lose your money.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1032,LRCX,"A company needs exogenous funds for smooth operations, meeting obligations and expanding business; with capital being one of the basic factors of production. Although there is option for equity financing, a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity. This is because debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity, especially in periods of low interest rates.Interestingly, the U.S. — the world’s richest economy — is the biggest borrower as well. In fact, according to the FY19 Federal Budget, at the end of FY18, gross U.S. federal government debt is estimated to be $21.09 trillion, more than double the debt load in the last decade.No one voluntarily wishes to be part of a debt-ridden nation. This is because debt brings with it the burden of interest payments.Then again, this should not dissuade one from investing in U.S. stocks. After all, in spite of such high debt levels, the United States remains the largest economy in the world in terms of GDP, representing a quarter share of the global economy per the latest World Bank figures.The problem arises when leverage, referred to as the amount of debt a company bears, becomes exorbitant. In particular, companies with high debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt.Therefore, the need of the hour is to choose stocks prudently, avoiding those with high debt loads. So the crux of safe investment lies in identifying low leverage stocks.This is where the significance of financial leverage ratio comes into play. This ratio measures the extent of financial leverage a company bears. Several leverage ratios have been developed for this purpose, with debt-to-equity ratio being the most popularAnalyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.With the Q3 reporting cycle well behind us, companies that recorded higher earnings growth will attract investors on probabilities of outperformance in Q4 as well. But if such companies bear high leverage, they might not generate satisfactory returns. This is because during economic depressions, debt-ridden companies are prone to falling into a debt trap.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen.EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report): This corporation is engaged in design, integration, installation, start-up, testing, operation and maintenance of complex mechanical and electrical systems.

1034,LRCX,"Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC  -  Free Report) has recently received a $165 million information technology (IT) contract from the Commonwealth of Virginia to serve as a multisourcing service integrator (MSI).Per the contract, Science Applications will be assisting Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) in modernizing the state’s IT infrastructure.VITA is a provider of consolidated technology services and solutions for the commonwealth and it is in charge of all technology related operations of the state including procuring products and services and supervision of major IT projects.This award has a five-year base period and two 2-year options, which add up to a potential value of $272 million, if all options are exercised.SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORP. Revenue (TTM) SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Revenue (TTM) | SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION QuoteThe contract entrusts Science Applications with the responsibility of monitoring the state executive branch agencies’ IT infrastructure services suppliers. This will also involve diversification of the state’s suppliers’ portfolio and improvement of the quality of service delivery. It will also look into cost effectiveness and provide a transparent view of the entire service delivery platform.Frequent Contract Wins by SAIC: A Boon or a Bane?Notably, Science Applications has been steadily winning contracts from the federal government, but these low-margin deals have affected the company’s profitability.In the recently reported fiscal second-quarter 2018, the company won a contract worth $621 million (if all options are exercised) from the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM). Moreover, the GSA, on behalf of the Army Software Engineering Directorate (SED), awarded another contract worth $404 million (if all options are exercised).Science Applications also won contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GSFC Omnibus Multidisciplinary Engineering Services, U.S. Navy - Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), NASA Joint Operations, and National Institute of Mental Health.These contracts ensure recurring revenues but adjusted operating income margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 5.5% in the reported quarter. The deals with the federal civilian bodies and re-competed supply chain management contracts weigh the most on margins. Also, an increase in cost reimbursement type contracts compared with fixed price contracts are a headwind.Nevertheless, we believe that the frequent government deals have increased the company’s prominence in the market and have positively impacted its top line.Zacks Rank and Key PicksScience Applications currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better ranked stocks in the broader technology sphere include Applied Materials, Inc.

1035,LRCX,"Though rising yields have dampened the appeal for dividend investing, a niche corner of this space is still in vogue. This is none other than the dividend growth strategy. Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those that pay high yields.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are six of the 14 stocks that fit the bill:Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report): This California-based company designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. It is expected to see earnings growth of 44.76% for this fiscal year and has a P/E ratio of 14.21 versus the industry average of 21.3. Lam Research has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Style Score of A.

1042,LRCX,"Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report)) recently announced a late-night chat show with the icon David Letterman, who was last seen as the host of CBS’ Late Show in May 2015. Letterman is making a comeback on TV with Netflix’s yet-to-be-named six-episode series set to release in 2018.The one-hour talk show will involve a single guest in a long-format interview as well as in-between segments. In a post, Letterman said, “I feel excited and lucky to be working on this project for Netflix.” He even revealed that the show will not have much resemblance with his past late-night shows that involved multiple guests, monologues and top 10 lists.Netflix has brought on board the A-listers in comedy like Dave Chapelle, Ellen DeGeneres, Adam Sandler and Jerry Seinfeld. Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos was quoted saying that Netflix's original content effort will get a boost from bringing “a true television icon” like Letterman on board as he is a master at “out in the wild, out from behind the desk and interviewing the people he finds most interesting.”Per sources, RadicalMedia, the company behind many Netflix series, will produce the 10 times Emmy award winner’s show.The streaming giant also announced an anthology series named “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” by Oscar-winning Coen brothers to premiere in 2018. The “mini-series” featuring Tim Blake Nelson as the titular character, Ryne Daley, James Franco, Zoe Kazan and others, will have six stories about America’s Wild West.The development comes on the heels of Disney’s cancelled deal with Netflix. Disney’s pull out might result in a brief setback for the company. However, going forward, the number of initiatives taken by Netflix, including the development of more kids and family oriented content will enable it to establish itself as a leading content provider in our view.Netflix, Inc.

1043,LRCX,"I run a portfolio at Zacks called TAZR Trader, which stands for Technical Analysis plus the Zacks Rank.Every week I screen for stocks that get the top grades from the Zacks Rank for their earnings momentum and then I analyze the chart and institutional sponsorship for the stock.Four names that passed the test early this year I’ve actually held onto for a while. And I plan to keep holding on to core positions while trading their swings… all the way to $200 during this bull market.There’s a video attached to this article with all their charts and the prime buying zones you want to be watching.But if you just want to read about them first, along with my rationale for their unstoppable profit and price trends, here are the 4 stocks that make it into my $200 Club…Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report): The maker of the Invisalign clear “teeth straighteners” continues to take the world, thousands of smiles at a time. American dental professionals love the product and as more consumers become aware of the option, Align’s market share dominates.Plus, the international growth should see 25%+ for years to come. Just think of the market potential for clear aligners in China and India!Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report): The Amazon of China just keeps surprising Wall Street with its growth in over a dozen business units, from ecommerce and the cloud to media and finance.Jack Ma came to the US in June and invited small businesses to discover Alibaba as the gateway to selling their products and services to the largest middle class on the planet. Years of dominate growth lie ahead that will justify the valuation.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): This premier “arms dealer” for chip makers is on a big roll because the demand for its wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) is almost beyond traditional cycles right now. By that I mean that the cloud, mobile, autonomous cars, and machine learning/automation are creating a secular wave of demand that will run well into 2019.Speaking of machine learning and AI, I could easily argue that NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) is headed to $200. But I sold too early and can’t justify an entry here above $160. So I say, buy the dips in the affordable Lam instead of chasing the pricey NVIDIA.Facebook (FB  -  Free Report): This business model is so misunderstood by average investors. Zuckerberg and his teams copied what was working for Google with Adwords and created a whole new revolution for small business advertising. The ability to target and re-target very specific audiences and then have access to analytics that show you how to boost and maintain a positive ROI on your ad spend will grow the digital advertising juggernaut to over $38 billion in revenues this year.And that growth is not stealing from Google – it’s simply expanding the pie of revolutionary global reach for tens of thousands of businesses, from the solo entrepreneur to the medium-size industrial, fashion or tech company.Plus, this growth is going to get even harder to understand by this time next year when Facebook unveils its next software and hardware innovations to help consumers find more of what they want from advertisers by using augmented reality (AR) technology to shop, learn, share, and play. Zuck didn’t buy Oculus Rift VR technology for $2 billion just to entertain gamers.And they didn’t hire the former chief engineer of DARPA, Regina Dugan, to create new space age toys for 2 billion monthly active users (MAU). They need to feed the advertising machine to keep Wall Street happy and they know it.Something big is coming from Facebook.

1044,LRCX,"Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) announced that its board of directors has approved a new share repurchase program worth $2 billion.The company also increased its quarterly dividend by 11%. Headquartered in Fremont, CA, Lam has been consistently rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Twin Shareholder-friendly MovesLam, one of the largest global manufacturers of semiconductor equipment, raised its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, reflecting an increase of approximately 11% over the previous payout of 45 cents per share. The new dividend, which has been approved by the company’s board of directors, will be paid to investors on Jan 10, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Dec 6, 2017.We believe the dividend hike not only highlights Lam’s commitment toward creating value for shareholders but also underlines the company’s financial condition and confidence in its business. It is evident from the past records that Lam has a stable dividend payment history.The latest $2 billion share buyback program marks yet another move by Lam to add value to its stockholders. The new share repurchase plan can be executed over the next 12 to 18 months. Repurchases may be made through both public market and private transactions or may include the use of derivative contracts and structured share repurchase agreements.Price PerformanceLam’s shares have outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have rallied 99.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 68.1%.The company’s investor-friendly announcements might further give a lift to the stock.Bottom LineLam has a strong capital management policy in place. The company’s initiatives are well supported by its solid cash flow generation, which in turn is driven by sustained solid operational performance.We are impressed by Lam’s efforts toward enhancing shareholder wealth through dividends and share buybacks. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company returned $73 million to its shareholders through dividends and spent approximately $155.0 million on share repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investment balances were $6.2 billion compared with $6.04 billion in the prior quarter.The regular share buybacks and dividend hikes are a good way of building investor confidence as these return shareholder value. The company expects to post revenues of approximately $2.55 billion (+/- $100 million) in the upcoming quarter. The increase in dividend indicates that the company is heading toward strong growth.Lam Research Corporation Price and Consensus  Lam Research Corporation Price and Consensus | Lam Research Corporation QuoteZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Lam Research has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1045,LRCX,"U.S. stocks managed to arrest a two-day slide on Monday, even managing to close the session with meager gains. Though Monday’s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news, investors will continue to wait for further progress on the new tax policy.However, experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely. Further, the era of low interest rates which had fueled much of the markets’ gains is coming to an end worldwide with central banks rolling back their easy money policies.Given this background, constant warnings about the exorbitant valuations of U.S. stocks may not seem as unrealistic as they did before. Some of these are rather bleak, going so far as to predict a decade long period of losses. However, the uncertainty created by the hurdles to the tax reform process and upcoming rate hikes means that it would make for a smart move to shore up your portfolios with some great value stock picks.Investors Remain Uneasy About Tax Cut ProspectsThe first weekly decline in two months was triggered on Nov 9 by the introduction of the Senate Republicans’ version of a tax cut legislation that entails the deferment of corporate tax cuts for a year. Such a delay raised concerns about President Trump’s ability to pass laws, leading the Dow to snap a seven-session streak of gains which itself was a product of tax cut hopes.Of course, the market does have other catalysts and Monday’s gains came on the back of encouraging deal news. But investors will continue to await further progress on the new tax policy. However, experts believe that the likelihood of such reforms being implemented within this year is extremely unlikely.Further, the version of the legislation introduced by the Senate Republicans is widely different from the one introduced in the House. This is likely to lead to several rounds of negotiations which in turn would raise market volatility. Central Banks Prepare to Wind down StimulusAn end to the monetary stimulus packages which central banks across the world have put in place is another factor which will soon come into play. Markets have been boosted by an extended phase of soft interest rates over several years now and their gradual removal can only reduce the level of impetus they enjoy. While the Fed prepares to raise rates in December, the ECB will begin slashing the level of its bond purchases from this month.One section of market watchers believe that U.S. investors have already come to terms with such a move. But given the events of the past week, a rate hike at this time could make things tougher for stocks. The Fed and the ECB are only likely to tighten monetary conditions further going ahead, which makes it imperative for investors to choose their stocks carefully.U.S. Valuations Already at Record LevelOver the last few months, investors have received several warnings about the pricey nature of U.S. stocks. The latest of these comes from John Hussman who claims that valuations for U.S. stocks have already hit an all-time high. Using his valuation metric of choice, the ratio of market capitalization to gross value added, Grossman claims that stocks are pricier than they were in 2000 and 1929, years which heralded unprecedented market downturns.Hussman believes that overstretched valuations, caused by an almost 300% Bull Run, will lead to a market drop of almost 63%. This would then lead to an entire decade of losses for the bourses. The underlying reason for the crash would be the prevailing belief among investors that only risky assets can provide good returns.Such a feeling has become popular during an extended period of extremely low interest rates, thinks Hussman. While most market watchers would characterize such dire conclusions as a tad extreme, they would be hard put to dismiss them outright, given the events dampening investor sentiment in the recent past.Our ChoicesConcerns about the ability of the Trump administration to push through tax cuts have been weighing on stocks recently. Even though markets have edged up during the last trading session, such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward.Further, central banks across the world are preparing to wind down monetary stimulus measures. Given such a backdrop it makes sense to bet on value stocks to protect your hard earned profits.

1052,LRCX,"While price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first to cross one’s mind while using valuation metrics, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also a convenient valuation metric.The P/B ratio measures how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It determines whether a company's asset value is comparable to the stock’s market price or not and hence can be useful for finding value stocksP/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.Understanding Book ValueBook value is usually denoted on a company's balance sheet as ""stockholder equity.There are several ways by which book value can be defined.  It is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this will equate to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Explaining the P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Magellan Health, Inc.

The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Given that each system is high valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in significant fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.For the fourth quarter, KLA expects shipments of $890–$970 million. Quarterly revenues are expected between $885 million and $945 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.46–$1.66.Bottom LineKLA’s comprehensive product line, cost-reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressure permits. Although competition and a concentrated customer base increase execution risk, accelerated process control spending across foundry, memory and logic players through 2017 and beyond will enable KLA to deliver stronger results. This therefore holds true for the soon-to-be reported quarter.KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  KLA-Tencor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | KLA-Tencor Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks which you may consider instead, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and Zacks Rank #1.

1055,LRCX,"Nielsen Holdings plc (NLSN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 34.88%.Notably, Nielsen surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the last four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 19.47%.The company’s stock has lost 6.03% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 20.93%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayNielsen is an information and measurement company offering media and marketing information on what consumers watch and buy on a global and local basis.The company reported weak first-quarter results, with both the top and the bottom lines missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, revenues increased year over year driven by continued strength in the company’s Watch segment and in emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in the Buy segment.Moreover, Nielsen is partnering with big companies to extend its TV ratings service beyond the Nielsen Local TV Ratings Service. Recently, Nilesen signed a multi-year agreement with Tennis Channel, providing its National TV Ratings service to the latter.  Earlier, it also renewed its agreement with CBS Corporation’s CBS Radio to deliver its local market insights and currency ratings to the broadcast media operator across all the Portable People Meter (PPM) metros.These partnership and agreements will help Nielsen to expand its client base and boost its Watch segment revenues in the upcoming quarter.Also, regular dividend payment and share-repurchase programs reflect Nielsen’s financial strength and commitment to return value to shareholders. The company's new products are doing well and should drive revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, continued investments in technology and infrastructure could weigh on margins and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nielsen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 63 cents. Therefore, Earnings ESP for Nielsen is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nielsen carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Nielsen N.V.

1056,LRCX,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fiscal fourth-quarter  2017 results on Jul 27.The company is unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of +1.99%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderBetter-than-expected demand for storage products led Western Digital to revise its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 outlook. While the company maintained its revenue guidance of around $4.8 billion, the non-GAAP earnings per share forecast was raised from the range of $2.55–$2.65 to $2.85.Notably, the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 13.5%. The revised fourth-quarter guidance also boosted investors’ confidence.We note that the company has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 12.1%, the stock returned 41.1% over the same time frame.We believe Western Digital’s strong presence in the flash memory market has been a positive for the company for a while now. Additionally, its product portfolio is being enhanced regularly with the first portable solid state drive (SSD) unveiled in April. It also increased the capacity of its surveillance-class hard drives to 10 TB.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteMoreover, it also introduced the world’s first Client SSD with 64-Layer 3D NAND technology in May and development of the industry’s first 3D NAND technology 96 layers of storage capability in June. Additionally the SanDisk acquisition has expanded Western Digital’s offerings in the SSD segment and also provided a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).However, the ongoing tussle with Toshiba regarding the flash memory chip joint-venture in Japan is a growing concern.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1057,LRCX,"We expect wafer fabrication equipment provider, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 26.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Lam Research is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.33%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lam Research currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Lam Research’s Zacks Rank # 1 and Earnings ESP of +1.33% makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat.Its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock returned 54.7%.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Results?Lam Research continues to be the market leader in dielectric etches on successful products such as VECTOR Strata, ALTUS deposition, and its Flex and Kiyo etch products.  The company sees strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market driven by its long-term move to the cloud, storage and networking applications.The company has been improving on the WFE market share significantly since 2013 and expects to continue making gains.Lam Research continues to see increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning.

1058,LRCX,"Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG  -  Free Report) reported optimistic second-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth and higher income from continued operations, and also reiterated its full-year 2017 guidance.The Dutch electronics giant reported second-quarter net income from continuing operations of €161 million ($177 million), up 36.4% from the prior-year quarter’s figure of €118 million. Earnings were driven by strong sales growth, lower financial expenses and improved operational performance. The year-earlier figure had been hurt by taxes linked to the company’s efforts to divest the lighting business.The company posted second-quarter 2017 net income of €0.27 (29.7 cents) per share, as against earnings of €0.46 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were hurt due to lower income from discontinued operations, higher restructuring and acquisition-related costs.Investors cheered the solid results, with shares of the company rising 3.8% at one point in pre-market trading following the release.Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price and Consensus  Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price and Consensus | Koninklijke Philips N.V. QuoteInside the HeadlinesTotal revenue in the quarter came in at €4,294 million ($4721.8 million), up 3.9% from the year-ago tally. Top-line improvement came on the back of impressive HealthTech portfolio sales.Philips’ adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) – the company’s preferred measure of operational performance – jumped 14.6% year over year to €439 million ($482.7 million), benefiting from cost-productivity programs and higher volumes.On the other hand, net cash flow generated from operating activities came in at €73 million ($80.3 million) compared with net cash flow of €177 million witnessed in the prior-year quarter.The company’s comparable order intake rose 8% year over year, driven by strong growth in Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.Segmental RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Personal Health sales rose 6% year over year to €1,761 million ($1,936.4 million). This segment recorded a 6% hike in comparable sales. Double-digit growth in Health & Wellness, high-single-digit growth in Personal Care and mid-single-digit growth in Sleep & Respiratory Care drove this segment’s top line.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter to €1,671 million ($1,837.5 million). Comparable sales grew 3% for the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Ultrasound and Image-Guided Therapy proved conducive to growth.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues were almost flat year over year at €768 million ($844.5 million). On a comparable basis, sales inched up 1%. Sales improvement came mainly on the back of low-single-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.However, sales decline in Healthcare Informatics, Solutions & Services proved to be a drag for the segment.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to be weak and fell 8.6% year over year to €92 million ($101.2 million). Lower royalty income due to foreseen expiration of licenses marred the sales of this segment.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Liquidity & Share RepurchaseExiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2017, Philips’ cash and cash equivalents rose to €2,220 million ($2,535.8 million) from €1,926 million a year back. The company’s long-term debt fell to €2,599 million ($2,968.8 million) compared with €5,269 million a year ago.During fourth-quarter 2016, the company completed its three-year EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program. Philips will launch a share buyback program for €15 billion in third-quarter 2017, to be executed over a span of two years.Diligent Cost-Savings ProgramsPhilips has been strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change-initiative programs – namely Accelerate, End2End productivity, and Design for Excellence – implemented earlier. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, and accelerate growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in 2016, the company achieved €269 million of gross savings in overhead costs, €418 million of gross savings in procurement and €204 million of productivity savings from the End2End program. In second-quarter 2017, cost savings on overhead and procurement led to a remarkable increase in margins, saving about €109 million.The company now aims to enhance its performance further and targets to deliver 4–6% comparable sales growth, and adjusted EBITA margin expansion of around 100 basis points per year.AcquisitionsThe quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips signed an agreement to acquire Spectranetics to strengthen its Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. Spectranetics is a provider of vascular intervention and lead management solutions. Philips also acquired CardioProlific, a US-based company that develops catheter-based thrombectomy technology for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Both these acquisitions will complement Philips’ portfolio of image-guided therapy devices.Philips also inked an agreement to buy U.S.-based medical device company, Electrical Geodesics, Inc. This acquisition will likely enhance the former’s imaging technologies and advanced informatics portfolio, used in neurological applications.The company penned an agreement to buy Respiratory Technologies, which provides an innovative airway clearance solution for patients with chronic respiratory conditions.Furthermore, subsequent to the quarter, Philips acquired image-analysis software provider TomTec Imaging Systems. TomTec specializes in diagnostic ultrasound that helps healthcare personnel to increase efficiency and diagnostic quality. Along with CardioProlific and Spectranetics, TomTec will likely be conducive to Philips’ image-guided therapy portfolio as well.Earlier this month, Philips also acquired the UK-based Health & Parenting, a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents, in order to strengthen its Personal Health businesses.Update on Lighting DealPhilips had successfully offloaded a major stake in its lighting business – Lumileds – as it inked an agreement to sell an 80.1% stake in Lumileds to NY-based private-equity firm, Apollo Global Management LLC in early February this year. This fresh deal, which values the whole unit at $2 billion, closed in second-quarter 2017. Also, Philips sold 22.25 million shares of Philips Lighting.As a result of these transactions, its shareholding in Philips Lighting has decreased to 41.2%. Hence, the company is reporting Philips Lighting as part of Discontinued Operations.OutlookPhilips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4–6% and anticipates gaining momentum in the second half of the year, boosted by a strong order book.While the company expects an uncertain climate in the U.S. and continued volatility in its markets, Philips is enjoying robust orders in China and India, as well as Europe.Our TakePhilips’ second-quarter results were quite consistent, with growth in both top- and bottom-line performance. The company’s cost-saving programs have been producing tangible results, thus supplementing its strength. It further believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long-term growth driver, even in the face of continued volatility in the markets in which the company operates.Philips is presently focusing on key opportunities in population health management, while improving its enterprise-wide solutions for health systems and collaborating with health care organizations, to fortify the company’s foothold in the healthcare industry. Its numerous acquisitions should also prove accretive to its top line in the quarters ahead, and help strengthen its foothold in the end markets.Moreover, offloading of the lighting business is a major positive and will likely help this company allocate its resources in core business areas to stoke growth, moving ahead.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPhilips presently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report).

1062,LRCX,"On August 10, I made a video to share with the public about a circle of stocks I owned in my Zacks portfolios that I felt were all in a race to $200…The $200 Club: Will Facebook Beat Alibaba There First?Here were their approximate closing prices on that day (rounded up to nearest dollar)…Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report): $152Facebook (FB  -  Free Report): $168Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): $150Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report): $172In the video that accompanies this article, I show fresh charts two months later of the ups and downs since that day.Clearly, most of these “high-flyers” were still great buys in August.

1063,LRCX,"Do you play or watch poker? Even if you don’t, you will not regret learning how to apply poker wisdom to investing in stocks.You can start with the video attached to this article or, for a quick and focused dive, check out this bit of applied wisdom I shared with my TAZR Trader members this week in a portfolio where we've successfully ""gamed"" the market and rode several stocks to new highs -- while all around us many expert players have said ""You can't buy that! It's too expensive!""When You Get the Best of It, Make the Most of ItThat's actually a quote by ""mathematics of gambling"" expert Mason Malmuth, in a book of his I read many years ago titled Gambling Theory and Other Topics.If you are familiar with the probability and statistics applications of poker to investing, you already know what Malmuth is talking about.The randomness and viciousness of poker demands that you ruthlessly apply optimally-rational probability-based thinking to your decisions -- in addition to deep and active psychoanalysis of your opponents.Some players are masters of poker-hand probability analysis and want very little opponent interaction, body language/facial “reading” or social gamesmanship.These are the players who wear sunglasses and try to avoid most interaction at the table.Then there are the true ""behavioral scientists"" like Daniel Negreanu. Since behavioral finance/economics are a pet project of mine -- and I started my Mind Over Money podcast this year in dedication to those fascinating arenas -- I am vastly interested in all related topics and Negreanu is an unparalleled practitioner of applied behavioral science.He is so secure with his probability-weighted strategies for any given hand that he can spend the majority of his time and attention at the table analyzing, dissecting and “gaming” player behavior and interactions -- which is where the real difference and edge is found in games with a high ""randomness component.""This focus and meta-awareness of the table, the deck, and the players gives him an uncanny ability to determine what cards his opponents are likely holding. It may begin with a hunch or guess, but as he verbalizes, jokes and sometimes taunts other players he can nearly always confirm his suspicions with an amazing degree of accuracy.If you want to learn how to play poker, better or at all, watch or read Negreanu.Now, what does this have to do with investing in or trading stocks?#1: Know Your Probability Scenarios#2: Play Your Opponents for Both their Strengths & WeaknessesFor us, this comes down to (1) Knowing our risk/reward in every trade and then (2) Gaming the institutional demand we expect at different price levels.Short-term technical traders who use price charts and indicators, including volume, live and die by this analysis.What I do with my short-to-medium term portfolio, where I may hold fundamentally-strong stocks through several quarterly earnings reports, is like a bigger version of the short-term technical analysis game, but with the added fundamental and behavioral components.Cautious Players Who Get It Wrong, Curious Ones Who Get It RightWhile big name fund managers like Ray Dalio of Bridgewater or Howard Marks, of value/distressed investment firm Oaktree Capital, come out waving red flags, we have to be able to discern if they are being overly conservative, once again, and missing the next leg of a big global economic cycle that could last for another 2 years.Other successful “players” at the table like David Tepper of Appaloosa, Dan Loeb of Third Point, Steve Mandel of Lone Pine, Lee Ainslee of Maverick Capital, and Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global are not wringing their hands about global macro worries. They are still “heads down, picking stocks” for the long-run of 2 to 5 years. Like Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report).And it’s important to keep the history of this “table” in perspective too. There have been numerous high-profile calls for a market melt-down in the past 2 years. Jeff Gundlach and the perma-bear Albert Edwards from SocGen also come to mind.But in all their macro analysis, they miss the simplest of factors: technological innovation + investment liquidity ($66 trillion tied to global equity markets) + stable economic growth and liquidity (favorable interest rates) = equities as the premier growth investment over many years of a long cycle.Overcomplicating this equation only leads to missing great and lengthy rallies.This has happened several times in my career trading growth stocks. And it is why I think we should still be buying growth stocks on the dips in this bull market to S&P 3,000.Because I have little reason to believe this time will be different.But if you want to dissect the behavior of one player who is convinced something is wrong and he’s throwing in the towel, check out the video that accompanies this article where I share the news this month of a fund manager who called it quits, citing how “wrong” and ""almost impossible"" the stock market is.Why You Still Buy Alibaba for $200 and BeyondI also share more insight on why I remain an investor in Alibaba shares at these levels. It seems every week Jack Ma and company reveal another market initiative that is sure to capture new and expanded sources of revenue in China and globally as they continue their dominant growth in multiple business segments.And in the video, I also show you which fund managers were still buying or starting new positions in Alibaba in the second quarter.Finally, I review what's going on with my ""$200 Club"" where I mistakenly sold Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) on Monday and added NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) today. Thankfully, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report) have not been removed.Disclosure: I own BABA, NVDA, ALGN, and FB shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.CookerKevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service. 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1064,LRCX,"Much has been happening with ViaSat Inc.  in recent times. The company recently launched the ViaSat-2 satellite, which has immense prospects. Just a couple of days ago, ViaSat released disappointing earnings numbers for first-quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s shares too have trended badly, having fallen 19.1% over the past one year, much worse than the industry’s average decline of 2.9%. Escalating research and development costs, and costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities badly affected profits. However, fundamentals of the business look quite strong. New contract awards for the company (up 31.4% to $441.8 million) grew sharply in the fiscal first quarter, driving impressive backlog, and highlighting strong demand for both products and services.ViaSat’s Government Systems business has been outstanding, and has been gaining even greater momentum, which should reflect well on the quarters to come.The segment reported impressive revenue growth of 25.8% year over year in the fiscal first quarter, driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical datalink products, government mobility platforms and satellite communications solutions. Splendid growth in revenues drove record operating profit (up 82% year over year) and Adjusted EBITDA (up 51% year over year) for the quarter.In-flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum. ViaSat is already connecting nearly 3 million devices a month on its existing fleet of 568 aircraft. The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. ViaSat-2 services are expected to begin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.ViaSat, Inc. Price and Consensus ViaSat, Inc. Price and Consensus | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteThe company successfully rolled out ViaSat-2 satellite in June. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1.Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. ViaSat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.Lately, ViaSat’s earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R&D expenses, but per the company, total R&D investments are set to peak this fiscal year. The primary drivers are the ViaSat-3 payload, pre-flight development and testing, and commercial in-flight connectivity, STCs and line-fit activity. This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters. Also, the costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities and preparations for the large-scale in-flight Wi-Fi ramp are expected to further burden the bottom line.Also, stiff competition in the industry proves to be a major growth deterrent for the company, particularly for its satellite services segment. The business is also highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods.Strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. In addition, the just-launched ViaSat-2 satellite is likely to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets.Overall, while we acknowledge that ViaSat has a robust foothold in numerous markets and is enjoying strong growth momentum, we feel its earnings are set up for more pressure in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (AEIS  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report). While Lam Research and Advanced Energy Industries sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Applied Materials carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1065,LRCX,"Shares of GoDaddy Inc. (GDDY  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $45.26 on Aug 9, before closing a tad lower at $44.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in recent times, appreciating over 33.4% over the last one year, ahead of the industry’s gain of roughly 12.8%. Notably, the company has witnessed an 3.7% jump in share price since it posted encouraging second-quarter 2017 results. Let’s find out what’s supporting the rally.Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates, Rise Y/YThe company reported strong second-quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Non-GAAP earnings of 13 cents per share were up significantly from a penny in the prior quarter and a loss of 11 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.

It now expects revenues in the range of $2.215 to $2.225 billion compared with its earlier guidance of $2.195–$2.225 billion. The new guidance represents year-over-year growth of approximately 20%.Strong Product and Marketing Roadmap for 2017GoDaddy’s strong product and marketing roadmap for 2017 is a big positive. The company’s new mobile-optimized website builder, GoCentral, has been gaining momentum. The company intends to release additional new GoCentral verticals, markets and features throughout 2017. During the quarter, the company also witnessed a 17.8% increase in its customer base from the year-ago quarter.Host Europe BuyoutIn April, GoDaddy completed the acquisition of Host Europe Group for €1.69 billion (US$1.79 billion) and the integration remains well on track. The deal expands GoDaddy's presence in international markets. It also complements GoDaddy's business as HEG has a similar customer base comprising small ventures and web professionals.Going ForwardInvestment in products, its technology platform, international expansion and customer care as well as delivering innovative and increasingly personalized products and services globally should drive shareholder value.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderGoDaddy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Luxoft Holding (LXFT  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1066,LRCX,"Share price of Model N, Inc. (MODN  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $13.70, eventually closing a tad lower at $13.10 on Aug 9, shortly after the company reported its third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Notably, Model N stock has rallied 48% year to date, substantially outperforming the 17.3% gain of the industry it belongs to. The stock price momentum reflects the company’s expanding product portfolio, growing customer base and accretive Revitas acquisition.We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four quarters and matched it once, delivering an average positive surprise of 11.32%. However, the company’s revenues missed estimates twice in the trailing four quarters.Model N, Inc. Price and Consensus Model N, Inc. Price and Consensus | Model N, Inc. QuoteIn the third quarter, including stock-based compensation, the company incurred loss of 23 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents. Adjusted loss of 14 cents per share was narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 16 cents. However, revenues of $34.2 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35 million, but increased 22.7% year over year.Model N expects fourth-quarter GAAP revenues to come in the range of $34.6-$35.1 million. For fiscal 2017, GAAP revenues, after deferred revenue adjustment, are expected to be in the range of $130.2-130.7 million. Management continues to expect annualized recurring revenue (ARR) to be between $46 million to $48 million. This represents 31% to 36% year-over-year growth.Currently, Model N carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has a market capital of $377.3 million and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%.Strong Fundamentals Drive MomentumModel N’s cloud-based revenue management solutions are well suited to replace the increasingly ineffective legacy systems at companies that are finding it difficult to keep pace with the current industry trends. Its revenue management platform thus continues to attract prominent names from the life sciences and high tech field. The manufacturing and financial services markets also hold tremendous growth potential for the company.Post the Revitas acquisition, the company has been able to expand its product portfolio and customer base. Persistent deal wins from existing and new customers is a key growth factor for Model N.Recently, Ampleon, a radio frequency (RF) power provider, selected Model N’s revenue cloud services. A significant number of systems at companies like Smith & Nephew, Edwards Lifesciences, J&J Japan, Stryker and Shire also became operational in the quarter, ICU Medical; a Medtech company was added to its customer base during the quarter. A high-tech company called Diodes also adopted Model N’s revenue cloud model in the third quarter.However, lack of international customers, mounting operating loss, continuing cash burn and stretched valuation are major headwinds.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Alibaba Group Holding (BABA  -  Free Report), Luxoft Holding (LXFT  -  Free Report) and Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth rate for Alibaba, Luxoft Holding and Lam Research is projected to be 28.97%, 20% and 17.2%, respectively.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1067,LRCX,"Given the rally in stocks this year, value analysis is the best approach to identify great bargains. Though price to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also a fairly handy tool for identifying high-growth companies selling at low prices.The price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is the ratio of market price of a stock over the book value of its equity. P/B ratio is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.Understanding Book ValueThere are several ways by which book value can be defined. Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.What About P/B Ratio?By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five stocks that qualified the screening:Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is a leading global provider of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

1071,LRCX,"eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) will report  second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 20 after the bell.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that makes surprise prediction difficult. This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | eBay Inc. QuoteWe don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement.eBay’s surprise history has been decent as the company beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and matched estimates on one occasion.Over the last one year, however, the stock has underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. It gained roughly 40% compared with the industry’s gain of 51.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcementRecap of the First Quarter PerformanceeBay’s first-quarter earnings and revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were up 3.7% year over year.Revenue growth was driven by strength in international markets, growth of active buyers, integration of the Ticketbis acquisition, expansion of new user experience and brand advertising. eBay added 2 million active buyers in the first quarter taking the total to 169 million.What We Are Watching?eBay is currently replatforming itself and sees significant progress on this front. The company accelerated its efforts by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse inspired shopping journeys, rejuvenating customer-to-customer (C2C) business and strengthening its brand.Apart from structured data and enhancing mobile experience, application of artificial intelligence, increased use of social media to drive traffic, category merchandising, and an easier listing process are  positives. The company’s recent deal with Flipkart is expected to increase penetration in India.However, concerns remain in the form of increasing competition in the e-commerce and hardline retail market from companies like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart and deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally.eBay’s increased investment toward overall platform technology and slower growth rate compared to its peers are also overhangs. Furthermore, eBay’s growth continues to suffer due to a weak world economy. The company is heavily dependent on countries outside the U.S for its transaction and Internet sales. Although the U.S. is flourishing, emerging economies are slowing down.Summing UpeBay’s unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over its competitors. We remain positive about eBay’s replatforming and brand enhancement initiatives, the pace of building a solid foundation of structured data and artificial intelligence, increasing personalizing capacities and improving mobile experience. However expected results may take some time to show up due to weak global economy, slow e-commerce growth and increasing competition.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and Zacks Rank #1.

1072,LRCX,"A number of factors influence investment decisions, particularly when it comes to choosing stocks. While investors with a high-risk appetite looking for higher returns seek sophisticated and complex strategies, those with a low-risk appetite prefer conventional investment strategies based on solid fundamentals.Conventional strategies can be banked upon in bearish markets as well. We have picked one such strategy that is focused on the sales growth of a company.Sales Growth – A Key Financial IndicatorIn the current market scenario, characterized by changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, continued sales growth is crucial for the survival of any business. Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to boost sales.Sales are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. It’s worth keeping in mind that in cases where companies incur a loss, albeit temporarily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company’s future earnings performance. Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be a suitable metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio. Sales growth alone, however, cannot ensure success. Consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more reliable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) operates as a play and entertainment company. This Pawtucket, RI-based company currently has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 11.7% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), based in Fort Worth, TX, operates as a network air carrier. It has long-term expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 2.8%. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Atlanta, GA, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) operates regulated exchanges, clearing houses, and listings venues for financial and commodity markets.

This Fremont, CA-based company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 16.4% and a Zacks Rank #1.Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) operates as a medical technology company.

1073,LRCX,"Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20. Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.40%.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.80%. Earnings (adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals and currency effect) of 73 cents per share increased 15% year over year but declined 12% on a sequential basis.Revenues (adjusted for Windows 10 deferrals) of $23.56 billion decreased 9.6% sequentially but increased 6.3% from the year-ago quarter (up 7% in constant currency or CC). Further, it exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.55 billion.Notably, Azure revenues soared 94% at CC on a year-over-year basis. Microsoft noted that Azure premium revenues grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using the premium services. Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Microsoft Corporation QuoteAzure’s strong performance has also helped the company to outperform the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. The stock returned 17.1%, while the index gained 10%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWe believe that Azure’s performance will be the key catalyst in the to-be reported quarter. Microsoft anticipates commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth, on the back of expanding installed base, growing consumption and higher number of renewals.Management forecasts commercial unearned revenues of $26.8–$27 billion, in line with historical seasonality. We note that acquisitions like Deis have aided in expanding Azure’s features that will continue to improve installed base going forward.However, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to dominate the cloud computing market trailed by Azure. We believe that increasing competition from the likes of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), IBM, salesforce.com and Oracle toughens growth opportunities for Azure, which can hurt results.Apart from Azure, increasing adoption of Windows 10 and Office 365 are growth factors. Gartner in its latest report projects IT spending to increase 2.4% over 2016 to $3.48 trillion in 2017. The figure is much better than earlier projection of 1.4% growth. Improving spending on enterprise software is major positive for Windows, Office 365 and related applications.Meanwhile, declining PC shipments in the second quarter – as per data available from both Gartner and IDC – is a concern for the company. Both market research firms agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, is escalating PC prices, in turn thwarting the overall demand.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Microsoft will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 71 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderYou can consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:IPG Photonics (IPGP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #1. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1074,LRCX,"Brightcove Inc. (BCOV  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 44.44%. Moreover, it has delivered negative earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 81.94%.Furthermore, we note that shares of Brightcove have fallen 31.1% in the last one year, substantially underperforming the industry‘s growth of 38.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderBrightcove is a well-known provider of cloud solutions for delivering and monetizing video across connected devices. The company exhibited strong year-over-year bookings performance in the last reported quarter, despite a significant decrease in its revenue retention rate, primarily among media customers. Back then, the company had stated that it expects this to be a headwind over the next few quarters.However, we are optimistic that its robust product portfolio and new product enhancements will drive bookings momentum, going forward.Notably in April, the company launched Brightcove Live – an API-driven scalable, cost-effective solution to deliver and monetize live broadcasts, events and 24/7 channels. In May, it unveiled a broad set of innovative technologies, including Context Aware Encoding and Dynamic Delivery. Management believes these newly introduced features will continue to garner more customer interest and value for media customers, while purpose-built solutions like Social, Audience and Gallery will cater to the needs of enterprises and digital marketers.We also note that last month, TV Tokyo, one of Japan’s leading broadcast networks, selected Brightcove Live for live stream of the Liebherr 2017 World Table Tennis Championships.For the second quarter, the company expects revenue of $37–$37.8 million, with non-GAAP loss from operations anticipated to be in the range of $4.2–$5 million.

1075,LRCX,"Netgear, Inc. (NTGR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.77%. Additionally, it has an average positive earnings surprise of 12.72% in the trailing four quarters.However, we note that shares of networking equipment maker Netgear have decreased 9.7% in the last year, underperforming the industry‘s advance of 4.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNetgear designs technologically advanced, branded networking products that address the specific needs of small businesses and home users. We expect the company’s strong product portfolio, comprising offerings like its Nighthawk WiFi routers and Arlo home security products, to boost the top line.In particular, we are positive about the company‘s launch of the Arlo Baby Smart HD Monitoring Camera (ABC1000), in Jan 2017. Netgear’s Arlo segment revenues jumped 150% year over year, driven by Arlo Pro in first-quarter 2017.We believe that Netgear’s strength of Arlo and Orbi sales in the retail channel will primarily drive results. Region-wise, North America continues to contribute the lion’s share (65% of 1Q17 net revenue).However, the service provider business continues to pose challenges with the company streamlining the segment. In the first quarter, the company reported a $28.3 million year-over-year decline in sales to service providers.For the second quarter, the company expects net revenue of $315–$330 million, with GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 5.3–6.3% and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 8–9%.NETGEAR, Inc.

Shares also touched a 52-week high of $42.10 during yesterday’s trading session.The share price momentum can be attributed to the company’s strategic initiatives andexpanding product portfolio.Moreover, the recent announcement of the company’s proposed reincorporation from Delaware to Nevada where it is currently doing business is a positive in our view.

The year-over-year growth in Gaming Systems revenues was driven by an increase in software and hardware sales, including shipment of new iVIEW4 player-interface display units.The company’s iVIEW4 technology, backed by sophisticated and advanced features, is witnessing strong adoption. Earlier this month, the company was awarded a contract by Temecula, CA-based Pechanga Resort & Casino to provide 4,200 new iVIEW4 on-device player-interface controllers.The company also announced that itis has been chosen by Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino for providing a suite of products for casino management as well as for its online and mobile platforms.Further, the company’s Gamescape, Pro Wave, and TwinStar cabinets along with J43 and three-reel mechanical cabinets have also been instrumental in boosting its gaming segment.Additionally, Scientific Games announced the launch of its new slot game named Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy last month.

1077,LRCX,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the technology sector and a rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run. Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.The company has performed extremely well so far this year and has the potential to carry on the momentum in the near term.Why an Attractive Pick?Share Price Appreciation: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date. Micron returned a whopping 61.6%, which compared favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 11.7%.Solid Rank & VGM Score: Micron currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Northward Estimate Revisions: Four estimates for the current year moved north over the past 60 days versus no southward revisions, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year increased 1.3%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus Micron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus | Micron Technology, Inc. QuotePositive Earnings Surprise History: Micron has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 23.1%.Strong Growth Prospects: The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings of $4.62 reflects year-over-year growth of 7,602.2%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 32.2% growth in 2018. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10%.Growth Drivers: Micron offers both DRAM and NAND products. While DRAM chips are key components in PCs, NAND flash chips are crucial for portable electronic devices.Improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips make us confident about Micron’s growth. Per various sources, the prices for these specific chips have improved primarily due to a better product mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.Mergers and acquisitions are actively expanding Micron's core business. Notably, the company acquired the remaining stake in Inotera in December and made the brand a wholly owned subsidiary in Taiwan.It is worth mentioning that Inotera will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.Going forward, the acquisitions of Elpida and Rexchip (now known as Micron Memory Japan, Inc. and Micron Memory Taiwan Co., Ltd., respectively) will increase Micron’s traction in the memory market.Micron is positive about the product launches and growing demand, particularly that of SSD products. We also believe that any increase in prices will have a favorable impact on the company’s overall results. We anticipate these benefits to be a tailwind for the company, going forward.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Activision Blizzard, Inc.

1078,LRCX,"Applied Materials’ (AMAT  -  Free Report) price target was recently increased by more than 14% to $55 from $48 by RBC Capital’s analyst Amit Daryanani. The analyst also raised its rating from Sector Perform to Outperform.Following the news, Applied Materials’ shares inched up 1.93% in response, eventually closing at $48.05. Additionally, the share price hit a new 52-week high of $48.53 on Sep 18, eventually closing at $48.05.Also, shares of Applied Materials have been steadily treading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock returned 48.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 46.6%.Why the Hike?Analysts at RBC Capital remain optimistic about Applied Materials’ market dominance in the semiconductor space.There have been significant developments in emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality, augmented reality, big data, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. These areas have the potential to significantly increase semiconductor spending and drive the advances in silicon technology in the future.These new technologies will be key sources of growth for Applied going ahead.Given this material shift in capital intensity due to increasing demand in these areas, the analyst believes that capital equipment spending has become less cyclical and the current wafer fab equipment (WFE) growth will continue in the near future, benefiting Applied Materials.Notably, the company has tasted considerable success in expanding beyond semiconductors, particularly in display. New display technologies like OLED and large format TVs are opening new market opportunities for Applied Materials. With about 34% of revenue coming from display and services, Daryanani expects Applied Materials to remain in a better position to deal with WFE cyclicality compared with its peers.Also, Daryanani expects the company earnings per share to increase to more than $4.00 per share by fiscal year 2020. He believes that modest WFE growth, margin expansion, display tailwinds, expansion in China and buybacks, among others, will drive earnings in the years to come.With its sustained focus on growth areas, sound fundamentals, margin expansion and strength within the semiconductor space, Daryanani remain positive about the company’s overall success in the future.To add to it, the analyst expects Applied Materials’ Analyst Day, which is to be held on Sep 27, to be a positive event.Applied Materials, Inc. Price and Consensus  Applied Materials, Inc. Price and Consensus | Applied Materials, Inc. QuoteConclusionApplied Materials is one of the world’s largest suppliers of fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD and solar PV cell manufacturers.

1082,LRCX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Lam Research Tops Q4 Earnings & Revenue EstimatesLam Research reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings of $3.11 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02. Earnings increased 11.1% sequentially and 72.8% year over year. Revenues Revenues of $2.34 billion increased 8.9% sequentially and 51.7% year over year. Also, revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31 billion. Revenues by Geography Region wise, Korea contributed 38%, Japan accounted for 17% and Taiwan and China contributed 16% each of fourth-quarter revenues. The U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia generated 9%, 3% and 1%, respectively. Shipments Total system shipments were $2.54 billion during the reported quarter, up 5% from $2.41 billion reported last quarter. Margins Non-GAAP gross profit was $1,090.2 million or 46.5% of revenues, reflecting an increase of 40 bps sequentially. Total adjusted operating expenses were $440.1 million, reflecting an increase of 6.3% sequentially. Operating margin was 27.7%, reflecting an increase of 80 bps from the prior quarter. Net Income GAAP net income was $526.4 million compared with $574.7 million in the last quarter and $258.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $565.5 million compared with $507.8 million in the last quarter. Balance Sheet Exiting fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investment balances were $6.04 billion compared with $5.9 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017. Cash flow from operating activities was $729.2 million against $422.7 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditures amounted to $34.8 million. The company paid $73.7 million in cash dividends to stockholders during the Jun 2017 quarter. Guidance Lam Research provided guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, the company expects revenues of approximately $2.45 billion (+/- $100 million). Shipments are projected to be roughly $2.35 billion (+/- $100 million). Gross margin is predicted at around 46.5% (+/-1%), while operating margin is likely to be about 28% (+/-1%). Earnings per share are projected at $3.25 (+/- 12 cents) on a share count of nearly 183 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.76 per share, which makes guidance better than expected. GAAP earnings per share are projected at $2.98 (+/- 12 cents). Our Take Lam Research delivered strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results with both earnings and revenues outperforming our estimates. The company is doing well and continues to see strong success in the areas of device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections. The company has been improving on the WFE market share significantly since 2013 and expects to continue making gains. Lam Research continues to see increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has taken cost-reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies. The company is likely to remain the market leader in dielectric etches as VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition, and its Flex and Kiyo etch products have been extremely successful. It anticipates continued strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market courtesy of the long-term move to the cloud, storage and networking applications. Moreover, Lam Research is making good progress with its customer support business and anti-trust agency reviews. However, concerns persist in the form of volatility and lower growth expectations globally, with slow-but-steady improvement in some developed markets balancing the weakness in certain emerging economies.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter.Lam Research Corporation Price and Consensus  Lam Research Corporation Price and Consensus | Lam Research Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. It comes with little surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We are expecting an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

1083,LRCX,"Here at Zacks, we utilize a system that emphasizes earnings estimates and earnings estimate revisions to find high quality stocks that are poised to outperform the market over the next one to three months. From 1988 through 2016, our proven Zacks Rank system more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. Nevertheless, like any stock-rating method, it has its uncertainties. Because it is a short-term system, and because earnings estimate revisions can happen erratically, there’s really no telling how long a stock will last on our Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list. This makes it even more impressive when a stock finds a home on our #1 list and is able to consistently provide impressive returns for months. We’ve operated in a strong bull market for some time now, and despite a few recent periods of volatility, the stock market at large remains near its all-time highs. However, some stocks have been able to stick out from the rest, including several that have remained a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for an impressive amount of time. Check out three of these particularly successful Strong Buy stocks below: 1. Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) Lam Research is a manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The stock was given a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on April 21, making it the longest-reigning company on the list right now. Since then, LRCX has gained a whopping 16.1%, outpacing the S&P 500’s modest 4.2% gain over that same time. Lam Research is also currently sporting an “A” grade in the VGM category of our Style Scores system, which truly underscores its overall strength. 2. CAI International (CAI  -  Free Report) Shipping container leaser CAI International has been on fire all year, and when it was added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on April 22, the stock had already gained 115% in 2017. Nevertheless, CAI has soared an additional 60% since being added to the list, and it has showed very little signs of stopping. Just today, the stock once again touched a new all-time high. Interestingly enough, CAI is also sporting an “A” grade for Value, meaning that it could still be a solid pick for value-minded investors. 3. Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY  -  Free Report) Ryanair was assigned a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on May 17. On that day, shares of the value airliner closed at $99.93. Roughly three and a half months later, Ryanair is trading at $114.15 per share, which represents a gain of 14.2%—well beyond the S&P 500’s gain of just 3.8%. This airline stock is also displaying impressive growth prospects, including projected EPS growth of 35% and estimated sales growth of 13% for the current fiscal year, which have helped it gain an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1084,LRCX,"Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google is rolling out its free Wi-Fi program Google Station in Indonesia as part of which public places like railway stations and universities will have free connectivity.The program will be initially launched in a few cities and expanded going ahead. Google is working with internet service providers (ISPs), system integrators and venue owners on this endeavor.We observe that Alphabet stock has gained 16.7% over the past year, outperforming the 13.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Replicating the Success in IndiaGoogle launched this program in India in January 2016, partnering with Indian Railways’ Internet services arm RailTel to provide public Wi-Fi service at the Mumbai Central station. In September, Google expanded the project to other public places including malls, cafes, universities, stations and hangout spots.The company claims that the service is currently active in more than 150 stations and plans to extend it to 400. With the new move, it seems that Google is trying to repeat the success of this program in Indonesia.Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM) Alphabet Inc. PE Ratio (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. QuoteOpportunities in IndonesiaAccording to eMarketer, Indonesia currently has about 100.8 million internet users, the highest among Southeast Asian countries. The figure is expected to reach 137.2 million by 2021.However high-speed internet connectivity is lacking in the nation. Per a data from Akamai, Indonesia had just 7.2 megabits per second (Mbps) of average data connection speed in the first quarter of 2017.Furthermore, mobile users of the country prefer connecting to Wi-Fi rather than internet from mobile service providers to save usage fees. Per a JakPat survey from February 2017, more than 50% of mobile internet users in the country connected to Wi-Fi on a daily basis.Furthermore, according to a report by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Google, the internet economy of Southeast Asia is expected to surge to a massive $200 billion by 2025.These trends offer ample opportunities for Google to tap the growing number of data conscious and budget friendly internet users in Indonesia and lure them to its high-speed services.The company is also launching the YouTube Go app in the country that will allow users save videos and watch or share them offline.Our TakeWe believe that with this move, Google is looking to strengthen its global foothold as well as boost ad revenues. The company’s ability to innovate has translated into strong growth as it continues to adapt to changing market trends.It seems that it has all resources and technology to create successful ventures in Asia. The company is banking on its huge cash balance and technological prowess to pursue growth in any market that exhibits true potential.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Furthermore, although the top line witnessed a marginal fall, the bottom line improved significantly on a year-over-year basis.For the second quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (excluding amortization, impairment and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 8 cents, which came much above the estimate of a penny. Moreover, it marked tremendous eight-fold jump from a penny reported in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, the company reported loss of 11 cents per share compared with a loss of 36 cents per share witnessed in the year-ago quarter. On non-GAAP basis too, the company marked significant year-over-year improvement with earnings per share increasing to 17 cents from 12 cents posted in second-quarter 2016. The year-over-year improvement in bottom-line results came mainly due to the company’s consistent focus on reducing operating expenses, which were partially offset by lower revenues.Shares of Stratasys were seen volatile following the earnings release, moving up to $22.29 and down to $21.67, before settling at $22.14. Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period.

The decrease was primarily due to lower research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses.The company posted non-GAAP operating income of $11.1 million in the reported quarter compared with $10.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Stratasys, Ltd.

1087,LRCX,"The share price of Synaptics Inc. (SYNA  -  Free Report) dropped to a new 52-week low of $42.50, eventually closing a tad bit higher at $42.58 on Aug 8.The underperformance can be attributed to growing headwinds related to sluggish demand in China. Notably, management had lowered fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 guidance following the announcement of the acquisitions of Conexant Systems and Multimedia Solutions business of Marvell Technology Group in mid-June.We note that these headwinds have pulled down current year earnings estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 declined 0.65% to $3.02 over the last 30 days, as both the analysts covering the stock revised their estimates downward.We note that since its first-quarter results (announced on Aug 3), the stock has plunged a massive 21.2%. Shares of Synaptics have lost 20.5% of its value year to date against 26.9% growth of its industry.Key FactorsSynaptics reported adjusted fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 85 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents.Revenues were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $427 million. However, there was a sequential decline of 4%. The decline in revenues can primarily be attributed to a 6% decrease in mobile revenues sequentially. The decline in mobile revenues was mostly because of continued weakness in the China mobile market.Synaptics Incorporated Revenue (TTM) Synaptics Incorporated Revenue (TTM) | Synaptics Incorporated QuoteMoreover, non-GAAP gross margin of 32.6% for the fourth-quarter was below the guided range. Management stated that overall product mix and ramping up of a particular product played massive roles for the lower than expected margins.. Lastly, non-GAAP net income of $173.9 million for fiscal 2017 was down 4% from $180.5 million last fiscal year.Also, competition from Atmel, Elan Microelectronics, Focaltech Systems, Goodix remains a concern for the company.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Synaptics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Alibaba Group (BABA  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1088,LRCX,"For the Global Week Ahead, I found three broad themes that heavily impact U.S. and global stocks.Reuters identified these — and all are worth sharing again.August Angst: With the Dow Jones Industrial Average touching 22,000 in the past week, some investors and traders are bracing for a rocky second half of 2017.The August through October time frame is the only three-month period to have a negative average return going back to 1928, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.Some U.S. stock market internal measures are showing signs of rally fatigue, as the number of new stocks striking 52-week lows on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has risen for seven straight days while the number marking fresh highs has declined in five of the past seven sessions.Weak U.S. Dollar, Strong Global Stocks: An 8-percent fall since May in the greenback against a basket of other currencies has coincided with ever more record highs in MSCI's All-Country World stocks index.While the fall in the dollar index happened alongside a reduction in expectations of more Fed rate hikes, many analysts say the dollar weakness does not reflect concerns over the U.S. economy or over the uncertainty emanating from President Donald Trump's White House.Instead, it reflects the relatively loose monetary conditions and confidence to invest in higher-yielding assets that could see the ""risk-on"" stocks rally maintained for a while yet.Tech Sector Drive: The Tech sector is seen to be a beneficiary of low rates, global growth and disruption underway across industries from retail to banking.This has ensured that tech stocks are the best performers by some distance across each of the world's major market regions and the gap with sectors such as energy is particularly wide.Inflows this year into tech stocks globally are running second only to the rush into EM debt, according to data from EPFR and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Slowing inflows into the sector over the past week, as BofA-ML points out, could be the first signs that investors are keen on banking some profits.It is August. This means high summer and vacations to traders. Take a step back too, and look into the biggest underlying motives behind recent stock trading.  Top Zacks #1 Rank  (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): This is a widely followed semiconductor equipment-wafer fabrication outfit. Can the tech sector turn around? It will depend on stocks like this. The long-term Zacks VGM score is A.Sony Corp. (SNE  -  Free Report): This is the big Japanese consumer electronics giant.

Investors continue to scan for clues on the direction of U.S. and European monetary policy.On Monday, the nation of Chile reports a number of statistics. Among them, copper production. But it also prints a proxy of GDP growth (ex-mining). The prior reading here was 1.9% y/y. With mining, it goes to 0.5%.The Fed’s Bullard speaks in Tennessee and Kashkari speaks in Minneapolis.On Tuesday, the latest Mainland China exports and imports data come out. Look for +10.6% y/y growth from exports and +9.5% y/y from imports.On Wednesday, the City of Buenos Aires inflation rate comes out.

1089,LRCX,"The U.S. stock market no doubt has been on a stellar ride, touching fresh highs on several occasions. When the stock market surges, the U.S. dollar tends to struggle and this is what we are seeing now.Though the dollar index moved higher from a 15-month low against the basket of major currencies following the upbeat July job data report, it is down nearly 9% in the year-to-date timeframe. Additionally, the index recorded its worst run of monthly losses last month since early 2011. PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish Fund (UUP  -  Free Report), tracking the dollar index, shed 9.2% in the year-to-date time frame. This is primarily thanks to rounds of weak economic data, North Korean nuclear missile tests, geopolitical tensions, political turmoil in Washington and diminished expectations for a third rate hike this year.In particular, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in her latest testimony, stated that she is not in a rush to raise interest rates given muted inflation. It will continue to follow a gradual rate hike plan and unwinding of its massive balance sheet. Per the central bank, interest rates are close to the neutral level – a level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity (read: Asset Rollback Top Priority of Fed: ETFs in Focus).Additionally, fading hopes in the implementation of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda after the failure of healthcare bill added to the woes of the greenback. Further, rejuvenated economic growth in Europe and the prospect of an end to its cheap monetary policy era has dealt an additional blow to the dollar. The prospect of a trade war with China and renewed tension on the Korean Peninsula are further weighing on the dollar lately.Weak Dollar: A BoonA weak dollar has fueled a superb rally in blue chip companies, which derive most of their revenues from international markets. Notably, Dow Jones broke through the 22,000 milestone for the first time on August 2. This is because weak dollar has made dollar-denominated assets cheap for foreign investors making U.S. multinationals more competitive thereby leading to increased profits. As such, companies having a higher percentage of international sales will likely outperform (read: Dow at Record High: More Upside for ETFs?).Further, commodities and emerging markets stocks are also getting a lift from a weak dollar. Given this, we have highlighted four ETFs and stocks that are benefiting from the current trend and are likely to do as long as dollar remains weak.ETFs To Bet OnVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK  -  Free Report)With AUM of $3.1 billion, this ETF offers diversified exposure to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. market by tracking the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index.

The fund tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and holds 853 securities with each holding no more than 4.52% of assets. However, the product is tilted toward the information technology and financial sectors accounting for one-fourth of the portfolio each followed by consumer discretionary (10.3%).

EEM charges 72 bps in fees per year from investors and has gained 25.6% so far this year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or ‘Hold’ rating with a Medium risk outlook (read: Top Emerging Market ETFs of First Half 2017).PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund (UDN  -  Free Report)This fund could be the prime beneficiary of the falling dollar as it offers exposure to the basket of six world currencies against the U.S. dollar. This is done by tracking the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index Futures Index Excess Return plus the interest income from the fund’s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. In terms of holdings, UDN allocates nearly 57.6% in euro while 25.5% collectively in Japanese yen and British pound.

1090,LRCX,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25. Notably, the company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 34.09%.In the last quarter, the company reported a loss of 7 cents per share, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues increased 18.3% year over year to $984 million primarily driven by higher Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) sales. Additionally, revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $983 million.AMD expects second-quarter 2017 revenues to increase 17% sequentially (+/- 3%). At mid-point this reflects 12% growth on a year-over-year basis. Further, gross margin is likely to be 33%, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be $370 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe note that the stock is up 21.7% on a year-to-date basis, which reflects bullish expectations from AMD’s expanding product portfolio (Ryzen Pro, Vega accelerator, EPYC server processor, Ryzen desktop processor). The company has also benefited from strong demand of its GPU cards, which are now increasingly used to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteHowever, over the same time frame, the stock has underperformed the 30.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. The underperformance reflects stiff competition from NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) in the GPU space and Intel in the consumer PC market.Nevertheless, AMD’s improving position in key markets – like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), gaming and parallel processing – driven by the launch of Radeon and Ryzen chips is a key catalyst.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advanced Micro is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1091,LRCX,"Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service provider, Shutterfly, Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 25, after market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company’s loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which led to a positive earnings surprise of 18.45%. In fact, the company surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 13.12%.Shutterfly, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Shutterfly, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Shutterfly, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayShutterfly generally incurs loss in the first three quarters and makes profit in the final quarter of every year because of the seasonal nature of its business. For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects to incur loss per share in the range of 55-50 cents. Net revenue is projected to be in the range of $205-$212 million, representing a year-over-year decrease in the band of 0.5%-3.9%.Shutterfly’s improved offerings in the growing mobile e-Commerce segment, aggressive promotions and easy-to-use products are its strong points and should continue to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, continuous expansion of its range of products is a key element of the company’s strategy, which is likely to boost sales. In fact, its Shutterfly 3.0 initiative, under which the company aims to create a platform and device-agnostic memory management as well as personalized e-commerce solution, might further drive the quarter’s performance.As announced in the fourth quarter of 2016, Shutterfly has undertaken various structural changes. Also, in order to focus more on profitable and cost-effective brands, the company plans to retire many of its other brands.As part of the restructuring, the company is focusing on reducing its workforce by about 13%, thereby reducing costs considerably. The first three quarters of 2017 are thus expected to be a transitioning period for the company. Additionally, the company expects to incur restructuring charges over the first few months of the current year ranging from $15-$20 million, which could pressurize margins in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, by the end of first-quarter 2017, about $9 million of the expenses had already been incurred.Moreover, higher costs associated with strategic initiatives to increase its production capacity may also somewhat hamper the quarter’s profits, while unfavorable travel industry and consumer spending trends might limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Shutterfly this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Shutterfly has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

While the industry lost 0.7%, the stock returned 4.2% over the same time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderJuniper has seen growing demand and adoption of its Software Defined Secure networks (SDSN) platforms. The recent security enforcement, which enhances security across enterprise networks as well as public and private clouds, has made its SDSN platform even more lucrative.In the second quarter, CloudSeeds selected Juniper’s Contrail Networking software-defined networking (SDN) solution for its new Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) data center solutions.

1093,LRCX,"Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) or TI, a global semiconductor company and one of the world's leading designers and suppliers of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits, is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that makes surprise prediction difficult. This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement.Texas Instruments’ surprise history has been quite impressive as the company beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 7.68%.In the last one year, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to. It gained 24.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 35.3%.First-Quarter Highlights        In the quarter, Texas Instruments’ revenues grew 13.1% year over year. Pro forma net income was up 40.6% from the year-ago period.The automotive market continued to be strong. The company also saw broad-based improvement in the industrial market. The communications market and personal electronics grew well. Enterprise systems saw a decline.The analog and embedded processing applications business displayed strong growth.Factors at Play this QuarterInternal Execution Remains the KeyInternally, the company has always executed rather well. It, along with chipmaker Intel (INTC), remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. Since the company usually builds out capacity well ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on an expansion plan.Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Texas Instruments Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Texas Instruments Incorporated QuoteInvestments in High Margin Areas Texas Instruments continues to prudently invest its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing its exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets.Auto and Industrial Markets StrongThere are indications of strengthening auto and industrial markets, which are helping the company. The communications and enterprise systems market is stable. The personal electronics market remains weak.To ConcludeWe remain optimistic about TI’s compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm Analog output. We note that channel inventories remain very low, meaning that demand is likely to remain strong.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and Zacks Rank #1.

1096,LRCX,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 25.The company is unlikely to post a positive earnings surprise due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -2.02%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Increasing Competition Hurts GrowthYear to date, Seagate has underperformed the S&P 500 Index. The stock has returned 3.3% as compared with the Index’s gain of 10.7%.The dismal performance can be attributed to intensifying competition in the market post the merger of Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and SanDisk. Western Digital recently revised fourth-quarter estimates upwards driven by better-than-expected demand for its storage products (flash-based storage devices). This also doesn’t bode well for Seagate’s to-be-reported quarter results.Moreover, shift in demand from PCs to inexpensive mobile devices is hurting growth of Seagate, which is primarily a hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer.Further, declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data is a major concern for Seagate. Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteAdditionally, we also believe that Seagate’s significant investments in HAMR technology, 10 and 12 terabyte Helium HDD and fourth generation SMR technology will take some more time to translate into credible top-line growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1097,LRCX,"Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 25. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 1.49%.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.92%. Adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation) of 53 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Moreover, revenues of $609.2 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $605 million. It rose almost 7.3% from the year-ago quarter (up 8% adjusted for foreign exchange) but declined 1.1% from the previous quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAkamai shares have massively underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock lost 21.5%.The underperformance can be attributed to headwinds related to do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives by large Internet companies (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix), which are hurting its media business. Moreover, intensifying competition and pricing pressure are other concerns.Further, continuing investments are also expected to hurt EBITDA margin, which is expected to touch the lower end of 37-39% range in the second quarter. Foreign exchange fluctuations are also likely to weigh heavily on its top line.Additionally, newly launched products like Bot Manager, Image Manager, Enterprise Application Access (EAA) and the Enterprise Threat Protector (ETP) are expected to take some more time to contribute positively to top-line growth.Nevertheless, Akamai’s strong foothold in the web applications domain apart from the rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video is a key catalyst.Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Akamai Technologies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Akamai Technologies, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Akamai is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1098,LRCX,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has announced plans of opening a new fulfillment center in Ohio.This is in a bid to further speed up deliveries and expand its presence in the United States.This news comes on the heels of the company’s closure of the Whole Foods acquisition on Aug 28.Starting today, a selection of best-selling staples from Whole Foods will be sold at lower prices across all its stores, with more getting added in the future. After certain technical integration, Amazon will link its Prime loyalty program with Whole Foods, offering members with special savings and other in-store benefits.Share Price MovementAmazon is one of the leading players in the fast-growing retail e-commerce market and its strength lies in its huge scale of offerings, its broad reach and platform approach.However, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have gained only 26.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 47.8%.The underperformance can be due to a spike in operating expenses as a result of buildout of fulfillment centers in preparation for the holiday season. The company’s increased spending on original TV shows and movies and offline retail has also been impacting its profits.More About the New FacilityFulfillment centers are giant warehouses that help online retailers in storing and shipping products and handling returns quickly.According to Amazon, the new 855,000-square-foot facility will be developed in partnership with Seefried Industrial Properties. The facility will be build in North Randall where once stood a shopping mall, which was closed in 2009.The facility will create more than 2,000 full-time jobs. The center will primarily focus on smaller items such as books, electronic devices and children’s toys.The company already operates two fulfillment centers in Etna and Obetz, Ohio. Currently, it employs more than 4,500 full-time hourly associates at these two centers.Our TakeAmazon has been strengthening its presence across the globe. To date, it has created millions of full-time jobs and continues to hire manpower to meet growing customer demand.We feel, Amazon must maintain its U.S. market share, while expanding globally in order to retain its leading position. For this, the company needs to invest more in fulfillment as well as technology and content, especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates.Although increased expenses might hurt the company’s bottom line in the near term, we believe this is necessary for the company to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market.Amazon.com, Inc.

1099,LRCX,"The Priceline Group Inc.  reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 earnings.Non-GAAP net earnings of $15.14 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 89 cents and were better than management’s guidance of $13.65 at the mid-point. Revenues of $3.03 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22 million.On a year-over-year basis, both agency and merchant business showed strong momentum. Room nights and Rental cars performed impressively. The only point of weakness was airline tickets.At the call, management stated that the company’s ongoing investments in people, technology, product and marketing are contributing significantly.Overall, we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market, Priceline’s strong position in international markets, growth opportunities in the domestic market, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position.However, weaker ADRs, macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs. Year to date, the stock has surged 39.8%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 49.3%.Let’s check out the numbers.Revenues in DetailsPriceline’s revenues were up 25% sequentially and 18.3% from the year-ago quarter.Priceline generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 16/77% in the first quarter (previous quarter split was (18/74%).The Priceline Group Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Priceline Group Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Priceline Group Inc. QuoteMerchant revenues were up 12.7% sequentially and 3.8% year over year. Agency revenues increased 30.6% sequentially and 25.9% year over year.Advertising & Other revenues were up 1% sequentially and 4.9% from last year. This is basically non inter-company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable.On a sequential basis, room nights volumes decreased 2.2%, rental car days increased 11.3% and airline tickets stayed flat. On a year-over-year basis, room nights were up 21%, rental car days increased 11.7% while airline ticket volumes were down 8.7%.Priceline’s room night growth is attributable to its geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tends to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market, as well as growing competition from local and international players. The company saw average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs decline slightly year over year. Rentalcars.com also did quite well but there was some softness in ticket volumes.BookingsPriceline’s overall bookings were up slightly sequentially and 16% (19% in constant currency) year over year and were within the guided range.Merchant bookings were up 11.9% sequentially and 14.3% year over year. Agency bookings decreased 1.1% sequentially but increased 16.8% from the year-ago levels.Margins and Net IncomePriceline reported pro forma gross margin of 97.6%, up 112 basis points (bps) sequentially and 253 bps year over year.Owing to the nature of its business and the mix of agency versus merchant revenues, management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter. Priceline’s gross profit dollars were flat sequentially but up 21% (24% in constant currency) from last year and higher than the guidance. International gross profit grew 24% (26% on a constant currency basis). U.S. gross profit grew 7% from last year.Priceline’s adjusted operating income was up 16.2% sequentially and 22.8% year over year to $935.4 million. Operating margin of 30.9% was up 615 bps sequentially and 9 bps from the year-ago quarter.Priceline’s GAAP net income was $720.2 million or $14.39 a share, compared with $455.6 million, or $9.11 a share in the March quarter and $580.6 million, or $11.6 a share in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetPriceline ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of 6.4 billion compared with $5.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. Priceline generated $1.6 billion of cash from operations. It spent around $147.3 million on capex and $555.3 million on share repurchases.At quarter-end, Priceline had $7.6 billion in long-term debt with net debt being $5 billion compared with net debt of $4.9 billion in the previous quarter.GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2017, Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 11-16% and total gross bookings to increase 11-16% year over year (9-14% on a constant currency basis).Notably, this guidance indicates a slowdown in growth rates of room nights booked and total gross bookings as it is the lowest compared to the last four quarters. Investors seem to be worried about this overly conservative guidance as reflected in the 6.7% depreciation in the stock price in afterhours trading.Priceline expects gross profit dollars to increase 15.5-20.5% (12.5-17.5% on a constant currency basis), with adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2,030-2,130 million.Pro forma earnings per share (EPS) are expected to come in the range of $32.4-$34.1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $34.4 per share. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $31.7-$33.4.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPriceline currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Luxoft Holding (LXFT  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1100,LRCX,"ViaSat Inc.’s  first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings came in at 4 cents, down drastically from the figure of 23 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Despite posting record first-quarter revenues, ViaSat’s profits were hurt by escalating research and development costs, and costs related to the ViaSat-2 service launch activities.On a GAAP basis, the company actually swung to a net loss of 16 cents per share, in stark contrast to earnings of 4 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of $380 million in the fiscal first quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $387 million. However, revenues rose 4.7% compared to the prior-year quarter tally, and were at a record high for the fiscal first quarter. Terrific growth in government business drove top-line growth, which was somewhat offset by contraction in Commercial Networks revenues.New contract awards (up 31.4% to $441.8 million) grew sharply in the quarter, driving impressive backlog, and highlighting strong demand for both products and services.Segment wise, Satellite Services revenues were nearly flat (down 0.1% year over year) at $152.2 million. The segment witnessed strong revenue growth in commercial air, along with higher consumer broadband revenues. Particularly, growth of Average Revenue per User (ARPU) in ViaSat's residential broadband internet business grew 11% year over year.Commercial Networks revenues continued to be strained, plunging 31% on a year-over-year basis to $45.2 million, dragged bylower fixed terminal sales for Australia's nbn satellite broadband service.This segment continues to witness an increase in research and development investment (up 67% year over year) associated with internal development of the ViaSat-3 project and expansion of next-gen mobility solutions.On the other hand, Government Systems reported impressive revenues of $182.6 million, up 25.8% year over year, driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical datalink products, government mobility platforms and satellite communications solutions. Impressive growth in revenues drove record operating profit (up 82% year over year) and Adjusted EBITDA (up 51% year over year) for the quarter.During the quarter, sales backlog climbed 18.9% year over year to a record $1,085.8 million, driven largely by a robust backlog at Government Systems segment.However, adjusted EBIDTA plunged 23.7% from the comparable quarter last year to $61.2 million, dragged by start-up costs associated with the ViaSat-2 network, and planned rapid growth in in-flight connectivity based on installing existing backlog.ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ViaSat, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ViaSat, Inc. QuoteQuarterly HighlightsThe company launched ViaSat-2 satellite in the quarter successfully. ViaSat-2, touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage, is a massive improvement over ViaSat-1.Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat-1 include high-capacity connectivity, smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways. ViaSat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular internet access points, delivering greater network reliability and security.ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market. The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Western Asia. ViaSat-2 services are expected to begin in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.The company has also been investing in the next generation of ViaSat-3 class satellites — which will provide even more bandwidth globally from satellites slated to launch starting in 2019.LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $160.6 million compared with $130.1 million as of Mar 31, 2017. The company also generated record levels of operating cash flow in the fiscal first quarter, which hit $153.7 million.To ConcludeViaSat posted mixed results for the quarter, but set multiple records. Strong backlog levels, robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential, in-flight, and government markets are likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. In addition, the just-launched ViaSat-2 satellite is likely to help the company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets.Despite these positives, escalating research and development costs remain a major concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in the near term. Further, the company’s satellite services segment is highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods.Despite such headwinds, increasing adoption of satellite networking, in-flight Wi-Fi services in commercial aircraft data links and encryption-product based businesses are expected to drive the company’s long-term growth. We also believe the collaboration with Eutelsat is a strategic fit for ViaSat to embark on a global expansion drive.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Autodesk, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Autodesk, Inc. QuoteOur TakeAutodesk’s business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it in the long run by boosting subscriptions and deferred revenues. The company’s marketing and promotional activities are expected to sustain its growing subscription base.Autodesk’s broad product portfolio will generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets as evident from the year-over-year triple digit growth in product subscriptions in major geographies including emerging countries.However, although the company plans to keep spending unchanged over the next one year, it remains concerned about the increasing foreign exchange headwinds, which might weigh heavily on its expenses.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAutodeskcarries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1104,LRCX,"The stock market has been exhibiting volatility in the past few weeks. While geopolitical tensions, renewed fears over the implementation of President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda, an uncertain Fed policy and high stock valuations are weighing on the stocks, strong corporate earnings, and improving health of economies around the world act as tailwinds.This is especially true as the economy has been on a solid growth path buoyed by an impressive labor market, increase in wages, and higher consumer spending. U.S. GDP growth expanded 2.6% annually in the second quarter, which is double the first-quarter growth of 1.2% and represents the fastest growth since the third quarter of last year, when the economy grew 2.8%.Consumers also appear to be more optimistic with the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment rising to the highest level since January, reflecting confidence in the outlook for the economy. Further, retail sales recorded the biggest increase in seven months in July (read: Retail Sales Off to a Great Start to Q3: ETFs to Buy).Given improving economic fundamentals and heightened uncertainty, investors should focus on high-quality investing through a basket form.Why Quality Investing?Quality stocks are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheets, high return on capital, low volatility, elevated margins, and a track of stable or rising sales and earnings growth. These stocks thus reduce volatility when compared to plain vanilla funds and hold up rather well during market swings. Further, academic research shows that high-quality companies consistently deliver superior risk-adjusted returns than the broader market over the long term.Given this, we have highlighted five solid picks each from the ETF and stock worlds, targeting this niche strategy. Any of these could enjoy smooth trading and outperform the U.S. market in the coming months.ETF PicksiShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to stocks exhibiting positive fundamentals (high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage) by tracking the MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index.

The product has amassed $3.4 billion in its asset base and charges just 15 bps in annual fees from investors.PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio (SPHQ  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the S S&P 500 Quality Index, a benchmark of S&P 500 stocks that have the highest quality score based on three fundamental measures: return on equity, accruals ratio and financial leverage ratio. This approach has resulted in a basket of 99 stocks with each holding less than 5.3% of total assets. The fund is skewed toward industrials at 22.4%, followed by information technology (18.2%), consumer discretionary (16.5%) and consumer staples (15.2%).

1111,LRCX,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 24 after the closing bell.The surprise history has been decent in Alphabet’s case. The company missed estimates once in the last four quarters and has an average four-quarter positive surprise of 5.74%.Coming to the price performance, in the last one year, shares of Alphabet have steadily treaded higher. The stock has returned 31.1% compared with the Zacks categorized Internet Services industry’s gain of 21.6%.What Happened in the Last Reported Quarter?Alphabet’s first-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A surge in ad click aided growth in the quarter. Also, revenues grew year over year, driven primarily by the boom in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in programmatic advertising and Play aided revenue growth.Factors at Play in Q2The main drivers of the Google business haven’t changed. Pricing remains under pressure, both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging, as total paid click grew a reassuring 44% in the last quarter.Google has gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter.YouTube remains a strong contributor, benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.Also, Google’s cloud business trails Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure and IBM. The company’s cloud business is expected to do well in the to-be reported quarter. And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.On a cautionary note, Google’s troubles in the EU are mounting. Despite attempts of appeasing authorities by investing in the region, EU might prove to be more expensive for the company. Google is not providing for this outflow, which means it still has a reasonable chance of emerging victorious.

1112,LRCX,"International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) recently shipped its first z14 mainframe from its Poughkeepsie factory based in New York. This model was unveiled in July 2017 when its entire series of mainframes were renamed as IBM Z.Per IBM, the most prominent feature of the newest member of the series is 100% data encryption, ensuring high security. Other key features include real time insights that are beneficial for machine learning and a strong cloud platform. The system is also compatible with blockchain technology.IBM z14 can support 12 billion encrypted transactions each day, almost equivalent to 400 Cyber Mondays. With this specification, the company believes that the new mainframe will find widespread acceptance in the financial, government, retail, travel and transport industries, where the number of transactions is much higher and data safety necessary.Shares of IBM have lost 9.5% year to date, underperforming the industry’s decline of 8.8%. We believe, with the recent advancements made by IBM in cloud, blockchain and its artificial intelligence platform Watson, the launch of a mainframe compatible with all the three segments is a positive for the company. These will help shares rebound going forward.Evolution of MainframeMainframe computers were primarily meant for huge amount of critical data processing for large organizations. With the evolution of technology mainframes, the underlying infrastructure was also upgraded. Though public, private and hybrid clouds have become popular; these huge computers are still in demand for their capability of handling high workloads and the fact that it can be integrated into an existing ecosystem.IBM almost had a monopoly in the mainframe segment for quite some time. Though IBM still dominates the market, other players like Fujitsu and Unisys (UIS  -  Free Report) have entered the fray. Mainframes have an intrinsic role in the digital transformation of enterprises, more so because of their high computing power.Effect of Mainframe Segment on IBM’s FinancialsIn a recent report by Gartner, the CPU segment mostly comprised of mainframes witnessed year-over-year decline of 29.5% in the second quarter of 2017.However, IBM’s management expects the shipments of z14 mainframes to have a positive impact on second-half 2017 results. This is anticipated to have a positive impact on overall revenues generated by the mainframe market.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteZDNet quoted Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM Z, who said that IBM adds around 5 o 15 customers in this segment per quarter. Per IBM, z14, which has been co-designed with clients’ insights, is expected to witness high adoption rate.We believe that with the impending implementation of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, the shipment of z14, whose core advertising point is data encryption, is perfectly timed.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIBM currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader industry include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc.

(GWRE  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Guidewire posted impressive fiscal fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, which were better than the  guided range.For the fourth-quarter, non-GAAP earnings were 59 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents and increasing 51.3% year over year. Revenues for the quarter were $181.1 million, an increase of 28% from the year-ago quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $168 million.ISCS, which the company acquired in February 2017 and later renamed as InsuranceNow, contributed $16.2 million in hosting revenues for fiscal 2017. This along with customer addition, higher service activities and certain advance payments from term licenses boosted the company’s top line. Shares of Guidewire have gained 60.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 28% rally.Growth Catalysts in DetailManagement noted that nine new customers were added during the fourth quarter, with five for the company’s core offering InsuranceSuite and one for InsuranceNow. Moreover, 27 existing customers expanded their relationship with the company during the quarter.    Notably, while the integration of ISCS is going on, Guidewire’s other acquisitions have contributed to the company’s growth. The company’s product suite, which has been enriched by the acquisition of FirstBest, now called Guidewire Underwriting Management; EagleEye Analytics, now Guidewire Predictive Analytics and InsuranceNow is experiencing benefits from cross-selling of the products.Guidewire Software, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Guidewire Software, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Guidewire Software, Inc. QuoteThe company benefitted particularly from $6.1 million of advance payment from term licenses in the fourth quarter. This will however have a negative impact on fiscal 2018 license revenues, growth and margins, as the costs related to the payment will be incurred in the following quarter.Guidewire is slowly shifting from a term license based model to a subscription based model. This will hamper the top line for some time as cloud based or subscription based revenues are a bit delayed compared to license based early payments. Margins are also anticipated to be affected by the investments for the cloud transition. However, we believe, this step will be beneficial for the company in the long run as the industry is moving toward cloud-based infrastructure at a steady pace. This is reflected in the company’s expectation of a rise of 20% to 30% in subscription sales in fiscal 2018 from 6% in fiscal 2017.Zacks Rank and Key PicksGuidewire sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other stocks worth considering in the broader industry are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc.

Created in 2011, MallforAfrica is a platform to help connect businesses with consumers in Africa.The deal will help eBay to increase its presence in Africa and open new revenue opportunities.  According to consulting firm McKinsey, digital sales revenue in Africa will top $75 billion by 2025. Given such impressive projected numbers in Africa, eBay is sure to gain from it.Also, eBay has been making continuous efforts to fuel growth in its Marketplaces business. It has re-platformed itself by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse inspired shopping journeys and strengthening its brand.Last month, eBay Inc. entered into a partnership with Facebook to offer daily deals on Facebook’s Mobile Marketplace. The deal will boost eBay’s Marketplace by offering its platform features to Facebook and getting access to the latter’s huge user base in return.Also, eBay struck a deal with Shopify in July. The two launched a new sales channel, an integrated platform that allows Shopify sellers to synchronize inventory information, sell products ordered on eBay and view eBay buyer messages directly from Shopify accounts.These moves will help accelerate eBay's growth. In the second quarter, eBay added nearly two million active buyers to its platforms, for a total of 171 million.Now coming to eBay’s second-quarter results, the company’s earnings of 34 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Increase in cost of revenues and operating expenses (predominantly sales and marketing) weighed on eBay’s bottom line.However, the company’s revenues of $2.33 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a slight margin and came ahead of the guided range. Revenue growth was driven by strength in international markets, increase in active buyers, expansion of new user experience and brand advertising.Furthermore, it delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 1.09% in the trailing four quarters.Notably, this e-Commerce service provider company’s solid market position, several initiatives like building a solid foundation of structured data and artificial intelligence (AI), customer-to-customer (C2C) business  and enhancing mobile experience, strong revenue growth, continued innovation and strong long-term growth potential position it favorably.

1116,LRCX,"Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to acquire Landauer Inc. , a leader in radiation science and services. The deal is valued at approximately $770 million, including debt and net of acquired cash.The deal is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of this year. It has been unanimously approved by Landauer's Board of Directors.Following the announcement, Fortive’s share price increased 1.30% to $65.57. However, its shares have returned 22.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 33.9%.More Into the HeadlinesLandauer Inc. is the world's leading provider of analytical services to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure. Its services include manufacturing various types of radiation detection monitors, distribution and collection of the monitors to and from clients, and analysis and reporting of exposure findings.In 2016, the company generated annual revenues of $143 million.Post acquisition, Landauer will become part of Fortive’s field solutions platform. This platform includes Fortive’s Fluke and Qualitrol businesses, which make test and measurement tools and precision equipment for utilities, power companies and other industries.In the last reported second quarter, Field Solutions’ core revenues were up mid-single digits with both Fluke and Qualitrol posting strong core revenue growth.The deal is in sync with the company’s strategy to strengthen its teams with advanced talent and technology.The acquisition will further strengthen Fortive’s field solutions portfolio and compliment its customer base.Fortive’s String of AcquisitionsFortive has been on a buyout spree to increase its penetration into existing markets, expand in others and also fight competition.In July, Fortive agreed to acquire Industrial Scientific Corporation, a leading provider of portable gas detection equipment and a safety-as-a-service pioneer. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2017.The acquisition is expected to enhance the company’s digital strategy, thereby creating a stronger platform for connected solutions. These solutions can be used for applications in maintenance and safety.Last year, the company strengthened its position in the IoT space through eMaint Enterprises. It also added some important transportation technologies through the acquisition of GTT, a global leader in priority traffic control technology for public transit and emergency vehicles.ConclusionWe believe that the company’s Transportation Technologies platform, ongoing margin expansion owing to the Fortive Business System and acquisitions will drive Fortive’s growth, going forward.However, foreign exchange risks, increased investments, increasing competition across geographies and end-market cyclicality remain risks.Fortive Corporation Price and Consensus  Fortive Corporation Price and Consensus | Fortive Corporation QuoteZacks RankFortive currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1117,LRCX,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has announced its plans to open its first fulfillment center in Staten Island, NY. This new facility will be equipped with modern technology.Also, it is likely to deploy robots which will decrease the time taken to sort and pack products, thus strengthening its same-day or overnight delivery services.Notably, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 29.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 47.0% in the same time period.About the New FacilityThe 855,000-square-foot fulfillment center is being developed by Matrix Development Group. It will feature innovative technology like deploying robots to speed up its deliveries. Going forward, the center is expected to create more than 2,250 new full-time jobs.Meanwhile, Amazon has been increasingly investing to build and modernize fulfillment centers mainly to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. The company also plans to open more centers in Sacramento, CA; Kansas City, KS; North Randall, OH and other cities, which will add to more than 80 such centers worldwide.In 2016, Amazon’s capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was used in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.A Prudent Capital InvestmentFulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important for providing the level of services that customers expect from the company.In addition, small retailers that are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping are signing up for Amazon’s fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company’s warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul.Although heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) keep Amazon’s margins under pressure, they are also responsible for the company’s progress. Evidently, Amazon’s retail business is currently unbeatable on price, choice and convenience in the face of fierce competition from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), among others.Furthermore, we believe that Amazon’s long history of execution, growing focus on innovation, technological prowess and huge cash balance not only give it the flexibility to pursue growth in potential areas but also create value for investors.Amazon.com, Inc.

1118,LRCX,"When it comes to investment, millennials do exhibit some specific characteristics. With age on their side, they have a long-time horizon for investment. This allows them to take risks and focus more on capital appreciation rather than dividend income. They like stocks that have potential for upside.They also have a tendency to turn to sectors that they are familiar with and companies whose products or services are part and parcel of their lives. Probably that’s why their preferred sectors include technology, internet commerce, auto and fitness.It’s not surprising, then, that companies on millennials’ portfolio are mostly the popular ones.How Important is this Demography?Gone are those days when millennials were considered dependent on parents and unlikely to have surplus cash to invest in the stock market.

Millennials are fond of brands that offer maximum convenience at minimum cost and probably this is the reason behind the success of e-commerce giants like Amazon, eBay and Alibaba.Busy lives and somewhat unhealthy food habits require them to focus on fitness.

The figure was also better than the guided range of $1.285–$1.335 billion.The year-over-year growth was driven by strong progress of the Fairchild integration and diversified product portfolio for automotive, industrial and communications end-markets.Notably, shares of ON Semi have gained 27% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s16.6% rally. The company’s diversified product and customer base along with improving end-markets will help the stock to sustain its momentum in the rest of 2017.Revenue DetailsON Semi has three business units namely – Power Solutions Group or PSG (revenues of $671 million), Analog Solutions (revenues of $468 million) and Image Sensor Group (revenues of $198 million).Automotive (31% of revenues) end-market revenues were approximately $410 million, up 30% year over year and increased marginally quarter over quarter. In the quarter, the company’s image sensor revenues related to advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and viewing applications grew at an impressive rate.Management noted that growth drivers for automotive applications include ADAS and LED lighting, in-vehicle networking solutions, mixed signal ASICs and protection devices. Exposure to a diversified global customer base was also a positive.Industrial (26%) end-market revenues increased 59% year over year and 8% sequentially to $351 million. The company noted that its Python line of CMOS image sensors for machine vision applications continues to grow at an impressive rate. The demand for industrial end-markets was driven by industrial power supplies, building automation, lighting, industrial automation and alternative energy. With the acquisition of Fairchild, demand for the company’s power modules increased significantly. Implantable devices and hearing health also led to strong growth in the medical business.Communications (19%) end-market revenues grew 62% year over year and 6% quarter over quarter to $252 million attributable to growth in its content and major smartphone platforms and traction in the smartphone market.Computing (10%) grew 50% year over year and 3% quarter over quarter to $131 million. On Semiconductor won designs for power stage for cloud computing and server applications.Consumer (15%) end-market revenues grew 96% on a year-over-year basis and approximately 7% sequentially to $194 million.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ON Semiconductor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ON Semiconductor Corporation QuoteMarginsNon-GAAP gross margin was 36.9%, up 140 basis points (bps) sequentially and 180 bps year over year, reflecting higher-than-expected revenues and improving operational efficiency.ON Semi incurred non-GAAP operating expenses of $296.8 million, up 48.6% from the year-ago quarter and 4.2% from the previous quarter. The figure was higher than management’s guided range of $281–$295 million, primarily owing to higher variable compensation.As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined 60 bps from the year-ago quarter but increased 240 bps from the previous quarter to 22.2%.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 240 bps from the year-ago quarter and 290 bps sequentially to 14.7%.Balance SheetCash & cash equivalents were $871.6 million, up $142.7 million sequentially. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $333.2 million compared with $208.5 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $264.2 million, up from $155.8 million in the previous quarter.GuidanceON Semi revised its annual synergies run rate from the Fairchild acquisition to $180 million, up from the previous target of $160 million for 2017. The company also raised annualized synergies run rate exiting 2018 to $220 million from $200 million. Total annual synergies expectation from Fairchild was maintained at $245 million, which the company looks to achieve by end of 2019.Management expects to see strong growth in revenue contribution from Fairchild in the near to mid-term. In the third-quarter, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenues from communications, computing and consumer end-market are anticipated to increase, automotive revenues are expected to remain flat while the industrial end market might show a decline.ON Semi now forecasts revenues to be in the range of $1.34–$1.39 billion in third-quarter 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be in the range of approximately 36.2%–38.2%, while operating expenses are expected in the range of $285–$299 million.For 2017, On Semi now expects free cash flow in the range of $600-$650 million, up from the prior guidance of $500–$600 million.ConclusionWe believe that improving end-markets are positive for ON Semi. The Fairchild acquisition has helped the company to secure a dominant position in the power semiconductor market with a planned focus on smartphone, automotive and industrial end markets.Further, a diversified customer and product base coupled with improving end-markets has insulated the company against certain end-market and geographical demand volatility. Lower customer and product concentration risk is therefore a positive for its top line.Moreover, growing demand and greater adoption of CMOS image sensor business and ADAS related applications have given ON Semi a significant growth opportunity in the automotive market.Additionally, higher synergies from the Fairchild acquisition along with reducing enterprise-wide manufacturing cost will boost profitability.Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider On Semiconductor carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"
1125,LRCX,"Earlier this month, 3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results with another huge earnings miss – its second after the last quarter’s staggering miss. The company continues to grapple with the headwinds that have marred its performance over one and a half years. We anticipate that rise in operating expenses, among other factors, will continue to thwart growth in the short run. In light of weaker-than-expected results, management trimmed the full-year 2017 guidance.Mirroring these headwinds, the stock has had a dismal performance on the bourse.  Over three months, 3D Systems has lost 44.5% in stark contrast to the industry’s average gain of 1.9%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has moved south over a couple of months, from 52 cents to 45 cents, on the back of five downward estimate revisions versus none higher.Read on to find the major factors curbing the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s growth and why it may be prudent to avoid the stock at the moment.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter 2017 earnings release, 3D Systemsreduced its guidance for 2017. 3D Systems now anticipates revenues in the range of $643–$671 million (earlier projection: $643–$684 million), reflecting year-over-year growth of 2-6%. Management also reduced the guidance for non-GAAP earnings to around 46 cents per share from the previous estimate of 51-55 cents.Over the past few quarters, the company has been experiencing unfavourablebroader market conditions that have badly hit its financial performance. Macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability have negatively impacted the company’s performance.Lower revenues from professional printers have been a pressing concern for the company in the recent past. In the last reported quarter, the company’s Printer revenues were down 14% to $28 million, while on-demand manufacturing decreased 5% to $26 million. The decline was primarily due to continued challenging market conditions that affected customers' capital investment cycles. Moreover, in the second quarter, gross margin contracted 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 50.6%.Moreover, 3D Systems continues to incur high research & development (R&D) and acquisition costs. Going forward, the company believes investment in IT and go-to-market initiatives will result in higher expenses, thus restricting near-term operating income growth. During the second quarter, the company’s operating expenses flared up 4% to $87.5 million, as R&D expense rose 17% year over year, mainly on account of a rise in focused investments in production application solutions, metals and materials. Such costs will continue to take a toll on the company’s financial health in the near term.The company operates in a highly competitive industry with its chief competitors being firms that manufacture or use machines to make models, prototypes and small-volume to medium-volume manufacturing parts. A few of its competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources. Intensifying competition for experienced and qualified personnel in the industry also adds to the company’s challenges.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report), each carrying Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lam Research has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.4% for the trailing four quarters, having surpassed estimates all through.Applied Materials managed to beat estimates every time in the trailing four quarters, at an average earnings surprise of 2.7%.Arista Networks has an average positive earnings surprise of 22.8% for the trailing four quarters, having surpassed estimates every time.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1126,LRCX,"While investors avoid stocks that do not have juicy yields, it is true that these low-yield stocks have a solid history of dividend growth that lead to outperformance. This is because investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation even in a volatile market.Inside The Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report): This California-based company is a provider of internet infrastructure solutions that enable internet service providers and other telecommunications service providers to meet demand resulting from the rapid growth of the internet.

1127,LRCX,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has announced its plans of opening a new fulfillment center in Bristol, south west England, next year.This is in a bid to further speed up deliveries and expand its presence in U.K.This news comes on the heels of the company’s launch of the Instant Pickup service for Prime and Prime Student members, who will receive their ordered items in just two minutes. Shoppers can order from a wide range of fast-selling items such as drinks, snacks and phone chargers, using the Amazon mobile app. The company staff will place these in lockers at instant pickup points within two minutes.More About the New FacilityFulfillment centers are giant warehouses that help online retailers in storing and shipping products and handling returns quickly.According to Amazon, the new facilitywill create approximately 1000 full-time jobs. Including these 1000 jobs, the company plans to bring its total U.K. workforce to 24,000 by the end of 2017.Amazon stated that it workers at the Bristol plant will be hired on permanent contracts. These permanent employees will earn upwards of £7.65 an hour, which will increase over their first two years of employment to £8.15 an hour or more.U.K. Expansion ContinuesFor the last few years, the company has been expanding its investments in the U.K. In 2016, the company tripled its U.K. investments to more than 400 million pounds ($513.96 million).At the end of 2016, the company had 13 fulfillment centers in U.K. It plans to open another three  warehouses in Doncaster, Warrington and Tilbury this autumn.Moreover, Amazon has been using its latest-generation robots, vision systems and other high-end technologies in few of these distribution centers to speed up order deliveries. The increased use of robot technology has also contributed to high capex, impacting its profits. Since 2010, including operating costs, the company has already spent 6.4 billion pounds ($8.3 billion) in the U.K.Share Price MovementAmazon is one of the leading players in the fast-growing retail ecommerce market and its strength lies in its huge scale of offerings, its broad reach and platform approach.However, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis, The company’s shares have gained only 27.8%, lower than the industry’s gain of 46.8%.The underperformance can be due to a spike in operating expenses as a result of buildout of fulfillment centers in preparation for the holiday season. The company’s increased spending on original TV shows and movies and offline retail has also been impacting its profits.Our TakeAmazon has been strengthening its presence across the globe. To date, it has created millions of full-time jobs and continues to hire manpower to meet growing customer demand.We feel, Amazon must maintain its U.S. market share, while expanding globally in order to retain its leading position. For this, the company needs to invest more in fulfillment as well astechnology and content, especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates.Although increased expenses might hurt the company’s bottom line in the near term, we believe this is necessary for the company to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market.Amazon.com, Inc.

The stock has appreciated a huge 46.6% on a year-to-date basis against the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s gain of 19.9%.How is PayPal Poised to Benefit?Since management made no change in the previously announced fiscal guidance and three-year outlook based on the TIO buyout, we do not expect any instant accretion to PayPal’s earnings.PayPal seems to be thinking several years down the road. It has been trying to enter the bill pay space. Since TIO is a major player in the North American bill pay market, the acquisition could accelerate the company’s push in the space.Further, TIO's offline payment processing platform will help PayPal tap un-banked and under-banked customers who are unable to access conventional financial services. Per a Business Insider report, these customer groups roughly encompass 33.5 million U.S. households and 2 billion people globally.The acquisition gives PayPal access to $7 billion worth of payments from around 14 million clients that TIO serves in North America and its 10,000 biller partners.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

The company also sees significant opportunities in the patterning market.Additionally, the company remains strongly positioned in China where it foresees growth in semiconductor orders. The decision of the Chinese government to reduce its semiconductor imports by building domestic capabilities is likely to bolster Applied Materials’ revenues in the long run.Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) and PetMed Express, Inc.

1132,LRCX,"Nikon Corporation’s (NINOY  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings declined significantly over the comparable quarter last fiscal, as the company generated a net profit of ¥8.9 billion ($80.7 million) compared with profit of¥14.7 billion last year. Earnings per share came in at¥22.37, down 39.7% year over year.Operating income too decreased 31.1% year over year to ¥12.4 billion ($65.1 million).Inside the HeadlinesIn the quarter, Nikon’s net sales inched up 0.6% year over year to ¥170.3 billion ($1.5 billion). The top line was positively impacted by increase in unit sales from FPD and Semiconductor lithography, which was somewhat offset by soft digital camera sales, change in product mix of new DSLRs and delayed budget execution by governments.Sales for the Precision Equipment Business climbed 6.6% year over year to ¥55.2 billion ($500.7 million).The unit enjoyed remarkable growth in the FPD Lithography System field, which benefited from the broad-based strength in capital investments. However, operating income at the segment fell to ¥13.1 billion compared to ¥14.8 billion in the prior-year quarter due to lower unit sales in the FPD Lithography System field.However, the Imaging Products Business witnessed a steady decline in both sales and profits, as the top line edged down 0.8% over first-quarter fiscal 2017 to ¥90.9 billion ($824.6 million). The unit saw a turnaround in the shrinking digital camera market, as the compact digital camera market improved year over year. Operating income at the segment also fell to ¥7.6 billion, down 24.8% from ¥10.1 billion in the year-ago period, due to adverse product mix.The Instruments Business displayed nearly flat growth, with the top line coming in at ¥13.5 billion ($122.5 million), up from sales of ¥13.4 billion recorded last quarter. The microscope-related field’s performance was weak due to delayed budget execution by the U.S. and China governments and other factors, and adverse foreign currency translation impact further hampered revenues. However, in the industrial metrology field, the company recorded improved sales in the U.S. and Asia. The segment recorded an operating loss of ¥2.4 billion compared with a loss of ¥1.2 billion in the prior fiscal quarter, due to higher upfront investments and expenses related to sales expansion initiatives.The new Medical Business posted sales of ¥4.7 billion ($42.6 million) in the quarter, up from ¥4.2 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Optos Plc's retinal diagnostic imaging equipment exhibited solid performance in North America, which drove revenues.This segment also recorded an operating loss of ¥1.1 billion, slightly wider than the ¥0.6-billion loss in the prior-year quarter, hurt by upfront investments.Lastly, the Other Businesses segment net sales grew 9.4% year over year at ¥5.8 billion ($52.6 million).Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Jun 30, 2017, Nikon’s cash and cash equivalents were ¥309.2 billion ($2.8 billion), down from ¥319.1 billion recorded on Mar 31, 2017.Long-term liabilities (which include Bonds and Long-term loans) totaled ¥137.7 billion ($1.2 billion), marginally down from ¥138.3 billion a year ago.Nikon Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nikon Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nikon Corp. QuoteRestructuring PlanIn third-quarter fiscal 2017, Nikon unveiled a plan to undertake company-wide structural reform, as it seeks to enhance its operational profitability and create value.The restructuring will help Nikon shift from a strategy pursuing revenue growth to one pursuing profit improvement.The restructuring was prompted by the fact that Nikon has not been able to derive value from its existing businesses. The company’s Semiconductor Lithography Business Imaging Product business is still not profitable, while the Imaging Product Business has been grappling with a shrinking market and foreign exchange headwinds.In light of the above, Nikon planned to discontinue the current ""Medium-Term Management Plan Update."" Instead, it has initiated a company-wide restructuring to help shift to a strategy which pursues profit growth instead of revenue growth.The plan includes reassessment of the strategy of the Semiconductor Lithography and Imaging Product Businesses. Additionally, Nikon intends to optimize manufacturing, sales and R&D on a global basis and streamline & optimize its workforce. As part of the initiative, Nikon stated it will be declaring a voluntary retirement program for about 1,000 employees.Extraordinary losses due to the restructuring came to about ¥49.8 billion and were booked in the fiscal year ending Mar 31, 2017.GuidanceThe company sees a gradual recovery trend in its end markets as both the U.S. and Europe enjoy steady personal consumption, after much turmoil in the aftermath of the UK’s decision to exit from the EU, as well as the U.S. presidential election. Japan’s capital investment and personal consumption also seem to be on the road to recovery.Incorporating the present market scenario, Nikon reiterated its forecast for fiscal 2018. The company expects net sales to come at around ¥700 billion. Also, the guidance for operating profits is about ¥45 billion.Nikon anticipates strong capital investments in the semiconductor-related field, which will drive growth in the Precision Equipment Business. Sales in the Imaging Products Business are likely to be better than the earlier projections, led by an increase in unit sales of digital cameras and interchangeable lenses. The instruments businessis also contending with deferred government budget spending and restrained investments, which might mar sales.Our TakeNikon has been suffering in recent times as its chip-making equipment business has been underperforming, as it struggles with slowing demand and stiff competition with overseas rivals. Further, adverse foreign exchange impact and supply disruptions caused by the Kumamoto earthquakes in Apr 2016 further dented operations for this company.In order to drive growth, the Japanese precision instrument maker aims to downsize low-profitable operations and instead focus resources on medical equipment and other promising businesses.Nikon’s growth blueprint is based on four initiatives — a merger & acquisition program, research & development program, human resource program and cost-reduction program.Nikon is focusing on expansion in two new segments, namely Medical and Instruments business. Also, the company is undertaking a number of initiatives to stabilize the key financials of its core business areas – including Precision Equipment and Imaging Products. In addition, Nikon’s strategic acquisitions and investments to build its medical business is anticipated to help it reap significant benefits over the long run.Nikon currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks include Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc.

1134,LRCX,"Plexus Corp. (PLXS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 19, after the closing bell. The company reported a positive earnings surprise of 10.53% in the last quarter. Further, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.52% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor third-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are projected in the range of $595–$625 million. GAAP earnings are projected within 68–76 cents per share. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 4.8–5.2%.For Healthcare/Life sciences Sector, management expects growth to be in mid-single digits driven by increasing end-market demand and new wins, while for Industrial/Commercial sector, revenues are anticipated to be flat year over year.Communications sector is stated to be marred by softening end market demand as well as timing of new product launches, whereas Defense/Security/Aerospace, bolstered by increasing end-market demand and new program wins, is projected to see revenues up in mid-single digits sequentially.We note that on a year-to-date basis Plexus’ shares have decreased 2.4%, underperforming the Zacks categorized Electronics Manufacturing Services industry’s gain of 16.7% over the same period.This sluggish performance can be primarily attributed to the reduced end-market demand in the slowing Networking and Communications industry, which contributes significantly to the company’s top-line (approximately 23.4% of fiscal 2016 revenues).Nevertheless, we believe that a healthy number of program wins is a big positive for the company.  In the last reported quarter, Plexus won 26 programs worth approximately $202 million in its Manufacturing Solutions group and has added over $813 million in revenues in the trailing four quarters due to new wins. In addition, the company announced that qualified manufacturing opportunities reached $3 billion revenue run rate in the quarter.Moreover, as an engineering-focused EMS player, Plexus is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing outsourcing trend among healthcare, industrial and defense/aerospace OEMs; given its exposure to high-growth segments, streamlining of operations and strong cash flow generation abilities.Furthermore, the consolidation of the company’s production facilities in low-cost areas is expected to boost margins, going forward. Additionally, a robust shareholder return policy continues to drive the stock.Plexus Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  Plexus Corp. Price and EPS Surprise | Plexus Corp. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Plexus is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Plexus currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 72 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Plexus carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +6.09% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1136,LRCX,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) continues to expand its Prime Now Service. Canada is the latest addition to the list of countries receiving this one and two-hour delivery service.Reportedly, Amazon plans to start this service first in Vancouver. Later, provided the pilot becomes successful, it will expand the service to other Canadian cities throughout 2018.Currently, Prime Now is available in nine countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and Japan.Prime Now will likely offer common grocery items, including produce, dairy, frozen food, as well as health and personal care items. The online giant also plans to partner with local bakeries, butcher shops and grocers to bolster Prime Now’s food offerings.Undoubtedly, the new destination will help the company attract more customers to its Amazon Prime program, which is a significant revenue source.Amazon has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis.

1137,LRCX,"To arrive at a decision to buy or sell a stock at an attractive value, investors have a number of valuation metrics at their disposal. Though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are preferred by value investors while choosing value stocks, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also a convenient valuation metric for identifying low-priced stocks, which have high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.Understanding Book ValueThere are several ways by which book value can be defined. It is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this would equate to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value.Explaining the P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under- or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries. A P/B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets, or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s share price may be significantly high – thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one – in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses – like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies – with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditures, high-debt companies, service companies or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should also analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share – a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG ratio links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Style Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are four stocks that qualified the screening:Magellan Health, Inc. (MGLN  -  Free Report), a managed care organization, has a projected 3–5 year EPS growth rate of 18%. Currently, the stock has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.

1138,LRCX,"Dividend is a major source of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.Dividend paying stocks are primarily mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market. Their market leading position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and more scope for capital appreciation as opposed to those that pay high yields.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broad stock market or any other dividend paying stocks, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio:5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Zacks Rank Less than 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Style Score of B or better: This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum.

(OC  -  Free Report): This Toledo, TX-based company develops, manufactures and markets insulation, roofing and fiberglass composites. The stock has a VGM Style Score of B and a Zacks Rank #1.

1139,LRCX,"On Aug 18, Zacks Investment Research downgraded DST Systems Inc.  to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Of late, the stock has been witnessing downward estimate revisions. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 dropped 6.5% to $3.04 over the last 30 days. All four estimates for fiscal 2018 declined in the same time frame, resulting in a drop of 4.5% in the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $3.57.    The negative estimate revision was primarily due to disappointing second-quarter 2017 bottom-line results. The company posted non-GAAP earnings (excluding amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and one-time items) of 76 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.DST has lost 4.8% of its value year to date against 24.2% growth of its industry.Factors Affecting the CompanyWe believe persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market is putting the company’s fundamentals under pressure. Additionally, a high debt burden remains a major concern.The impact of client migrations, reduction in membership and decline in healthcare technology spending resulting from changes in government policy also negatively impacted the company.Moreover, there was an increase in total cost and operating expenses in the second quarter, which soared 63.9% from the year-ago quarter to $525.2 million. This in turn put pressure on margin. Operating margin was down 620 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 12.2% in the last quarter.DST Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) DST Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | DST Systems, Inc. QuoteFurthermore, in the last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.56%.Additionally, stiff competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Fiserv Inc.

1140,LRCX,"A healthy business with stable sales growth is the key to survival in today’s fast changing and highly competitive environment. So, superior revenues are essential to drive growth. Most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise.Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities. Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period, it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations.In cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis, these are valued based on revenues and not on earnings. This is because sales growth (or decline) is usually an early indicator of the company’s future earnings performance.While sales growth is an important metric for any corporation for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making, this in isolation does not reflect too much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.Hence, a consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Chattanooga, TN, Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) provides group and individual disability insurance products and services. The company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 7% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report) designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports automatic test equipment. This North Reading, MA-based company currently has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.  Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), based in Fremont, CA, designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing systems used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.

1141,LRCX,"The world’s largest online retailer, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), recently announced a private offering of bonds aggregating $16 billion.According to Informa Global Markets, this is the fourth largest high-grade debt offering of 2017. These bonds have been issued in seven tranches of different amounts and maturities, ranging from three-year notes to 40-year notes.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase will act as lead underwriters for the offering.Price MovementAmazon is one of the leading players in the extremely fast-growing retail ecommerce market and its strength lies in its huge scale of offerings, its broad reach and platform approach.However, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. During this period, the company’s shares have increased only 30.4%, lower than the industry’s gain of 46.4%.The underperformance could be due to a spike in operating expenses as a result of buildout of fulfillment centers in preparation for the holiday season. The company’s increased spending on original TV shows and movies and offline retail has also been impacting its profits.Reason for the Debt IssueAmazon stated that the transaction proceeds will be used to fund its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc. The amount will also be used to repay its 1.200% notes due 2017, and for general corporate purposes.In June, Amazon had announced that it had reached a deal to acquire leading natural and organic foods supermarket, Whole Foods Market, Inc.  for $13.7 billion. The deal, which is expected to conclude in the second half of this year, will open a window of opportunities for Amazon in the retail market. The deal will also help it counter competition, if it manages to get a first-mover advantage.Amazon’s Cash PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had total debt of $7.7 billion. Its cash equivalents and marketable securities balance were almost $21.45 billion, slightly down from the prior quarter. Also, the company generated $3.8 billion of cash from operations, spending $2.5 billion on fixed assets (including internal-use software and website development costs) and $633 million on acquisitions. Principal repayments of capital lease obligations were $1.2 billion in the second quarter.The new debts will carry a fixed rate of interest and will help the company to lower interest burden compared with the floating rate in the credit facility.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1142,LRCX,"Shares of Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $78.97 during yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $78.23. This comes a day before its third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release which is scheduled to be announced after the market close.Notably, the stock has added 32.9% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s gain of 21.7%.The recent momentum in share price reflects investor confidence that the company may once again report splendid results for the third quarter. We note that the stock has an excellent track record of exceeding the quarterly earnings expectations. With respect to the earnings surprise history, Synopsys has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 21.9%.Apart from this, the company’s impressive third-quarter outlook and upbeat fiscal 2017 guidance have also aided the year-to-date upward movement in share price. For the third quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $685-$700 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 91-94 cents.For fiscal 2017, Synopsys raised its revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range to $2.650-$2.670 billion and $3.24-$3.29, respectively, from $2.58-$2.61 billion and $3.21-$3.26.Other Factors Driving the StockWe believe that the company’s sustained focus on introducing new products, acquisitions and deal wins will continue to boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive forthcoming results.We are also positive about Synopsys’ time-based license revenue model, under which, customers effectively rent the software, rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee. Hence this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream.Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to its customers.We are also encouraged by Synopsys’s endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also inspire investor confidence and loyalty.Synopsys, Inc. Price and Consensus  Synopsys, Inc. Price and Consensus | Synopsys, Inc.

1143,LRCX,"Stocks near their 52-week highs make the trickiest of investment choices as they have a possibility to either scale higher or go downhill.The odds are difficult, if not impossible, to gauge. At best, 52-week investments can be described as a touch-and-go strategy which can lead to handsome rewards but only in conjunction with a particular set of parameters.Movement of stocks toward their 52-week high or low are closely tracked on a daily basis. The vast information on such movements is hard to interpret, even for the most seasoned of investors.Clubbing 52-week high stocks with the correct set of parameters is all you need to turn the tide in your favor. This is where our screener comes into play, as it helps you steer clear of uncertainties and book solid profits.A Peek into 52-Week High StocksStocks near 52-week highs often instill the presumptive “adjustment and anchoring bias” in the minds of investors. This principle works on the belief that investors use the 52-week high price as a reference point and value stocks against this anchor.Many a times, such stocks are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.A few of the stocks remain undervalued due to prolonged under reaction on part of investors despite bullish growth drivers. Meanwhile, news pertaining to robust sales, surging profit levels, bullish earnings prospects and strategic acquisitions can drive stocks.However, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted and the renewed interest might drive stocks beyond the 52-week high bar. Wall Street’s fast paced trading makes it imperative for investors to step in before the market gets a whiff of it.Also, recent academic research reveals that if a stock’s current price is near its 52-week high, there are high chances that it will outperform peers in the subsequent period.  According to researchers George and Hwang, holding 52-week high stocks for six months resulted in an average monthly gain of 0.45% between 1963 and 2001. Encouragingly, this is twice the gain that can be garnered from similar momentum-based strategies.Setting the Right FiltersOur diligent screening technique has been deployed to find 52-week high stocks that hold tremendous potential compared to their respective industries. The added parameters are strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and positive price momentum.These stocks are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, which make us believe that they will continue their rally for quite some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This simply is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range and is likely to touch the 52-week high mark soon.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to their peers.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank = 1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks which are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares that can be traded easily.Here are five of the nine stocks that made it through the screen:ZAGG Inc.

This company’s flagship brand, the invisible SHIELD, is a protective, high-tech patented film covering, designed for iPods, laptops, cell phones, digital cameras, PDAs, watch faces, GPS systems, gaming devices and other items.
