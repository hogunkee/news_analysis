12,NWL,"Newell Brands (NWL) appointed four directors picked by billionaire investor Carl Icahn to its board, the consumer goods company announced Monday.Newell, whose portfolio spans includes Rubbermaid containers and Sunbeam toasters, also will speed up plans for a revamp. The troubled New Jersey-based company is looking to slim down and focus on brands with attractive margins and growth potential.Icahn, who owns about 6.9% of Newell's shares, agreed to vote in favor of Newell's nominees for directors at an upcoming annual meeting. That could help Newell fend off another activist investor. Starboard Value is engaged in a proxy war with Newell, proposing its own director slate. Starboard told shareholders earlier in March that Newell is poorly run.Icahn said Monday the new board will create significant value for shareholders. He also noted that Icahn Enterprises has previously played a similar role at companies such as eBay (EBAY)-PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

A prior bounce off the 50-day early last month yielded a 3% gain.The 13-year-old fund, which tracks the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Index, has amassed $19.9 billion in assets. The biggest sector weightings as of June 30 were consumer cyclical, at nearly 17%, technology at 16%, financial services at 15% and industrials at 13.5%, according to Morningstar Inc.Top holdings included Fiserv (FISV), Newell Brands (NWL) and Western Digital (WDC).

For instance, the top 70% of the market is considered mega-cap, while the next 15% makes up CRSP's midcap universe.It also minimizes turnover by allowing holdings to be shared between two indexes, so a company with a shifting market cap can be moved to the next index in stages, instead of all at once.VO has trailed the S&P 500 this year with a 10.3% gain vs. the benchmark index's 11.7% through Aug. 2. It slightly outpaces the S&P 500 over the past five years, at 14.9% to 14.6%, and for the past 10 years with an 8.3% return vs. 7.9%.Market-cap-weighted indexes usually lead to lower turnover.

IWR also lags the S&P 500 on a YTD basis with an 8.8% gain. It pulls ahead of the benchmark index for the past 10 years (8.2% to 7.9%) and the past 15 years (11.6% to 9.5%).Thursday's picks, First Trust US Equity Opportunities (FPX) and iShares Edge MSCI U.S. Quality Factor (QUAL), have found support at their respective 50-day lines.RELATED:3 Sector Gainers And Losers; 2 Equity Plays Near Buy ZoneWhich 2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Own Nvidia As Top Holding?Dow Holds Up, Oil Reverses Higher; 2 Big-Dividend Plays Near Breakout

If it clears the entry, that would mark its third breakout since late last year with respective 6% and 4% gains in between the flat-base patterns.The $7.5 billion fund, launched in August 2006, tracks the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Value Index. Financial services accounted for VOE's biggest sector weighting as of April 30, at nearly 21% of assets. Consumer cyclicals was next at 19%, technology 12% and utilities 9%.

The $1.04 billion ETF has formed a series of flat bases during the past year.

Macron had set markets surging April 24 with a surprise first-round win over nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, but was heavily favored by polls ahead of Sunday's vote, and markets appeared to have priced in a Macron victory before Friday.But earnings, mergers and company news drove a wide range of dramatic moves Monday.Apple rose 3% in its best session since Feb. 1, taking a new high after regulatory filings showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) had amped up its stake in the stock to $19.2 billion by the end of March, from $7.1 billion at the end of December.In earnings news, Newell Brands (NWL) soared 12% to lead the S&P 500.

The stock was extended at the open, and surged past its June 2015 high to close at a record high. Other China-based internet plays posting strong gains Monday included Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and Bitauto Holdings (BITA).The two biggest losses on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 were also driven by earnings. On the Nasdaq 100, Liberty Global (LBTYA) dropped 8% after reporting preliminary first-quarter results on Sunday. Tyson Foods (TSN) dropped more than 6% to the low end of the S&P 500, after its fiscal second-quarter earnings stopped just short of analysts targets.Mergers news was also a factor, with Kate Spade (KATE) up 8% after agreeing to $2.4 billion takeover by Coach (COH).

20,NWL,"X U.S. stock indexes extended modest losses in late morning trade as the final round of the election in France couldn't deliver the pop the first round results in April offered.The Nasdaq composite slid 0.3% while the S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose in the first 15 minutes of trade, briefly touching a new high before reversing lower. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average trimmed 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was almost even with Friday's pace.The results in the April 23, first round of the French election led to a 4.1% gain April 24, the biggest one-day gain in France's CAC-40 index since August 2012. U.S. markets also enjoyed a boost that day as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose 1.2% and 1.1% in rising volume.The surprise in the first round was tied to Emmanuel Macron's strong showing. Macron's victory Sunday, however, was no surprise. The CAC-40 fell 1%, showing the news was already baked into the price.Blue chips were mostly down early Monday as DuPont (DD) led the losers with a 1.3% drop. On the positive side, Apple (AAPL) climbed 1.6% to a new all-time high. A Drexel Hamilton analyst said that Apple is in the early stages of unlocking its potential and set a 202 price target, roughly 35% above Friday's closing price.In the S&P 500, the morning's biggest loser was Tyson Foods (TSN), which gapped down nearly 6% on an earnings miss. The biggest gainer was Newell Brands (NWL), which gapped up 11.5% after the company beat the consensus view on earnings and sales.RELATED:What Does IBD/TIPP Poll Say About Trump's Tax-Cut Plan?Is Russia, Saudi Arabia Losing Grip On Oil Markets?

21,NWL,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) agreed Thursday to sell its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) for about $900 million, and the retail giant also announced plans to shutter 150 unprofitable Sears and Kmart stores in a bid to streamline the chain.With Sears's department-store business continuing to bleed cash, Chief Executive Edward Lampert has turned to selling and spinning off assets to keep the company operating. The hedge fund manager, who's also the retailer's chairman and largest investor, agreed earlier this week to lend the company $500 million and said last month that affiliates of his firm would offer it a $200 million line of credit.Sears also has been reviewing its DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliance brand for potential sales.""Looking ahead, we will continue to take actions to adjust our capital structure, meet our financial obligations and manage our business to better position Sears Holdings to create long-term value,"" Lampert said in Thursday's statement.Investors cheered the Craftsman sale, sending Sears up as much as 8% before settling back for a 3.7% gain. The stock had slumped 55% last year as the company continued to post losses. Shares of New Britain, Conn.-based Stanley advanced 1.9% in recent action.The Craftsman sale marks Lampert's third move in the last two weeks to prop up the beleaguered retailer with fresh sources of funding. Under terms of the deal, Stanley will pay $525 million at closing and $250 million after three years, the companies said in a statement Thursday. The buyer also will make annual payments on new Craftsman sales for 15 years.Craftsman has been part of Sears since 1927, when the retailer acquired the brand for $500. The tools debuted in the iconic Sears catalog two years later. By the 1940s, the brand benefited from a surge in power-tool sales.Craftsman was eventually offered through other retailers, including Costco Wholesale (COST) and Ace Hardware, but Sears's decline has taken a toll on the brand. Only about 10% of Craftsman-branded products are currently sold outside of Sears, and the agreement allows Stanley to increase Craftsman sales in these untapped channels.Sears will continue to carry Craftsman products at its stores. The license will be royalty-free for 15 years, and then generate 3% afterward.""To accommodate the future growth of Craftsman, we intend to expand our manufacturing footprint in the U.S.,"" Stanley CEO James M. Loree said in the statement. ""This will add jobs in the U.S., where we have increased our manufacturing head count by 40% in the past three years.""The pledge to support U.S. manufacturing comes at a time when President-elect Donald Trump has criticized companies for shifting jobs overseas. Ford Motor (F) canceled a $1.6 billion Mexican expansion earlier this week, saying it would add positions in Michigan instead.The Craftsman deal comes about three months after Stanley agreed to buy Newell Brands (NWL) tools business for $1.95 billion.For Sears, the sale is the latest in a long string of moves designed to generate cash for the ailing retail business. The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based company raised $2.5 billion in 2015 by forming a real estate investment trust that bought more than 250 of its properties.More property sales may be coming. This week's $500 million loan was secured by the company's real estate operations in anticipation that a future sale of some properties could help pay back the debt.It's also been closing poor-performing locations, an effort it continued with Thursday's announcement. The company said it will shut 109 Kmart and 41 Sears stores, and it reiterated its intention to squeeze more money out of its real estate.Lampert also previously spun off the Sears Hometown & Outlet business and Lands' End clothing line.Still, challenges remain. The company needs to raise a total of roughly $1.5 billion to make it through 2017 comfortably, Christina Boni, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, has estimated.

22,NWL,"Newell Brands (NWL) said it will transform into an operating company from a holding company, consolidate its 32 business units to 16 operating divisions and sell a number of its businesses as part of a new strategic plan to ramp up growth and focus its portfolio.Shares of Newell fell 1.2% to close at 51.60 in the stock market today. Newell stock is in a flat base consolidation, but is finding resistance at its 50-day line.The merger of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden, completed in April, prompted the strategic review. Brands in the portfolio include Paper Mate, Sharpie, Elmer's, Mr. Coffee, Calphalon, Graco, Baby Jogger, plus a number of other consumer goods names.Among those up for sale are the ""vast majority"" of its tools business, winter sports gear, its heater, humidifier and fan-making operations, and its consumer storage container business. The for-sale businesses have a total 2015 net sales value of $1.5 billion, said the company in a release.IBD'S TAKE: Newell's stock has been trading below the key 50-day moving averages in recent weeks. Find out why it's important to see how a stock behaves around moving average lines: ""Finding Support Or Hitting Resistance?""""We will drive growth acceleration over time through more effective and scaled commercial operations, increased investment in our brands and capabilities, and the delivery of bigger, better innovation across a broader set of categories,"" Newell Brands Chief Executive Michael Polk said in the release, adding that the company will at the same time expand margins through ""significant cost synergies and other savings"" from the combination of both companies, among other initiatives.Newell said it hopes to complete the sale of these assets in the first half of 2017, with proceeds used to accelerate the pay down of debt.
"
23,NWL,"Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) agreed to buy Newell Brands (NWL) tools business for $1.95 billion in cash to expand in industrial cutting equipment.The sale includes the Irwin, Lenox and Hilmor brands, Newell said in a prepared statement Wednesday. The consumer-products company, which also owns Elmer's glue, Mr. Coffee brewers and Graco baby strollers, will use the proceeds to pay down debt, it said. Stanley Black & Decker said in its own statement that the deal will add 15 cents a share to earnings in the first year after closing.The acquisition will help broaden the reach of Stanley Black & Decker's global tools and storage business, the New Britain, Conn.-based company said. For Newell, the sale is part of an effort to slim down after its blockbuster  merger with Jarden Corp. in April. That deal created a company with $16 billion in sales and pushed Newell into new categories such as sports and outdoor products.The acquisition will lead to annual cost savings of about $80 million to $90 million after three years, Stanley Black & Decker said. The deal should close in the first half of 2017, it said.IBD'S TAKE: Stanley Black & Decker is ranked third in IBD's ""Building-Hand Tools Group."" Trouble is, that sector ranks 174th out 197 groups IBD follows. The best of the lot right now is Toro Co. (TTC) It's composite rating isn't sparkling, at 75, but its earnings rating is 96 out of a possible 99.

104,NWL,"Momentum can shift quickly on Wall Street. A single trend or event sends some stocks or industries tumbling, while others get a shot in the arm and race higher.
"
105,NWL,"Stock groups that fall into the latter category — share prices that have spiked considerably in recent weeks — feature a diverse mix of companies that range from Time Warner (TWX) and Walt Disney (DIS) to FedEx (FDX), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Whirlpool (WHR).
"
106,NWL,"Following are four stock groups that have made big moves over the past few weeks.
"
107,NWL," Freight shippers: An improving economy, combined with falling oil prices, have created a positive operating environment for companies that deliver freight and packages for a living.

"
108,NWL,"FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) are far and away the biggest players in the group and boast IBD Composite Ratings of 94 and 91, respectively, out of a possible 99.
"
109,NWL,"A couple of other stocks also have pretty high ratings: Air T (AIRT), with a Composite Rating of 89; and Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW), with a Composite Rating of 87. Composite Ratings factor in things like earnings growth and stock price gains.
"
110,NWL," Media conglomerates: As recently as 13 weeks ago, IBD's Media-Diversified group languished way down the industry rankings in 157th place. Since then, the group has steadily moved higher and currently ranks No. 12.
"
111,NWL,"In addition to Disney and Time Warner, the group includes media/entertainment heavyweights 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS).
"
112,NWL,"Some stocks in the group have benefited from moves to expand their Internet offerings and build bigger audience bases.
"
113,NWL,"For example, Time Warner's HBO premium channel recently said it will offer streaming-only HBO Go to consumers without cable subscriptions next year to help it compete against Netflix (NFLX). Similarly, CBS recently said it will offer its Showtime premium channel as an online subscription service and CBS News as an advertising-supported online channel
"
114,NWL," Medical supplies: Like the Media-Diversified group, IBD's Medical-Supplies group has made a big move the past few months. Thirteen weeks ago the group ranked No. 164. It has since vaulted to No. 19. The group's shares touched a record high on Monday and have risen 19% since the beginning of October.
"
115,NWL,"Becton Dickinson, the largest stock in the group by market cap, saw its shares spike in October after it announced plans to buy CareFusion (CFN) for around $12 billion. Shares have since moved even higher for Becton, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 91.
"
116,NWL,"Other highly rated stocks in the group include Patterson (PDCO), which has a Composite Rating of 94; and West Pharmaceutical Services (WST), with a Composite Rating of 93.
"
117,NWL," Household appliances: An improving U.S. housing market and economy have helped IBD's Household-Appliances/Wares group move up to No. 21 in the industry rankings from 186th place 26 weeks ago.
"
118,NWL,"Whirlpool is the biggest stock in the group and boasts a Composite Rating of 91. It's been trading at multiyear highs, along with the highly rated Middleby (MIDD) (99 Composite Rating) as well as Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) and Electrolux (ELUXY).Momentum can shift quickly on Wall Street. A single trend or event sends some stocks or industries tumbling, while others get a shot in the arm and race higher.Stock groups that fall into the latter category — share prices that have spiked considerably in recent weeks — feature a diverse mix of companies that range from Time Warner (TWX) and Walt Disney (DIS) to FedEx (FDX), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Whirlpool (WHR).Following are four stock groups that have made big moves over the past few weeks. Freight shippers: An improving economy, combined with falling oil prices, have created a positive operating environment for companies that deliver freight and packages for a living. IBD's Transport-Air Freight group ranks No. 11 out of 197 industries tracked — up from No. 49 four weeks ago and No. 117 as recently as 13 weeks ago.FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) are far and away the biggest players in the group and boast IBD Composite Ratings of 94 and 91, respectively, out of a possible 99.A couple of other stocks also have pretty high ratings: Air T (AIRT), with a Composite Rating of 89; and Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW), with a Composite Rating of 87. Composite Ratings factor in things like earnings growth and stock price gains. Media conglomerates: As recently as 13 weeks ago, IBD's Media-Diversified group languished way down the industry rankings in 157th place. Since then, the group has steadily moved higher and currently ranks No. 12.In addition to Disney and Time Warner, the group includes media/entertainment heavyweights 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS).Some stocks in the group have benefited from moves to expand their Internet offerings and build bigger audience bases.For example, Time Warner's HBO premium channel recently said it will offer streaming-only HBO Go to consumers without cable subscriptions next year to help it compete against Netflix (NFLX). Similarly, CBS recently said it will offer its Showtime premium channel as an online subscription service and CBS News as an advertising-supported online channel Medical supplies: Like the Media-Diversified group, IBD's Medical-Supplies group has made a big move the past few months. Thirteen weeks ago the group ranked No. 164. It has since vaulted to No. 19. The group's shares touched a record high on Monday and have risen 19% since the beginning of October.Becton Dickinson, the largest stock in the group by market cap, saw its shares spike in October after it announced plans to buy CareFusion (CFN) for around $12 billion. Shares have since moved even higher for Becton, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 91.Other highly rated stocks in the group include Patterson (PDCO), which has a Composite Rating of 94; and West Pharmaceutical Services (WST), with a Composite Rating of 93. Household appliances: An improving U.S. housing market and economy have helped IBD's Household-Appliances/Wares group move up to No. 21 in the industry rankings from 186th place 26 weeks ago.Whirlpool is the biggest stock in the group and boasts a Composite Rating of 91. It's been trading at multiyear highs, along with the highly rated Middleby (MIDD) (99 Composite Rating) as well as Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) and Electrolux (ELUXY).

303,NWL,"The Nasdaq composite slipped 1.1%, and the Dow drifted to a 1% loss. The NYSE composite and the S&P 500 each registered 0.9% declines. The Nasdaq's biotech and transportation sectors posted gains, while computers makers, led by Apple's (AAPL) 7% loss, pulled hardest to the downside. On the NYSE, energy-sector issues posted gains while financials had the heaviest losses.
"
304,NWL,"Trading tracked firmly above Tuesday's slightly below average trading levels, up 9% on the NYSE and 18% on the Nasdaq.
"
305,NWL,"Oil hovered little changed, focusing on a possible announcement from OPEC regarding production later in the day, rather than on weekly crude inventories, which rose by a half-million barrels vs. expectations for a near 1-million-barrel decline. Commodities were generally mixed, though gold shot up $33 to above $875 an ounce.
"

"
308,NWL,"On the downside, MWI Veterinary Supply (MWIV) toppled 15% in very fast trading. No particular news seemed to drive the loss, but it did show shares losing a bid to beat resistance at their 50-day moving average.
"
309,NWL,"Overseas, most Asian markets closed moderately higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped the most, notching a 2.2% gain, led by property stocks reacting to Tuesday's fed funds lending rate cut in the U.S.
"
310,NWL,"In Europe and the U.K., modest losses were the theme. Energy and commodities stocks gained on expectations of rising oil prices and a possible production cut from OPEC later today. But banks and financials dragged London's FTSE 100 down 0.7%, Frankfurt's DAX down 1.1% and the CAC-40 in Paris down 0.8%.

"
316,NWL,"Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) gapped down and slumped 6% after lowering guidance and announcing a round of layoffs.

Revenue is slated to fall in the low teens. Newell will also slash up to 1,000 non-manufacturing jobs.

"
326,NWL,"Group mate Goldman Sachs (GS), which reported Tuesday, fell 3%.
"

335,NWL,"Stocks opened lower on Tuesday morning, just one day after markets signaled an intent to bounce back quickly from their worst week in two years. No one should be declaring a bottom just yet, but the sell-off appears to be more so a return of volatility than a market-wide crash—and some investors might need to adjust their strategies accordingly.One method to implement in a volatile market is to avoid companies that are likely to disappoint investors by posting soft earnings results. The busiest stretch of Q4 earnings seasons is already over, but several market-moving reports are still on the horizon.With that said, one of the best ways for investors to elude the possibility of continued volatility over the next few trading periods is to avoid companies that are likely to underperform earnings estimates. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season. Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these weak stocks in order to help them identify the high-risk companies ahead of their upcoming reports.Check them out now:1.       Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report)Pilgrim’s Pride is one of the largest chicken companies in the US, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The company is scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes on Feb. 14. PPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -3.77%.Based on our current consensus estimates, Pilgrim’s Pride is expected to report earnings of $0.53 per share and revenues of $2.56 billion. But the company has witnessed two negative estimate revisions within the past 30 days, and its Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of just $0.51 per share. 2.       Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (HPP  -  Free Report)Hudson Pacific Properties is a full-service, vertically integrated real estate company focused on owning office properties and media and entertainment properties in California. The company is scheduled to release its brand-new quarterly report before the market opens on Feb. 15. HPP is holding a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -0.51%.According to our overall consensus estimates, Hudson Pacific is projected to report earnings of $0.50 per share and revenues of $184.60 million. These results would represent respectable growth of 8.7% and 10.4%, respectively. However, the company’s Most Accurate Estimate has slipped to $0.49 per share recently. 3.       Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report)Newell Brands is a global consumer goods company with a portfolio of well-known brands, including Paper Mate, Sharpie, Dymo, EXPO, Parker, Elmer’s, Coleman, and many more. The company is scheduled to announce its quarterly results before the opening bell on Feb. 16. NWL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -2.22%.Our overall consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $0.69 per share and revenues of $3.72 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of -13.8% and -10.2%, respectively. Newell has also witnessed nine negative estimate revisions within the past 30 days, and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.67 per share. Want more analysis from this author?

336,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, the company reported negative earnings surprise of 6.5%. However, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average of nearly 3%.What to Expect?The big question facing investors is whether this global manufacturer and marketer of consumer and commercial products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 69 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 13.8%.Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteWe note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has witnessed downward revisions in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.72 billion, reflecting a 10.2% decline from the prior-year quarter.However, we note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the past six months. The company’s shares have declined 45.5%, while the industry has dropped 14.3%.Factors at PlayNewell’s solid earnings history reflects the splendid performance of its brand as well as Growth Game Plan, ongoing Project Renewal Program and solid acquisitions. The company has also made significant progress on its Growth Game Plan that targets accelerating growth by simplifying and strengthening the portfolio.Moreover, the company has been keen on the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point-of-sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and cost-savings plans. In a move to accelerate the pace of transformation, the company is looking to exit non-strategic assets, reduce complexity and focus on key consumer-focused brands. This will help improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value, amid a rapidly changing retail backdrop.Under the transformation plan, the company is accelerating the pace by restricting Newell’s portfolio on nine core consumer segments that can garner nearly $11 billion of sales and $2 billion of EBITDA. Further, the company is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in its industrial and commercial product as well as smaller consumer businesses.These strategic alternatives will significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence. Additionally, it will reduce the company’s customer base by 50% and result in consolidation of 80% of global sales on two ERP platforms by the end of 2019.Moreover, the company’s recently reported soft-core sales and margins for 2017 indicate that there are more troubles ahead for the stock. Sales were hurt by the continuation of retailer inventory rebalancing in the United States, while margins suffered due to the negative mix of lower Writing sales and lower fixed cost absorption due to shorter cycle runs on self-manufactured products. Based on the preliminary results, the company lowered projections for 2017 and provided an initial view for 2018.The company now expects core sales growth of nearly 0.8% in 2017, compared with 1.5-2% growth predicted earlier. Normalized earnings per share for 2017 are estimated to be $2.72-$2.76, compared with the previous forecast of $2.80-$2.85.Given the soft 2017 performance and lowered view, we remain skeptical of the outcome in the to-be-reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newell Brands is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Newell Brands has an Earnings ESP of -2.22% and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). This makes any surprise prediction impossible. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks Rank #4 or #5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dillard’s Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.25% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Aaron’s Inc.

337,NWL,"For manufacturers of many traditional consumer staples, the past several years have been a transitionary period. Consumer habits are shifting, product preferences are changing, and companies are responding. But for investors, now might be a good time to avoid these types of companies, including home goods giant Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report).Newell Brands is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Paper Mate, Sharpie, Dymo, EXPO, Parker, Elmer’s, Coleman, Jostens, Marmot, Rawlings, Oster, Sunbeam, FoodSaver, Mr. Coffee, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Graco, Baby Jogger, NUK, Calphalon, Rubbermaid, Contigo, First Alert, Waddington and Yankee Candle.The company recently accelerated its transformation plan, but investors have not responded well to its results so far. The stock has dipped more than 15% over the past month, including a plunge this week on the back of soft preliminary results for the remainder of fiscal 2017. Newell Brands is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Latest OutlookEarlier this week, Newell lowered its projections for fiscal 2017. The company now expects core sales growth of nearly 0.8%, down from the 1.5% to 2% growth predicted earlier. Adjusted earnings are expected to fall in the range of $2.72 per share to $2.76 per share, down from the previous forecast of $2.80 to $2.85.As one would expect, Newell’s lowered guidance has led to a plethora of negative earnings estimate revisions. We have now seen six negative revisions to its full-year estimates within the past week.But this trend has actually extended beyond this timeframe. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current fiscal year has slowly slumped from the $2.83 per share it was at about 90 days ago. Meanwhile, its soft results are having an effect on analyst expectations for the upcoming fiscal year.Our consensus estimate for the company’s next-year earnings has lost 29 cents over the past 90 days, and we are now expecting profits to remain flat year-over-year. Newell is slated to release its latest quarterly results on Feb. 16.Newell’s shaky results have forced management to accelerate its transformation plan and consider new strategic options. The company is aiming to trim its portfolio to nine core consumer segments that can garner nearly $11 billion of sales and $2 billion of EBITDA.Brands to be evaluated in the industrial and commercial product business include Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa. Meanwhile, Newell’s Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S. Playing Cards could be trimmed.These changes will likely lead to better shareholder value down the line. But investors know that transformation plans can be volatile and unpredictable. In the case of Newell, it might be better to sit this one out for now.Better OptionsAs mentioned, the entire consumer staples sector is in a state of flux. Nevertheless, there are a few better options right now. Investors looking for a strong stock in the same industry might consider Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI) or Kimberly-Clark (KMB), which both hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want more analysis from this author?

339,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) has been keen on the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement, and cost-savings plans. In a move to accelerate the pace of transformation, the company is looking to exit non-strategic assets, reduce complexity and focus on key consumer-focused brands. This will help improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value, amid a rapidly changing retail backdrop.Additionally, the company reported soft preliminary results for 2017 and lowered view. Moreover, it outlined the initial expectations for 2018.Consequently, shares of Newell Brands as much as 18.9% since the news. Overall, the stock has declined 37.4% in the last three months, against the industry’s growth of 0.5%.Coming back to the transformation plan, the company is accelerating the pace by restricting Newell’s portfolio on nine core consumer segments that can garner nearly $11 billion of sales and $2 billion of EBITDA. Further, the company is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in its industrial and commercial product as well as smaller consumer businesses.Brands to be evaluated in the industrial and commercial product business include Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa. Meanwhile, the company’s Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S. Playing Cards are other brands chosen for exploring strategic options.The strategic alternatives for these brands will significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence. Additionally, it will reduce the company’s customer base by 50% and result in consolidation of 80% of global sales on two ERP platforms by end of 2019. The completion of these plans will aid in making Newell a nearly $11 billion focused portfolio company with leading consumer-facing brands, attractive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.The company anticipates after tax proceeds from these efforts to be higher than what is required to reach a leverage ratio below the lower-end of the current leverage ratio target range. The company is likely to start the evaluation process immediately with results from the transactions coming by the end of 2019. With this, the company anticipates to be better positioned in the dynamic retail landscape with its leading brands, excellent marketing, innovation and solid e-commerce capabilities.Throwing light on the performance in 2017, the company stated that core sales remained soft due to widening of gap between sell-in and sell-through results driven by continuation of retailer inventory rebalancing in the United States and the bankruptcy of leading baby retailer. Further, the company’s margins were hurt by the negative mix of lower Writing sales and lower fixed cost absorption due to shorter cycle runs on self-manufactured products, designed to reduce inventories and maximize operating cash flow.However, the company remains encouraged by brands performance as well as strength in e-commerce business, which maintained a double-digit growth rate. Further, the company expanded market share while accelerating sell-through growth rates in the United States in the fourth quarter, ahead of the third-quarter levels. This reaffirms the company’s confidence in its brands, design and innovation-driven strategy.Further, the company’s efforts to improve working capital seems to be paying off with nearly $1 billion of operating cash flows generated in the fourth quarter, in spite of increased margin pressure from planned downtime of factories and input cost inflation.Based on the preliminary results, the company lowered projections for 2017 and provided an initial view for 2018. The company now expects core sales growth of nearly 0.8% in 2017, compared with 1.5-2% growth predicted earlier.

This surpassed the company’s prior expectation of $700-$800 million.For 2018, the company expects to record core sales growth driven by continued gain market share gains in its core categories and geographies, partially offset by persistent retailer inventory reductions. The company anticipates normalized earnings per share of $2.65-$2.85. The company assumes tax rate of 20-21% including the benefits of U.S. tax reform.

340,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) looks good driven by its transformation goals, cost-saving programs, shareholder-friendly moves and value-added investments. One major component of Newell’s Growth Game Plan is portfolio management, which is likely to accelerate growth by simplifying and strengthening the company’s portfolio.The cumulative effect of these strategies and actions is well reflected in the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B. Further, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 8.8% highlights its inherent strength.Newell Poised for Growth on Solid Brand PortfolioNewell Brands is a leading name in the home and office products space backed by its solid portfolio of brands including Sharpie, Paper Mate, Dymo, Expo, Waterman, Parker, Irwin, Lenox, Rubbermaid, Graco, Calphalon and Goody. Also, the addition of popular brands like Mr. Coffee machines and Rawlings baseballs after the Jarden acquisition positions it well for future growth.Portfolio Management: A Powerful ToolThe company’s Growth Game Plan not only focuses on simplification of operating structure but also makes prudent investments in higher growth potential areas. As a part of this plan, Newell Brands significantly strengthened its portfolio by completing six acquisitions and divestitures in and just after the end of first-quarter 2017. Acquisitions included the Sistema food storage and the WoodWick fragranced candles businesses while divestitures comprised the tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, and the rope and chain business.Additionally, Newell Brands recently divested its central European baby gear business, Teutonia. The company is also on track with its plan of exiting product lines having an annual sale of $200-$300 million across its combined business with Jarden, over the next two to three years.Cost Savings and InvestmentsNewell remains on track with its Project Renewal Program, which is expected to generate annual cost savings of $700 million by 2017-end or 2018 beginning. The company is currently in the third phase of the plan that focuses on generating cost savings in the areas of procurement. This is to be achieved by reducing complexity of its business and simplifying the manufacturing and distribution processes as well as further overhead reduction.Moreover, the company plans to use a major portion of the savings to accelerate growth by reinvesting in its business while the remaining cost savings are expected to reflect in earnings. The company is poised to generate more than $300 million savings in the year. Also, Newell obtained cost synergies as anticipated with an additional $86 million in the third quarter.Balance Sheet Looks StrongNewell Brands’ financial flexibility enables it to enhance shareholder values and drive future development through value-added investments aimed at accelerating growth and expanding margins. Further, the company’s commitment toward enhancing shareholder value is evident from its robust dividend payment history and share repurchase programs.Thus, the company anticipates growing dividend at par with earnings. Additionally, it approved a new share buyback plan of up to $1 billion, expiring by 2020-end.The company also has $256 million remaining under its current buyback plan, which is now extended til 2020.Bottom LineWhile all seems well with this company, the recent effects of the Hurricane Harvey on its results and strained margins cannot be ignored. Also, the company’s lowered outlook for 2017 indicates troubles for the company in the near-term. Consequently, the stock has plunged 26.1% in the past three months wider than the industry’s decline of 3.4%.  Though these troubles seem temporary and are slated to impact near-term performance, we believe the company is well poised for growth in the longer term driven by the aforementioned strategies and cost saving initiatives.Do Consumer Products Stocks Grab Your Attention?

341,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report), once an investors’ favorite, has lost its shine following dismal third-quarter 2017 results and lowered its outlook for the year. Also, it has been witnessing strained margins for a while now. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved south as the analysts were disappointed on the stock.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 27.3% following its third-quarter results on Nov 2. In the past three months, the stock has plunged 37.4%, significantly wider than the industry’s decline of 10.5%. The downturn was due to the after-effects of Hurricane Harvey that resulted in increased inflationary pressure owing to low resins’ supply. Further, a Growth Score of F confirms the weakness in the stock.Deeper AnalysisQ3 & Negative Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 has declined to 75 cents and $2.81, respectively, over the past 30 days. This follows Newell Brands’ dismal performance in the third quarter, which marked its first earnings miss in more than three years. Also, sales lagged estimates after two straight beats.Results were below the company’s expectations and were hurt by soft late-quarter sales with respect to retailer inventory rebalancing, mainly related to the decelerated market growth, in the United States through the Back-to-School period. As a result, markets were weak across various categories. Though its bottom line improved 10.3% year over year, management slashed its outlook for 2017, marking the second guidance cut in three months. (Read: Newell Misses Q3 Earnings & Sales, Lowers '17 Outlook)Newell Brands now expects normalized earnings per share in the range of $2.80-$2.85, down from $2.95-$3.05, projected earlier. Also, in September, the company had trimmed its earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressure due to low resins’ supply owing to impacts from the Harvey.Other ConcernsNewell Brands has been witnessing weak margins for the last few quarters now. Despite gains from cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, the absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix and increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment weighed on margins in the third quarter.Apparently, the company’s gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) in the third quarter, while operating margin declined 40 bps. In the first and second quarters of 2017, Newell’s gross margin had declined 410 bps and 20 bps, respectively. While operating margin soared in the preceding quarter, it recorded a 250 bps decline in the first quarter.Additionally, Newell Brands faces intense competition from numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products. This might dent the company’s operating performance and overall profitability.Newell Brands Vs IndustryBottom LineThough Newell Brands is on track to attain its transformation goals through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and Project Renewal Program, the turnaround might take some time.Meanwhile, you can count upon some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Staples space that also witnessed positive estimate revisions recently.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) consensus mark for 2017 and 2018 has moved up by 29 cents per share and 15 cents to $6.08 and $6.15, respectively, in the last 30 days.

This cosmetic giant also flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and 2017 have increased by a penny to 12 cents and 2 cents to 66 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

342,NWL,"Investors in Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15th 2017 $55.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Newell Brands, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Newell Brands is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Consumer Products - Staples industry that ranks in the Bottom 8% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 88 cents per share to 75 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Newell Brands right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

343,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company’s top line declined year over year. Consequently, management lowered its outlook for 2017.Consequently, Newell’s shares declined 10.5% in the pre-market trading session. The stock was down 39.1% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 9%.Results were below the company’s expectations and were hurt by soft late-quarter sales with respect to retailer inventory rebalancing, mainly related to the decelerated market growth, in the United States through the Back-to-School period. As a result, markets were weaker across various categories.Q3 HighlightsNewell’s normalized earnings of 86 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents in the third quarter but improved 10.3% year over year from 78 cents in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by modest core sales improvement, the ongoing cost savings and related synergies, Project Renewal, acquisitions along with a more favorable tax rate. However, these were somewhat mitigated by the lost earnings from divested businesses, adverse product mix, commodity cost inflation, higher advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment coupled with a greater share count.On a reported basis, including one-time items, the company recorded earnings of 48 cents per share compared with 38 cents a year ago.Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteNet sales dropped 7% to $3,678.2 million in the quarter, also missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,702 million. This represents a net adverse impact of 770 basis points (bps) from acquisitions and divestitures.Core sales increased 0.4%, driven by solid performance by Baby and Food businesses within the Live segment, Waddington as well as Consumer and Commercial business within the Work segment, Team Sports and Fishing in the Play segment.Segmental Performance Live net sales increased 2.3% year over year to $1483.3 million while core sales improved 0.6%. The uptick was backed by solid results in the Baby and Food businesses, substantially offset by soft results from Appliances and Cookware.Net sales in the Learn segment edged up 0.7% to $642 million while core sales were up 0.5%, on the back of modest improvement in all its divisions.Work net sales rose 1.6% to $738 million while core sales improved 1.9%, owing to persistent growth on Waddington as well as robust results from the Consumer and Commercial business.Sales at the Play segment increased 2.4% to $611 million while core sales advanced 2.3%, driven by growth across all the divisions along with solid growth in Team Sports and Fishing.Net sales at the Other segment plunged 62.4% to $204 million, primarily due to the divestitures of the Tools, Winter Sports, Fire Starter as well as Fire Log and Cordage businesses. Further, core sales decreased 10.6% owing to soft Process Solutions business.MarginsNewell’s normalized gross margin contracted 100 bps to 35% as cost synergies and savings gains were more than negated by adverse mix as well as higher commodity cost inflation.Normalized operating income fell roughly 9.5% to $551 million. Normalized operating income margin also declined 40 bps to 15%. Gains from synergies and Project Renewal savings were higher than compensated with the absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix and increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment.Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $792.3, long-term debt of $10,184.4 million and total shareholders’ equity of $12,770 million.

Under the revised plan, Newell is authorized to buyback up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares through 2020-end. Still the company had $256 million left under its current $500 million share buyback plan. Earlier, the existing plan was expected to expire at the end of 2017 but now it is extended through the end of 2020.OutlookNewell is on track to attain its transformation initiatives. In fact, market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement, along with cost-savings plans are expected to drive growth. Further, it continued to obtain cost synergies as anticipated, with an additional $86 million in the quarter.However, management trimmed its guidance for 2017. Newell now expects normalized earnings per share in the range of $2.80-$2.85, down from $2.95-$3.05, projected earlier. In September, the company had trimmed its earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressure due to low resins’ supply owing to impacts from the Hurricane Harvey.Further, the company expects net sales for 2017 in the band of $14.7-$14.8 billion, reflecting 11.3-11.8% improvement from prior-year quarter. Moreover, core sales growth is anticipated in a range of 1.5-2%. However, the company had earlier maintained its net sales and core sales guidance.

344,NWL,"Following the heaviest inflow of Q3 earnings reports of the entire quarter yesterday after the closing bell, we see new economic data reads and news from across the pond. There will also be a long-awaited unveiling of the GOP tax reform plan today. And this is all aside from a new group of Q3 earnings reports coming out before the opening bell this morning.Initial Jobless Claims fell again, to 229K last week from a slightly upwardly revised 234K the previous week. Continuing claims have sunk to multi-quarter lows beneath 1.9 million to 1.884 million specifically. This is more positive news, following yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) strong 235K new private-sector jobs results for October. Tomorrow’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report is expected to bring in north of 300K new jobs last month. All of these numbers speak to an unwaveringly strong U.S. labor market.Productivity and Labor Costs reads were also released early today. Preliminary productivity hit 3.0%, a bit higher than the 2.8% analysts had been expecting. The last time this metric registered this high was back in 2014. Labor costs were close to in-line with expectations at 0.5%, following a 0.3% read last time around. A surge in productivity with slight wage increases would seem to be music to the ears of economists and market participants alike; solid growth without unruly inflation creating headwinds is likely as Goldilocks as it gets.Which brings us to the tax reform proposal key to the Republican-run Congress today and its success in next year’s mid-term elections, and my question is one that is almost never asked by market analysts these days: with 3% growth, still-cheap borrowing costs and solid employment numbers, what do we need a tax cut for?These types of measures are typically used to pry an economy out of being stuck in the mud; if we’re already at or near our goals currently, wouldn’t a tax cut at this stage be simply borrowing against future gains, with the possible additional problems of blowing a hole the the national deficit, which would create longer-term economic issues?This aside for now, the Bank of England today has decided to ratchet up its interest rates 0.5%, amounting to its first rate hike in 10 years. This announcement comes as inflation in the U.K. remains at 3% while economic growth is slowing, not speeding up.The Bank also stayed pat with an asset buyback program worth U.S. $574 million. It’s far from a typical move for a central bank to raise rates while the country’s economy slows; starting new businesses, obtaining mortgages, etc. will now be more difficult. Perhaps the logic is that giving commercial and investment bank in England a leg up will spur the economy indirectly in the months ahead.Q3 Earnings RoundupWe will hear from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) after the closing bell. Yesterday afternoon we saw a big beat from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) augmented by remarks from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that security measures will add to costs at the social media leader at the expense of future profits. Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), on the other hand, missed expectations on a Model 3 “bottleneck,” but future projections for auto deliveries in 2018 remained hopefully robust.Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) shares have tumbled more than 20% this morning following its disappointing Q3 earnings results, where by the consumer plastics maker missed the 92 cent Zacks consensus and posted just 86 cents per share. This was still 10% growth year over year. Revenues in the quarter narrowly missed the 3.7 billion expected, and the company lowered earnings estimates for full-year 2017.Global quick-service restaurant major Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat estimates by 2 cents per share to 68 cents in its most recent quarter, with $1.44 billion in revenues topping the $1.40 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Comps at KFC of +4% assisted the positive results in the quarter. Shares are trading up 2% in today’s pre-market.Hyatt Hotels (H  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations greatly on the bottom line, posting earnings of 26 cents per share compared with the 17 cents expected. Revenues of $1.12 billion topped the $1.09 billion we had been looking for. RevPAR rose 1.6% quarter over quarter, slightly offset by adjusted EBITDA down year over year.

345,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, November 2nd, before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings surprise of 1.2%. Notably, in three of the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average of 6.3%.What to Expect?The big question facing investors is whether this global manufacturer and marketer of consumer and commercial products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 92 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17.4%.We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has witnessed upward revisions in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $370 billion, reflecting a 6.3% decline from the prior-year quarter.Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteHowever, we note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months. The company’s shares have declined 22.9%, while the industry has dropped 9.6%.Factors at PlayNewell’s superb earnings history reflects the splendid performance of its brand as well as Growth Game Plan, ongoing Project Renewal Program and solid acquisitions. The company has also made significant progress on its Growth Game Plan that targets accelerating growth by simplifying and strengthening portfolio.However, the company recently revealed that the third quarter was adversely impacted by the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey. The effects of Harvey disrupted huge parts of the U.S. resin manufacturing supply chain, significantly raising operating costs. Further, management stated that most of the resin suppliers along with facilities in Texas and Louisiana have declared force majeure, since Harvey’s landfall on Aug 25. In fact, many of these facilities remained closed for more than a week. This caused increased inflationary pressure stemming from lower resin supply.Moreover, these resin supply issues and higher inflation are likely to persist through the rest of 2017 and in to 2018. Consequently, the company trimmed earnings guidance for 2017. It now envisions normalized earnings in the band of $2.95-$3.05 per share versus $3.00-$3.20 projected earlier.While Newell Brands is working with its global suppliers to discover other sources of resin, this action exceeds the pre-determined costs targets substantially. Though the company plans to continue investing in strategic capacities and brands to aid market share growth, it is likely to witness temporary margin contractions in comparison with 2017 plan.Given the impact of Harvey on the company’s operations, we remain a little skeptical of the outcome in the to-be reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newell Brands is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Newell Brands has an Earnings ESP of +1.17% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 93 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. However, this combined with the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.14% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.

347,NWL,"Consumer goods behemoth Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) appears to be in bad shape. Despite having an impressive earnings surprise history and known for solid strategic initiatives, Newell has seen its shares slump 19.4% in the past three months. In fact, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company performed worse than the  industry that fell 9.8% in the said time frame.So, let’s take a look at what went wrong with Newell and where the company is headed.Hurricane Harvey Poses ThreatsNewell Brands recently revealed that the company’s third quarter was adversely impacted by the deadly Hurricane Harvey. Incidentally, the effects of Harvey significantly disrupted huge parts of the United States’ resin manufacturing supply chain, significantly raising operating costs. Further, management stated that most of the resin suppliers along with facilities in Texas and Louisiana have declared force majeure, since Harvey’s landfall on Aug 25. In fact, many of these facilities remained closed for more than a week. This caused increased inflationary pressure stemming from lower resin supply. Also, these resin supply issues and higher inflation are likely to persist through the rest of 2017 and in to 2018, which remains a concern.Trimmed Outlook Weighs Upon the Stock, Estimates Roll DownOwing to these factors and likelihood of the hurdles to persist, Newell Brands lowered its earnings per share outlook for 2017. Now, the normalized earnings are envisioned in the band of $2.95-$3.05 per share versus $3.00-$3.20, anticipated during first-quarter 2017 conference call. While Newell Brands is working with its global suppliers to discover other sources of resin, this action exceeds the pre-determined costs targets substantially. Also, though the company plans to continue investing in strategic capacities and brands to aid market share growth, it is likely to witness temporary margin contractions in comparison with 2017 plan.Newell Brands Inc. Price and Consensus  Newell Brands Inc. Price and Consensus | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteAs expected, this was followed by a downtrend in Newell Brands’ estimates. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and 2017 have dropped from 97 cents to 91 cents and from $3.12 to $3.00, respectively in the past 30 days.Changing Consumer Demands & Competition Remain ConcernsOperating in a consumer-driven space, Newell Brands remains vulnerable to consumers’ evolving preferences. Further, the company faces intense competition from other major players on grounds of pricing and product innovation, which remains a threat to its market share. Apart from this, Newell Brands remains prone to industry headwinds like consumers’ shift to e-commerce and major competition stemming from Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance.While Newell Brands remains strongly committed toward its long-term strategies like its Project Renewal Program and efficient portfolio management, the aforementioned hurdles keep us skeptical — at least for the near term.Nervous About Newell?

348,NWL,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  reduced its earnings forecast for 2017 owing to a default by a resin supplier to its operations in Mexico.Dr Pepper expects the default by the resin supplier to affect its 2017 operating income by approximately $7-$9 million, or 3 cents per share, the impact of which will be felt most in the third quarter of 2017.The company slashed its 2017 earnings guidance to $4.53-$4.63 per share, from $4.56-$4.66 anticipated earlier. Analysts polled by Zacks expect earnings of $4.65 per share for 2017, reflecting a 5.8% increase from a year ago.  Nevertheless, Dr Pepper took care of its resin requirements and expects to write-off certain prepaid resin inventory. However, management has not commented on any change in its sales and volume expectation. As specified earlier, net sales growth of 4.5% and total volume growth of around 2% is anticipated for 2017.Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc QuoteApart from this default, the disastrous effect of the recent hurricanes in the United States and the earthquake in Mexico also impacted Dr Pepper’s operations. However, the company did not specify the impact of such calamities on its operating results.In addition to these aforementioned troubles, weak carbonated beverages volume trends and persistent pressure from adverse foreign currency movement raise caution. Foreign currency headwind is expected to affect core EPS by 4 cents in 2017, primarily because of the Mexican peso. Again, foreign currency translation is likely to reduce overall 2017 revenues growth by approximately 1%.Though the default at Dr Pepper’s supplier's resin plant was not due to the impact of the recent hurricanes, it is to be noted that the effects of Harvey have significantly disrupted most of United States’ resin manufacturing supply chain, significantly raising operating costs.  These resin supply issues and increased inflation are likely to persist through the rest of 2017 and in to 2018. Recently, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) trimmed its earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressures due to low resins’ supply owing to impacts from the recent hurricanes.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDr Pepper currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector are Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.

349,NWL,"Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas, dumping more than 50 inches of rain — a record high from a single tropical storm. Texas Governor Greg Abbott estimated the damage at $150 billion to $180 billion, eclipsing the previous Hurricanes, Katrina or Sandy. The devastating storm also had an adverse impact on the plastics industry as the Gulf Coast is the epicenter of the U.S. specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry that provide the building blocks for plastic products. Harvey Crippled the Foundation of Packaging Industry Texas accounts for about 70% of U.S. production of ethylene — one of the most important chemicals used for producing plastics. Ethylene is a basic ingredient for final products ranging from plastic bottles to tires to polyester fabric. Industrial ethylene is derived from petroleum or natural gas, and many chemical plants producing ethylene are located near the Gulf Coast’s concentration of petroleum facilities. Hurricane Harvey has led to the shutdown of around 37% of U.S. production capacity for ethylene, which includes 55% of capacity in Texas. Producers such as The Dow Chemical Company , ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), Chevron Phillips Chemical, among others have shut or cut back ethylene production. These disruptions have affected 37% of U.S. capacity for making chlorine and caustic soda, salt-derived chemicals used to make vinyl and PVC pipe. Consequently, a critical part of the supply chain for the industry has been paralyzed with petrochemical plants not in operation and the rail companies that ship them still restoring service. This situation has led to supply shortages and consequently higher prices for U.S. manufacturers. Raw Material Supply at Stake, Costs To RiseIt will likely take months to resume normalcy. In the meantime, prices for raw materials for plastics are already beginning to rise. The more material impact for the plastic packagers from Harvey will be on resin prices, since the Gulf supplies around 70-75% of the resin in the United States. This could weigh on earnings for the plastic stocks in the next few quarters. In line with this, Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) trimmed earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressures due to low resins’ supply. Nearly all of Newell’s resin suppliers with facilities in Texas and Louisiana have declared force majeure, with many facilities shut for more than a week and some still not operating. The company expects the impact to persist through fourth-quarter 2017 as well as resin inflation to build through the remainder of 2017 and in to 2018. Likewise, Greif, Inc. (GEF  -  Free Report) slashed fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to factor in $2.5-million headwind impact related to Hurricane Harvey. Performance and Zacks Industry RankYear to date, the Zacks Containers – Paper and Packaging industry has underperformed the S&P 500. The industry has clocked a gain of 11.5%, lagging the S&P 500’s increase of 16.5%.  We have 265 industries in our Zacks Coverage Universe, which we put into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).

Further, the stock is supported by a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.9% and a VGM Score of B, which justifies its growth prospects. These factors have aided the company to retain a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Harvey to Erode Profits – Guidance TrimmedHowever, the company’s stock performance recently witnessed a setback due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in lower resin supplies. The effects of Harvey significantly disrupted huge parts of the United States’ resin manufacturing supply chain, significantly raising operating costs. Further, management stated that most of the resin suppliers along with facilities in Texas and Louisiana have declared force majeure, since Harvey’s landfall on Aug 25. In fact, many of these facilities remained closed for more than a week.Evidently, the devastating effects of Harvey have weighed upon the company’s third quarter. Further, these resin supply issues and increased inflation is likely to persist through the rest of 2017 and in 2018. Consequently, the company trimmed earnings guidance for 2017. It now envisions normalized earnings in the band of $2.95-$3.05 per share versus $3.00-$3.20 projected earlier.Stock SuffersNotably, shares of this global manufacturer and marketer of consumer and commercial products declined 12.1% in the past month, underperforming the industry’s fall of 4.5%. Looking closer, the company’s stock fell 6.4% since lowering earnings view on Sep 6.Newell Making Efforts to Revive SuppliesNonetheless, Newell Brands is working together with its global suppliers to discover other sources of resin, though this action exceeds the pre-determined costs targets, substantially. Going forward, the company is also likely to continue investing in strategic capacities and brands to aid market share growth, albeit witnessing temporary margin contractions in comparison with 2017 plan.Long-Term Strategies Still Look PromisingPortfolio Management: As part of Growth Game Plan, Newell remains not only focused on simplifying operating structure, but also making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. In first-quarter 2017, the company made significant progress strengthening portfolio by completing six transactions in and just after the end of the quarter. The company completed two acquisitions including the Sistema food storage business and the WoodWick fragranced candles business, while divesting four businesses, namely tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, and the rope and chain business.Further, the company has an agreement in place to divest Teutonia, its central European baby gear business. Notably, the company is on track with its plan of exiting product lines with annual sales of $200-$300 million across its combined business with Jarden, over the next two to three years.Most recently, the company agreed to acquire Chesapeake Bay Candle in a deal worth $75 million. The transaction is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2017 and will enhance its candles business.Project Renewal Program: Newell’s Project Renewal Program remains on track, and it expects annual cost savings from this program to achieve $700 million by 2017 end or 2018 beginning. The company intends to use a major portion of the savings to accelerate growth by investing the same in business, while the remaining cost savings are expected to reflect in earnings. Evidently, the company delivered more than $80 million of incremental cost savings in the most recent quarter, which reflects year-to-date savings of $198 million. Notably, it remains on track to generate over $300 million savings for the year.Bottom LineDespite the headwinds concerning resin supply, Newell is expected to continue delivering growth on the back of savings and acquisition related initiatives.

353,NWL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.9% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Newell Tops Q2 Earnings & Sales, Raises Top-Line ViewNewell Brands reported second-quarter 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines surpassed estimates and improved year over year. Further, the company raised sales guidance for 2017, while retaining other forecasts for the year.Newell’s normalized earnings of 87 cents per share in the second quarter came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents, and grew 11.5% year over year from 78 cents in the prior-year quarter. Growth was driven by improved sales and operating profitability, partly negated by higher shares outstanding. Further, results gained from the company’s ongoing cost savings and related synergies. On a reported basis, including one-time items, the company recorded earnings of 46 cents per share, compared with prior-year earnings of 30 cents. Earnings benefited from core sales growth, Project Renewal savings, cost synergies, the lack of negative inventory acceleration impact associated with the Jarden acquisition (acquired in April 2016) and contributions from acquisitions.Net sales advanced 5.1% to $4,054.6 million in the quarter, also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,959 million. The uptick can mainly be attributed to solid core sales growth, full-quarter contributions from Jarden, and the Sistema and WoodWick buys. However, this was partly offset by the sale of the company’s Tools, Decor, Fire Starter and Fire Log, Teutonia and Cordage businesses.Core sales jumped 2.5%, driven by solid performance by Baby within the Live segment; Writing within the Learn segment; Work segment’s Waddington; Team Sports in the Play segment. Further, the company witnessed core sales growth in all four regions.Segmental PerformanceLive net sales increased 13.8% year over year to $1,277.6 million, while pro forma core sales increased 0.2%. The increase was backed by solid results in the Baby, Appliances and Home Fragrance businesses, offset by softness in Cookware and Fresh Preserving.Net sales in the Learn segment advanced 10.9% to $1,011.4 million, while pro forma core sales were up 6.6% driven by strength in Writing category.Work net sales surged 14.1% to $737.7 million, while pro forma core sales improved 6.3% mainly owing to broad-based growth across all divisions, led by Waddington.Sales for the Play segment increased 14.2% to $782 million while pro forma core sales dipped 1.2%. The decline is accountable to fall in Fishing related to broad retail inventory destocking across specialty and mass retailers, alongside the negative impact of a key retail customer bankruptcy. This was partly mitigated by strength in Beverages, Coolers and Team Sports.Net sales for the Other segment declined 50% to $245.9 million due to the sale of Tools, Decor, Fire Starter and Fire Log, and Cordage businesses. Pro forma core sales also dipped 2.1% as weak Home & Family results overshadowed the modest improvement in Process Solutions.MarginsNewell’s normalized gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 37% as cost synergies and savings gains were more than negated by adverse mix effects of the Jarden acquisition and the sale of Tools business.Normalized operating income soared roughly 13.8% to $692 million. Normalized operating income margin expanded 130 bps to 17.1%. Apart from the aforementioned gross margin factors, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings to overheads benefited operating margins. However, this was offset by higher investments related to eCommerce, brand development and insights.Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $780.2, long-term debt of $10,172.8 million, and shareholders’ equity of $12,244.4 million. In the first half of 2017, the company used $241 million cash in operating activities.Other DevelopmentsAs part of its strategy to accelerate growth by simplifying and strengthening its portfolio, Newell Brands concluded the sale of its Winter Sports business to ohlberg & Company, L.L.C, in July 2017. As part of the sale, it divested brands including Völkl, K2, Marker, Dalbello, Madshus, Line, Full Tilt, Atlas, Tubbs, Ride and BCA. The company had agreed to gross proceeds of $240 million from the sale.OutlookGoing forward, management expects core sales to expand in the second half backed by new distribution gains, a strong pipeline of innovations in the second-half and sustained double digit growth in eCommerce. Further, Newell remains confident of opportunities to create long-term value to deliver solid growth and margin expansion. Moreover, the company anticipates strong operating cash flows that will aid in delivering its leverage ratio targets ahead of time.That said, the company raised its sales guidance for 2017, while keeping the other forecasts intact.Newell now expects net sales for 2017 in the range of $14.8–$15 billion, reflecting 11.5–13% growth compared with $13.26 billion reported in 2016. Earlier, the company had forecasted sales of $14.52–$14.72 billion, reflecting 9.5–11% year-over-year growth. The revised net sales forecast is based on the timing of divestitures and foreign currency effects.However, the company continues to anticipate core sales growth in a range of 2.5–4%. Normalized earnings per share are expected in the range of $3.00– $3.20. The company expects full-year tax rate in the range of 22–23%, due to a one-time very low tax rate anticipated in third-quarter 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

The increase was backed by solid results in the Baby, Appliances and Home Fragrance businesses, offset by softness in Cookware and Fresh Preserving.Net sales in the Learn segment advanced 10.9% to $1,011.4 million, while pro forma core sales were up 6.6% driven by strength in Writing category.Work net sales surged 14.1% to $737.7 million, while pro forma core sales improved 6.3% mainly due to broad-based growth across all divisions, led by Waddington.Sales for the Play segment increased 14.2% to $782 million, with pro forma core sales dipped 1.2%. The decline is accountable to fall in Fishing related to broad retail inventory destocking across specialty and mass retailers, alongside the negative impact of a key retail customer bankruptcy. This was partly mitigated by strength in Beverages, Coolers and Team Sports.Net sales for the Other segment declined 50% to $245.9 million on the back of the sale of Tools, Decor, Fire Starter and Fire Log, and Cordage businesses. Pro forma core sales dipped 2.1% as weak Home & Family results overshadowed the modest improvement in Process Solutions.MarginsNewell’s normalized gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 37% as cost synergies and savings gains were more than negated by adverse mix effects of the Jarden acquisition and the sale of Tools business.Normalized operating income soared roughly 13.8% to $692 million. Normalized operating income margin expanded 130 bps to 17.1%. Apart from the aforementioned gross margin factors, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings to overheads benefited operating margins. However, this was offset by higher investments related to eCommerce, brand development and insights.Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $780.2, long-term debt of $10,172.8 million, and shareholders’ equity of $12,244.4 million. In first-half 2017, the company used $241 million cash in operating activities.Other DevelopmentsAs part of its strategy to accelerate growth by simplifying and strengthening its portfolio, Archer Daniels concluded the sale of its Winter Sports business to ohlberg & Company, L.L.C, in Jul 2017. As part of the sale, it divested brands including Völkl, K2, Marker, Dalbello, Madshus, Line, Full Tilt, Atlas, Tubbs, Ride and BCA. The company had agreed to gross proceeds of$240 million from the sale.OutlookLooking ahead, management expects core sales to expand in the second half backed by new distribution gains, a strong pipeline of innovations in the second-half and sustained double digit growth in eCommerce. Further, the company remains confident of opportunities to create long-term value to deliver solid growth and margin expansion. Moreover, the company anticipates strong operating cash flows that will aid in delivering its leverage ratio targets ahead of time.That said, the company raised its sales guidance for 2017, while keeping the other forecasts intact.Newell now expects net sales for 2017 in the range of $14.8–$15 billion, reflecting 11.5–13% growth from $13.26 billion reported in 2016. Earlier, the company had forecasted sales of $14.52–$14.72 billion, reflecting 9.5–11% year over year growth. The revised net sales forecast is based on the timing of divestitures and foreign currency effects.However, the company continues to anticipate core sales growth in a range of 2.5–4%. Normalized earnings per share are expected in the range of $3.00– $3.20. The company expects full year tax rate in the range of 22–23%, due to a one-time very low tax rate anticipated in third-quarter 2017.Stocks to ConsiderNewell Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

357,NWL,"Achieving growth is exceptionally challenging in today’s fast-changing operating environment. Hence, the companies have to step up marketing efforts over digital platforms and become more professional about sales management to drive their top line.Technological evolvement further emphasizes the importance of sales and the need for the companies to apply the correct strategies and provide the right services to increase their sales.Sales growth is a vital metric for any company as it is an important part of growth projections and influential in strategic decision making. So, sales should get more attention from investors in the investment process, as a healthy growth rate is usually a positive investment indicator.Also, in cases where companies incur a loss on a temporary basis owing to short-term situations like product development stage, new entrant in a high-growth industry or paying higher taxes, they are valued based on revenues and not on earnings. This is because sales growth (or decline) is usually an early indicator of the company’s future earnings performance.However, sales growth alone doesn’t reveal too much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily translate into profits.Therefore, consideration of a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Teradyne, Inc. (TER  -  Free Report) designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports automatic test equipment. This North Reading, MA-based company currently has long-term expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 10% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.  Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report), based in St. Petersburg, FL, is engaged in the underwriting, distribution, trading, and brokerage of equity and debt securities, and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products. It has long-term expected EPS growth rate of 17%. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Chicago, IL, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) provides risk and information solutions.

358,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 4, before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings surprise of 17.2%. Notably, in three of the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.7%.What to Expect?The big question facing investors is whether this global manufacturer and marketer of consumer and commercial products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 86 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed upward revisions in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,959 million, compared with $3,859 million reported in the prior-year quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past three months. The company’s shares have jumped 13.2%, while the industry has declined 3.2%.Factors Influencing This QuarterNewell’s superb earnings history reflects the splendid performance of its brand as well as Growth Game Plan, ongoing Project Renewal Program and solid acquisitions. The company has also made significant progress on its Growth Game Plan that targets accelerating growth by simplifying and strengthening portfolio.The company’s results in the second quarter are expected to be driven by core sales growth, Project Renewal savings and cost synergies. Further, it remains impressed with global growth and progress with e-commerce advancement. Moreover, the company earlier raised adjusted earnings outlook for 2017, while keeping the other forecasts intact. The raised earnings view reflects the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, and currency impacts. Normalized earnings per share for 2017 are anticipated in the range of $3.00–$3.20, compared with $2.95−$3.15 guided earlier.In first-quarter 2017, Newell made significant progress strengthening portfolio by completing six transactions in and just after the end of the quarter. The company completed two acquisitions including the Sistema food storage business and the WoodWick fragranced candles business, while divesting four businesses, namely tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, as well as the rope and chain business.However, the company’s significant global presence exposes it to currency woes. Moreover, intense competition and volatile consumer behavior remain the major threats, given its consumer-focused nature.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newell Brands is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Newell Brands has an Earnings ESP of +0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

359,NWL,"Consumer products giant Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) posted weaker-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, probably due to softness in North America. Concurrent to the weak second-quarter results, the company anticipates soft earnings guidance for full year.Adjusted earnings of $1.49 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 by 0.7% and year-ago adjusted results of $1.53 by 2.6%. Despite higher cost savings, earnings suffered due to lower sales and higher cost inflation.Quarter in DetailThe company reported sales of $4.55 billion in the second quarter. Sales marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.56 billion by 0.2% and declined 1% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, currency did not impact second-quarter sales results.Organic sales declined 1% from the prior-year quarter due to lower net selling prices. Softness in North American consumer products, higher competitive activity and less promotion shipments led to an organic sales decline of 2% in North America. Organic sales also declined 3% in developed markets outside North America. However, it increased 2% in developing and emerging markets in the quarter.We note that apart from sluggishness in North America, Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets over the last few quarters. We note that the company posted organic sales growth of 5% in each of the first and second quarters of 2016, which decelerated to 3% in the third quarter. Though it showed some improvement in fourth-quarter 2016 with organic sales growth of 4%, it remained flat in first-quarter 2017 and improved just 2% in second-quarter 2017.Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in these markets, the company expects only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in 2017, particularly in the second half of 2017.Operating profit in second-quarter 2017 declined 4.7% to $799 million. It was mainly impacted by lower sales and higher input costs of $75 million in the quarter due to increases in raw materials (mainly pulp). Nevertheless, the company generated $120 million of cost savings from the FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) program during the quarter.Share Price MovementKimberly-Clark’s shares have been underperforming the industry for the last one year. The stock has declined 6.4% in comparison to the industry’s decline of just 0.9%. Notably, the industry is part of the top 10% of the Zacks Classified industries (26 out of the 265).Segment DetailsPersonal Care Products:The segment includes products like disposable diapers, training/ youth/swim pants, baby wipes, feminine and incontinence care products.Segment sales of $2.3 billion declined marginally in the quarter as improved product mix was offset by lower selling prices. Sales improved in developing and emerging markets, but declined in two other regions of North America and developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit improved 3% to $467 million in the quarter driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and input cost inflation.Consumer Tissue:The segment includes bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins and related products for household use.Segment sales dropped 2% to $1.5 billion in second-quarter 2017 owing to lower volumes and average selling prices. Sales improved in developing and emerging markets but declined in two other regions of North America and developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit declined 12% to $241 million in the quarter, as lower sales, higher cost inflation and other manufacturing costs more than offset the benefits from cost savings and lower marketing spending.K-C Professional (KCP) & Other:The segment consists of facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins, wipers and a range of safety products.Segment sales grew marginally to $0.8 billion in the second quarter. Growth in volumes and improved product mix was offset by lower selling prices. Sales improved in North America and developing and emerging markets but it declined in developed markets outside North America.Segment operating profit surged 9% to $163 million, gaining from cost savings, lower manufacturing costs and reduced marketing, research and general spending, partially offset by input cost inflation.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteOther Financial UpdateCash and cash equivalents were $1.05 billion as of Jun 30, 2017. Capital expenditure was $171 million. Cash provided by operations in second-quarter 2017 was $825 million. Long-term debt was $6.8 billion.In the second quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares at a total cost of $300 pursuant to a share repurchase program.Guidance for 2017The company has revised its earnings guidance for 2017 in view of weak second quarter result. It now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20–$6.35.Net sales and organic sales in 2017 are expected to be similar or slightly up from the previous estimate of 1 to 2% growth, for both sales and organic sales driven by higher volumes. Input cost inflation are expected to be higher in the range of $200–$300 million as compared with the previous estimate of $150–$250 million. Encouragingly, the company has raised the cost savings target for 2017. It now expects cost savings of $425–$450 million from the company's FORCE program. The prior estimate for savings was $400 million.  Zacks Rank and Key PicksKimberly-Clark currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked companies from the industry include Energizer Holdings, Inc.

360,NWL,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 25.The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.8% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Waters Corp. has an average positive surprise of 5.8% for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates thrice.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Waters Corp. has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Waters Corp. has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.73 comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Waters Corp.’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsWaters Corp.’s key strengths include a dominant position in the biopharma end markets and thriving sales in emerging markets. Global pharmaceuticals business, in particular, is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division over the past few quarters. We believe the company’s second-quarter financials will benefit from steady demand from pharmaceutical business, growth in recurring revenue and modest recovery of industrial markets.Moreover, the company’s Industrial business, which has gained momentum in the past few quarters due to increasing demand for improved food quality and safety testing, is also likely to drive the quarter’s top line. In addition, demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions and liquid chromatography, has been on an uptrend lately and is likely to drive second-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System while mass spectrometry sales grew on the back of QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust market traction of the ACQUITY, CORTECS and Xevo line of products will supplement the top-line performance of the soon-to-be-reported quarter. In light of the above catalysts, the company’s shares have appreciated 37% year to date, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 35.5%.Despite these positives, sluggishness in the company’s academic and government businesses are likely to restrict growth to some extent. Of late, unfavorable order timing and volatility associated with instrument-heavy business have played a spoilsport for the academic and government businesses. Also, weakness in the chemical industry on a global scale is likely to dampen sales performance for the to-be-reported quarter. Further, we believe that currency fluctuations will remain a risk to the company’s top line in the quarter under review as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and a Zacks Rank #2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Aug 4. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Belden Inc.

361,NWL,"Despite softness in the coffee and pet foods segments, The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), has managed to keep its shareholders happy through regular dividend payments.The board of directors recently approved an increase of 4% in its quarterly dividend, from $0.75 to $0.78 per common share. The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to shareholders held in record at the close of business on Aug 11. This represents the company’s 16th consecutive year of dividend growth.However, the dividend growth rate was lower when compared with year-ago numbers. Smucker increased its quarterly dividend by 12% in 2016, by 5% in 2015, by 10% in 2014 and by 11.5% in 2013.In addition to dividend payment, the company actively repurchases shares. During the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company completed the 3 million share repurchase program that was announced in February.In fiscal 2017, the company returned over $775 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends, up from $750 million of cash returned to shareholders last year, reflecting strong cash flow. In fact, in the last five fiscal years, the company has returned over $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Stock Price Performance and Estimates RevisionIf we look into the company’s share price performance over the past six months, we will notice that shares of Smucker underperformed the Zacks categorized Food–Miscellaneous/Diversified industry. In the said time frame, shares of the company have declined 12.5%, compared with the industry’s fall of 5.3%. Challenging coffee and pet foods segments seems to have pressurized the stock.Moreover, the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results of Smucker were not quite impressive. While earnings during the quarter fell 19% year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits, sales edged down 1% due to lower net price realization. The fall was witnessed in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment and an unfavorable mix in the U.S. Retail Coffee segment.The dismal quarterly performance has also lowered analysts’ expectations. Estimates for the first quarter and for fiscal 2018 have gone down by a penny to reach $1.67 and $7.97 respectively, over the last 30 days.Bottom LineDespite such unfavorable trends, we are encouraged with Smucker’s acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand, the launch of Dunkin Donuts K-cup pods and expanded distribution for the Natural Balance pet brand which are fueling sales. The company remains focused on expanding its business though sustained innovation, cost-cutting initiatives and efforts to expand e-commerce sales. Smucker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and carries a long term growth rate of 7.3%.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Still Interest You?

362,NWL,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 25. Investors want to know whether the company will deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.5%.A look into Kimberly-Clark’s stock performance, reveals that its shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized Consumer Products–Staples industry in the past three months. In the said time frame, stocks of the company went down 4.6%, compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Trending A look at the estimate revision would give us an idea regarding analyst’s expectations right before the company releases its earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter decreased by a penny in the past 30 days while the same has remained stable for fiscal 2017 at $6.29. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 per share for the second quarter reflects a year-over-year decrease of 2%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.58 billion for the said quarter, a 0.2% decline from the year-ago period, while the same for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $18.5 billion.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kimberly-Clark has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.50. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteFactors Influencing the QuarterKimberly-Clark has been dealing with decelerated organic sales growth, especially in developing and emerging markets over the past few quarters. The decline in sales growth is primarily due to lower volumes and a difficult economic scenario. Moreover, the company’s diaper segment is witnessing lower market share and higher competitive promotional activity as consumers are seen to shift to either premium or less expensive diaper offerings.Nonetheless, the company is focused on improving its performance through regular innovation. In the near term, it has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America. The company has been aggressively cutting costs through its FORCE program that has been generating higher cost savings each year. The program generated costs savings of $435 million in 2016 and expects savings of at least $400 million in 2017. Evidently, it already achieved $110 million of cost savings in the first quarter.Kimberly-Clark is well positioned in the overseas and has been regularly expanding in diverse regions. Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets, it expects only modest improvement in the overall environment in 2017, particularly in the second half.Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

363,NWL,"SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading grocery dealer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 6.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SUPERVALU this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSUPERVALU has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 10 cents. The company has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents for the fiscal first quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and reflects year-over-year decline of 47.4% from 19 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents for fiscal 2018 shows growth from 29 cents delivered in fiscal 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.98 billion and $12.85 billion for the impending quarter and fiscal 2018, which are 23.5% and 14.2% lower than the respective year-ago periods.Factors at PlayWe note that SUPERVALU has been witnessing difficulties in delivering growth, of late. In fact, the company has been reporting lower-than-expected sales for the last few quarters, primarily due to soft comparable store-sales. Evidently, its top line has lagged estimates for seven of the last nine quarters.In addition, this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to tough competitive pressure, lower store traffic and deflationary environment in the food industry. Notably, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, retail sales fell 3.2% year over year with same-store sales remaining negative at 5.8%, thereby marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline.We note that the food/grocery industry is grappling with a number of headwinds of late. Shift in consumer purchase decisions, evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms continue to plague the industry. Moreover, the fact that SUPERVALU is not completely immune to the industry’s headwinds, have been denting its financial results.Nonetheless, management at SUPERVALU is striving hard to spark a turnaround and return to its growth trajectory. The company is also geared to expand its retail banners in order to boost sales, along with the intent to capitalize on the private brands portfolio among the retail banners. Moreover, it is trying all means to rejuvenate its retail segment, reduce costs and increase operating efficiency.We commend SUPERVALU’s efforts to develop the wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the recent acquisition of Unified Grocers is expected to radically boost the company’s wholesale segment, alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies. Its wholesale business will drive the momentum further and boost its near-term results.Notably, SUPERVALU’s shares have rallied 10% in the last one month against the Zacks categorized Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry’s decline of 2.8%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector fell 0.3%.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, total second-quarter 2017 earnings for the sector are expected to rise 3.9%, while revenues are projected to improve 1.5%. In fact, we observed that the Consumer Staples sector has lagged the broader market in the last one year. While the Zacks categorized sector gained 1.1%, the S&P 500 index advanced 13.5%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

364,NWL,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this tobacco leader will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Philip Morris this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuotePhilip Morris has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.23. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 for the second quarter has been stable in the last seven days and reflects growth from $1.15 posted in the prior-year period. However, the same has moved up by a penny to $4.90 for 2017 and also shows growth from $4.48 delivered in 2016.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.06 billion and $28.63 billion for the impending quarter and 2017, which are also 6.2% and 7.3% higher than the respective year-ago periods.Factors Influencing the QuarterWe note that Philip Morris has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and rising taxes on it. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s performance and, in turn, its overall profitability. Moreover, consumers are currently opting for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes, thereby affecting cigarette volume. Evidently, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing six quarters, including the last reported quarter.As smoking rates are declining in developed countries, the race to replace traditional cigarettes is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Particularly, serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products. Therefore, Philip Morris is aggressively investing in creating smoke-free products such as IQOS (Heatsticks that heat tobacco instead of burning it) in order to boost its business and market share. Meanwhile, it continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing.We expect the company’s continued focus on accelerating IQOS volume growth and pricing actions will help it deliver upbeat results in the upcoming quarter as well as in 2017.Driven by these factors, shares of Philip Morris have rallied 30.1% year to date, comfortably outperforming the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry’s advance of 18.5%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector gained 9.2%.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

365,NWL,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $14.80 on Jul 14, closing at $15.03. Despite the company’s efforts to diversify the brand and its sustained focus on improving operations, performance remains challenged by rising competition and escalated raw milk costs. The impact is well reflected in Dean Foods’ share price which has been underperforming the broader Zacks categorized Consumer Staples sector for the last six months. In the said time frame, share price of the company has declined 28.2% against the sector’s growth of 9%. Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been pulling down Dean Foods and the strategic measures put in place to revive its performance.Milk Cost & Volumes Posing Concerns Dean Foods’ business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel and others. The prices of these commodities are continuously fluctuating. A price hike in such items will hurt the company’s margins. The company witnessed escalated raw milk costs in the first quarter of 2017, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. During the quarter, raw milk costs rose about 6% from fourth-quarter 2016 and jumped 18% from first-quarter 2016.The USDA data through Feb 2017 revealed that fluid milk volumes dipped 1.8% year over year on an adjusted basis. Also, total volume of 633 million gallons dipped 1.3% from 641 million gallons in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the Class I Mover, a measure of raw milk expenses, increased year over year in the second quarter. This raises concerns over the company’s near-term performance.The impact of decreased volumes and increased raw milk costs led Dean Foods to post dismal first-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings marked its second consecutive miss and plunged year over year.. The company’s earnings underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.4% in the trailing four quarters. Consolidation Intensifies Competition In recent years, the retail grocery industry experienced significant consolidation, resulting in intense competition among dairy product suppliers. Dean Foods experiences stiff competition, both geographically and at the processor level, in all major product lines. The company could suffer significantly from the loss of any large regional grocery chain. It not only competes with various dairy processors for shelf space but also with various beverages and nutritional products.Strategic Initiatives Lift Hopes of Improvement Contributions from Friendly’s acquisition have been boosting ice cream sales volumes. This is aiding top-line growth. We also applaud the company’s efforts to grow in the organic space, which is evident from its recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley as well as the acquisition of Uncle Matt's juices. Further, the company's focus on cost productivity and growth plans bode well. With such strategic initiatives in place, we can hope that Dean Foods would be able to uplift its performance. Moreover, the company carries a VGM Score of “A”, which points at its inherent strength.While estimates for the second quarter have been stable, fiscal year estimates have witnessed a downtrend. Dean Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks? Check theseSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Energizer Holdings, Inc.

366,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) is smoothly progressing with its Accelerated Transformation Plan, focused on creating a simpler, faster and stronger consumer-focused portfolio of leading brands. In sync with the plan, the company completed the previously announced the sale of The Waddington Group and Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc., for gross proceeds of $2.7 billion. The company received $2.5 billion net of taxes. Proceeds from the sale of these assets will be directed to lower balance sheet debt as well as for share repurchases.The company agreed to divest the packaging maker, The Waddington Group, to Novolex for roughly $2.3 billion in May 2018. The sale includes brands like Eco-Products, POLAR PAK, WNA and other industry-leading brands.Further, in June, the company entered a pact, with a fund managed by Seidler Equity Partners (“SEP”), to sell its sporting goods subsidiary, Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc. The private investment firm has partnered with Major League Baseball (“MLB”) for the transaction. The sale includes Rawlings, Miken and Worth brands. Newell Brands will receive gross proceeds of nearly $395 million from the transaction. Further, after-tax proceeds from the sale are expected to be about $340 million.Moreover, Newell is looking for options for the Jostens and Pure Fishing brands. The key aspects of the Transformation Plan are restructuring the company into a global consumer product entity, valued at more than $9 billion, along with major brands in seven consumer segments.  In doing so, the company plans to offload non-core businesses that account for nearly 35% of the company’s sales, utilize $10 billion after-tax proceeds from divestitures and a free cash flow to lower debt plus make share repurchase as well as retaining investment grade rating and an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019, targeting 30-35% payout ratio.The above-mentioned plan will likely generate net sales of above $9 billion, boosting shareholder value and financial flexibility. Newell progresses well with its divestiture operations and anticipates the same to be completed by the end of 2019. Thereafter, management projects sales of roughly $9.5 billion, with normalized operating margin expansion of more than 15% by 2020.Shares of the company did not react much to the news.

367,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) is progressing smoothly with the execution of its Transformation Plan. The plan mainly aims at transforming the company into a simpler, stronger and faster one, so that it can leverage its abilities in relation to innovation, design and e-commerce. However, the company is witnessing lower core sales and strained margins for a while now.Yet, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.7% in a month, outperforming the industry’s 0.3% increase. Let’s delve deep into the company’s Transformation Plan and other attributes to see whether the stock can be an investor's favorite.Transformation Plan – A BoonNewell is well on track with the execution of its Transformation Plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement, and cost-saving plans. Also, management is looking to exit non-strategic assets, reduce complexity and focus on key consumer-focused brands. In May, Newell expanded the Accelerated Transformation Plan, which is expected to transform the company and create value. Notably, the plan aims at restructuring Newell’s portfolio into seven core consumer segments that can generate above $9 billion sales; offload non-core businesses that account for nearly 35% of the company’s sales; utilize $10 billion after-tax proceeds from divestitures along with free cash flow to lower debt and make share repurchase; and retain investment grade rating with an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019, targeting 30-35% payout ratio.Additionally, this plan focuses on the simplification of the company’s operations, which is likely to reduce the company’s number of manufacturing facilities by 66%, distribution centers by 55%, brands by 45%, number of employees by 39% as well as reduce above 30 ERP systems to two by the end of 2019. Management will also focus on right-sizing the cost structure for anticipated smaller net sales, remove stranded corporate expenses and recover the synergies lost through the divestitures. These efforts are likely to enhance Newell’s operational performance and financial flexibility and boost shareholder value, going ahead.With respect to this plan, Newell also inked a deal to divest its packaging maker — The Waddington Group — to Novolex for roughly $2.3 billion. The transaction is expected to generate after-tax proceeds of nearly $2.2 billion, which will be further used in deleveraging and share repurchase. Newell added Jostens and Pure Fishing brands to the list of potential divestitures as well. Recently, management has also agreed to sell its sporting goods subsidiary — Rawlings Sporting Goods Company, Inc. — to a fund managed by Seidler Equity Partners. The private investment firm has partnered with Major League Baseball for the transaction. Markedly, the sale will include the Rawlings, Miken and Worth brands of the St. Louis, MO-based subsidiary. Newell will receive gross proceeds of nearly $395 million from the transaction and after-tax proceeds from the sale are expected to be about $340 million.Currently, Newell’s divestiture transactions are on track and expected to be completed by the end of 2019. Thereafter, management projects sales of roughly $9.5 billion, with normalized operating margin expansion of more than 15% by 2020.ConcernsAlthough the Transformation Plan is progressing well, it failed to deliver higher sales and lift the company’s margins. Apparently, the company has lagged sales estimates in four of the trailing seven quarters, including the last reported quarter. Also, the top line fell 7.6% year over year in first-quarter 2018 due to adverse impact of the last year’s divestitures, net of buyouts. Sales were also hurt by the disrupted business of the Baby division along with a considerable inventory destocking in the Writing division’s office superstore and distributive trade channels. Core sales declined 3.5%, mainly due to soft Writing and Baby sales as well as decline across most segments. In 2018, core sales are projected to be flat to down low-single digit rate.Further, Newell has been witnessing strained margins for the last few quarters now despite gains from cost synergies and savings. Absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix as well as increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment have been also weighing on margins.Bottom LineWe believe that the company’s robust Transformation Plan along with solid brand portfolio and strong balance sheet will offset the aforesaid concerns. As a result, its shares are likely to march higher in the future. Meanwhile, the stock’s Value Score of B with a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.1% remain encouraging.Want Top-Ranked Stocks in the Same Sector? Check TheseMedifast, Inc.

369,NWL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Newell has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Newell’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.However, we should point out that Newell has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 8.7, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Newell has a P/S ratio of about 0.8. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, NWL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Newell currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Newell a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Newell is just 1.4, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.0. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.5, which is far better than the industry average of 10.5. Clearly, NWL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Newell might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A. This gives NWL a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower. The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 10.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Newell Brands Inc. Price and Consensus  Newell Brands Inc. Price and Consensus | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineNewell is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 15%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

370,NWL,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 11.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NWL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Newell Beats Q1 Earnings, Updates Transformation PlanNewell Brands reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results wherein the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line marginally lagged the same. While this marked the company’s second straight earnings beat, sales figure failed to top the consensus mark after surpassing expectations in the fourth quarter of 2017. Further, management retained its 2018 view.This Hoboken, NJ-based company posted normalized earnings of 34 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents but remained flat year over year. The bottom line gained from cost savings, favorable pricing, gains from acquisitions and a lower tax rate, compensated by the lost earnings from divested operations, fall in core sales and commodity cost inflation.On a reported basis, earnings per share came in at 11 cents compared with $1.31 earned in the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $3,017.4 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,039 million as well as declined 7.6% year over year on account of the adverse impact of the last year’s divestitures, net of buyouts. Also, the top line was hurt by the disrupted business of the Baby division along with a considerable inventory destocking in the Writing division’s office superstore and distributive trade channels. Further, core sales fell 3.5%, mainly due to Writing and Baby.Normalized gross margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 33.3% while normalized operating margin declined 190 bps to 8.7% in the quarter under review.Segment PerformanceLive segment net sales inched up 0.4% to $1,071.6 million from the year-ago period. However, core sales decreased 3.1% on account of improvement in Appliances & Cookware, which was more than offset by a high-single digit fall in Baby business.Net sales at Learn segment came in at $495.4 million, down 13% from the prior-year period. Core sales dropped 14.3%, mainly due to decline in Writing business.Work segment net sales of $640.7 million grew 4.4% year over year. Also, core sales rose 5.5% on account of continued strength in Waddington and Safety & Security.Net sales at the Play segment came in at $616.8 million, down 1.8% from the prior-year period. Core sales dipped 2.6% due to fall in Outdoor & Recreation, compensated with sturdy growth registered in Team Sports.The Other segment net sales of $192.9 million plunged 50.2% from the prior-year quarter on account of the divestitures of the Tools, Winter Sports, Fire Starter and Fire Log plus Cordage businesses. Core sales declined 4.1% due to weakness in Process Solutions, partly offset by improvement in U.S. Playing Cards.Transformation Plan UpdateIn line with its Accelerated Transformation Plan, Newell inked a deal to divest its packaging maker, The Waddington Group, to Novolex for roughly $2.3 billion. The transaction, anticipated to close within 60 days, is likely to generate after-tax proceeds of about $2.2 billion, which will be further used in deleveraging and share repurchase. Moreover, Newell adds Jostens and Pure Fishing brands to the list of potential divestitures.These moves are expected to speed up value creation and transform portfolio to leverage the company’s abilities with respect to innovation, design and e-commerce. Also, it will help improve operational performance, deleverage the balance sheet as well as enhance shareholder value.The key aspects of this Transformation Plan are restructuring the company into a global consumer products’ entity, valued at more than $9 billion along with major brands in seven consumer segments; offloading non-core businesses that account for nearly 35% of the company’s sales, utilizing $10 billion after-tax proceeds from divestitures and a free cash flow to lower debt plus make share repurchase as well as retaining investment grade rating and an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019, targeting 30-35% payout ratio.The above will likely generate net sales of above $9 billion, boosting shareholder value and financial flexibility. Newell progresses well with its divestiture operations and anticipates the same to be completed by the end of 2019. Thereafter, management projects sales of roughly $9.5 billion with normalized operating margin expansion of more than 15% by 2020.Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $459 million, long-term debt of $9,623.5 million and shareholders’ equity of $14,130.9 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $36.4 million.The company reported negative operating cash flow of $401.7 million compared with negative $263.6 million in the prior-year period. During the quarter under review, the company returned $112.6 million to shareholders in the form of dividends.OutlookFollowing the mixed quarterly results, management reiterated its guidance for 2018. Net sales are still projected in the band of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion with core sales to be flat to down low-single digit rate.Further, management continues to expect normalized earnings per share in the band of $2.65 to $2.85 and envisions operating cash flow in the range of $1.15-$1.45 billion for 2018. However, the company estimates both the metrics’ outlook to come in at the lower end of the guided range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 8% due to these changes.Newell Brands Inc. Price and Consensus Newell Brands Inc. Price and Consensus | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, NWL has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, NWL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

QuoteThough the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents for the first quarter of 2018 remained stable in the last 30 days, it portrays a year-over-year decline of 20.6%. Also, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $3.04 billion for the quarter, down 6.8% from the year-ago period.Furthermore, the consensus estimates of $1,051 million, $523 million and $551 million for Live, Learn and Work segments, respectively, reflect a decline of 39%, 5.1% and 21.8% sequentially. However, the consensus mark of $633 million for the Play segment shows an increase of 12.4% from fourth-quarter 2017.While the company has been witnessing margin issues, Newell remains on track with the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and cost-savings plans. Further, it is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in the industrial and commercial products as well as smaller consumer businesses. The strategic alternatives for these brands will significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence. On completion of these plans, Newell is expected to become a nearly $11 billion focused portfolio company with leading consumer-facing brands, impressive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.Furthermore, Newell’s Project Renewal Program continues to focus on saving costs in the areas of procurement by reducing the complexity of its business and simplifying the manufacturing and distribution processes, through further overhead reduction. In addition, it intends to use a major portion of the savings in accelerating growth by investing the same in business, while the remaining cost savings are expected to reflect in earnings. These savings are also expected to boost margins, cash flow and further investments.All said, we remain cautious about Newell’s performance in the upcoming quarter, however, the company is poised well for growth in the long term.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Newell is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Newell has an Earnings ESP of -4.67% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which make surprise prediction difficult.As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Hostess Brands, Inc.

"
377,NWL,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

380,NWL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) lost luster lately due to lower core sales, weak margins, adverse pricing and commodity cost inflation, despite reporting better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017. Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have lost 34.4% in the last six months, much wider than the industry’s decline of 8.9%. The stock also has a Growth Score of D, which questions its growth prospects.Given this backdrop, Newell’s transformation plan seems to be a blessing in disguise for the stock. The plan focuses on enhancing its operational efficiency and boosting shareholder value, amid a rapidly changing retail backdrop. Meanwhile, the company has been progressing well with the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and cost-savings plans.Recently, management also expanded its accelerated transformation plan aimed at developing a simpler, faster and stronger company. Additionally, Newell believes that there are more divestiture opportunities, which can yield a total of roughly $10 billion after-tax from the accelerated transformation plan. However, the company retained that it will divest operations at competitive market multiples only.Furthermore, management reaffirmed continuing the execution of its strategic plans. These initiatives include optimizing its portfolio by focusing on brands with attractive margins and growth potential in global categories; boosting operating efficiency and simplifying operations; enhancing financial flexibility for higher free cash flow and shareholders’ returns; and making the most of Newell’s scale and differentiated capabilities for higher market share gains.Earlier, the company accelerated the pace of its transformation plan by restricting Newell’s portfolio on nine core consumer segments that can garner nearly $11 billion of sales and $2 billion of EBITDA. Moreover, it is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in its industrial and commercial product as well as smaller consumer businesses. The strategic alternatives for these brands are expected to significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence.Additionally, these alternatives should reduce the company’s customer base by 50% and result in consolidation of 80% of global sales on two ERP platforms by end of 2019. On completion of these plans, Newell is expected to become a nearly $11 billion focused portfolio company, with leading consumer-facing brands, attractive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.That said, we believe the transformation plan has the potential to change the fate of Newell, bringing it back on growth trajectory. However, the near-term headwinds might continue to impact the stock’s performance.Want Top-Ranked Stocks in the Same Space? Count on TheseEnergizer Holdings, Inc.

However, decline in both top and bottom line did raise some concerns. Nevertheless, management retained its 2018 view.This Hoboken, NJ-based company posted normalized earnings of 68 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but declined 15% year over year from 80 cents in the prior-year quarter. Management highlighted that lost contributions from divested operations, fall in core sales volume, adverse pricing, and commodity cost inflation coupled with increased share count hurt the bottom line. These were partly mitigated by ongoing cost savings and related synergies, contributions from acquisitions and lower tax rate.Net sales of $3,743.1 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,716 million but declined 9.5% year over year on account of the adverse impact from divestitures, net of buyouts.

384,NWL,"Welcome to Episode #81 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The recent stock market correction is impacting stocks across the entire gamut of the stock market, from large cap to small caps. That even includes the golden blue-chip type stocks.The reason some stocks are considered blue chips is because they are considered safe, large cap stocks that aren’t supposed to be volatile in a portfolio. They are also usually owned by a large percentage of investors.Some might even consider them boring.But even the blue chips can run into rocky periods and, for some, that’s happening right now.Some blue chips started to tumble in 2016 and 2017 and the recent correction only added to the losses.Is it time to buy them?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, not all stocks that sell off are values. Some companies may have value fundamentals including low P/E, P/B, P/S ratios. Some may even have value PEG ratios, which means a PEG under 1.0.But that’s not enough. A true value stock will also have earnings growth.The value traps will have all the value fundamentals but earnings estimates will be falling or will be negative year-over-year.The key, then, is to look at the full year earnings estimates.Are These 5 Battered Blue Chips Value Stocks or Traps?Tracey took a look at 5 blue chip stocks that have sold off the last few years to see if there could be a buying opportunity there.1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) continues to sink. It recently hit a new multi-year low. The shares are trading with a forward P/E of 15 now. You’d think these were a bargain, right? After all, it IS GE. But is it a true value?2.     Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) is a mess. After two quarters of disappointing sales, and now a management crisis, the shares are down 14% year-to-date. 2018 earnings are expected to be unchanged versus 2017 despite the largest corporate tax cuts in history. But shares are trading at just 9x. Should you be buying Newell right now?3.     Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) plunged in 2017 but this year it has recovered and is now up 11% year-to-date. Sounds like things could be turning around. But shares now trade with a forward P/E of 68. Are investors too bullish on this athletic apparel and shoe retailer or is there a true earnings turnaround happening here?4.     Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) saw its shares sink over 14% in 2018 after it reported yet another disappointing quarter. Customer traffic has not rebounded and same store sales remain anemic for a chain that was once the darling of the restaurant industry. The appointment of a former Taco Bell executive to be CEO, however, has boosted the shares off the recent lows. Should value investors be buying with a forward P/E of 30?5.     J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) was left for dead by investors in 2017. Department stores aren’t going to make it, right? But shares are up 1% year-to-date. With a forward P/E of 20, are earnings finally going in the right direction for this out-of-favor retailer?What else should you know about telling the difference between value stocks and value traps?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>
