15,IRM,"When an ETF invests in the S&P 500 while offering less risk and a big yield, what’s not to love?PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD) filters the iconic index for 75 companies with the highest dividend yields, then extracts 50 of those that are least volatile.SPHD was up 5.99% this year through March 2 vs. a 2.39% loss for SPY. It has also outperformed SPY, the largest and oldest U.S. exchange traded fund, over the past three years. On Thursday, it briefly hit an all-time high of 35.42.Launched in 2012, SPHD combines two popular and important defensive factors, notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In general, for investors who want to stay in the equity market but take on less-than-normal risk, dividend and low volatility products are compelling,"" Rosenbluth said.This investing strategy's distillation of the S&P 500 index is resonating with investors.SPHD's assets have swelled more than 200% to $836.8 million since the end of 2015. Investors poured in $172.1 million of fresh money in the first two months of this year.What they're getting are top-notch stocks such as AT&T (T), a member of the elite IBD Leaderboard. Stocks on this hand-picked list offer superior fundamentals and technicals, which enhance their potential for explosive gains.AT&T is a top 10 holding in the SPHD stock portfolio. The telecom giant, a defensive play, is holding up well even as the broad market starts to gain some steam.The company reported strong earnings Jan. 26 and the stock has since soared. It hit a 52-week high of 38.11 on the stock market today.SPHD yields 3.48% vs. 2.17% for SPY. Its dividend factor recognizes companies for their dividend yield -- AT&T's is 5% -- and not the longevity of dividend payments, Rosenbluth notes.That tasty income is a big lure for investors at a time when capital appreciation is hard to find.The defensive tilt to SPHD gives investors more exposure to some of this year's top-performing sectors. Utilities have the top weighting, at 18% of assets. By comparison, the S&P 500 benchmark has 3% in utilities.The ETF also overweights the real estate sector, which has been showing momentum.SPHD makes large sector bets, but they tend to be in lower-risk sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, said Rosenbluth.""The risk is more toward underperforming when the broader market moves higher,"" he added. Low volatility ETFs protect on the downside, but tend to rise less in a rising market too.Rosenbluth suggested investors could consider combining an ETF such as SPHD with peers such as SPY or Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) ""to overweight their exposure to lower risk stocks.""The top three stock holdings in SPHD include CenturyLink (CTL), Iron Mountain (IRM) and Spectra Energy (SE).CenturyLink ranks No. 5 in IBD's integrated telecom services industry group. It boasts a strong Composite Rating of 88 and has two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth.Iron Mountain, which helps companies manage records and protect data, ranks No. 2 in its industry group. It has a dull 68 Comp Rating, but sports two quarters of improving profits.Spectra Energy, an oil-and-gas pipeline company, lags in its industry group and has a poor 48 Comp Rating. But it has eight quarters of increasing fund ownership.SPHD rebalances and reconstitutes twice a year, in January and July.It provides income investors a steady source of income, by paying out dividends monthly.The ETF has a 0.30% expense ratio. For SPY, it's 0.09%.

200,IRM,"Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.Last quarter, earnings of 55 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents and increased 14.6% year over year. However, in the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average negative surprise of 8.08%.Revenues of $949.8 million missed the consensus mark of $955.2 million but improved 7.5% year over year.The company attributed the year–over-year improvement in results to accretive Recall Holdings acquisition, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of its storage rental business.Notably, shares of Iron Mountain have gained 26% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 3.4% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain’s strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts.The company’s entry into the data center market is likely to be a growth driver. We note that it is investing a lot in setting up its data center business.In the month of July, the company acquired MAG Datacenters, which operates FORTRUST for $128 million. The acquisition is expected to bolster the company’s presence in the Western U.S data center market by adding 9 MW of existing capacity and enhancing opportunity for further expansion in the future.Last month, Iron Mountain unveiled the first of the four announced data centers in Northern Virginia. The company already has data centers in Boston, Denver, Kansas City and Western Pennsylvania. Combined with the data center facility in North Virginia, the company will have 30 megawatts of capacity by year end, per management.The company’s data center in Northern Virginia was also selected by Virtustream to expand its cloud footprint. Moreover, the company's recent announcement to acquire data centers in London and Singapore will help it gain ground in the international markets in our view.However, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to falling activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Besides, forex fluctuations, fragmented nature of the industry and stiff competition continue to be overhangs. Further, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Iron Mountain’s Earnings ESP is -1.35%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 55 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Iron Mountain carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in their upcoming release:Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1.

201,IRM,"We are in the heart of the Q3 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q3 earnings releases line up for this week, of which Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Oct 24.No doubt, the Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which clearly signal a December rate hike, have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. This is because REITs depend on debt for their business, and pay high and consistent dividend. Thus, a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows.Nevertheless, with improvement in the macroeconomic scenario, at a steady yet sluggish pace, demand for a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017. Though supply has been increasing, the pace has been modest in many of the asset categories.According to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) —the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the earlier years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Additionally, data center REITs are experiencing a boom with the growing popularity of cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data as well as the use of third-party IT infrastructure by several companies. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the Finance sector, of which REITs are part, are expected to be down 1.5% year over year on 1.1% higher revenues. This represents the Q3 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole — i.e. after combining the reported actual results with the still-to-come estimates.Now, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned two REITs’ third-quarter results.For Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) — Equity Residential —things do not appear to be much favorable. In fact, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This elevated supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition to this, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Furthermore, the company has made strategic efforts toward repositioning the portfolio from low barrier-to-entry/non-core markets to high barrier-to-entry/core markets, and opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in recent years.Though the assets sale might enable the company to focus exclusively on its core, high-density urban markets over the long term, the earnings-dilution impact from such a move cannot be bypassed in the near term. These issues are expected to affect the company’s net operating income in the quarter to be reported.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $619.6 million, marking estimated growth of 2.2% year over year.For third-quarter 2017, Equity Residential projects normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share in the range of 77-81 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 79 cents.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Equity Residential is -1.04%. Also, Equity Residential’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP.

The company’s diversified revenue base remains a positive. Moreover, a solid product portfolio and increasing market share are growth catalysts. The company has an aggressive acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth in storage revenues. Also, it has been investing aggressively in order to set up its data-center business.Still, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Further, the storage and information management services industry remains a highly fragmented industry with intensifying competition. In addition, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $962.4 million, denoting expected growth of nearly 2.1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is pegged at 56 cents.At present, Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -1.35%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat. Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note: All earnings per share numbers presented in this report represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.

205,IRM,"Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) is making concerted efforts to fortify its portfolio in desired markets backed by acquisitions and new storage facilities in core markets. Recently, this global leader in storage and information management services unveiled two new information management facilities in Missoula and Helena, MT.The Missoula facility, spanning 8,000 square feet of area, is situated at 4545 Majestic Drive. The building offers 39,000 cubic feet of storage and information management capacity. It is well equipped to provide solutions for data and records management, as well as document and asset imaging.In addition, the facility at Helena spans 27,900 square feet of space offering 85,000 cubic feet of storage and service capacity. The property located at 1700 National Ave is capable of delivering records and data management, as well as secure shredding services.Notably, the facilities mark the company’s debut in the Montana market and reflect its intensions to extend Iron Mountain’s solutions portfolio to the business market in the state.Per management, there is an increasing need to safeguard important data and information, and make them easily accessible to the organization.  With Iron Mountain’s solid capacity to offer facilities for data management, the company remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.

206,IRM,"Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) recently boosted its financial position by closing an amended and refinanced secured revolving facility. The move offers greater flexibility to the company as it offers a $1,750-million senior secured loan and another $250-million term loan A.Amendments have been made in the funded term-loan component, as well as the revolving component of the credit facility.The restated loan has enabled the company to stretch debt maturities from June 2022 to June 2023.Notably, the company can withdraw funds in different currencies like U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, among other. Moreover, borrowings under the revolving line of credit will be used for general corporate purposes. The amended loan reduces the interest rate margins on the revolver and term loan by 25 basis points (bps). Depending on the company’s leverage ratio, currency used and type of loan opted, interest rate margins for the facility will be in the 25-175 bps band.  The decrease in interest rate is anticipated to reduce the company’s annualized interest expense significantly. The move will improve the company’s cash flow and alleviate its bottom-line pressure as well. This reduction will strengthen Iron Mountain’s balance sheet.Nonetheless, per the term loan B of the credit agreement, including terms-related maturity, amortization and interest rate will remain unchanged. The company has a $700-million term loan B under the existing credit agreement.The amendment, which boosts the company's financial flexibility and future investment activities, highlights lenders' confidence in the company. Extending maturities provide the company ample scope for deploying capital for long-term growth opportunities and carrying out acquisition initiatives.In fact, as the company plans to grow its dividend by another 7% to $2.35 by 2018 and 4% annually beyond 2018, the refinancing will enable managing to meet these goals and reward shareholders with higher returns.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has underperformed its industry in the past three months.

207,IRM,"In a bid to expand into the Amsterdam market, Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) has acquired the Dutch EvoSwitch data-center business. The company shelled out €205 ($235) million for this acquisition which involved the purchase of EvoSwitch Netherlands B.V and EvoSwitch Global Services B.V. (EvoSwitch NL) in particular. The move comes after Iron Mountain’s expansion in London through data-center facility purchase from Credit Suisse in the past 12 months.The latest acquisition brings in 11 megawatts (MW) of existing data-center capacity in the Netherlands which happens to be fully leased. Moreover, there is an additional 23 MW expansion capability.  As a result, the total data-center portfolio capacity of Iron Mountain, now grows to more than 285 MW.The expansion into the Amsterdam market, which happens to be the second largest European data-center market, with the acquisition of EvoSwitch NL seems a strategic fit for Iron Mountain. Founded in 2007, EvoSwitch NL operates one of the largest colocation facilities centers in the Metropolitan Region Amsterdam (MRA).The MRA serves as a crucial node in the FLAP data-center market, i.e. Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and therefore, the acquisition of EvoSwitch NL significantly boosts Iron Mountain’s presence in the region. Particularly, two locations in the MRA join Iron Mountain’s portfolio with this acquisition.Further, the present campus of EvoSwitch NL already caters to more than 50 connectivity and telecommunication providers, together with internet exchanges, such as the Amsterdam Internet Exchange AMS-IX. Its customers base is diversified as well as global. Moreover, Leaseweb Netherlands B.V., (Leaseweb NL), a cloud hosting company operating in more than 30 countries, represents around 45% of EvoSwitch NL's contracted revenues under a 10-year lease agreement, and will become one of the top five customers of Iron Mountain data centers.Iron Mountain expects the transaction, including integration costs, to lead to modest dilution to AFFO of around 0.5% in 2018, but be accretive in 2019 following integration. Specifically, stabilized net operating income yield is estimated to be around 12-13% subsequent to build-out and lease-up of the expansion capacity at the EvoSwitch NL sites, while the present capacity is likely to generate annualized revenues of about $30 million at mid-50% adjusted EBITDA margins, the company noted.Importantly, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to spur demand for data centers and offer ample scope for growth to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) and Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report).Iron Mountain’s latest endeavors in this space also command appreciation and will likely boost its top-line growth by leveraging on the healthy fundamentals. In fact, aggressive acquisitions, along with diversified revenue base, a strong product portfolio and cost-cutting initiatives, bode well for long-term growth.

208,IRM,"Of late, Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) has been adding capabilities to its cloud platform. Specifically, the company recently announced rolling out the Iron Cloud for Video, which is a secure and scalable cloud-based solution enabling organizations to manage video content efficiently.Particularly, the solution offers organizations a scope to lower the cost and complexity of management of video data and content while increasing compliance. In fact, without bearing the upfront capital expenses for purchase of additional on-premise video infrastructure, organizations can progress with video-content management and access requirements. The solution is available as part of the company’s Iron Cloud purpose-built portfolio of cloud-based enterprise-class data management and access solutions.Notably, the volume of video data is growing at an exponential pace, thanks to the increasing use of video technology across sectors and industries. In fact, with the arrival of new video sources and technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), drone surveillance and high-definition cameras, the volume of data and content is likely to supersede the capacity of on-premise solutions. However, this rapid growth is also leading to cost escalations and complexity, in turn throwing up challenges for management. Amid this, the company’s addition to the Iron cloud platforms seems a strategic fit.Apart from this, Iron Mountain recently announced that it has added new capabilities to its online policy management platform — Policy Center — that will enable companies to understand and comply with policies relating to privacy and retention of data.The latest capability additions will improve the services offered by the company’s cloud-based platform amid a challenging regulatory landscape. Nevertheless, Iron Mountain’s service revenues remain modest due to shrinking activity rates, as stored records are becoming less active. Also, recycled paper prices continue to fall. The recovery is expected to be slow in the near term, thus making it difficult for the company to achieve any robust top-line growth. Furthermore, the company has a highly-leveraged balance sheet.Amid these, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have underperformed its industry in the past three months. While shares of the company have lost 8.6%, the industry incurred a loss of 5.3%, during the same time period.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) and Sotherly Hotels Inc. (SOHO  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Arbor Realty Trust’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share has been revised 2.3% upward to 90 cents over the past two months.

209,IRM,"Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has added new capabilities to its online policy management platform — Policy Center — that will enable companies to understand and comply with policies relating to privacy and retention of data.Notably, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is scheduled to be effective from May 25, 2018, is a legal framework that consolidates data-privacy laws across Europe, and will be applicable to companies within and outside the country that control data of European Union (EU) subjects.As a result, enterprises will need to be well informed about legal retention and data-processing obligations to ensure complete adherence, as well as avoid any data breach possibilities. Further, to achieve compliance, the firms require a clear governance program that provides accurate information. By incorporating data-privacy information into the Policy Center platform, Iron Mountain fulfills compliance needs of companies. Amid this increasing rigid regulation, such a cloud-based retention and privacy policy management platform will help enterprises to comprehensively understand the obligations and adhere to regulations such as the EU GDPR. In addition, Policy Center Enterprise Edition offers various tools to document important information relating to personal data. In fact, the cloud-based solution is now equipped with updated privacy and retention guidelines from all over the world, backed by privacy experts from individual industries and locations. This will provide better clarity to companies that can update the respective data privacy and retention practices through a browser interface. Additionally, these companies can notify employees of the rules to ensure uniform implementation.Though the latest capability addition will improve the services offered by the company’s cloud-based policy management platform amid a challenging regulatory landscape, it is struggling to maintain revenues from storage services. Notably, service revenues remain modest due to the shrinking activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Furthermore, numerous acquisitions have resulted in a highly-leveraged balance sheet.Amid these, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have underperformed its industry in the past three months. While shares of the company lost 8.8%, the industry incurred a loss of 5.9%, during the same time period. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report) and Sotherly Hotels (SOHO  -  Free Report).

210,IRM,"In a bid to expand into the Croatian market, Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Zagreb-based Arhiv Trezor. The company has selected Arhiv Trezor for its expansion because the latter has a robust base of customers and enjoys a great reputation.The expansion into the Croatian market, with the acquisition of Arhiv Trezor, seems a strategic fit for Iron Mountain as this will enable the company to benefit from the rising record and information management business. Further, this will fortify the company’s presence within Southeastern Europe.Notably, as a result of the application of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the requirements for data privacy and protection have become extremely stringent. This requires clients to associate themselves with companies who aid them in adhering to the rules, thus increasing business opportunities for companies like Iron Mountain.Arhiv Trezor, which is a leader in storage and management of records, digitization, protected information destruction and safe transportation, was founded in 2002. The company has also received ISO 9001: 2015 Certification for records and business documentation archiving in Europe.Per Ernest Cloutier, executive vice president and general manager, International for Iron Mountain, ""Acquiring a known market leader like Arhiv Trezor fits our strategy of seeking established local providers that share our commitment to service delivery, trust and security in markets with strong growth trends in information management outsourcing.""Iron Mountain has an aggressive acquisition strategy to drive growth of storage revenues. The company has not only gained new customers from these acquisitions but has also been able to expand operations in international regions such as Greece, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Australia, Turkey, India, Brazil, China, Colombia and Poland.The company completed the acquisition of Recall Holdings in May 2016, which has broadened its footprint. Moreover, FORTRUST, Credit Suisse, IO Data Centers LLC and Dutch EvoSwitch data-center acquisitions are in sync with its strategy of expanding the company’s data-center business.Notably, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center real estate investment trusts (REIT) are experiencing a boom market. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to spur demand for data centers, and offer ample scope for growth to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) and Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report)    .Iron Mountain’s latest endeavors in this space also command appreciation and will likely boost its top-line growth by leveraging on the healthy fundamentals. In fact, aggressive acquisitions, along with a diversified revenue base, a strong product portfolio and cost-cutting initiatives, bode well for long-term growth. Additionally, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of the company’s storage rental business are positives. However, heavy investments in setting up the company’s data-center business dampen its financials, especially as it already has a highly leveraged balance sheet.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has witnessed a rise of 6.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 4.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

214,IRM,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report), Iron Mountain Incorporation (IRM  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Cubesmart (CUBE  -  Free Report) will release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total Finance Sector earnings for the Jan-Mar quarter are expected to be up 27% on 4.7% increase in revenues, as compared to the prior-year quarter. In fact, the sector witnessed 0.6% earnings growth in the prior quarter, primarily due to 4% rise in revenues.Notably, with the underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Digital Realty Trust is a data-center REIT that offers colocation and interconnection solutions for domestic and international tenants through its portfolio of data centersNotably, data-center REITs have been experiencing a boom market, of late. Additionally, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets. Other than enjoying high occupancy, these markets are also absorbing new construction at a faster pace. Further, according to a Cisco forecast, data-center IP traffic is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 25%, over the 2016-2021 period.Notably, Digital Realty, with its high-quality date centers, is well poised to benefit from this trend. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for occupancy of 90% for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.1%.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are a number of local developers in the United States, and several regional operators in Europe, Asia and Australia. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data-center market in the quarter to be reported. (Read more: Digital Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Hence, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.57, over the past month.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though Digital Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.25% makes surprise prediction difficult.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four occasions, the average beat being nearly 2.18%. This is depicted in the graph below:Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteIron Mountain’s focus on setting up data-center businesses bodes well for the company.  Internal storage rental growth rate for 2018 is expected in the 3-3.5% range, backed by volume growth and pricing improvement. We believe stellar organic growth and the company’s initiatives to expand its core storage business will benefit the first-quarter results.Nevertheless, Iron Mountain has grown its business principally through acquisitions, which have affected its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill. Hence, a highly leveraged balance sheet is predicted to have limited any robust margin improvement in the quarter. (Read more: What's in the Offing for Iron Mountain in Q1 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 50 cents. This indicates a 4.2% increase year over year.Furthermore, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank of 2, our proven model does not conclusively show that the company will likely beat estimates this season. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The story about Iron Mountain’s surprise history is better told by the chart below:Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteKimco Realty is taking long strides, and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. In fact, for first-quarter 2018, the company continued aggressively selling its non-core assets.In line with its strategy, the company announced dispositions of 21 shopping centers, spanning 2.3 million square feet of space, for $219.5 million in the first quarter. Of this, the company’s share included $210.2 million. High-disposition activity can lead to earnings dilution and depress the company’s growth momentum in the quarter to be reported.  While challenges faced by retail REITs have been well documented, recent data from real estate research firm Reis states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies remained moderately unchanged at 10% for first-quarter 2018. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporate.Although Kimco is actively enhancing omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it might take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results. (Read more: Why is Earnings Beat Unlikely for Kimco Realty in Q1?)Although the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%, an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) makes it difficult for our proven model to conclusively predict a likely earnings beat this season.Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteCubeSmart is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of self storage facilities in the United States.Notably, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Nevertheless, increased supply of self-storage units in a number of the company’s markets during the Jan-Mar quarter is predicted to have affected its performance. This might have dampened its same-store revenue growth as well.  Amis these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues of $144.9 million indicates 8.9% year-over-year growth. Further, the company’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 39 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged, over the past month. The figure reflects 8.3% rise from the prior-year quarter.In fact, though it has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.37% makes surprise prediction difficult.Over the preceding four quarters, the company met the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and beat in the other two, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.91%.

215,IRM,"Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market closes.Last quarter, this real estate investment trust’s (REIT) normalized funds from operations (FFO) of 53 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. Nonetheless, fourth-quarter 2017 revenues of $991 million improved 6.1% year over year.Over the preceding four quarters, the company missed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and beat in the other, resulting in an average negative surprise of 2.23%. This is depicted in the graph below:Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain’s focus on setting up data-center businesses bodes well for the company.  Internal storage rental growth rate for 2018 is expected in the 3-3.5% range, backed by volume growth and pricing improvement. We believe stellar organic growth and the company’s initiatives to expand its core storage business will benefit the first-quarter results.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for storage rentals from North- America data management of $72 million indicates a sequential increase of 4.3%. Likewise, the consensus estimate for storage rentals from Western European business of $80 million reflects an increase of 1.3% from the previous quarter.In addition, the company’s service revenues, which comprise charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services, are also expected to moderately improve sequentially. Service revenues from its North American records and information management business will likely be up 0.5% moderately, while the same from the Western Europe business is anticipated to rise nearly 2%.  Nonetheless, Iron Mountain has grown its business principally through acquisitions, which have affected its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill. Hence, a highly leveraged balance sheet is predicted to limit any robust margin improvement.In the past six months, the company has underperformed the industry it belongs to.  The stock has dipped 16.5%, while the industry incurred a loss of 9.8% during this time frame. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Iron Mountain’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks Rank: Iron Mountain carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

219,IRM,"In a bid to expand its Phoenix data-center campus, Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) recently announced the ground breaking of a new 550,000-square-foot facility.  It will be built on a nine-acre land parcel over the next five years. This 48-megawatt (MW) project with multi-tenant and cloud facility will be delivered in two phases. The first phase is expected to complete in June 2019, with a 24 MW building, spanning 307,000 square feet of space. The second phase will provide a 48 MW building.Combined with the company’s existing 38 MW data center in the campus, the latest development will enhance Iron Mountain’s Phoenix campus with 100 MW. Further, it will support the rising needs of new and existing customers, including financial services, public cloud providers, aerospace and technology companies, who stand to benefit from more than 25 carrier and network providers present on the campus.  In fact, this $430-million project is a strategic fit as it will enable the company to expand its presence in one of the fastest-growing data-center markets in the United States. Notably, with lower power costs, higher tax efficiency, and negligible geographic and weather-related risks, Phoenix is emerging as an active data-center market.Per management, this expansion will cater to the increasing needs of hyperscale, public cloud and global enterprise organizations. In fact, the company’s total data-center portfolio potential amounts to more than 285 MW globally.Iron Mountain has been focusing on an aggressive expansion strategy to penetrate key markets. Recently, it debuted in Montana with two new information management facilities. (Read more: Iron Mountain Sets Foot in Montana With Two New Facilities). Further, in a bid to expand into Croatia, the company announced the acquisition of Zagreb-based Arhiv Trezor. Such measures will likely supportits organic growth in storage revenues and help expand the company’s customer base.However, these endeavors require heavy investments to set up data centers and acquire new business. Moreover, frequent acquisitions carry higher integration risks, which could impact organic growth.Also, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet may limit its growth plans and worsen its risk profile. Hence, the impact of such capital-intensive strategies on the company’s financials and profitability is unavoidable.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has underperformed its industry in the past six months.

220,IRM,"Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16.Last quarter, normalized funds from operations (FFO) of 55 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Moreover, the company delivered an average negative surprise of 0.63% in the trailing four quarters.However, FFO increased 10% year over year driven by 2.4% increase in revenues, which totaled $966 million. The figure beat the consensus mark of $958 million.The strong year-over-year performance can primarily be attributed to synergies from Recall Holdings acquisition, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of its storage rental business. Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIron Mountain’s strong product portfolio, increasing market share and promising international business are key catalysts.The company is investing a lot in setting up data center business. Notably, the acquisition of FORTRUST will add 9 MW of existing capacity and opportunity for further expansion in the future.Combined with the data center facility in North Virginia, the company will have 30 megawatts of capacity by year end, per management. Moreover, Iron Mountain’s announcement to acquire data centers in London and Singapore will help it gain ground in the international markets.Further, the acquisition of OEC Records Management significantly expands the company’s presence in India. The acquisition adds 16 facilities in 10 cities and 3.6 million cubic feet of storage.However, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to falling activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Further, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Iron Mountain is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

221,IRM,"We are in the heart of the ongoing reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there have been a deluge of Q2 earnings releases this week, and next we have Welltower Inc. , Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) and Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) releasing quarterly numbers on Jul 28.Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind.In fact, a number of asset categories displayed strength in second-quarter 2017, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery. Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm – CBRE Group Inc.  – the overall U.S. industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter, with the industrial availability rate contracting 10 basis points to 7.8%.In addition, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the second quarter amid a balanced demand-supply environment. Moreover, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data are not only helping tech companies, these are also driving demand for data center REITs. Additionally, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand levels.However, dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. Also, for healthcare REITs, rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have put a pressure on pricing in some markets.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others may disappoint this earnings season. However to predict that, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of a beat this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.Let’s have a look at what’s in store for the three REITs set to release quarterly results on Friday:Toledo, OH-based, Welltower’s efforts to enhance its healthcare real estate portfolio quality through prudent asset allocation and disposal, along with its diversified portfolio, are anticipated to boost its performance in the quarter to be reported. Additionally, rising senior citizen population will likely prove conducive to growth.However, interest rate hike remains a concern for Welltower due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets. In addition, increased deliveries in certain markets are likely to adversely affect the company's pricing power and occupancy. Further, intense competition from national and local healthcare operators curtails the company’s power to significantly improve its top line and ink deals at attractive rates. (Read more: What's in the Cards for Welltower in Q2 Earnings?)Welltower has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. However, it currently has a Zacks Rank #4, which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP.Over the trailing four quarters, Welltower posted in-line funds from operations (“FFO”) per share in one occasion and beat estimates in the other three, recording an average positive surprise of 0.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Welltower Inc. QuoteNote: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Chicago, IL-based healthcare REIT Ventas is anticipated to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from its diversification efforts, increasing healthcare spending and aging population. Furthermore, its strong balance sheet positions it well for growth. Moreover, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment that has grabbed attention and Ventas has, by now, already committed nearly $2 billion to this segment.However, hike in interest rate is a concern for Ventas, as the company has considerable exposure to long-term leased assets. Additionally, rising supply of senior housing units is expected to have a pressure on pricing in some of the company’s markets. (Read more: Ventas to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Ventas has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

224,IRM,"Iron Mountain (IRM  -  Free Report) reported disappointing fourth quarter results and lowered its 2015 revenue and earnings guidance on February 20. This prompted analysts to revise their estimates meaningfully lower for both 2015 and 2016, sending the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
"
225,IRM,"Despite this, shares trade at a lofty 30x forward earnings and sport an enterprise value to cash flow ratio of 18.
"
226,IRM,"Iron Mountain stores records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provides information management services to various organizations around the world. The company generates its revenues by renting storage space to its customer base in approximately 1,100 facilities around the globe and providing these customers with an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services.

227,IRM,"Iron Mountain began operating as a REIT in 2014.
"
228,IRM,"Fourth Quarter Results
"
229,IRM,"Iron Mountain reported its fourth quarter results on February 20. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.25, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.31. Funds from operation, which takes net income (unadjusted) and adds back real estate depreciation expenses, was $0.28 for Q4.
"
230,IRM,"Total revenues rose 1% to $778 million, which was below the consensus of $788 million. A strong dollar was a headwind in the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, revenue rose 5%.
"
231,IRM,"'Storage Rental' revenue, which accounted for 60% of total revenue, increased 2% year-over-year, while 'Service' declined slightly.
"
232,IRM,"Estimates Falling
"
233,IRM,"Following soft Q4 results, management lowered its 2015 adjusted EPS guidance from a previous range of $1.23-$1.38 to $1.15-$1.30. It also lowered its revenue guidance from a range of $3.135-$3.290 billion to $3.030-$3.150 billion. This was due in part to foreign currency headwinds.
"
234,IRM,"Analysts revised their estimates lower for both 2015 and 2016, enough to send the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). This places Iron Mountain in the bottom 5% of all companies that Zacks ranks based on earnings estimate revisions.
"
235,IRM,"The 2015 Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $1.23, down from $1.34 before the report. The 2016 consensus is currently $1.30, down from $1.45 over the same period. You can see the drop in consensus estimates in the following chart:
"
236,IRM,"Lofty Valuation
"
237,IRM,"Despite weak earnings momentum, shares of Iron Mountain trade at a lofty 30x 12-month forward earnings. And its enterprise value to cash flow ratio certainly doesn't look like much of a value at 18x.
"
238,IRM,"Investors may be drawn to Iron Mountain's 5% dividend yield. However, the company has paid out significantly more in dividends the last three years than it has generated in free cash flow. It has plugged this gap with the issuance of significant amounts of debt. Its balance sheet is now highly levered with a debt/equity ratio of 5.4.
"
239,IRM,"The Bottom Line
"
240,IRM,"With weak earnings momentum, continued foreign currency headwinds and lofty valuation, investors should consider looking elsewhere for now.
