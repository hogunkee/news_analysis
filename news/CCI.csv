The decline in the pattern is a restrained 12%, however.In January, when Crown Castle reported fourth-quarter results, management raised its 2018 forecast for certain metrics.""In the near-term, we remain excited by the increasing investment activity by our customers that is translating to an expected increase in new leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions in 2018,"" the company said. CEO Jay Brown added that the company is ""well positioned to benefit from the continued growth in demand for data.

While T-Mobile has gained subscriber and revenue share vs. AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), Sprint's brand is still weak in comparison. Sprint's most valuable asset is radio spectrum well-suited for next-generation 5G services.Under a newly proposed deal, ownership would be structured so that Deutsche Telekom could consolidate the combined financial results of T-Mobile and Sprint, while SoftBank still has a say in management, reports said.Even if SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom reach an agreement, the big question is whether the Trump administration will approve a merger that reduces the number of national wireless firms to three from four.A Sprint merger with T-Mobile would create a three-player market, including Verizon and AT&T.The entry of cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) into the wireless market could boost chances of a merger being approved, analysts say.Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has courted President Trump with pledges to invest in the U.S.Japan-based Softbank in October 2012 bought a controlling stake in struggling Sprint.

5,CCI,"Sprint's (S) network investment plans could offer a massive clue on whether merger talks with T-Mobile US (TMUS) will go anywhere, analysts said Wednesday.The key is whether Sprint puts money into capital spending, and how much. Simon Flannery, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says that indicator could come soon.""Keep an eye on Sprint's capex line — if it comes in light over the next two quarters, it could suggest Sprint has pushed off its investment plans potentially related to renewed conversations with T-Mobile,"" Flannery said in a note to clients.Others on Wall Street echoed that sentiment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""With cost synergies being the primary factor supporting a combination, Sprint's reversal of its spending strategy is likely to be taken into (account) when considering potential valuation levels,"" Amir Rozwadowski, a Barclays analyst, said in his report.Shares in Sprint and T-Mobile surged on Tuesday after a report said the two wireless service providers are back at the negotiating table. The stock action was calmer Wednesday. Sprint had been down more than 2% but fought back to near break-even ground, losing just 2 cents to close at 6 on the stock market today. Meanwhile, T-Mobile also edged down 0.3% to finish at 62.92.Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo, said the prospect of Sprint investing in its network may have lit a fire under T-Mobile.""We believe T-Mobile was likely was motivated to re-engage in discussions upon hearing of Sprint's plans for aggressive network investment over the next two years,"" Fritzsche said in her note to clients. ""T-Mobile had put the synergy number on a merger at around $40 billion in the fall of 2017. We believe the majority of these synergies were around network savings. Put another way, the more Sprint invests in the network now, the lower that synergy opportunity becomes.""And Craig Moffett, analyst at MofffettNathanson, points out making investments now is troublesome for Sprint.""(Network investment) will require that Sprint amend and extend existing tower leases, deploy new equipment, and enter into entirely new leases for both towers and backhaul,"" Moffett said in his report. ""At best, much of this capital spending would be wasted should they merge with T-Mobile. At worst, these new leases would meaningfully reduce the net synergies from a merger.""Japan-based SoftBank controls Sprint while Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) holds a majority stake in T-Mobile.

6,CCI,"Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) sold off on Monday as investors focused on chances that their proposed merger will be approved by federal regulators.""The market seems to be ascribing very low odds to approval,"" New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said in a report to clients.Sprint and T-Mobile announced their merger deal on Sunday.

Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Regulatory approval is a tossup in our view,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in his note to clients.If the deal is blocked by regulators, Sprint has the most to lose, analysts say. That's because debt-laden Sprint's competitive position is much weaker than T-Mobile, which has been gaining share vs. Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T). Plus, a breakup fee is not included in the merger agreement.One question is whether federal regulators will approve a merger that reduces the number of national wireless firms to three from four. The other two major players in the market are Verizon and AT&T.Further, foreign ownership could be a hot potato amid rising trade tensions between the Trump administration and Germany, says one analyst.""One may ask how the current U.S. administration, which places much emphasis on 'putting America first,' will view the creation of a major foreign-controlled operator that aims to deliver significant synergies to its German and Japanese majority shareholders — no matter how these synergies are pitched,"" Jefferies analyst Ulrich Rathe said in his report.President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move opposed by German business and Chancellor Angela Merkel. The U.S. ran a nearly $65 billion trade deficit in goods with Germany last year. President Trump has been critical of Merkel's trade policies, saying German imports have damaged the U.S. manufacturing industry in such areas as car production.Before the merger announcement, Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son had courted President Trump with pledges to invest in the U.S. and create jobs.""While we believe the merger has an improved chance of regulatory approval given management's outlook for job creation, there are likely to remain concerns about customer concentration and the impact on overall consumer pricing given that T-Mobile and Sprint were market leaders in pricing,"" William Blair analyst Jim Breen said in his note.Sprint and T-Mobile promise to sustain competition by investing in next-generation 5G technology. In turn, the 5G investments would create jobs, they say.Deutsche Telekom plans to own a 42% stake in a combined Sprint-T-Mobile, with SoftBank taking a 27% share. Public shareholders get the rest of the company.The all-stock transaction has an exchange rate of one T-Mobile share per 9.75 Sprint shares. It reflects T-Mobile's market resurgence while debt-laden Sprint's turnaround remained in question.Deutsche Telekom says it would appoint 9 out of 14 board members and consolidate the merged company's financial results.Shares in AT&T slipped 1% to 32.70.

9,CCI,"The best sector mutual funds last year thrived in several areas, and the number of funds winning IBD Mutual Funds 2018 Awards jumped to 32 from the previous year's 13.This year the best sector mutual funds represented technology, defense and aerospace, media and telecom, health care and retail. Each of the top-performing sector funds not only surpassed the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years, but was also the top fund in its sector ranked by 10-year performance.According to Morningstar, a sector mutual fund invests solely in a general industry — such as technology — or in a more specific industry, like an internet company. But there can be a great deal of overlap among the sectors. For example, Amazon.com featured heavily in three of the five featured sector funds — technology, retail and media — while other FANG stocks held prominent roles as well.The components and weighting within the fund dictate its performance compared with the S&P 500.Technology stocks were among the year's best performers, as institutions flocked to the leading names — like the FANG stocks — in the sector.T. Rowe Global Technology (PRGTX) was the top fund within the U.S. technology sector, coming in with a 47.04% return in 2017, more than doubling the S&P 500's 21.83% return and also trouncing the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 28.2% return. The fund targets potential winners within specific technological themes, like cloud computing.Holdings that drove 2017's outperformance include Big Cap 20 member Salesforce.com (CRM) and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — a position which has since been sold. The fund also saw big gains from Chinese stock leaders Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs of Dec. 31, the fund had nearly 35% of its assets in its top five holdings, which are exhibiting strong fundamental and technical action.New top holdings include dynamic electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Shares of Tesla moved up 46% in 2017, but have been mostly stagnant since September 2017. Since then, the stock has been trading sideways in a range from 290 to about 360.Meanwhile, Apple-supplier Broadcom fell victim to slowing iPhone sales, as the stock fell 21% from its highs in early February. The stock is consolidating at its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.The defense industry saw strong gains in 2017, as President Trump boosted military spending.  Blue chip stock and defense leader Boeing (BA) paced the advancers with a gain of nearly 90%.Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace (FSDAX) jumped 34.21% in 2017. Its top holdings include Dow Jones Industrials name Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).While Boeing and Northrop — up 32% in 2017 — are extended from recent buy points, General Dynamics hasn't had the same torrid advanced and is near a 229.64 flat-base entry.Social media has become a major segment of the media & telecom sector and no company has a larger social media impact than Facebook (FB).T. Rowe Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) rose 32.99% in 2017. According to Morningstar, the fund is a bit different from the other sector funds in the communications category. While the fund has several communication tower names like American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), it also looks for high-growth companies that are disrupting the industry, like Amazon.The two tower companies had gains of 35% and 28%, respectively, in 2017. As such, the fund's performance was driven by its top three holdings: Amazon.com, Alibaba and Facebook.In a sector not typically known for large advances, health care fund Delaware Healthcare (DLHIX) put in a strong performance in 2017 with a 32.32% rise.The $512 million fund's performance was driven by its position in Germany-based MorphoSys — which advanced nearly 60% — and is involved in the development and research of antibodies. The foreign biotech is also the fund's biggest position as of the end of January at over 7%.Its top U.S.-based position is ethical drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY), but that didn't spark the fund's 2017 performance, as the stock only rose about 15% last year.Retailers continue to struggle with the Amazon Effect, creating winners and losers within the sector. The obvious retail winner in 2017 was e-commerce giant Amazon.In 2017, Fidelity Select Retail (FSRPX) delivered a 25.82% return due to its long-term investment in the industry leader Amazon.A whopping 40% of the $2.3 billion fund's portfolio is tied to e-commerce giant Amazon (23%) and Home Depot (HD) (17%). Both stocks were paramount to the fund's return in 2017 and will again in 2018 if their positions remain that big.The Fidelity Select Retail fund has owned Amazon since August 2005 — according to Morningstar — while Home Depot was first purchased in August 2008. Last year, Amazon ran up 56%, accounting for a large portion of the fund's annual gains. The stock is trading near its highs and nearly 30% above its most recent buy point — a flat base's 1,213.51 entry.In the meantime, the home improvement retailer had a solid 41% advance in 2017. The retailer was driven higher by solid consumer spending and a strong housing cycle.

14,CCI,"Merger talks that seem to have failed between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) rattled the telecom industry on Monday as investors sent up shares of Charter Communications (CHTR) and Dish Network (DISH) as possible partners for Sprint and T-Mobile — and boosted the fortunes of cellphone tower companies as well — while other telecom firms fell.XCharter gained 3.9% to 348.40 on speculation that Softbank could renew takeover talks with the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).  Cable industry pioneer John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBDRA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter. Over the summer, Charter signaled that it's not interested in being acquired by Softbank.Meanwhile, Dish Network, another potential Sprint partner, climbed 5.7% to 50.82 on speculation it could eventually end up as a T-Mobile partner.The on-again, off-again talks between Sprint parent Softbank and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom collapsed over the weekend with both sides saying the deal is finally off. Sprint plunged 11.5% to close at 5.90 on the stock market today. T-Mobile lost 5.7% to finish at 55.54.AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) slipped as investors fretted that wireless competition will re-intensify after a brief lull.

16,CCI,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

17,CCI,"Crown Castle International (CCI) shares fell Wednesday, following the formal announcement that it would acquire Lightower Fiber Networks for about $7.1 billion in cash.Crown Castle also released second-quarter results before the market open.The deal to buy Lightower provides Crown Castle the ability to expand its cellular services in highly populated urban areas in Northeastern metro markets, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia, the company said. It also will help provide 5G wireless infrastructure to customers such as Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T).The deal originally was reported Monday, and some analysts said the deal is pricey. Crown Castle also announced a public offering of $3.25 billion worth of common shares, and $1.5 billion worth of convertible preferred stock.Crown Castle stock fell 2.1% to close at 98.66 on the stock market today.Crown Castle is a real estate investment trust that owns, operates and leases a network of wireless communication towers in the U.S., with about 40,000 towers. With the Lightower acquisition, Crown Castle will expand the miles of fiber it controls to 60,000, from 32,000. Lightower is privately owned by Pamlico Capital, Berkshire Partners and other investors.IBD'S TAKE: Crown Castle stock is down 7% since reports first surfaced that it had bid for Lightower.

18,CCI,"Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday announced that it was naming a new managing director for Greater China, a huge but declining market for the iPhone maker. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) said SolarCity co-founder Peter Rive is leaving the company, while wireless tower operator Crown Castle International (CCI) confirmed a $7.1 billion takeover.XApple said Isabel Ge Mahe, its vice president of wireless technologies, will be vice president and managing director of Greater China. Apple's stock has risen for eight straight sessions, retaking its key 50-day moving average. But its greater China sales have fallen for five straight quarters, amid greater local smartphone competition.Peter Rive will exit Tesla, the electric car and alternative energy company said. Rive is a cousin of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. His brother, Lyndon Rive, left in May.Crown Castle will acquire privately held Lightower Fiber Networks for about $7.1 billion cash as it looks to provide 5G wireless services in urban areas. Crown Castle had fallen 4.4% this week on widespread reports that a deal was close, amid concerns about the price tag.

19,CCI,"Cell-tower operator Crown Castle International (CCI) has bid for broadband-service provider Lightower Fiber Networks in a $7 billion deal that would help Crown Castle provide 5G wireless infrastructure to customers such as Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T), reports said Monday.XPrivately held Lightower's fiber-optic network would mesh with Crown Castle's plans to build out ""small-cell"" radio antennas for 5G services in urban areas. The small-cell antennas — hung on utility poles or building rooftops — will require fiber-optic connections to local hubs, which in turn link to cloud-computing infrastructure as well as long-distance networks.Some analysts, though, view the $7 billion price tag, which includes debt, as pricey.""Crown Castle has not been shy about its desire to acquire more of the right type of fiber assets to bolster its small-cell business. Should reported valuation levels prove true ($7 billion), an equity component to financing a deal is likely,"" Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski said in a note to clients.Shares in Crown Castle closed down 4.2% at 96.81 in the stock market today. Shares in Zayo Holdings (ZAYO), a rival of Lightower that has been viewed as a takeover candidate, edged up 1.7% to 30.87.Lightower's network has 33,000 route miles throughout the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic providing connections to service locations and data centers. Meanwhile, Crown Castle has been investing in small-cell technology more than peers American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC).Crown Castle reports earnings on Wednesday.Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo, says Verizon and AT&T are already Lightower's top customers.IBD'S TAKE:  Crown Castle stock is up 12% in 2017 but has been outperformed by peers American Tower, up 27%, and SBA Communications, up 31%. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Fritzsche says there may be upside for Zayo if Lightower is acquired.""While Lightower is admittedly growing top-line at a much faster rate than Zayo, it should be noted Zayo covers three times the geography of Lightower — with dense fiber network footprints in many other densely populated U.S. cities,"" she said in a note to clients.The advent of 5G networks is expected to enable faster wireless internet services to homes as well as high-speed connections to drones and self-driving cars.RELATED:Tesla Stock Drops As Autopilot Feature Blamed For CrashAmazon, Dish Wireless Deal Would Target Internet Of Things: CitiWhen Software Mergers Heat Up, These Companies Will Be Buyers

20,CCI,"Stocks rolled into the first real week of the earnings season with mixed feelings, as names like Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) backed away from early highs but remained positive, with Netflix shares soaring in after-hours action on its Q2 results.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 all closed within 0.03% of their starting position. Small caps had a shade more momentum, lifting the Russell 2000 index 0.1%.A weak reading on a New York-region manufacturing gauge and signs of more possible regulatory intervention in China's markets may have rattled investors early in the session. But investors were also looking toward Netflix's Q2 report and the week's increasingly busy earnings schedule, and the market was due for a breather after last week's strong performance.Specialty steel makers were at the top of the sessions best-performing industries, led by Carpenter Technology's (CRS) 6% gain. Retail and mining groups posted many of the day's strongest moves. Macy's (M), Conn's (CONN) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) figured powerfully in those advances.Netflix bolted 8% higher after reporting strong subscriber growth and guidance despite weaker-than-expected Q2 earnings.Apple notched its seventh straight advance, retaking its 50-day moving average, although a retreat from early highs left the stock below the session's midway mark, only pennies above the 50-day line in a weak-volume move.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) each rose 2%, helping boost the Nasdaq 100.On the Dow, Apple couldn't outpull IBM (IBM) and JPMorgan (JPM), which each dropped more than 1%.Trucking fleet operator J.B. Hunt (JBHT) rolled up a 3% gain in heavy trade, despite reporting second-quarter earnings below analysts' targets.

Small caps did well with the Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking a tad higher than Tuesday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, August West Texas Intermediate crude oil rallied 72 cents, or 1.6%, to $47.12 a barrel, about a six-week high, after weekly U.S. supply data showed a sharp drop in stockpiles last week. Meanwhile, production climbed to the highest level since July 2015, according to the Energy Information Administration.In the stock market today, fiber-optic stocks outperformed again. The outright leader in the group is Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), but it's too late to buy because the stock is extended in price after a 25% gain last week. Shares are up an additional 13% this week.Earlier today, Crown Castle International (CCI) announced plans to buy Lightower for $7.1 billion. The deal will nearly double the miles of fiber that Crown Castle controls to 60,000 from 32,000, allowing it to expand its cellular service in key markets, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia.Chip-equipment firms got another lift after Dutch firm ASML Holding (ASML) jumped 4.5% on strong earnings. Industry-group peer MKS Instruments (MKSI) was featured in Tuesday's Sector Leaders column.Inside the IBD 50, chip-equipment firms, Ichor (ICHR), Nova Measuring Instruments (NVMI)and Lam Research (LRCX) outperformed with gains of 3% to 4%. The IBD 50 index of leading growth stocks looked poised for another day of outperformance, with 20 names up 1% or more.Also in the IBD 50, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) popped 2.5% to 119.42, making a good case for support at the 50-day moving average as it trades just below a 120.84 alternate-handle entry.Elsewhere, U.S. spice maker McCormick (MKC) slumped 5% on news it's acquiring Reckitt Benckiser's North American food business for $4.2 billion.

22,CCI,"The rally in cellphone tower stocks could lose steam, says brokerage Raymond James, which on Monday downgraded American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) on valuation and merger speculation.Ric Prentiss, a Raymond James analyst, downgraded American Tower and SBA Communications to outperform from ""strong buy"" and Crown Castle to market-perform from outperform.""The prospects of an improving U.S. tower leasing environment and lower interest rates have paved the way for an impressive start for tower stocks in 2017 with year-to-date total returns of 19%, 24% and 30% for Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA Communications,"" Prentiss said in a report.Prentiss added that he's ""taking some chips off the table,"" with valuation multiples expanded ""to the upper range of their historical levels.""American Tower lost 0.8% to 129.18, Crown Castle was up marginally to 102.21 and SBA slid 1.4% to 132.42 on the stock market today.Wireless phone companies such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) rent tower space to house radio antennas. Most towers house radio antennas from multiple carriers.Prentiss notes speculation that Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) could agree to merge. If approved, a Sprint merger with T-Mobile would eliminate one customer of the tower companies.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 80 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise.

25,CCI,"Plans by Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) to deploy new 5G wireless internet services vs. entrenched cable companies such as Comcast (CMCSA) will get a boost from the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission, says a Cowen & Co. report.Ajit Pai, recently named FCC chairman by President Trump, aims to make it easier for phone companies to get local government approval for the ""small-cell"" networks required for 5G services in urban areas.Local governments are expected to seek fees for attaching radio antennas to public infrastructure, such as utility poles and traffic lights. Cities will likely challenge any FCC limits on fees, says the Cowen report.""We think Chairman Pai will now pivot to the ground game — lowering local barriers for small-cell deployment,"" said the Cowen & Co. report. ""An aggressive FCC ruling has the potential to materially bend the cost curve of 5G deployment.""Verizon is testing 5G services in 11 U.S. cities and has stated plans for a ""meaningful"" commercial deployment of 5G broadband services in 2018.

Pai could seek support for 5G initiatives from the FCC's Democratic members, says the Cowen report.While Verizon has talked up the potential of 5G wireless services as competition for cable TV firms' broadband, it's also studying new business cases such as providing data links to self-driving cars.Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) have downplayed the threat of 5G residential broadband services. Instead, they've told investors they're well-positioned to partner with phone companies in 5G deployment, owing to their extensive fiber-optic wiring in local neighborhoods.It's unclear, though, whether a Verizon-cable 5G partnership would target self-driving cars or other emerging applications.Verizon shares rose 0.2% on the stock market today, while Verizon climbed 0.4%. Comcast gained 0.7% and Charter Communications 0.2%.RELATED:Verizon, Charter Merger Knocked On 5G Synergies

26,CCI,"Florida-based utility NextEra Energy (NEE) continues being a dependable dividend stock and made its customary annual increase last month. The company raised the quarterly dividend to 98.25 cents a share from 87 cents. The dividend made the annualized yield 3%. NextEra said the increase was part of a plan announced in 2015 for 12% to 14% annual growth in dividends…

27,CCI,"Cellphone tower stocks could gain from the unlimited-data war pitting insurgents T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S) vs. incumbents AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), analysts say.Shares in American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) have clawed back from a late 2016 sell-off tied to President Trump's surprise election. One view is that a Sprint merger with T-Mobile is more likely in a Trump administration and a deal could lower demand for cell towers.On the other hand, the four national wireless firms are rolling out more unlimited-data plans as subscriber growth slows in a mature market. Verizon and AT&T in February reintroduced unlimited plans to counter market share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint.""The unlimited fight taking place among the wireless carriers promises to ensure they keep investing in their networks,"" said Colby Synesael, a Cowen & Co. analyst in an email.Wireless phone companies rent tower space to house radio antennas. Phone companies normally sign leases of 15-20 years with tower firms. Most towers house radio antennas from multiple carriers.SBA Communications stock rose 0.2% to close at 115.41 on the stock market today. Shares in American Tower inched down a penny to 114.70. Crown Castle stock was down marginally to 91.50. American Tower stock has neared a technical buy point of 118.36 while SBA Communications is also close to a 118.67 buy point. Crown Castle has a buy point of 102.92.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. But IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 90 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise. Learn about other dividend-paying alternatives at IBD's Income Investor.Another reason for upbeat views on tower stocks is that AT&T appears likely to win the federal contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless-broadband network dedicated to public safety. As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum.""Investors were positive going into (fourth-quarter) earnings and coming out I think investors liked the initial guidance but feel it is still conservative,"" added Cowen's Synesael.One long-term wild card for tower stocks is the deployment of 5G wireless services. Verizon has stated that it plans to be a leader in next-generation 5G wireless services, which will require ""small-cell"" technology in urban areas.Crown Castle has made acquisitions to acquire small-cell technology while rivals American Tower and SBA Communications have been more focused on overseas acquisitions, analysts say.RELATED:Does Verizon Have An Edge On T-Mobile, AT&T In Unlimited War?
"
28,CCI,"As telecom companies ramp up investments in 5G wireless technology, investors should focus on chip and network equipment manufacturers as well as cell-tower operators and fiber-optic-gear makers, says an in-depth research report by Cowen & Co.Trials of 5G wireless networks are underway, but wide-scale deployment isn't expected until 2020.""At this early juncture, we believe the best way to play 5G is to invest in the companies that will help facilitate the network buildouts, including the chip/equipment manufacturers and the tower/fiber providers,"" said the report.Cowen flagged American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC); fiber-optic-gear makers Acacia Communications (ACIA), Ciena (CIEN) and Oclaro (OCLR); fiber-optic-network operator Zayo Holdings (ZAYO); and chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM).IBD'S TAKE: Shares of several of Cowen's 5G picks are struggling. Oclaro, though, has a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, while Ciena's CR is 90. Zayo has a technical buy point of 35.75. Learn more about CRs and CANSLIM investing, and learn more about Oclaro and other stocks at IBD Stock Checkup. Many of the companies aiming to put 5G on the fast track — Qualcomm, Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Verizon Communications (VZ) — expect initial trials to involve fixed wireless broadband services to residential homes, as well as the Internet of Things.IoT encompasses such burgeoning arenas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture.""5G will require a lot more antennas/radios in a lot more locations of which the majority will need to be connected with fiber,"" said Cowen. ""This serendipitously will provide an opportunity for AT&T (T)/Verizon to again distance themselves from Sprint/T-Mobile in terms of network, because they will be able/willing to make the sizable investment to build out this new topology.""South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in pre-standard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now but will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason""5G will be about flexibility and versatility as the network will be software-based, scalable, sliceable, and 'versioned' for different verticals/users. 5G will provide a new level of data coordination and help make sense of data as the Big Data industry takes on a much larger and more meaningful role in our lives,"" Cowen's report said.Of the stocks cited, the only big mover in midday trading in the stock market today was Qualcomm, which plunged 12.7% to close at 54.88 on continued fallout from Apple's (AAPL) suit against the mobile chipmaker on Friday over technology licensing. Qualcomm, which called Apple's suit ""baseless,"" got at least one downgrade Monday, from Nomura Instinet, ahead of its earnings due after the close Wednesday. Nomura Instinet said regulatory scrutiny could impact Qualcomm's pending $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). NXP stock lost 1.8% to close at 96. RELATED:Qualcomm: Apple Is 'Encouraging Regulatory Attacks'CES: Intel Grabs 5G Spotlight From Qualcomm; AT&T Expands 5G Trials  
"
29,CCI,"Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem owe much of their torrid growth to the 3G and 4G wireless networks that whisked games, apps, photos and video to the computerlike smartphones.Now the 5G, or fifth generation, wireless revolution is near, promising data speeds 50 to 100 times faster than 4G LTE networks. Sure it'll improve smartphones, but that's not the point. Analysts say 5G's biggest impact will be to drive the proliferation of the Internet of Things — billions of connected devices.The business case for 5G is all about IoT, an evolution, or maybe revolution, that will take the internet era into new territories. Companies including chipmakers, network equipment makers and telecom service providers are investing heavily in the technology, with the first products to roll out in 2017.""With 5G, there are going to be many more device categories,"" Matt Grob, Qualcomm chief technology officer, told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: 5G holds big promise for the future, but how are key players performing now? One company worth watching is Arista Networks, a 2014 IPO that is battling Cisco Systems, the longtime networking gear leader. Arista is on the IBD 50 ranking of the top-performing stocks,  a good place to look for stocks possibly worth buying.IoT encompasses such burgeoning arenas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture. Farmers will, for example, know exactly when to harvest for best yields based on air temperature and soil moisture.Many of the companies aiming to put 5G on the fast track — Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Verizon Communications (VZ) to name a few — expect new revenue streams from the IoT and game-changing apps outside of smartphones.Qualcomm aims to ship its first 5G modem chips for phones in the second half of 2017, with follow-on chips targeting the IoT.Qualcomm, like others, expects 5G to evolve on multiple tracks: IoT, smartphones and fixed residential. While Apple, Samsung and others will ship 5G smartphones only after standards are rubber-stamped, which observers say will be a work in progress until 2020 or later, carriers are closer with ""fixed"" 5G, a wireless broadband service provided from a fixed point to homes in limited areas. If  fixed 5G to homes works well in trials, Verizon says it will pursue a commercial rollout city-by-city in 2018 and 2019. It hasn't identified the cities yet.With 4G networks, it costs wireless firms about $1 to deliver a gigabyte of data. 5G networks promise much better economics. It also will provide virtually uninterrupted communications for new apps.""5G is going to bring lower costs per bit, lower latency and highly reliable services,"" Grob said. ""So it's going to be great for autonomous vehicles, medical devices and for infrastructure and smart cities. There are more companies taking part in the standards development for 5G than ever.""Medical applications include remote monitoring of devices like EKGs or blood pressure monitors. Smart city technologies include traffic signals that adjust to vehicle flows and sensor-based water systems that test for contaminants in real time.The Internet of Things isn't waiting on 5G. AT&T (T) already has some 8 million web-connected cars linked to its 4G network. U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) says it had 41 million IoT connections as of Sept. 30. Cisco says its gear links 4.9 billion devices now and will connect 12.2 billion by 2020, and few will be 5G.But the more speed, the better.Some companies might get a good boost early in the 5G revolution, such as makers of network testing gear like Keysight Technology (KEYS). Independent testing is a big part of the standards-setting process.Early on, analysts say Xilinx (XLNX) programmable chips will be useful for prototyping 5G products, while the higher radio frequency bands associated with 5G may create long-term opportunities for RF chip leaders Broadcom (AVGO) , Qorvo (QRVO) and Murata.As small cells are deployed in urban areas, cell tower firm Crown Castle (CCI) and startup Tarana Wireless aim to capture share. Tarana's biggest investor is AT&T. Some analysts view Zayo Holdings (ZAYO) as a takeover candidate, because small cell systems require fiber-optic links in metro areas for long-haul transport.Next-generation data centers — to keep all these things humming on the internet — will be another battleground, as Cisco takes on Arista Networks (ANET), startup Affirmed Networks and others.Meanwhile, startup SigFox, the LoRa alliance — with members including Cisco and IBM (IBM) — and others aim to provide all IoT devices with low-power connections via Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum.5G backers aim to create flexible networks that provide both the high-bandwidth connections required by fast-moving, self-driving cars in urban areas and always-on, reliable, low-data-rate connections needed by parking meters, oil rig sensors or other devices.While 4G networks provide cars with infotainment, 5G services are expected to provide real-time environmental data so, for example, driverless cars can avoid collisions.To service various types of devices, wireless networks will need to utilize both very high radio frequencies not yet commercialized and lower-band airwaves. Improved radio antennas and more complex semiconductors are expected to make higher frequencies usable for 5G.In urban areas, hundreds of ""small cell"" antennas hung on utility poles or buildings will work together, analysts say.Wireless networks and telecom data centers will be upgraded to provide both high and low data rate services, again to service various types of sensors and devices. AT&T and Verizon are among the leaders in moving to software-defined-network technology. SDN will help usher in 5G. With it, wireless firms can improve network bandwidth allocation and provide cloud-based, on-demand services.Part of the 5G revolution involves connecting a network of data centers to the IoT. That's a focus for Intel, Cisco, China's Huawei and many other companies.""5G will be a whole transformation of the network to virtualization, providing more flexibility and agility,"" said Jean Luc Valente, vice president of product management for Cisco's cloud and virtualization group. ""With 5G, with connected cars, some data is going to be collected, maybe at a traffic light intersection. Those data nuggets will be (analyzed), maybe not in the back-end data center, maybe much closer in a micro-cloud."" The upshot, among many benefits, is that self-driving cars won't collide.Cisco aims to provide cloud-based IoT services as it shifts away from hardware sales. The company partnered in February with Intel and Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC) to start selling a swath of 5G hardware and services. They are involved in 5G trials by Verizon and others.As 5G sparks partnerships, it's also generating M&As with 5G or IoT angles.Qualcomm expects its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to pay dividends in autonomous cars. Japan-based SoftBank acquired wireless chip designer ARM Holdings for $31 billion with an eye toward I0T.AT&T says it will move to 5G faster if regulators approve its acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), part of its strategy to whisk more video to mobile devices.Cisco bought Jasper in March for $1.4 billion, gaining a cloud-based IoT platform. Verizon in February announced an agreement to acquire XO Communications, which owns high-frequency spectrum for 5G services, for $1.8 billion.Internet leaders, too, are jockeying for leading roles in 5G. Facebook (FB) is working with equipment vendors and carriers on standards. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is developing open software for the IoT.For Intel, 5G and IoT offer an opportunity to turn its money-losing mobile business around, says Citigroup. For Qualcomm, the shift to 5G should provide higher profit margins as the 4G generation matures.South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in prestandard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. KT plans to showcase 5G technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics, though just how isn't known.Aside from the Internet of Things and 5G mobility, Verizon is eyeing fixed 5G wireless broadband services to homes, potentially taking on cable TV companies. It's not clear yet if 5G fixed broadband could provide high-speed internet in neighborhoods or blanket bigger areas, analysts say. The Verizon trials will help determine that.Verizon has been investing across the board — in SDN, small cell technology and fixed wireless, says Adam Koeppe, vice president of technology planning at Verizon.""We're putting in the building blocks for what comes next. IoT is one of them,"" he said. ""The goal of the IoT device evolution is to have very low-cost modules, with long battery life. Think of sensors, smart meters — things that get embedded in day-to-day infrastructure and products that communicate on low bandwidth, on a sliver of spectrum, gobbling up very little of network resources.""""Where 5G fits into the equation is scale,"" Koeppe added. ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies — traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself — that's where 5G comes into play.""Yet 5G-related revenue is still on the distant horizon for most companies, analysts say. The marketing hype has picked up long before 5G networks and services will be deployed.IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now and will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason. Revenue is small in part because monthly revenue from IoT devices might come to just $1 or $2, not the $60 or more from smartphone users.RELATED:Qualcomm Upgraded On NXP Acquisition, Adds 'Tons Of Scale'Verizon Among Those With Lots At Stake With Next FCC ChairmanCisco Rival Arista Soars On Import Green Light

30,CCI,"Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) are likely to rekindle merger talks during a Trump administration, but their operational rebounds will make it harder to make a case to regulators, says Citigroup.T-Mobile US has been taking revenue and subscriber market share for three years from wireless services leaders AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Sprint's subscriber growth has more recently rebounded.Shares of cell tower operators American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC), meanwhile, have been hit over worries they could lose business if T-Mobile and Sprint merge.""We think Sprint and T-Mobile are more likely than not to reconsider a merger scenario, but the (TV spectrum) auction, other strategic options, and regulatory complexities may slow down any attempt during 2017,"" Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins said in a research report.Japan's SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) owns two-thirds of T-Mobile.T-Mobile stock rose 1% in the stock market today, to 53.46, while Sprint jumped 3.1% to a more than two-year high of 7.74.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock has been trading around a nine-year high after reporting Q3 earnings topped views amid speculation over wireless industry M&A. Sprint stock has doubled in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Amid intensified wireless competition, a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile would be profit-margin-friendly, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market.T-Mobile in October reported higher-than-expected Q3 profit and raised full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance as its wireless subscriber additions in the September quarter again led the industry. Sprint added 344,000 postpaid subscribers.""We come back to an essential issue that we believe hurt the companies' prospects for consolidation in the last go around -- if it's not broken, why fix it?,"" Rollins wrote. ""We believe these two companies may need more time to build a thoughtful narrative on the needs for further wireless industry consolidation.""AT&T, which bought DirecTV in 2015, in October agreed to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion. Analysts and industry executives speculate Verizon could acquire Dish Network (DISH) or deepen its alliance with cable TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA).RELATED:How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosComcast: Does Trump Win Portend Regulatory Rollback?John Malone Talks Up Apple Buy Of Disney, Likes AT&T Strategy

31,CCI,"Real estate investment trusts were big winners for much of the year, as investors sought out juicy payouts in a world of low or even negative interest rates. But with bond yields rising amid growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike, property REITs such as Store Capital (STOR) and Simon Property Group (SPG) are selling off.REITs get special tax treatment as long as they pass on nearly all earnings to investors. Many pay attractive yields and in the low-interest world they've also delivered significant share price appreciation. But the stocks peaked a few months ago, with many REIT stocks breaking their 50-day moving averages or their 200-day lines in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: Fed rate hike talk is sinking REITs and utilities, but it's giving a boost to financials. See which big bank stocks have joined JPMorgan Chase in a buy zone this week.Store Capital is the only property REIT in the IBD 50. Store — an acronym for Single Tenant Operational Real Estate — focuses on single-occupant commercial real estate. Earnings growth has been strong, with a 4.1% dividend yield.But shares fell below the 50-day moving average last week. Store Capital sank 3.75% to close at 27.49 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest levels since late June.Simon Property Group owns many malls. That's a tough business with many retailers slashing stores in the face of competition from Amazon (AMZN).Simon Property fell below its 50-day moving average in early August, and found resistance at that line over the next several weeks. Recently shares have crumbled, tumbling through the 200-day line on Monday. Shares closed down 1.6% at 195.72, and are off 5.5%% so far this week.Crown Castle (CCI) and American Tower (AMT) are both REITs that own cellphone towers used by telecoms.Crown Castle has been trading below its 50-day line since early August, with a couple of exceptions. Shares fell 2% Wednesday, through its 200-day line. Crown Castle hasn't closed below that key level since early February.American Tower plunged below its 50-day on Sept. 9. It tried to retake that line on Friday but reversed lower. Shares have plunged 5% so far this week to a 3-month low, including 2.9% on Wednesday, heading for the 200-day line.Public Storage (PSA) owns self-storage facilities across the country. Shares peaked in April, then decisively undercut the 50-day and 200-day lines in late July. Public Storage has continued to fall. Shares slid 1.8% Wednesday afternoon, hitting a 52-week low.RELATED:Real Estate Is Newest S&P Sector

32,CCI,"Investment bank Morgan Stanley on Thursday selected nine ""high conviction"" stocks that have near-term catalysts that could move their shares higher.Of the nine, four are technology stocks: Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Amazon.com (AMZN), IBM (IBM) and Lam Research (LRCX). And a fifth, Align Technology (ALGN), is a medical-products (teeth alignment) company.Two of the companies are currently featured on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks: Activision and Align. And one, Amazon, is on IBD's Leaderboard list.The others are wireless tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), commercial bank SVB Financial Group (SIVB), and energy services firms Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Parsley Energy (PE).IBD'S TAKE: Investors.com offers a host of proprietary stock lists to give investors actionable ideas about companies worth considering. The IBD 50 is IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals. Leaderboard provides a select group of stock picks showing the most potential for big gains.""Our analysts believe that one or more imminent events will drive the share price (of the nine stocks) materially over the next 15-60 days,"" a group of Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research report.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak expects video game publisher Activision to beat Wall Street's estimates when it reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 3. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company is benefiting from a shift to higher-margin game downloads, vs. packaged media sales, and online and mobile-game traction, he said.Potential catalysts include a faster-than-anticipated shift to full-game downloads and indications that Activision is monetizing its King Digital user base through advertising.""Currently 15% to 20% of games are downloaded digitally, and we expect this to increase to 40%-plus in the next five years,"" Nowak said.Align Technology, which makes teeth-straightening systems, is set to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 7.Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Beuchaw is looking for San Jose, Calif.-based Align to report strong results. Catalysts for the stock include inflections in discretionary spending, the rollout of Align's G6 feature set, and collaboration with more digital scanner partners.E-commerce leader Amazon is likely to report its Q3 results in late October. Nowak is expecting Amazon to beat Wall Street's consensus expectations.""Our estimates are driven by higher gross profit per customer, which more than offsets our expectations for higher forward streaming-content (spending) and increased fulfillment deleverage from Amazon's large expected warehouse build this year,"" Nowak said. ""We also see potential for further upside due to ongoing strength in Amazon's AWS cloud-computing business.""Amazon is moving into a phase of improving profitability in its core e-commerce business, even as it takes market share, he said.Potential catalysts include Amazon's Q3 results, acceleration of e-commerce penetration in core markets, Prime membership growth, and enterprise cloud adoption hitting an inflection point, Nowak said.Tech services giant IBM could see a lift as it makes progress transitioning from mainframe and other legacy businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said. IBM is becoming more exposed to its emerging businesses in Watson, cloud, analytics, mobile and security, which have double-digit growth profiles, she said.IBM's potential catalysts include an accelerated transformation and recent acquisitions helping to achieve a faster path to revenue growth and improving profit margins, she said.Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research is set to report its September quarter results on Oct. 19 and will hold an analyst meeting on Nov. 16.""We would expect both events to be positive for the stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore said. Investors are likely to take a fresh look at Lam in the wake of its failed merger with inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor (KLAC).
"
33,CCI,"Cellphone tower operators should get a boost in 2017, when capital spending by customers AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Sprint (S) picks up, says SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, which initiated coverage on American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) with buy ratings.""As we look forward to 2017, we believe the outlook is relatively brighter. U.S. carrier activity remains stable at historically low levels, but a number of growth drivers — new spectrum deployments/re-farming, 5G trials and FirstNet, for example — could modestly re-accelerate growth for the group,"" said Greg Miller, a SunTrust analyst, in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Both Crown Castle and American Tower are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay dividends. REIT stocks perform well when interest rates are low. But IBD's Finance-Property REIT group ranks just No. 90 out of 197 industry groups amid worries that interest rates could rise. A good place to check on industry group ratings is Stock Checkup. After a big run, dividend-paying AT&T and Verizon are also being pressured by views that the Federal Reserve may hike short-term rates.Verizon has stated it plans to be a leader in next-generation 5G wireless services. The U.S. government, meanwhile, is expected to soon award a contract for FirstNet, a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.Miller expects intensified wireless competition to drive investments in network capacity. T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint have stepped up marketing for unlimited data offers, while AT&T and Verizon are selling bigger data buckets.""In our view, the U.S. wireless industry remains fiercely competitive, and the risk of standing still from a network-quality perspective is just as great if not greater than ever,"" added Miller in the report. ""We believe carriers — particularly AT&T and, to a lesser degree, Verizon — will need to continue to spend on networks in order to maintain long-term competitiveness and, should 2016 play out as we expect, the odds of greater activity next year increase from a historical perspective.""Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA Communications all fell hard in the stock market today. Crown Castle stock fell 2.2%, to 91.87, while American Tower stock dropped 2.8%, to 108.11, and SBA fell 2.3%, to 108.99. Crown Castle and American Tower touched record highs in July, above 102 for the former and above 118 for the latter.RELATED:Verizon, T-Mobile, Dish Strategic Talks On Hold As Auction Drags OnAT&T, Verizon Get Their Wish: FCC Opens Up 5G AirwavesSpectrum Wild Cards May Add Supply, Impact Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T
"
34,CCI,"Investing in real estate may help to build a strong foundation in your investment portfolio. These securities diversify portfolios, generate income and hold potential for capital growth -- a trifecta of benefits for ETF investors.And several REIT exchange traded funds may be poised for a sizable rally, having found support around their 200-day moving averages after a recent pullback. They include Vanguard REIT (VNQ), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), which are among the five largest funds in the sector.Real estate debuted as the 11th S&P 500 sector Monday, commanding a roughly 3% weighting in the large-cap index. It's a timely move, given the performance and popularity of REIT exchange traded funds with investors in 2016.As a stand-alone sector, REITs will gain added visibility that may serve to further increase asset flows into this asset class, says Adam Patti, CEO of IndexIQ, the firm behind IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (ROOF). Active managers, many of whom underweighted real estate when it was part of the financial sector, may be forced to adjust.Demand for U.S. real estate securities held strong ahead of the industry's elevation as a new S&P 500 sector. Investors poured $1.33 billion into real estate ETFs in August, following $1.60 billion in July, according to Morningstar data.""The popularity of REIT ETFs persisted last month"" even as other yield-focused ETFs, such as rate-sensitive telecom services and utilities, saw significant outflow, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote Sept. 13.On the stock market today, VNQ showed bullish momentum, extending Wednesday's gains from the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged in September. The Fed left the door open to hikes later this year. Several other REIT ETFs showed similar action.Investors in REITs should monitor interest rates closely. Lower rates typically make it easier to buy, sell and refinance property, which boosts demand for real estate. Conversely, the sector tends to sell off when rates trend up.IBD'S TAKE: Recent changes to a widely used classification system for equities could significantly impact how fund investors allocate resources.Among real estate ETFs, Vanguard's VNQ dominates in terms of net inflow so far this year, raking in $5.75 billion through August. The $34.83 billion ETF holds traditional real estate such as self-storage company Public Storage (PSA) and health care REIT Welltower (HCN).By comparison, its iShares rival IYR also holds newer ""specialty REITs"" focused on timber, communications or other areas. They include American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), former telecoms that have restructured as REITs, Rosenbluth noted.And the young XLRE invests exclusively in S&P 500 components. This ETF launched in late 2015 in anticipation of the landmark change to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) -- a taxonomy for equities -- that carved out real estate from financials as a stand-alone sector.XLRE swelled from a few hundred million in assets to $2.82 billion as the GICS changes took effect this month. The five largest real estate ETFs skew toward big REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG) and Vornado Realty (VNO).IndexIQ describes ROOF as the only way for investors to gain access to the small-cap segment of REITs and real estate holding companies. It invests across the commercial, residential and specialized REIT sectors.The ETF is relatively small in assets and thinly traded, but has vaulted over the five largest funds so far in 2016.ROOF jumped 16.2% on the stock market year to date through Sept. 21. By comparison, VNQ gained 11.8% over the same period, XLRE 6.8%, and ETFs tracking the S&P 500 7.5%.Index IQ's Patti thinks ""REITs still have room to run"" because they got hit fairly hard in 2015. Funds holding smaller REITs may offer an especially attractive opportunity for investors.Small caps as a group provide higher dividend yield than large caps, according to Patti. ROOF currently has a 12-month yield of 3.80% and VNQ 3.27%.The former invests in the bottom 10% of the domestic REIT market in terms of market capitalization, while filtering out the smallest and most illiquid names. Patti described ROOF's 67 stock holdings as ""hidden gems"" that are underowned and offer attractive relative value. They include First Industrial (FR).Added flow of money to real estate as a new sector could further extend valuations for large caps, while reducing their dividend yield, according to Patti. That dividend income is a big reason why investors seek out REITs in the first place. Real estate investment trusts generate yield by distributing 90% of their earnings as dividends.""The reality is if you're investing in REITs for yield and diversification, you should look at small caps,"" Patti said. He suggests that investors carve out 15% of their overall REIT exposure for the small caps in ROOF.RELATED:The First New S&P 500 Sector Since 1999 Is A Big Deal For InvestorsWith Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And AppealKey Debut For Real Estate Is A Big Opportunity For ETF InvestorsMeet The First New Sector SPDR ETFs In 17 Years

Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) was down the most, by 2.8%.Comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, traditionally seen as a dovish policymaker, fueled negative sentiment. He didn't really say anything earth-shattering, other than to say he backs gradual interest-rate hikes. The Fed has three meetings left this year: Sept. 20-21, Nov. 1-2 and Dec. 13-14. Futures traders think there's a 30% chance the Fed will hike at the September meeting, but the chances rise to around 60% in December.XLFS holdings Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and US Bancorp (USB) were up as much as 0.7%.

"
37,CCI,"Real estate soon makes its debut as the newest S&P 500 sector, in a sign that this once-niche asset class is all grown up and ready for a far more prominent role in investors' portfolios.In November 2014, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI announced that real estate was being moved out from under the financial sector and elevated to its own sector. The change was driven by investor demand, the indexing giants said. Now, the index changes are being formally implemented.MSCI-based indexes will be rebalanced after the market close on Aug. 31 and S&P-based products will be rebalanced on Sept. 16. Exchange traded funds tracking them will follow suit.The changes are consequential — real estate is the first new sector since 1999, when the S&P 500 index was carved into 10 broad sector slices. It will have a bigger weight than materials and telecom in the large-cap index starting in September, and be almost even with utilities. The financial sector's weighting will nudge lower to roughly 13%.The promotion recognizes, first and foremost, real estate's growing importance to major world economies. It now has a $596.28 billion market cap in the S&P 500 alone. It accounted for a minuscule 0.2% of that large-cap bogey's market cap in 2001 vs. a current 3.1%.More companies, like former telecoms American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), are converting to a real estate investment trust (REIT) structure, in part for a favorable tax status. So this asset class, which used to fit inside that narrow sleeve of investment portfolios dubbed alternatives, is being used more and more for strategic asset allocations.Its elevation also should bring more attention to a dividend-rich sector that has outperformed this year.""REITs are an important portfolio diversifier and income producer, and now perhaps the added visibility that a stand-alone sector provides will serve to increase asset flows into this sector,"" said Adam Patti, CEO of IndexIQ, the firm behind IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (ROOF).Real estate yielded 3.09% and gained 10.1% in 2016 through Aug. 10, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. By comparison, the S&P 500 as a whole yielded 2.11% and gained 6.4% over the same period.For fund investors, the launch of the new sector can have a profound impact on portfolio choices, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, which operates independently from S&P Dow Jones Indices.""In a passive investment world, this is an active change that's taking place,"" Rosenbluth told IBD. ""The more investors understand about it, the better prepared they can be.""IBD'S TAKE: Compare and contrast how the best REITs are faring on various fundamental and technical metrics at IBD Stock Checkup.Investors aiming for a simple, diversified portfolio with one or two funds such as SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), Vanguard 500 (VOO) or iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH) won't really be affected by the index changes. Those funds offer exposure to both financials and REITs, and will continue to do so.""Nothing changes for you"" as a result of the index rebalance if you own SPY or its peers, said Dave Mazza, head of research for SDPR ETFs. While stocks like Public Storage (PSA) may be categorized under the new real estate sector, ""at the end of the day, you own the same stocks,"" he added.For those who take a sector-based approach to investing in ETFs, the changes will be more significant.Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the $15.73 billion category heavyweight, will drop its exposure to equity REITs after the reclassification. Mortgage REITs remain in the financial sector. The real estate equity holdings are slated to be transferred on an in-kind basis from XLF to Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), a young ETF that will subsequently balloon from $115 million in assets to about $3 billion.Investors in XLF will receive a special dividend on Sept. 22, in the form of shares of XLRE. At the end of the entire transaction, a current investor in XLF will own shares of the revamped XLF as well as XLRE, providing the same exposure combined as the investor had before with XLF alone.The special dividends will reflect the ratio of real estate in the financial sector, which is roughly 20% now. According to Mazza, the in-kind process made possible by the ETF structure will minimize costs tied to rebalancing XLF, one of his firm's largest ETFs and the most heavily traded after SPY. The implementation was designed to be as tax-efficient as possible, ""opposed to selling $3 billion worth of real estate,"" he told IBD in a phone call.Once investors receive the XLRE shares, it will be up to them to maintain real estate exposure, add to it, sell it or trim it depending on their view of the sector's outlook, said S&P Global's Rosenbluth.Similar changes are afoot for other financial ETFs including Vanguard Financials (VFH), Fidelity MSCI Financials (FNCL), Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Financials (RYF) and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Financials (PSCF).But not every ETF sponsor is making adjustments the same way. The Vanguard Financials ETF will drop the real estate securities that no longer belong in the underlying index. Investors in VFH will have to buy Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) or a similar ETF to retain real estate exposure.Other financial ETFs that don't track S&P and MSCI benchmarks are not affected, such as iShares U.S. Financials (IYF).Longer term, investors will have to examine the performance, income and tax consequences of the changes. Year to date, Vanguard's real estate ETF has far outpaced its financial sibling in both performance and asset gathering. VNQ has gained 13.5% vs. 3.7% for VFH. The former raked in $5.19 billion in fresh money through July — more than any other sector equity ETF and a far cry from the heavy outflow for some of the largest financial funds.And without REITs, financial ETFs will yield less and likely be more volatile. However, the income from financials is taxed at a lower, more favorable rate.Investors should expect the financial services sector to outperform real estate in a rising rate environment. REITs sold off in 2015 in anticipation of rate increases, though some investing pros argue that REITS can fare well in that environment.Rosenbluth also thinks many actively managed mutual funds are likely to increase their exposure to REITs to better align with the large-cap bogey. That could translate to billions in demand for this brand-new S&P sector.RELATED:With Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And AppealKey Debut For Real Estate Is A Big Opportunity For ETF InvestorsMeet The First New Sector SPDR ETFs In 17 Years

38,CCI,"Citigroup downgraded Crown Castle (CCI) to neutral on valuation following a dividend-driven rally in cell tower stocks despite a slowdown in AT&T's (T) spending on wireless infrastructure.Owing to low interest rates worldwide, investor demand has been growing for high-dividend-paying stocks. AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) stocks were top performers in the first half of 2016, and cell-tower shares have been on a run recently.Crown Castle stock has jumped 14% in the past two months, and it carries an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of 88, putting it among the top 12% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months. Shares touched an all-time high of 102.82 on Wednesday.Crown Castle fell 1.6% to 100.54 on the stock market today.American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC) were up 8.6% and 13% in the past two months, respectively, as of Friday. American Tower stock hit its all-time high of 114.50 on July 1, while SBA touched an eight-month high on Friday.American Tower rose 0.9% to 114.67, hitting a new high intraday. SBA Communications slid 1% to 113.30.Wireless phone companies rent tower space from Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA to house radio antennas. Phone companies normally sign leases of 15-20 years with tower firms, and most towers house radio antennas from multiple carriers.Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins on Monday downgraded Crown Castle to neutral, but he maintained buy ratings on SBA Communications and American Tower. Crown Castle stock gained nearly 18% this year though July 8, while American Tower was up 17%, and SBA 9%.""Tower stocks have rallied back 9% over the last month and 15% year to date. Lower rates seem to be helping valuations, especially for Crown Castle given its larger dividend yield,"" said Rollins in a research report. ""We believe the time is right to shift the investment strategy for towers to emphasize buying the cheaper assets.""Rollins expects AT&T's spending to boost wireless network capacity to improve in 2017. ""We expect domestic tower site leasing growth to remain in the 4%-to-7% range over the next 12-months,"" Rollins added.Falling bond yields, though, could be a bigger factor than the growth outlook for tower stocks, he says.""We could see further multiple expansion in this low-rate environment, which is a risk to our downgrade of the highest-yielding tower name, Crown Castle,"" Rollins added.
"
39,CCI,"Special Report: Income Investing 2016Yield isn't hard to find in the stock market, especially in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space, but focusing on yield alone for generating income can often result in underperformance.According to recent data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the average REIT dividend at the end of September was 4.4%. Certain sectors of the REIT universe offer even more tempting yields, such as health care REITs, whose dividend yields averaged 5.8%, and mortgage REITs, whose yields average a whopping 11.6%.Selecting the right REIT to generate investment income is a lot more than just focusing on the highest-yielding names. Ed Cowling, director of specialty assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management agrees. ""With higher yield comes higher risk,"" he said.Under REIT rules, companies must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends to avoid paying most corporate taxes.Of course, REITs prefer to access cheap money to acquire and develop properties to spur growth. In general, rising rates mean higher borrowing costs, which can cut into a REIT's profits and valuation.Higher interest rates are on Wall Street's mind these days, but the Fed has been very transparent about a slow and steady approach to rate hikes in light of a choppy U.S. economic recovery, low oil prices and uncertainty in China.Interest rates rising at a snail's pace likely will not have a material impact on REITs. ""Interest rate hikes tend to happen when the economy is improving, and a strengthening economy is usually when REITs are thriving,"" Cowling said.Matt Werner, portfolio manager of the West Loop Realty Fund, has had a pretty good year in a challenging environment for REITs. It's a small fund with assets just north of $80 million, but performance has been solid so far.Year to date, the fund ranks No. 5 out of 286 funds in its category as tracked by Morningstar. The fund is outperforming the S&P 500 this year, and it's also broadly outperforming its benchmark, the MSCI U.S. REIT index.Net of fees and expenses, the fund is up 1.3% year to date, compared with a 1.3% decline for the MSCI AWCI index.According to Werner, individual investors shouldn't be obsessing about the Fed so much. ""REITs have performed fairly well during historical times of rate hikes. The Fed is a potential driver of short-term volatility that will have little effect on the long-term positive fundamentals,"" he said.An overweight allocation to the data center/tech sector has helped the fund's performance. According to Werner, cell-tower REITs should be the beneficiaries of carriers deploying recently acquired spectrum, as well as continued expansion of small cell sites.Data-center REITs, meanwhile, will continue to benefit from increased corporate data outsourcing, the growth of the cloud, and the need for speedy delivery of data.Among the cell-tower operators, Werner likes American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI). In the data-center space, he likes CoreSite Realty (COR) and CyrusOne (CONE). Funds from operations (FFO) at CoreSite are expected to rise 31% this year and 17% in 2016. Growth prospects at CyrusOne are just as solid with FFO seen rising 23% this year and 18% in 2016.An underweight allocation to the health care sector is also contributing to outperformance. In his October REIT commentary, Werner wrote that health care REITs are the most correlated to interest rates, and some have disclosed rent coverage issues among tenants, as well as a heightened threat of new supply in senior housing.Assuming no unusual shocks to the U.S. economy in 2016, Werner thinks select REITs have a good chance of outperforming next year. If the economy continues to improve in 2016, Werner expects self-storage, lodging, apartments and mall REITs to be the biggest beneficiaries if job growth continues to improve.In the self-storage space, Werner likes Sovran Self Storage (SSS). It owns a Composite Rating of 93 from IBD, helped by double-digit revenue gains for 16 straight quarters. Among apartment REITs, he owns Camden Property Trust (CPT) and Equity Residential (EQR). According to Werner, the fundamental outlook for apartments remains strong, supported by relatively low new supply and an improving job market.According to Morningstar ETF analyst Bob Goldsborough, REITs with shorter lease durations generally do better in rising-rate environments because they can go back to tenants more frequently and get higher rents. REITs with longer lease durations, like the health care and office segments, don't have that luxury.""REIT funds more devoted to hotels, multifamily and self storage should be less affected by rates than those heavy in retail, office and health care,"" he said.In terms of REIT ETFs, Goldsborough likes low-cost names likes Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH) and Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ).iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (ICF) is a little more costly to own, but it's also a solid choice, according to Goldsborough. ICF owns the 30 largest REITS.

40,CCI,"Wireless phone companies aim to improve spotty network coverage and add data capacity by turning to ""small cell"" technology — a strategy that may also enable them to tap unlicensed, Wi-Fi-type radio spectrum in the long run.
"
41,CCI,"Crown Castle (CCI) is the cell tower operator most likely to benefit, as it aims to play a large role in small cell deployment by wireless firms.
"
42,CCI,"Crown Castle in April made its second major small-cell-related acquisition, buying Sunesys for $1 billion in cash. In 2011, Crown Castle bought NextG for the same price.
"
43,CCI,"Verizon Communications (VZ), a Crown Castle customer, is leading the charge to small cell technology as data demand surges on its 4G LTE network. Wireless firms generally use large cell towers across the U.S. to whisk calls, video and email to mobile phone users. Wireless firms also use large radio antennas installed on building rooftops, church steeples, billboards, or even farm silos and fake trees.
"
44,CCI,"But small cell technology is gaining ground in urban areas. The low-power ""base stations"" are located in shopping malls and outdoor public spaces. They're often mounted on lamp posts or utility poles, and are roughly the size of a suitcase.
"
45,CCI,"There are about 150,000 full-size cell towers, operated by tower companies Crown Castle, American Tower (AMT), SBA Communications (SBAC) and others.
"
46,CCI,"The number of small cell base stations is potentially much bigger, depending on whether AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) follow Verizon's lead. Sprint, amid a network upgrade, is expected to deploy small cell technology in 2016.
"
47,CCI,"""We think there's an opportunity for small cells in most urban environments,"" Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's CEO, told IBD. ""It's a vast geography.
"
48,CCI,"""When we look at maps that we're working on and the locations we're building out today, you can come to the conclusion that this is going to go in virtually every major suburban and urban area. We're talking about building out block by block.""
"
49,CCI,"The rub for Crown Castle and its rivals is that rising use of small cells might mean wireless firms will need fewer big towers, which analysts say are highly profitable to operate.
"
50,CCI,"Moreland, whose company operates 40,000 towers, disagrees.
"
51,CCI,"""We can find no evidence, nor a carrier customer who is suggesting it's an either/or proposition,"" he said. ""It's complementary and additive.""
"
52,CCI,"Cell towers aren't going away, but small cell technology is coming on strong, says Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.
"
53,CCI,"""Carriers are going with small cells because they need to upgrade capacity in a particular spot, like an office building,"" Entner said. ""So instead of building a larger, more expensive tower site, they prefer to do a more topical solution.""
"
54,CCI,"For smartphone users, small cell deployments should mean fewer dropped calls and faster video downloads. Mobile phone users share radio signals and spectrum capacity, with service degraded as more devices are connected.
"
55,CCI,"Small cell technology also could help wireless firms tap a new source of airwaves, unlicensed spectrum.
"
56,CCI,"As for licenses airwaves, AT&T spent $18.2 billion in the recent AWS-3 spectrum auction, the most of any company. Verizon spent $10.4 billion.
"
57,CCI,"Those additional airwaves, however, won't be enough to meet long-term demand. Verizon is interested in augmenting its licensed spectrum with new airwaves that federal regulators plan to set aside for Wi-Fi-type networks.
"
58,CCI,"The Federal Communications Commission in April voted to make 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz frequency band available for mobile broadband and other commercial uses. The FCC also is studying whether to open up nearly 200 MHz of spectrum in the 5 GHz band.
"
59,CCI,"Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are among the cable TV firms interested in using 5 GHz airwaves to expand public Wi-Fi services, analysts say.
"
60,CCI,"Meanwhile, Verizon is keen on using unlicensed spectrum, and it's been testing a 400-node small cell system in Boston.
"
61,CCI,"Amir Rozwadowski, a Barclays analyst, says Verizon has focused on its small cell initiative for about 18 months. He says Verizon's interest in small cell systems goes beyond near-term data capacity needs and is related to the ""multiyear evolution of its network.""
"
62,CCI,"Rozwadowski added in a research report that Verizon is already putting in the foundation for a shift to next-generation 5G mobile networks. Wireless firms globally are expected to deploy 5G networks after 2020.
"
63,CCI,"To get small cell systems in place in urban areas, Verizon has been working with building owners and local regulators.
"
64,CCI,"Verizon also has been in talks with suppliers of fiber-optic wiring that connects small cell systems to the Internet and long-distance phone networks, or the so-called backhaul system. The fiber hook-ups speed up mobile data performance.
"
65,CCI,"Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO), which leases fiber connections to cell tower operators, has told analysts it's interested in the burgeoning small cell market.
"
66,CCI,"As for Crown Castle, its April 30 acquisition of Sunesys, a unit of Quanta Services, boosted the wireless tower company's ability to provide fiber-optic hook-ups for small cell backhaul services.
"
67,CCI,"Analysts say Crown Castle made the move in part to meet Verizon's needs. Sunesys owns or has rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets. So, Crown Castle now can provide fiber services similar to the likes of Zayo. That's a new business for Crown Castle, notes Rozwadowski.
"
68,CCI,"Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, likes Crown Castle's investments in small cell technology and its Sunesys acquisition.
"
69,CCI,"""Small cells will be a central pillar of (4G) network architecture for Verizon and Sprint in the second half of 2015 and especially 2016 and for T-Mobile and AT&T moving forward,"" said Smithen, in a report. ""Sunesys allows Crown Castle to jump-start its business plan by several years by shrinking build-out time and spending for metro fiber networks.""
"
70,CCI,"In 2014, small cell contracts accounted for 7% of Crown Castle's overall revenue, more than at American Tower and SBA Communications. As in the case of cell towers, Crown Castle expects small cell installations to be share-able among multiple wireless carriers, boosting profits.

71,CCI,"""Crown Castle has the biggest potential for upside to consensus (estimate) forecasts if Verizon and Sprint small cells kick-in,"" Smithen added.Wireless phone companies aim to improve spotty network coverage and add data capacity by turning to ""small cell"" technology — a strategy that may also enable them to tap unlicensed, Wi-Fi-type radio spectrum in the long run.Crown Castle (CCI) is the cell tower operator most likely to benefit, as it aims to play a large role in small cell deployment by wireless firms.Crown Castle in April made its second major small-cell-related acquisition, buying Sunesys for $1 billion in cash. In 2011, Crown Castle bought NextG for the same price.Verizon Communications (VZ), a Crown Castle customer, is leading the charge to small cell technology as data demand surges on its 4G LTE network. Wireless firms generally use large cell towers across the U.S. to whisk calls, video and email to mobile phone users. Wireless firms also use large radio antennas installed on building rooftops, church steeples, billboards, or even farm silos and fake trees.But small cell technology is gaining ground in urban areas. The low-power ""base stations"" are located in shopping malls and outdoor public spaces. They're often mounted on lamp posts or utility poles, and are roughly the size of a suitcase.There are about 150,000 full-size cell towers, operated by tower companies Crown Castle, American Tower (AMT), SBA Communications (SBAC) and others.The number of small cell base stations is potentially much bigger, depending on whether AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) follow Verizon's lead. Sprint, amid a network upgrade, is expected to deploy small cell technology in 2016.""We think there's an opportunity for small cells in most urban environments,"" Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's CEO, told IBD. ""It's a vast geography.""When we look at maps that we're working on and the locations we're building out today, you can come to the conclusion that this is going to go in virtually every major suburban and urban area. We're talking about building out block by block.""The rub for Crown Castle and its rivals is that rising use of small cells might mean wireless firms will need fewer big towers, which analysts say are highly profitable to operate.Moreland, whose company operates 40,000 towers, disagrees.""We can find no evidence, nor a carrier customer who is suggesting it's an either/or proposition,"" he said. ""It's complementary and additive.""Cell towers aren't going away, but small cell technology is coming on strong, says Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.""Carriers are going with small cells because they need to upgrade capacity in a particular spot, like an office building,"" Entner said. ""So instead of building a larger, more expensive tower site, they prefer to do a more topical solution.""For smartphone users, small cell deployments should mean fewer dropped calls and faster video downloads. Mobile phone users share radio signals and spectrum capacity, with service degraded as more devices are connected.Small cell technology also could help wireless firms tap a new source of airwaves, unlicensed spectrum.As for licenses airwaves, AT&T spent $18.2 billion in the recent AWS-3 spectrum auction, the most of any company. Verizon spent $10.4 billion.Those additional airwaves, however, won't be enough to meet long-term demand. Verizon is interested in augmenting its licensed spectrum with new airwaves that federal regulators plan to set aside for Wi-Fi-type networks.The Federal Communications Commission in April voted to make 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz frequency band available for mobile broadband and other commercial uses. The FCC also is studying whether to open up nearly 200 MHz of spectrum in the 5 GHz band.Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are among the cable TV firms interested in using 5 GHz airwaves to expand public Wi-Fi services, analysts say.Meanwhile, Verizon is keen on using unlicensed spectrum, and it's been testing a 400-node small cell system in Boston.Amir Rozwadowski, a Barclays analyst, says Verizon has focused on its small cell initiative for about 18 months. He says Verizon's interest in small cell systems goes beyond near-term data capacity needs and is related to the ""multiyear evolution of its network.""Rozwadowski added in a research report that Verizon is already putting in the foundation for a shift to next-generation 5G mobile networks. Wireless firms globally are expected to deploy 5G networks after 2020.To get small cell systems in place in urban areas, Verizon has been working with building owners and local regulators.Verizon also has been in talks with suppliers of fiber-optic wiring that connects small cell systems to the Internet and long-distance phone networks, or the so-called backhaul system. The fiber hook-ups speed up mobile data performance.Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO), which leases fiber connections to cell tower operators, has told analysts it's interested in the burgeoning small cell market.As for Crown Castle, its April 30 acquisition of Sunesys, a unit of Quanta Services, boosted the wireless tower company's ability to provide fiber-optic hook-ups for small cell backhaul services.Analysts say Crown Castle made the move in part to meet Verizon's needs. Sunesys owns or has rights to nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metro markets. So, Crown Castle now can provide fiber services similar to the likes of Zayo. That's a new business for Crown Castle, notes Rozwadowski.Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, likes Crown Castle's investments in small cell technology and its Sunesys acquisition.""Small cells will be a central pillar of (4G) network architecture for Verizon and Sprint in the second half of 2015 and especially 2016 and for T-Mobile and AT&T moving forward,"" said Smithen, in a report. ""Sunesys allows Crown Castle to jump-start its business plan by several years by shrinking build-out time and spending for metro fiber networks.""In 2014, small cell contracts accounted for 7% of Crown Castle's overall revenue, more than at American Tower and SBA Communications. As in the case of cell towers, Crown Castle expects small cell installations to be share-able among multiple wireless carriers, boosting profits.""Crown Castle has the biggest potential for upside to consensus (estimate) forecasts if Verizon and Sprint small cells kick-in,"" Smithen added.

113,CCI,"Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) could shake up the U.S. residential broadband market by 2020 by deploying 5G wireless services to homes, challenging cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR), says Goldman Sachs.While 5G is expected to provide much faster data speeds, another market opportunity for AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US (TMUS) will be applications that require always-on, low-data-rate connections, says Goldman Sachs in a new research report. The apps involve data-gathering from industrial sensors, home appliances and other devices often referred to as part of the Internet of Things.Simona Jankowski, a Goldman Sachs analyst, says that some chipmakers, network gear suppliers and software companies will see an upside in 5G deployment. Jankowski says that Broadcom (AVGO),  Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), cell tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), and bandwidth service provider Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO) could see upside from 5G deployment.“We expect pre-standard 5G commercial deployments to begin in the U.S. in 2017, when AT&T and Verizon plan to be first in the world to roll out fixed wireless 5G broadband to the home, followed by pre-standard 5G mobile networks in Korea in time for the 2018 Olympics,” wrote Jankowski in the report.U.S. regulators are focused on opening up high-frequency airwaves, also called millimeter wave spectrum, for 5G services.“Europe led the 3G transition, with industry giants such as Ericsson (ERIC) and Nokia (NOK) leading the way,” said Jankowski. “With 4G, the baton passed to the U.S., driven by a new group of industry leaders such as Qualcomm and Apple (AAPL). With China, Korea and Japan targeting 5G rollouts on par with or ahead of their Western counterparts, it bears watching whether the wireless industry’s center of gravity shifts once again (to Asia).”The Goldman Sachs analyst says that 5G also could have upside for Cisco, Intel, Zayo and Crown Castle.“We view Cisco’s market leading position in IoT as a strategic differentiator, given that 5G will likely be closely coupled with IoT,”  Jankowski added. “We expect Intel’s server and networking business to benefit from increased data traffic and greater demand for compute-intensive data analytics.“As the largest operator of small cell networks in the U.S. and one of the largest pure-play providers of dark fiber in large metros respectively, Crown Castle and Zayo look well positioned for this long-term investment cycle.”

115,CCI,"They call it stormy December, but January was  -- worse.On the heels of December's 1.58% decline in the S&P 500 and 2.80% tumble for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, in January the broad market lost 4.96% and U.S. diversified stock funds dove 6.25%, according to Lipper Inc.It was the sixth worst January for the big-cap bogey in the past 47 years. And in that span it was the third worst opening month to a year for U.S. diversified stock funds as a group.Click Here To See List Of Top Performing Mutual Funds Past 6 MonthsThere was no mystery about the main culprits. Investors worried about stock market news that harped on China's economic slowdown and speculated about how badly it would affect the global economy -- including that of the U.S.And investors fretted about oil's declining price. Light sweet crude, for example, fell from $37.04 a barrel to $33.62 by January's end. It closed below $30 on five trading days.""China and oil are two of the reasons for the weak market in January,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. ""I would also throw into the mix the strong dollar, high inventories, weak manufacturing sector and the political cycle.""Still, the market trended higher in its final eight sessions. Why? Credit the Federal Reserve, Orlando says. On Jan. 27, the Fed signaled that its decisions regarding future rate hikes ""would be dovish, data dependent and cautious,"" Orlando said.That was in stark contrast to the Fed's quarter-percentage-point rate hike in December.Also, Japan's central bank went to negative interest rates on certain bank reserves -- a move that bolsters stocks by making them more attractive than cash.The Federal Reserve action preceded by two days the Bureau of Economic Analysis' release of its advance estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter: annualized 0.7% growth, lower than Q3's 2% gain and slightly below market expectations of 0.8% for Q4.So investors, who were already spooked by the five indicators that Orlando cites, were relieved by the BEA's move, which virtually wiped out the prospect of three or four rates hikes in 2016. ""And when the Fed does make its next rate hike, investors know that that will be a sign of the Fed's faith that the economy is strong enough to handle it,"" Orlando said.Orlando believes that the Fed won't lift its rate again until the U.S. sees a quarter with 2% annualized GDP growth. ""July is the earliest we might see sufficiently strong data,"" he said. ""Then September is the next time that they'd be likely to raise the rate.""A 9.03% gain made dedicated short-bias funds the best-performing mutual funds among all U.S. diversified stock funds in January.Click Here To See The Top-Performing Stock And Bond Mutual Fund CategoriesAmong just market capitalization and style categories within U.S. diversifieds, large-cap core funds did best by losing the least, 5.35% in the month. Equity-income funds gave up even less: -3.92%.Top large-cap growth managers included Frank Caruso, whose AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) fell 6.08% last month.Reflecting the flight to safe havens, commodities precious metals funds paced all sectors, gaining 2.53%.Also reflecting the flight to safety, U.S. Treasury bond funds leapt 3.45% as taxable-bond funds overall lost 0.34% in the month.Latin American funds led foreign-region stock funds by losing the least, -4.30%.Orlando expects the market blahs to continue until about midyear.""I don't think China is going into recession,"" he said. ""Consumers are doing well there, but it will take a couple of quarters for investors to figure that out. Consumers in China will offset weakness in manufacturing by midyear.""By midyear, investors should also see that the U.S. dollar has stopped strengthening altogether, or at least as fast as it has, he adds. ""That dollar stabilization will make it easier for U.S. megacaps to export, which will boost corporate earnings,"" he said.Corporate inventories are already falling, he says. ""So we might see a restocking-cycle kick off in the second half of the year, which would boost manufacturing,"" he said.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index jumped to 55.6 in January from 42.9 in December, the highest pace of growth in a year. When that barometer tops 50, it's a sign of growth in the manufacturing sector. ""It was in contraction mode the last six months,"" Orlando said.As for politics, only once in the past 75 years has the party in power extended control of the White House to a third straight term. Concern about weak growth in jobs and wages should help swing control of the presidency to Republicans, Orlando says. And that should be good for business interests.With his eyes glued to midyear, Orlando expects that the technology, consumer-discretionary and industrial sectors to lead the breakout. That should benefit tech-hardware makers, chipmakers, automakers, homebuilders and airlines, he says.""Once the Fed starts to tighten again, then financials ought to work better,"" he said.In the meantime, his focus is on lower-beta, higher-dividend stocks. Names that he likes include Exxon Mobile (XOM) and Royal Dutch (RDSA).""In the first half of the year, we have overweights in Europe and Japan vs. the U.S.,"" he said. ""We're overweight in developed foreign markets but underweight in emerging markets.""Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of $1.6 billion T. Rowe Price Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $203 million Large Cap (TRULX), also expects ""a pretty tough year."" To cope with slower earnings growth, he has beefed up what he calls quality and higher-yield stocks. He's also been looking for early cyclical stocks with sound fundamentals, whose prices have been beaten up.In railroads, he began to buy Kansas City Southern (KSU) late last year.

118,CCI,"Do you have some mad money that's looking for a place to work in the stock market? Consider some REITs, which have boosted dividends this year. Likewise, consider sector mutual funds or ETFs that hold them.Why mad money? Because REITs still carry a risk of price declines if investors rotate out of them into higher-paying bonds if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates or the investors anticipate a rate hike.And real estate sector mutual funds as a group have lagged the S&P 500 so far this year through Nov. 5.Still, if you can wait out the storm — assuming that the storm actually passes — dividends paid by several have grown.And that trend might continue, writes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for both S&P Capital IQ and SNL Financial.That makes them attractive to income-hungry investors.""Recent research from SNL Financial reveals that REITs are hiking dividends at a rapid clip,"" Rosenbluth wrote in a report on Monday.One hundred and one, or 45%, of U.S. publicly traded REITs and property companies tracked by SNL real estate analyst Chris Hudgins have raised dividends at least once in the first 10 months of 2015, Rosenbluth reported.That was a faster pace than in prior years. The 101 REITs outnumber the 88 and 92 that increased dividends in the same periods of, respectively, 2013 and 2014, Hudgins' research says.Rosenbluth added: ""This is a pleasant surprise for many investors. The case against REITs is that their relatively high dividend yields (for stocks) will be less appealing as the yield on the 10-year Treasury moves higher as the Federal Reserve prepares to initiate a rate-hike sequence. Yet as Hudgins notes, 12 U.S. REITs and property companies raised their dividends in October, up from seven in September.""S&P Capital IQ likes three of the REITs, based on fundamentals.Here's what Rosenbluth wrote about each, with some updated yield figures: Simon Property Group (SPG) raised its quarterly dividend in late October by 3.2% to $1.60. Simon raised its dividend during all four quarters of 2015, and its annual dividend of $6.40 is 56% higher than it was three years ago.Simon has a 3.1% dividend yield. Crown Castle (CCI) increased its quarterly dividend 7.9% in October, which elevated the wireless-focused specialized REIT's dividend yield to 4.2%, higher than its peers' 3.9%.""CCI began paying dividends in February 2014 as it converted to a REIT, but in 18 months its quarterly dividend has nearly tripled to $0.89 per share,"" Rosenbluth wrote. Duke Realty (DRE), a diversified REIT, raised its dividend 5.9% in October.REIT HoldingsRosenbluth also noted that Duke, Simon and Crown were among the top 25 holdings for iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) at the end of October. The ETF has $4.6 billion in assets spread across specialized REITs (24% of assets), retail REITs (20%), residential REITs (15%), office REITs (11%), and others. IYR has a 3.7% yield and a 0.43% expense ratio.Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) — the largest REIT ETF, with $26 billion in assets — has large stakes in Simon and Duke. ""It has more exposure to retail and residential REITs but less exposure to specialized REITs,"" Rosenbluth wrote. ""It has an 0.12% expense ratio and a 3.9% yield.""Some mutual funds have exposure to those REITs as well.The $51.5 billion Vanguard REIT Index Fund has the same holdings as VNQ.Simon Property and Duke Realty are top-10 holdings of $4.5 billion Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio .All three REITs took price hits last week. Simon and Crown fell after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that a rate hike in December is possible. Duke fell on Friday.S&P Capital IQ thinks the three are still good to buy and own based on fundamentals, attractively low valuations and appealing dividends.""Yes, those REITS were negatively impacted by (the) likelihood of higher rates and actions by the Fed,"" Rosenbluth told IBD. ""(But all) of them are buy recommends. No changes made, but there is more upside than before.""Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter: @IBD_PKatzeff.

122,CCI,"There could be upside for cell tower operator Crown Castle (CCI) in an expected network upgrade announcement by Sprint (S), but how much upside is unclear.The next phase in Sprint's 4G network upgrade will likely use small-cell technology, an approach Verizon Communications (VZ) has also taken. Verizon's plans include tapping unlicensed radio spectrum, as IBD has reported.Wireless firms generally use large cell towers across the U.S. to whisk calls, video and email to mobile phone users. Small-cell technology is most useful in urban areas, including shopping malls and outdoor public spaces. Radio antennas are installed mounted on lamp posts or utility poles, and use fiber-optic hookups to connect to long-distance phone networks for mobile calls.Crown Castle has made acquisitions to acquire small-cell technology, focusing in this area much more than cell tower rivals American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC).""We believe Sprint is pursuing a 70,000 small-cell densification, with the initial phase slated for completion by the end of 2016,"" said Jonathan Atkin, an analyst at RBC Capital, in a research report. ""Absent an accompanying macro-site project, we are unclear on the benefit to tower companies from Sprint's densification, as the new infrastructure could be deployed principally on street-level infrastructure, though CCI could potentially see new tenancies on its small-cell infrastructure.""Kevin Smith, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, also speculates on upside for Crown Castle.""We continue to believe that Sprint's aggressive small-cell build will boost CCI in the second half of 2015 and the stock remains our top pick,"" wrote Smithen in a report Thursday. ""However, since CCI reports (Q2 earnings) well ahead of Sprint, we do not think that CCI will be in a position to include Sprint in its guidance on its earnings call.""Michael Bowen, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, says Sprint likely hasn't firmed up its plans, though he, too, sees potential upside for Crown Castle.""No one really knows what Sprint will do; however, there is speculation that it is contemplating a major network strategy that includes densifying its network in major markets,"" said Bowen in a report Wednesday. ""While CCI is moving heavily into the (small cell) space, American Tower and SBA Communications have stated that the economics of macro tower deployments are still much more favorable.""American Tower and SBA Communications prefer to invest in international tower assets than to deploy small cells in the U.S., while CCI recently sold its remaining international assets in Australia.""Shares of Crown Castle, American Tower and SBA were all up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today.

123,CCI,"According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) have recently expressed renewed interest for a possible merger. Notably, this will be the third instance that the companies are negotiating the merger.Ever since President Trump came to power, the telecom industry circle has been rife with speculations that the Trump regime may pave the way for a merger between the two companies mentioned above. It is to be noted T-Mobile US and Sprint are the third and fourth largest national telecom operators of the United States, respectively.  Change in Regulatory Stance to Aid M&AsThe previous administration under Barack Obama was strictly against further consolidation of the U.S. telecom industry. The U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) firmly stated that it wanted at least four powerful national telecom operators in the country.However, the newly restructured FCC under Trump’s presidency has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime. The FCC’s stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions.Why did Earlier Attempts to Acquire T-Mobile Fail?In 2011, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) placed the first bid of $39 billion for gaining full control of T-Mobile US. After a close inspection, the FCC thwarted AT&T’s attempt to acquire T-Mobile US, stating that it seeks a minimum of four national carriers in order to maintain competitiveness.In July 2014, Sprint offered $16 billion for a little over 50% stake in T-Mobile US. The deal was thoroughly evaluated by both the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice with the regulators coming to the same conclusion again. Consequently, Sprint opted out of the race. Sprint and T-Mobile US once again negotiated in last year which broke down on November over the leadership dispute of the merged entity.The WinnersBoth T-Mobile US and Sprint will benefit significantly from the proposed merger. At present, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T together control around 68% of the U.S. wireless market. The merged entity with around 32% market share will be a formidable challenger to both Verizon and AT&T. Yesterday, stock prices of Sprint and T-Mobile US jumped 17.1% and 5.7%, respectively.Notably, Verizon and AT&T will also benefit as these two large telecom carriers were facing severe pricing pressure from unlimited data offerings of T-Mobile US and Sprint. If these two companies merge then Verizon and AT&T will face lesser competition and won't have to invest as much in marketing and promotions to retain subscribers. A decrease in promotional expenditure will raise their operating margins. Share prices of Verizon and AT&T increased 2.9% and 1.8%, respectively, following the news.The LosersMajor losers of the proposed merger will be wireless tower operators like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Yesterday, these three stocks plunged by 4%, 4.8% and 5%, respectively.Consolidation of telecom operators generally results in lower capital spending. T-Mobile US and Sprint being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks. However, a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently, tower operators will lose on lease rentals.  The chart below depicts the price performance of T-Mobile US and Sprint year to date.Both Sprint and T-Mobile US currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineThe U.S. telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition, as success to a great extent depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Moreover, the competition is likely to intensify further in the U.S. wireless industry in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators). The proposed merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint will enable the consolidated entity to strengthen its foothold.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

124,CCI,"Vident Financial launched a new fund on Mar 27, focused on providing exposure to the real estate space of the United States equity market.U.S. Diversified Real Estate ETF (PPTY  -  Free Report) seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the U.S. Diversified Real Estate Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to employ a rules based approach to offer investors a multi-factor alternative to traditional market cap-weighted real estate funds. “If you ask for the three most important factors when investing in real estate, you’ll probably hear ‘location, location, location.’ To this we’d add property type and leverage,” per a Business Wire article citing Fred Stoops, head of real estate investments at Vident.The fund amassed $9 million in AUM within a few days of trading. It charges a fee of 53 basis points a year.  The fund’s top three holdings include Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Avalonbay Communities Inc (AVB  -  Free Report) and Terreno Realty Corp (TRNO  -  Free Report), with 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.0% exposure, respectively.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?The Real Estate segment of the U.S. market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U.S. economy. Although it requires immense knowledge about the sector and bears significant risks, equity funds providing exposure to the sector are a great way to diversify traditional portfolios.  Owing to its low correlation with other asset classes, the real estate sector is a great diversifier. Moreover, real estate investments are a great way to gain inflation protection, as rising prices increase the resale value of the property and it can also be used to generate rental income.   CompetitionThe fund faces intense competition. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the real estate sector.iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to real estate stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index. It has AUM of $3.7 billion and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are American Tower Reit Corp (AMT  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group Reit Inc (SPG  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Reit Co (CCI  -  Free Report) with 6.3%, 4.8% and 4.5% allocation, respectively.

125,CCI,"On Mar 5, we issued an updated research report on Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report).Crown Castle is a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States. It owns, operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 60,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions in every major U.S. market.Let’s have a look at what’s affecting the tower operator’s performance.UpsidesCrown Castle has been continuously trying to reposition itself from a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity), through the purchase of several fiber operators. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators: FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014). On Jun 26, 2017, the company gained ownership of more than 28,000 route miles of fiber with the purchase of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. With the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) on Nov 1, 2017, Crown Castle attained ownership of more than 60,000 route miles of fiber. Crown Castle aims to leverage the fiber assets to serve two main business lines — small cell network deployments in top metro markets and other enterprise and adjacent wholesale opportunities.Meanwhile, wireless services are rapidly gaining ground based on technological advancements and network upgrades. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Crown Castle successfully addresses this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon, AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US. The company has acquired 9,700 wireless towers from AT&T and taken over 7,200 wireless towers of T-Mobile US.The deployment of 5G network should also drive growth in the company’s tower and small cell assets as wireless carriers are trying to expand and improve networks. The industry has become a battleground for the 5G race. Notably, completion of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) first implementable 5G New radio (NR) specification has set the stage for the global mobile industry to initiate full-scale development of 5G NR for large-scale trials and commercial deployments in 2019.Dividend PayoutsDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $427 million in aggregate or $1.05 per common share, up around 11% on a per share basis from the year-ago quarter.We are also impressed with Crown Castle’s board of directors’ decision to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share, payable on Mar 30, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16, 2018. Notably, the company portrays an impressive record of dividend payouts.As investors prefer an income-generating stock, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Hiked 2018 OutlookApart from the positives, Crown Castle’s bright outlook for 2018 is encouraging. The company expects Site Rental revenues in the range of $4,582-$4,627 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the $1,360-$1,405 million band. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $3,049 million and $3,094 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $642-$687 million range. FFO is expected in the range of $1,965-$2,010 million. AFFO is estimated between $2,219 million and $2,264 million. Net income is anticipated between $511 million and $591 million.Positive Earnings SurpriseCrown Castle has a positive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, the average beat being 5.67%.Estimates Trend UpWe note that sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Crown Castle have moved up for the first two quarters of 2018 as well as full-year 2018. Sales for first and second quarter of 2018 are estimated at $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, indicating year-over-year growth of 29% and 27.7%. For 2018, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 22.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first and second-quarter 2018 EPS is pegged at $1.34 and $1.39, respectively, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.1% and 15.8%. For 2018, EPS is estimated at $5.54, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 14.2%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism on prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceCrown Castle has underperformed its industry in the past three months. Shares of Crown Castle have lost 3.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.1%. DownturnsCrown Castle continues to compete against behemoths like American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications (SBAC  -  Free Report) in the global wireless tower market. Moreover, consolidation in the wireless industry has reduced demand for cell tower and is therefore expected to dent Crown Castle’s top line. Further, new technologies are reducing demand for site leases and are driving costs. High customer concentration is also a concern for the company.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

126,CCI,"Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is planning to modify the small-cell deployment rules and update the entire wireless infrastructure in the United States. This move comes as an attempt to maintain U.S. leadership in the wireless field with an eye on the global race to 5G. FCC is trying to ease deployment rules of small cells for LTE and 5G, primarily by reducing fees that local governments and other entities charge against those buildouts.Per current regulations, companies have to comply with several requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) prior to small cell installations and deployments. These federal, historic and environmental procedures were designed for larger macrocell deployments and the costs and fees associated with the same worked feasibly with 3G and 4G deployments.However, these rules are no more compatible with next-generation 5G technology, which requires small cells spaced about 500 feet apart to deliver 5G signals. The costs associated are also too high.In fact, the exorbitant small cell deployment fees are expected to be discussed at length in the FCC meeting scheduled on Mar 22.Per a FierceWireless report, wireless players across the industry have unveiled deployment costs in the respective filings to FCC, in a bid to encourage the commission to lower the fees regarding small cell buildouts. Let’s take a look.Notably, 17% of AT&T's (T  -  Free Report) deployment costs for each small cell node is due to NEPA and NHPA compliance. In fact, in 2018, AT&T expects to spend around $45 million on NEPA and NHPA compliance, which is likely to increase in the future with growing number of small cell projects.Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) estimated to have spent 26% of its total small cell deployment costs in 2017 on NEPA, NHPA and Tribal consultation process. Sprint (S  -  Free Report) has recently reported that its total costs incurred for Tribal review of small cells over the last two years exceeded $23 million. Sprint’s tribal fees totaled $173,305 for the deployment of 23 cell sites around NRG Stadium in Houston.Uniti Fiber reported review fees of more than $15,500 for installing a small cell node in downtown Milwaukee, WI. One Competitive Carriers Association (CCA) member had to pay $107,000 to 36 tribes for the deployment of 7 towers in 7 months. T-Mobile US (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle (CCI  -  Free Report) had also reported a payment of nearly $8 million tribal consultation fees for one project involving the placement of approximately 1,260 new poles in Houston.Currently, AT&T is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock and Verizon sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Both Sprint and T-Mobile US carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.U.S. wireless communications industry trade association - CTIA (Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association) along with member companies as well as others in the wireless industry have put forward to FCC various examples of the costs currently borne by them.Carr’s Support to 5GLast week, at the Consumer Technology Association’s 5G Day, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr proposed a plan to streamline the federal, historic and environmental review procedures to update wireless infrastructure deployments and reduce regulatory financial burdens on wireless providers deploying 5G.Carr claims that 5G deployments will introduce 3 million jobs, provide $275 billion for private sector network investment and contribute $500 billion to U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Further, revamping the existing rules will decrease regulatory costs of small cell deployment by 80% and cut down deployment time by half.The resulting cost savings and resources can further be redirected to increase small cell deployments geographically, thus bringing in more Americans under the 5G coverage. In fact, it is also estimated that 300,000-400,000 small cells will be deployed in the next 3-4 years to support 5G services. The figure is likely to rise up to 800,000 by 2026.To achieve these goals and the ensuing benefits, it is essential to streamline the applicable regulations. Theoutdated infrastructure regulatory rules are holding back 5G investments and deployments.Bottom LineThe wireless industry for years has argued that small cell deployments are necessary to improve wireless networks, thus paving the way for 5G networks. Notably, small cells can be used to augment the existing 4G LTE and the upcoming 5G network. Both primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or a shopping mall.Small cells also help increase the voice capacity and data speeds and complements the current LTE infrastructure. However, providing an emergency power backup remains a major headwind for small cells.Carr’s plan has been aided by many industry bodies. The Telecommunications Industry Association and the Internet Innovation Alliance have applauded Carr’s plan to advance 5G deployment in the United States. In view of the above write-up, we expect investor focus to remain on the outcome of the meeting later this month, which will decide the nation’s fate in the race to 5G.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

129,CCI,"American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) is set to acquire transmission towers from Telkom Kenya. The move comes as part of American Tower’s expansion plans and in fact, the Kenya market will represent the company’s fifth in Africa and the 17th globally.Specifically, up to 723 transmission towers will be purchased for an undisclosed amount, per the Reuters report. Notably, Telkom Kenya is the third biggest telecom company, in term of user count, in Kenya. It is 60% owned by London-based Helios Investment Partners and 40% by the Government of Kenya.  This transaction, which is likely to completed in the second half of 2018, will help Telkom Kenya unleash capital from the sellout, which can be invested in its internet network and enhance service delivery. On the other hand, the move will enable American Tower to capitalize on the expansion of mobile broadband in Kenya and fetch long-term gains.   Notably, there is a rising trend of telecom companies to shrug off the tower infrastructure to wireless infrastructure companies like American Tower, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). This is because it helps telecom companies to avoid huge outlay of money in maintaining the expensive infrastructure and rather channelize resources on service delivery.And this growing trend is offering ample scope to these infrastructure REITs to prosper. In fact, wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of towers and equipment. Moreover, with the advent of new technologies, especially 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), companies like American Tower and Crown Castle International have higher chances of growth.However, consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments. In fact, take the example of the recent merger news of T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report). If such a deal materializes, then it can be a concern for the tower operators. This is because T-Mobile US and Sprint are being facilitated by the same wireless tower operators to install their cellular networks. However, a merger of these two will result in elimination of many overlapping towers and consequently, tower operators will lose on lease rentals.Nevertheless, American Tower currently continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks. Its tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers lend it a competitive edge over rivals.Nevertheless, the company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. Further, high customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Additionally, the company has been affected by change in rate of foreign currencies, stiff competition and integration risks. Additionally, flaring up operating expenses remain another challenge for American Tower.American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Moreover, shares of company have gained 7.6% in the past year against 2.4% decline of its industry.

133,CCI,"Leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Oct 31, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.35%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.91%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE, 5G networks and increased usage of smartphones and tablets are driving demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off. These benefits are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. Further, we believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers should drive top line and lend it a competitive edge over rivals. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents per share of the company’s common stock. The distribution was paid on Oct 17 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sep 29.However, American Tower has a substantially leveraged balance sheet with around $17,509.9 million of outstanding long-term debt in the last reported quarter. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation, which is rerquired to meet future debt obligations.High-customer concentration is likely to have an adverse impact on the company’s top line. Expansion in the global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds. Additionally, the company’s upcoming results face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Also, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).We believe that such headwinds have led to the company’s disappointing price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has declined 0.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.7%.  A Closer View on Certain Important MetricsAmerican Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will generate $295 million from Asia, $165 million from EMEA, $293 million from Latin America and $904 million from the United States. Meanwhile, total international revenues are estimated at $753 million.As of Sep 30, the company is projected to own 1,48,047 towers, with 39,843 towers in the domestic market and 1,07,911 towers internationally.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Tower has an Earnings ESP of -1.54%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.64, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.67. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise  American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) Quote Key PickBoston Properties, Inc (BXP  -  Free Report) from the broader Finance sector has the right combination to deliver an earnings beat when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.

134,CCI,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 27.The company’s bottom-line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAmerican Tower faces fierce competition in the global wireless tower market from large incumbents like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).  The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of third-quarter 2017, it had $799.47 million in cash and cash equivalents and around $18,581.4 million of outstanding long-term debt compared with $787.16 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of December 2016. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation, which is needed to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may restrain the company from accessing the debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.Customer concentration is very high for American Tower and the top four customers account for nearly 65% of its quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation    among them will have a significant material impact on the top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial fluctuations for the company.Buoyed by such headwinds, American Tower’s shares have lost 5.6% in the last three months. However, the stock performance was better than the industry’s decline of 13.3%.Meanwhile, the company generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Additionally, it provides on-site maintenance and servicing of antennas, amplifiers, and base station equipment. Since moving equipment from one tower to another is cumbersome, carriers normally renew these contracts upon expiration. This generates a strong long-term lease up-cycle.The revenues generated from leasing and management of such networks is remarkable and over 95% is recurring in nature. Moreover, most of its towers are over 210 feet tall, consequently providing sufficient space for its customers to install transmission equipment. The company also owns 29% of the land under its towers in the United StatesIndia, EMEA and Latin American markets together have contributed nearly 50% of the organic core revenue growth. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted to $751 million, up 13.6% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia totaled $298 million, up 10.4% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $155 million, up 18.3% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $298 million, up 14.6% year over year. The company’s total revenues from international business are likely to outperform the U.S. revenues in the next three to seven years.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

(AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) in the global wireless tower market.Wireless services are advancing rapidly in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. SBA Communications effectively addresses this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is anticipated to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video. SBA Communications is a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the United States and internationally, offering wireless customers in-depth management experience, scale and resources.The company offers wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks. Its services include site identification and acquisition as well as obtaining zoning approvals and permitting networks representing all technologies. SBA Communications also provides a broad range of cell site equipment installation, optimization and integration services. The company’s extensive site development experience includes participation in the development of more than 45,000 communication sites.Buoyed by such tailwinds, SBA Communications’ share price gained 15.9% in the past six months surpassing the industry’s growth of 10.7%.Meanwhile, customer concentration is very high for SBA Communications and the top four among its customers, namely, Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, account for majority of its total quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will lead to a significant material impact on the company’s top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may cause significant financial fluctuations.SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SBA Communications Corporation QuoteKey PickBroadcom Ltd.

136,CCI,"American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on May 1. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to witness a rise year over year.The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) QuoteFactors at PlayAmerican Tower faces fierce competition in the global wireless tower market from large incumbents like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the company had $802.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and around $19,430.3 million of outstanding long-term debt, compared with $787.2 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of December 2016. Such high debt levels may impede sufficient cash flow generation which is needed to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may keep the company from accessing the debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.Customer concentration is very high for American Tower and the top four customers account for nearly 65% of its quarterly revenues. Further, American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets. Although this geographic diversification will boost revenues, it might jeopardize the bottom line. Tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market.Further, American Tower’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of $1.76 for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. However, the figure witnessed rise of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter.Meanwhile, the company generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Additionally, it provides on-site maintenance and servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base-station equipment. Since moving equipment from one tower to another is cumbersome, carriers normally renew these contracts upon expiration.

137,CCI,"The Q3 earnings season has just begun and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is already buzzing with activity. Notably, on Oct 18, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report), SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) and Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN  -  Free Report) are scheduled to release their quarterly results.Admittedly, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting has affected the price performance of REITs in the quarter. However, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery, a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017.Per a recent study from CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate contracted 10 basis points (bps) in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy dropped, taking the national office-vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.The industrial asset category also grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment. Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations to improve supply-chain efficiencies, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has been increasing.Nevertheless, dwindling mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online purchases have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks.Consolidation in the wireless industry is expected to bring down demand for cell-tower deployments. Further, evolution of new technologies may reduce demand for site leases. These factors will likely impact the wireless communication tower operators.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others may disappoint this earnings season. Let’s have a look at what’s in store for these three REITs set to release third-quarter figures:Houston-based Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States. Crown Castle’s ongoing operation in the consolidated wireless industry has reduced demand for cell-tower deployment. This, in turn, might dent the company’s top line considerably. Also, the latest technologies have reduced demand for site leases.In the last reported quarter, Crown Castle noted that it projects third-quarter site-rental revenues in the range of $888-$893 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $891 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues from network services and other segment is currently pegged at 176 million. (Read more: Will Crown Castle Disappoint Investors in Q3 Earnings?)The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -3.52%.

This is depicted in the graph below: Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteSL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) has been boosting its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for the company amid an improving economy and job-market environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter property net operating income (NOI) and net rental revenues are currently pegged at $183 million and $281 million, respectively, nearly in line with the previous quarter’s figures.  Nonetheless, the company has been long troubled on the retail front, with an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon. This will likely create pressure on SL Green’s top-line performance. Of late, many retailers have been filing for bankruptcy and opting for store closures, as mall traffic has been shrinking owing to soaring online purchases. Although the company is aggressively taking initiatives to lure consumers, it may take a while for these efforts to reflect in its operating results.

138,CCI,"As per Reuters, leading wireless tower operator and real-estate investment trust, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) submitted a bid to take over Lightower Fiber Networks for more than $7 billion, including debt. However, neither side has confirmed the report. Crown Castle is U.S’s leading wireless communication tower operator. It has approximately 40,000 towers and 29,000 route miles of fiber network that support small cells. More than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report). It has acquired 9,700 wireless towers from AT&T and taken over another 7,200 from T-Mobile US.Management has decided to double its existing small-cell network within the next two years.  According to a report by Guggenheim Equity Research, the company will spend around $1.2 billion to deploy 25,000 new small-cell nodes over the next 18--24 months. At present, small-cell networks are in high demand from wireless service providers to improve coverage and increase capacity.Crown Castle’s ongoing efforts in transforming itself from a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on small cell opportunity) looks impressive. In the last few years, the company has purchased three fiber operators – FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in Jan 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in Apr 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in Sep 2014).Recently, Crown Castle acquired privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC., a premier service provider of dark fiber, which will augment the wireless tower operator’s small-cell backhaul. Management is gradually developing small-cell networks to supplement macro site tower business. With the Wilcon acquisition, Crown Castle will attain ownership rights of over 28,000 route miles of fiber.Acquisition of Lightower will increase Crown Castle’s fiber network and tower count by nearly 80% and 20%, respectively. Lightower runs over 33,000 route miles of fiber network across 17 states in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest, and operates 7,000 towers and small cells.In accordance with the current market scenario, Crown Castle is pursuing small cell deployments for its wireless customers. The company is making this move to enhance its networks and meet the whooping demand for high-speed, high-capacity wireless services.Price Performance of Crown CastleIn the last three months, the stock price has gained 0.5%, in contrast with the Zacks categorized REIT-Equity Trust industry’s decline of 0.9%. Diversification of business structure toward fiber network will be a long-term positive for the company.We believe these are primarily responsible for the stock currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

139,CCI,"The telecom industry witnessed strong performances by most of the key stocks last week.On the earnings front, U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) reported mixed financial numbers in the fourth quarter of 2017. While the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line lagged the same.In the reported quarter, the company gained 1.174 million postpaid customers but lost 0.184 million prepaid customers. Quarterly retail postpaid churn rate was 1.00% compared with 1.10% in the year-ago quarter. Verizon also lost 29,000 FiOS video subscribers and 15,000 FiOS digital voice residential connections while gaining 47,000 FiOS Internet subscribers.Moreover, Verizon recently completed the acquisition of Movildata Internacional, a Spain-based leading provider of commercial fleet management solutions. In addition to Spain, Movildata will help Verizon to expand its telematics footprint in Portugal and Italy.Comcast Corp.

The company gained a net of 350,000 high-speed Internet customers and 52,000 security and automation customers, but lost 13,000 voice customers and 33,000 video customers in the reported quarter.Moreover, Comcast plans to strengthen the services it offers to small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) leveraging on its wireless network. The company is rolling out a new product, Connection Pro, which will enable SMBs to keep their businesses running in case of a power failure or loss of web connectivity.Leading wireless tower operator Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) also reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results.  The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line missed the same. Nevertheless, the company raised its 2018 financial outlook.Apart from earnings, in a major relief to Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, gave its nod to the company for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. The major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Qualcomm carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In a separate development, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of Layer3 TV.

140,CCI,"Crown Castle International Corp.’s (CCI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $1.36 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. It also compared favorably with the year-ago tally of $1.24 per share.Results reflect increase in site rental revenues. The company continues to benefit from its extensive tower portfolio, high demand for infrastructure and slew of fiber-operator buyouts. Also, the company raised its outlook for 2018.Net revenues for the quarter amounted to $1.29 billion and marked year-over-year growth of 27.9%. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 billion. Crown Castle International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteSite rental revenues were $1,153 million, up 34.5% year over year that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items. Particularly, site rental revenues in the quarter experienced a $12-million benefit due to a long-term agreement signed with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) that includes contracted new leasing activity across towers and small cells.However, network services revenues came in at $146 million, down 8.2% year over year.Operating MetricsQuarterly operating income jumped 36.9% from the prior-year quarter to $349 million. Operating expenses also escalated 24.8% year over year to $950 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was approximately $763 million, representing year-over-year increase of 31.3%.Cash Flow and LiquidityCrown Castle exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $220 million, down from $314 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. Further, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company generated $452 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $442 million in the year-ago period.Total debt and other long-term obligations aggregated approximately $15,616 million, down from $16,044 million at the end of 2017.Dividend PayoutDuring the reported quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividend of $1.05 per common share, up approximately 11% from the year-earlier quarter.Q2 OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, Crown Castle expects site rental revenues in the range of $1,153-$1,163 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the band of $348-$358 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated in the range of $757-$767 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $154-$164 million range. Meanwhile, FFO is anticipated in the $496-$506 million band, while AFFO is projected at $539-$549 million.2018 OutlookCrown Castle raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company expects site rental revenues in the range of $4,639-$4,684 million, denoting a projected increase of $57 million at the mid-point from the prior issued outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $3,097-$3,142 million, reflecting an uptick of $48 million at the mid-point. In addition, AFFO is guided in the band of $2,255-$2,300 million, marking a rise of $36 million at the mid-point.Our TakeCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. Furthermore, the company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. The company is also well on track with the integration of its recent fiber-operator acquisitions. In fact, extensive tower portfolio, increased demand for infrastructure, healthy leasing activity, continued buyout of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband are the key positives.Nevertheless, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments, and consequently, it might impact Crown Castle’s top-line performance. Also, evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases and flare up expenses.Crown Castle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

143,CCI,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is a real estate investment trust and a leading wireless tower operator. The firm through its subsidiaries owns, operates and develops wireless and broadcast communications real estate.Notably, Crown Castle’s extensive tower portfolio, increased demand for infrastructure, healthy leasing activity, continual buyout of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband act as major positives. The deployment of 5G network should drive growth of its tower and small cell assets as the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks.On the flip side, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may generate significant financial uncertainty for the company.

145,CCI,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell on Jan 24.While the company’s bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, it lagged the same in the remaining two quarters with an average beat of 2.53%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry may reduce demand for cell tower deployments and therefore is expected to have an adverse effect on Crown Castle’s top line.The merger between AT&T and Leap Wireless had a bearing on Crown Castle as it has 1,300 towers with both the carriers. Likewise, the combined entity of T-Mobile US and MetroPCS negatively impacted Crown Castle that had 1,400 towers jointly shared by these companies. Also, the merger between Sprint and Clearwire served as a hurdle for Crown Castle as both share 2,700 of its towers.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Historically, the top four among its customers, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, accounted for majority of its total revenues, of which AT&T contributes a handful amount of site rental revenues. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line.Evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services are likely to weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.On the flip side, Crown Castle’s continuous efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) looks impressive. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators - FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014).On Jun 26, 2017, Crown Castle International completed the acquisition of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. Notably, Wilcon is the premier service provider of dark fiber, lit transport, Internet access and colocation services in Southern California. Currently, it owns 1,900 route miles of fiber in Los Angeles and San Diego. As a result, Crown Castle gained 28,000 route miles of fiber.On Nov 1, 2017, Crown Castle completed the buyout of LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) from Berkshire Partners, Pamlico Capital and other investors for approximately $7.1 billion in cash (subject to certain limited adjustments). With this buyout, Crown Castle is anticipated to attain ownership over 60,000 route miles of fiber. These deals are expected to increase opportunities for small cell network deployments in top metro markets.Moreover, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), fixed wireless broadband.Markedly, IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. Going forward, it is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Crown Castle’s shares have gained 5.17%, against the industry’s loss of 2.99% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.

146,CCI,"Although most of the major telecom stocks lost value last week, the sector was witness to a number of important events. Notable among the many developments is mobile chipset giant Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) coming up with a better-than expected outlook for revenues and profit margins for 2019. Adjusted profit per share is estimated in the range of $6.75-$7.50. Revenues are forecast in the range of $35-$37 billion.Qualcomm plans to achieve the profit target through its new $1-billion cost reduction plan, gains from the NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) deal and by resolving current licensing disputes, especially with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Excluding royalty revenues and certain product revenues from Apple and other licensing disputes, Qualcomm expects to earn $5.25 in 2019.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is reportedly planning to launch a theme-based online streaming TV service in 2018. The U.S. telecom behemoth will offer channels based on themes like news, sports and entertainment. All these channels will be offered as a standalone application. The content is likely to come from Oath properties like TechCrunch, Engadget, Huffington Post and premium content from third-party sources.Also, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) recently finalized a year-long pending deal with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) related to AT&T Mobility Orange unit employees. Announced on Dec 13, 2017, the four-year contract covers more than 20,000 AT&T Mobility employees (in wireless retail, call center and tech segments) in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The deal also includes wage hikes, healthcare benefits, employment security for call center and retail sales employees, and retirement benefits comprising pension and savings plan.Leading wireless tower operator Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is reportedly planning to unite its fiber operations/assets under the Lightower brand. The merged entity is likely to form a well-established brand and network. It will revamp Crown Castle’s position as one of the largest fiber network operators in the nation. The company has been continuously trying to reposition itself from a tower operator to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity), through the purchase of several fiber operators.In a separate development, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report), the biggest cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S., is reportedly being slapped with patent infringement charges by TiVo Corporation (TIVO  -  Free Report) in relation to its X1 platform. The suit claims that Comcast’s X1 set-top boxes are infringing on at least eight of the patents, which are held by Rovi Corp. Notably, TiVo was acquired by Rovi in 2016 and the merged entity is known as TiVo, which attained ownership of more than 6,000 patents.Outside the United States, Nokia Corp. (NOK  -  Free Report) entered into a five-year deal with Optus to manage its mobile network infrastructure, operations and field maintenance. Nokia will provide network operations and software services to help the Australian telecom operator scale its network, which includes deploying robotics, artificial intelligence and extreme automation. The two companies will also work together to develop a network operations centre. Nokia carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

147,CCI,"Wireless tower operators in the United States had a robust 2017. We believe that there are several reasons for this dream run to continue in 2018, the primary being the thrust in the U.S. public safety network.  Recently, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that all the 50 states of the nation, as well as two U.S. territories and Washington D.C., have entered the FirstNet project, the first dedicated nationwide wireless network for first responders.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.Per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial and consumer purposes. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). SBA Communications became the first tower company to confirm that it has received applications from AT&T for the buildout of the FirstNet network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network. Additionally, Rivada Networks has also decided to lay out public safety network.Wireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers.Tower operators generally have long-term (typically five - ten year) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers. We believe that a strong business model coupled with growing deployment of public safety networks will give a major boost to wireless tower operators in 2018.Zacks RankCrown Castle has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators: FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in January 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in April 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in September 2014). On Jun 26, 2017, the company gained ownership more than 28,000 route miles of fiber with the purchase of privately-held Wilcon Holdings LLC. Wilcon Holdings is the premier service provider of dark fiber, lit transport, internet access and colocation services in Southern California. It owns 1,900 route miles of fiber in Los Angeles and San Diego.The company’s latest buyout includes LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) on Nov 1, 2017. Lightower owns 32,000 route miles of fiber, primarily spread in top metro markets in the Northeast, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia.  With this buyout, Crown Castle will attain ownership of more than 60,000 route miles of fiber.Considering the current market scenario, Crown Castle is pursuing small cell deployments for wireless customers. The company is undertaking this measure to enhance its networks and meet robust demand for high-speed, high-capacity wireless services. Using small cells in unlicensed 3.5 GHz band will significantly reduce cost of operations for wireless operators. The 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard.Wireless services are rapidly gaining ground based on technological advancements and network upgrades. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Crown Castle successfully addresses this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report). The company has acquired 9,700 wireless towers from AT&T and taken over 7,200 wireless towers of T-Mobile US.The deployment of 5G network should also drive growth in the company’s tower and small cell assets as wireless carriers are trying to expand and enhance their networks. The industry has already become a battleground in the race for 5G. Notably, completion of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) first implementable 5G New radio (NR) specification has set the stage for the global mobile industry to initiate full-scale development of 5G NR for large-scale trials and commercial deployments in 2019.Bottom lineCrown Castle aims to leverage the fiber assets to serve two main business lines — small cell network deployments in top metro markets and other enterprise and adjacent wholesale opportunities. Moreover, the buyouts will help the company serve many new markets which were not accessible previously.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCrown Castle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Crown Castle has been portraying an impressive price performance in the past year.

149,CCI,"Investors in the REIT space are usually jittery when a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve and there is no exception this time too. However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018, a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a “strong” job market.This can be far more rewarding because REITs business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? A fatter purse obviously gives tenants more power to demand real estate space and shell out for higher rents.More importantly, the technology wave is not only helping tech companies but is also driving demand for the related real estates. Take for example the e-commerce boom that has hugely affected retailers’ business model.No doubt, this has adversely impacted mall traffic in recent times, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, this technological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and substantially driving up demand for space at a number of asset categories.In fact, right from the time we use our smartphones, tablets or computers for a purchase, demand for REITs get a boost. This is because as we place our demand, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. Finally, the order is fulfilled through the industrial/logistics facilities and delivered at our doorstep.Now, REITs happen to own many of these cell towers, data centers and logistics facilities. So without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Going by numbers, per a forecast from Cisco, from 2016 to 2021, global Internet video traffic and mobile data traffic are estimated to witness a CAGR of 31% and 46%, respectively.The estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. All these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower REITs including American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report) and data-center REITs such as Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty (COR  -  Free Report) and others.Moreover, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options. This is propelling demand for distribution facilities near population centers, which not only help in lowering delivery time but also reduce cost of delivery.Further, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. As such, demand from the e-commerce sector has been escalating and per a report by Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report), in third-quarter 2017, this sector accounted for nearly 25% of total U.S. leasing demand compared with 14.7% in the previous year.This is offering significant impetus for growth to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) and others. So shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Therefore, instead of being bogged down by the current rate hike news, tap the many novelties in the REIT sector. Since individual market dynamics play a critical role in determining performance of REITs, favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

150,CCI,"On Dec 5, we issued an updated research report on American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report). Let’s have a look at the overall performance of the stock.Bullish DevelopmentsAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE, 5G networks and increased usage of smartphones and tablets are driving demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s investments in Asia are paying off. Further, the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers will drive the top line.American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of organic core revenue growth. Toward this end, American Tower is enhancing prospects in India with the acquisition of tower businesses from Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Vodafone India is the subsidiary of U.K.-based Vodafone Group plc (VOD  -  Free Report).Notably, America Tower’s majority owned subsidiary in India — ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (ATC TIPL, formerly Viom) — plans to add 20,000 communications sites. Per the deal, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular will receive service level and process efficiency benefits. ATC TIPL will secure certain preferential rights of new businesses on existing portfolio and sites acquired in certain Indian markets. The transactions are expected to generate approximately $320 million in property revenues and $120 million in gross margin within a year for American Tower. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals from respective authorities.American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents per share of the company’s common stock look impressive. The distribution was paid on Oct 17 to stockholders of record at the close of business as of Sep 29.Raised GuidanceFor 2017, American Tower has raised outlook.  The company anticipates property revenues in the range of $6,510-$6,580 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 14.6%. Net income is expected between $1,340 million and $1,380 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 40.2%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $4,070-$4,110 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 15.1%. Consolidated AFFO is expected in the range of $2,870-$2,910 million, reflecting midpoint growth of 16.0%.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimate for American Tower has moved up for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018.Sales growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 are estimated to increase 9.9% and 8.8%, respectively. For 2018, sales are expected to rise 7.9%.The EPS growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 is estimated to increase 257.7% and 172.8%, respectively. For full-year 2018, EPS is expected to soar 12.9%.Positive Earnings SurpriseAmerican Tower delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.59% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average of 3.94%.Despite such positives, the company faces headwinds.The company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet. At the end of the third-quarter 2017, the company had $799.47 million in cash and cash equivalents and around $18,581.4 million of outstanding long-term debt compared with $787.16 million and $18,294.7 million, respectively, at the end of Dec 2016. Such high debt levels may impede cash flow generation, which is required to meet future debt obligations. Moreover, this may keep the company from accessing debt market and refinancing at suitable rates.High customer concentration is likely to affect the company’s top line. Expansion in global market increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Stiff competition, integration risks and rising operating expenses are other headwinds. Additionally, the company’s upcoming results face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Also, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).We believe that such headwinds have led to the company’s disappointing price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has lost 4.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.7%. ConclusionIn view of the above write-up, we advise investors to wait for a better entry point before accumulating shares. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) suggests the same.

152,CCI,"We are in the first full week of the Q1 reporting cycle, and only a handful of the S&P 500 players have released their earnings numbers, so far. Notably, banking giants kicked off the season on an impressive note, courtesy improved earnings and revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for five of the 98 Finance Sector companies on the S&P 500 (accounting 23.7% of the total market cap), that have reported earnings so far, have climbed 20.4% year over year on 6.9% higher revenues.Further, for the first quarter, as a whole, earnings of the finance sector, which includes REITs too, are expected to be up 22.7% year over year on 4.7% higher revenues.While the banking sector is already bustling with activity, we have a handful of REITs reporting earnings this week. Among these are Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to release results on Apr 18, after the market closes.     Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Crown Castle International Corp.This Houston-based REIT, engaged in the operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported. Also, leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.Moreover, the company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, it fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment from the company’s customers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated jump of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services might flare up volatility for Crown Castle’s revenues.Our proven model cannot conclusively predict if Crown Castle will likely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Crown Castle to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Over the trailing four quarters, Crown Castle delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of FFO per share.

In addition, its leasing activity is expected to remain decent amid improving economy and job market environment.Nonetheless, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate which curbs its pricing power. Furthermore, elevated supply of office space has been adding to its woes.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter net rental revenues is currently pegged at $262 million, reflecting a 1.1% decline from the previous-quarter figure. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income is projected at $48.4 million, indicating 7.2% rise sequentially.Finally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $268.7 million, 4.5% lower than the prior-year quarter.  The FFO per share is projected at $1.65, reflecting a 5.1% improvement from the year-earlier quarter.In addition to the above, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of a positive surprise for SL Green are low.

153,CCI,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results, after the closing bell on Apr 18.For this Houston-based REIT, which is engaged in operation of wireless communication towers in the United States, the bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the previous quarter. Results were backed by 28.6% year-over year increase in site rental revenues that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items.Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 5.67% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle is well poised to benefit from the high level of investment activity of its key customers. The company’s portfolio of assets is expected to witness decent demand in the quarter to be reported and leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions is likely to remain strong.The company’s continued efforts in repositioning itself from being a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) look impressive. In 2017, the company fortified its portfolio with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U.S. markets. These markets have been experiencing high demand for network investment by the company’s customers.For the first quarter of 2018, Crown Castle expects Site Rental revenues of $1,132-$1,142 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $1,138 million, denoting a projected increase of 8.3%, sequentially.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s site rental revenues for towers is currently pegged at $747 million for the first quarter, reflecting a projected increase of 0.8% sequentially. Site rental revenues for fiber are projected at $392 million, denoting an estimated surge of 26.5%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $1.31 billion, indicating year-over-year projected growth of 29.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.34, reflecting a rise of around 8.1%.In addition to the above, the deployment of 5G is expected to drive growth on both the company’s tower and small-cell assets. This is because the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things (IoT), and fixed wireless broadband.Remarkably, the IoT space is touted as the next big thing in the evolution of technology and higher investment by the wireless carriers. It is anticipated to boost the company’s revenues.However, Crown Castle competes in a highly competitive wireless tower operator industry, with incumbents like American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). Consolidation in the wireless industry might reduce demand for cell-tower deployments and therefore is expected to impact Crown Castle’s top-line performance.Furthermore, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s revenues. Evolution of new technologies might bring down the demand for site leases as well. Developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services will likely weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for infrastructure support and network services will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there was lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.34 over the past 30 days.Crown Castle’s shares have inched up 0.3%, against the industry’s loss of 4.5% in the past three months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%.

154,CCI,"Crown Castle International Corporation (CCI  -  Free Report) has been making concerted efforts to reposition itself from a tower company to a fiber provider, focusing on the small cell opportunity, backed by fiber operator acquisitions. Amid the ever-changing developments in new technology that could reduce demand for site leases and inflate expenses, such business diversification augurs well for long-term profitability.  The company has been making strategic buyouts to fortify its position as one of the largest fiber network operators in the United States. Its acquisition of LTS Group Holdings LLC in November 2017 enabled the company to gain around 32,000 route miles of fiber located mainly in top metro markets in the Northeast, including Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Further, such strategic deals offer higher opportunities for small-cell network deployments in these markets.Moreover, deployment of 5G aid wireless carriers to expand and improve their networks by providing coverage, capacity and speed which is needed to support mobile video, Internet of Things (IoT) and fixed wireless broadband. This, in turn, is anticipated to fuel revenues for Crown Castle’s tower and small cell assets.Additionally, a hike in the 2018 outlook by management in Q1 instills confidence in the company. The raised outlook primarily reflects the expected impact of the recently-signed customer agreements. Specifically, the company expects site-rental revenues of $4,639-$4,684 million, denoting a projected increase of $57 million at the mid-point from the previously issued outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $3,097-$3,142 million, reflecting an uptick of $48 million at the mid-point. In addition, AFFO is guided in the band of $2,255-$2,300 million, marking a rise of $36 million at the mid-point.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past year. Crown Castle has gained 5.1%, while the industry has declined 2.2%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share has remained unchanged in a month’s time.However, further advancement of technology is expected to reduce demand for site leases. In fact, recent developments in satellite-delivered radio and video services will likely reduce need for tower-based broadcast transmission, while changes in demand for network services might expose Crown Castle’s revenues to volatility. Moreover, as mobile handset manufacturers and wireless carriers increasingly adopt the Voice over WiFi network technology, its revenues are feared to be impacted.In addition to the above, high customer concentration remains a headwind. While the company’s top four customers — Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile — account for majority of its total revenue, AT&T contributes a handful of site rental revenues. Hence, loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly impact the company’s top line.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Columbia Property Trust, Inc. (CXP  -  Free Report) and Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

155,CCI,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Crown Castle International Corporation (CCI  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CCI due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Crown Castle Posts Solid Q1 Earnings, Raises OutlookCrown Castle’s first-quarter 2018 AFFO per share of $1.36 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. It also compared favorably with the year-ago tally of $1.24 per share.Results reflect increase in site rental revenues. The company continues to benefit from its extensive tower portfolio, high demand for infrastructure and slew of fiber-operator buyouts. Also, the company raised its outlook for 2018.Net revenues for the quarter amounted to $1.29 billion and marked year-over-year growth of 27.9%. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 billion.Site rental revenues were $1,153 million, up 34.5% year over year that included organic growth, as well as contributions from acquisitions and other items. Particularly, site rental revenues in the quarter experienced a $12-million benefit due to a long-term agreement signed with AT&T Inc. that includes contracted new leasing activity across towers and small cells. However, Network Services revenues came in at $146 million, down 8.2% year over year.Operating MetricsQuarterly operating income jumped 36.9% from the prior-year quarter to $349 million. Operating expenses also escalated 24.8% year over year to $950 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was approximately $763 million, representing year-over-year increase of 31.3%.Cash Flow and LiquidityCrown Castle exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $220 million, down from $314 million reported at the end of the prior quarter. Further, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company generated $452 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $442 million in the year-ago period.Total debt and other long-term obligations aggregated approximately $15,616 million, down from $16,044 million at the end of 2017.Dividend PayoutDuring the reported quarter, Crown Castle paid common stock dividend of $1.05 per common share, up approximately 11% from the year-earlier quarter.Q2 OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, Crown Castle expects site rental revenues in the range of $1,153-$1,163 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected at $348-$358 million. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated in the range of $757-$767 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $154-$164 million range. Meanwhile, FFO is anticipated in the $496-$506 million band, while AFFO is projected at $539-$549 million.2018 OutlookCrown Castle raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company expects site rental revenues in the range of $4,639-$4,684 million, denoting a projected increase of $57 million at the mid-point from the prior issued outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the band of $3,097-$3,142 million, reflecting an uptick of $48 million at the mid-point. In addition, AFFO is guided in the band of $2,255-$2,300 million, marking a rise of $36 million at the mid-point.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

156,CCI,"U.S. telecom service providers Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) are collaborating over a cell tower deal. Although, they compete fiercely in the domestic wireless market, their partnership marks a new move in the lucrative wireless-tower industry.AT&T and Verizon have inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States. Privately held, Tillman is the owner and operator of towers, small cells and smart cities infrastructures. Per the deal, Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT&T. Construction work of the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018. Installation of equipment in the already completed sites will begin as soon as possible.Currently, both Verizon and AT&T carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.These new structures will add to the overall communications infrastructure in the country and will fulfill the availability of towers in newer locations. The build-outs will also help the wireless carriers relocate equipment from their current towers.The companies are focusing on technology innovation, with further investment in the updated software platforms to provide the best customer experience in their network.The MotiveThe partnership implies that the biggest U.S. wireless carriers are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure prices for towers. Moreover, carriers are always looking for alternative partners to reduce their dependence on specific customer base, thanks to the already saturated domestic wireless market.Domestic telcos are moving away from traditional tower leasing model, in order to cut down spending as data consumption continues to rise. Notably, these companies plan to create a diverse community of suppliers and tower operators, to maintain a healthy market competition.Additionally, AT&T and Verizon are striving to expand their network capacity in order to meet consumers’ demand for more cellular data. The companies are also reviewing their long-term contracts for renewal and trying to gain new vendor partners to diversify their infrastructure lineup.The ConsequencesThe U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies — American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report), SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report).Customer concentration is very high for these tower companies as they heavily depend on the top four wireless carriers — Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile US — for a major part of their quarterly revenues. The loss of any of these customers or consolidation will have a negative impact on the companies’ top line. Moreover, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable-TV operators may generate significant financial fluctuations for the company.In such a scenario, the joint venture move is sure to pose severe competitive threat to established tower companies.Price Performance Despite such positives, the wireless carriers portray a disappointing price performance. In the past month, shares of AT&T and Verizon have lost 4.9% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with the industry’s decline of 8.4%. Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

157,CCI,"American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of tower businesses from Vodafone India Limited and Idea Cellular Limited for INR78.5 billion or $1.2 billion.Notably, this leading international wireless tower operator’s majority owned subsidiary in India — ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (ATC TIPL, formerly Viom) — plans to add 20,000 communications sites.American Tower currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vodafone India is the subsidiary of U.K.-based Vodafone Group plc (VOD  -  Free Report). Idea Cellular is a mobile network operator and the fourth-largest Internet service provider in India. Accordingly, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India are seeking to merge their operations to create the country's largest telecom operator. The merged entity will carry a value of more than $23 billion with 35% market share. The sale of assets is an initiative by the companies to sell their holdings, before the proposed merger.Deal ProspectsAs part of the deal, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular will receive service level and process efficiency benefits. ATC TIPL will secure certain preferential rights of new businesses on existing portfolio and sites acquired in certain Indian markets.American Tower is hopeful that the addition of these two high-quality portfolios will contribute to long-term leasing growth in India. The country’s leading mobile operators are presently focused on accelerating their 4G network deployments.American Tower is optimistic about the expansion of mobile broadband services in India, with participation in the Digital India initiative.Accordingly, the company generates more than 50% of the organic core revenue growth from its Indian, EMEA and Latin American markets. In third-quarter 2017, within the Property segment, revenues from the United States totaled $904 million, up 8% year over year. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted $751 million, up 13.6% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia (India) totaled $298 million, up 10.4% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $155 million, up 18.3% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $298 million, up 14.6% year over year.The transactions are expected to generate approximately $320 million in property revenues and $120 million in gross margin within a year for American Tower. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals from respective authorities.Price Performance American Tower displays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, the stock has returned 7.5% compared with the industry’s rally of 3.5%.  In the U.S. market, American Tower competes with the likes of Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report). We believe that geographic diversification will help the company reduce dependence on the highly-saturated wireless market.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

158,CCI,"The U.S. telecom industry continues to witness intense pricing competition as success depends largely on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition.Nevertheless, one sub-segment of the telecom industry, wireless tower operators, has had a strong showing in the last one year. We believe there are several reasons for this dream run to continue in 2018. We will discuss the reasons in short.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U.S. wireless carriers. In this context, Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Massive Spectrum Deployment by CarriersWireless networks will be key to the future growth of the overall telecom industry. As wireless networks run on radio frequency, spectrums (airwaves) have become the most sought-after commodity in the industry. T-Mobile US has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. In 2018, AT&T will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Furthermore, AT&T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network.Additionally, major U.S. telecom operators are currently exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally.The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) at its next open meeting on Nov 16 will discuss on the proposal of making available 1,700 MHz of high-frequency spectrum for flexible terrestrial wireless use and providing 4 GHz for core satellite use. Entry of New Players in the Wireless SpaceThe U.S. wireless industry is likely to become get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators) in this space. Comcast has already entered this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. At present the company is using its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network coupled with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Similar to Comcast, the company also has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Charter Communications has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network.These trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the FCC. The company is actively testing licensed small-cell technologies and has petitioned the FCC to release 3.5 GHz spectrum, popularly known as the CBRS band, for both licensed and unlicensed use.DISH Network, the second largest satellite TV operator, has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has a clear plan to build a wireless network on its own.Strong Business ModelWireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers. Tower operators generally have long-term (typically five - ten year) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is expected to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video.Recent trend of tower operators diversifying as fiber providers (focused on the small cell opportunity) looks impressive. Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G. Dark fiber based wireless backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually lead the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs.Our ChoiceWe believe all three wireless tower operators, American Tower, Crown Castle and SBA Communications will maintain their ongoing momentum in 2018. Currently all the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) has a total of 147,873 towers of which 39,764 are domestic and 108,109 are international towers. The company has long-term (three-five years) earnings per share (EPS) growth estimate of 13.67% and it currently has a dividend yield of 1.85%.Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) operates 40,124 towers in the United States. The company has long-term (three-five years) EPS growth estimate of 15.50% and a dividend yield of 3.80%.SBA Communications Corp.

159,CCI,"Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report), a leading wireless communication tower operator in the U.S., is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 19, after market closes.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.90%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.10%.The price performance of Crown Castle was also been impressive over the last six months. The stock returned 12.8%, outshining the Zacks categorized REIT- Equity Trust Other industry’s gain of 5.15% over the same time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider Crown Castle’s continuous operation in a consolidated wireless industry has reduced demand for cell tower deployment. This is, therefore, expected to have an adverse effect on the company’s revenues.The leading four Crown Castle customers – Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Sprint Corporation (S) and T-Mobile – account for the majority of its total revenue. Hence, loss of any of these customers or consolidation will significantly impact the wireless tower operator’s top line.Evolution of new technologies may reduce the demand for site leases. In addition, frequent changes in demand for network services and infrastructure support tend to increase volatility in revenues. Moreover, popularity of the Voice over WiFi network is increasing in metro cities. With both mobile handset manufacturers and wireless carriers rapidly adopting the technology, the company’s top line may come under pressure.Carriers like Sprint are looking for an alternative microwave technology, dubbed as the ‘Next Generation Network’, to replace the more traditional backhaul system.Also, owing to its expansive international presence, Crown Castle is highly exposed to currency exchange-rate risks.However, the company’s extensive tower portfolio, increased demand for infrastructure, healthy leasing activity, continual buyout of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband act as major positives. The deployment of 5G network should drive growth of its tower and small cell assets as the wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CrownCastle has an Earnings ESP of -1.74%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.13, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Crown Castlehas a Zacks Rank #2 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s -1.74% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Crown Castle International Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Crown Castle International Corporation QuoteAnother Stock to ConsiderLiberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) from the Zacks categorized broader Finance sector has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it expectedly reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25.

160,CCI,"The U.S. telecom industry remained rather subdued last week. On the earnings front, telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) reported mixed financial numbers in the third quarter of 2017. While the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line met the mark.Nevertheless, the company gained 0.603 million postpaid wireless customers and 0.139 million prepaid wireless customers. In the reported quarter, Verizon lost 18,000 FiOS video subscribers. However, it gained 11,000 FiOS digital voice residential connections and 66,000 FiOS Internet subscribers.In a separate development, Verizon dropped Univision Inc.’s Spanish language TV channels from its fiber-based FiOS TV network. In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Univision complained that the U.S. telecom behemoth pulled down its TV channels at 4:59 p.m. on Oct 16, two minutes before Univision's carriage deal with Verizon was set to expire, without any prior notice to the company.Univision is the largest Spanish-language TV broadcaster in the United States and is partially controlled by the Mexican cable MSO (multi service operator) Grupo Televisa SA (TV  -  Free Report).Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI  -  Free Report), the largest integrated telecom operator in Canada, reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2017, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. In the third quarter, the company added 129,000 postpaid wireless subscribers and 27,000 high-speed Internet customers, but lost 18,000 video subscribers.Leading wireless communication tower operator Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) also reported mixed results for the third quarter of 2017. While the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line lagged the same. The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per common share, reflecting an increase of approximately 11% compared with the prior-quarter figure of 95 cents per share.Meanwhile, U.S. telecom giant AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) announced that its third-quarter 2017 financial results will be hurt by recent natural calamities such as the multiple hurricanes that hit the U.S. coasts and a devastating earthquake in Mexico.The company announced that it lost a net 90,000 U.S. video subscribers in the quarter because of intense competition in traditional pay TV markets, as well as the impact of the recent hurricanes. Customer reduction is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as the company is yet to fully restore its operations, which were destroyed by natural calamities.Moreover, AT&T and First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) recently introduced a new developer program focused on public safety innovation. The program will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network that AT&T is set to build.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. AT&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Future dividends are subject to the approval of Crown Castle's management.Fourth-Quarter 2017 OutlookFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Crown Castle expects Site Rental revenues in the range of $904-$999 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the band of $281-$286 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $624 million and $629 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated to be $159-$164 million. Meanwhile, FFO (funds flow from operation) is anticipated in the $376-$381 million band. AFFO (adjusted FFO) is projected in the $430-$435 million range, while net income is projected in the range of $91-$116 million.Full-Year 2017 OutlookCrown Castle has raised its 2017 outlook. The company expects Site Rental revenues in the range of $3,522-$3,527 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the $1,096-$1,101 million band. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $2,399 million and $2,404 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $590-$595 million range.

Net income is anticipated in the $438-$463 million range.Full-Year 2018 OutlookFor the full-year 2018, the company expects Site Rental revenues in the range of $4,546-$4,591 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the $1,360-$1,405 million band. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $3,013 million and $3,058 million.

AFFO is expected between $2,219 million and $2,264 million. Net income is anticipated between $515 million and $595 million.Deterrents Crown Castle operates in a consolidated wireless industry which is a major a concern. Further, new technologies compete out the demand for site leases. Also, the top four industry players, namely, Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report), and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS  -  Free Report), account for the majority of its total revenues. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line. We believe that it is probably due to these headwinds the company presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

162,CCI,"Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report), a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Oct 19, after market close.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.64%. Moreover, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 0.19%.The price performance of Crown Castle has been impressive in the past three months. The stock has returned 5.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 0.7% over the same time frame.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCrown Castle’s ongoing operation in a consolidated wireless industry has reduced demand for cell tower deployment. This is expected to dent Crown Castle’s top line considerably. Further, new technologies have reduced demand for site leases.Also, customer concentration is very high for Crown Castle, with the top four players as its customers, namely, Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report), Sprint, and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS  -  Free Report), accounting for majority of its total revenue. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top-line Concentration, which is a concern.Crown Castle’s extensive tower portfolio, increased demand for infrastructure, strong business outlook, healthy leasing activity, continued acquisition of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband have acted as major positives for the company. Wireless services are rapidly gaining popularity through technological advancements and network upgrade.Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Crown Castle effectively addresses this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon Communications, AT&T and T-Mobile US. Crown Castle had acquired 9,700 wireless towers from AT&T and taken over 7,200 wireless towers of T-Mobile US.In the last reported second-quarter 2017, Crown Castle unveiled its expected Site Rental revenues for third-quarter 2017 in the range of $888-$893 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $891 million.We wait to see how Crown Castle’s ongoing efforts to reposition itself from a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small-cell opportunity) through the purchase of several fiber operators will influence its upcoming quarterly results.We are impressed with Crown Castle’s continued efforts to reward its shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $18.14 per share of preferred stock, payable on Nov 1, 2017, to common stockholders of record at the close of business on Oct 15, 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Crown Castle is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of -3.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.12 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.16. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Crown Castle has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Key PickWelltower Inc , from the broader Finance sector, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it expectedly reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1.

163,CCI,"On Oct 10, U.S. national wireless carrier Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) was upgraded by a notch to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeSprint remains on track with network modernization and integration efforts, to fortify its position in the wireless industry. Sprint is also known for its unlimited offerings, which are a counteractive competitive measure against rival carriers.We believe these offerings have helped Sprint register an impressive number of customer additions during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In the reported quarter, Sprint witnessed net additions of 61,000 wireless customers, including prepaid net additions of 35,000, wholesale and affiliate net additions of 65,000. The company lost 39,000 net postpaid customers. Sprint's focus on delivering the most attractive value proposition in wireless resulted in 88,000 postpaid phone net additions in the quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of net additions. As of Jun 30, 2017, Sprint had 53,698 million wireless connections, up 0.63% year over year. Backed by such subscriber gain, Sprint has raised its outlook for full-year 2017.Meanwhile, Sprint’s wholly-owned prepaid subsidiary, Virgin Mobile USA, has extended the unlimited service offer to existing iPhone owners who are switching over to the carrier. Earlier, Virgin Mobile USA inked a deal with Apple to relaunch itself as an exclusive iPhone carrier.In August 2017, the company unveiled its Sprint MultiLine, an enterprise-grade solution within its Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) portfolio. Sprint MultiLine delivers a solution that allows businesses to add a company-owned number to their employees' personal phones for calling and texting on any mobile device and any underlying carrier. This will aid large enterprises as well as small and medium size businesses (SMB) to overcome challenges in the ever-growing BYOD environment.We also look forward to Sprint’s alliance with telecom service provider, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) to launch massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) radios. In September, Sprint carried out field tests of 2.5 GHz Massive MIMO using Sprint’s spectrum and Ericsson’s 64T64R (64 transmit, 64 receive) radios, in Seattle, WA and Plano, TX. The trial demonstrated capacity surge of about four times compared with an 8T8R antenna. Notably, both the companies are planning to launch Massive MIMO radios across the United States by 2018. These devices are expected to raise the network capacity of Sprint by up to 10 times and will also influence Gigabit LTE services, thus aiding the company’s 5G networks.The company further tried to save costs by relocating its mobile towers from the expensive space leased from Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (AMT  -  Free Report) to the lesser expensive plots on government-owned properties.Hiked GuidanceFor full-year 2017, Sprint has raised its outlook. The company expects fiscal 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $10.8-$11.2 billion compared with the previous expectation of $10.7-$11.2 billion. Sprint anticipates operating income of $2.1-$2.5 billion versus the previous expectation of $2-$2.5 billion. Capital expenditures will be approximately $3.5-$4 billion, which is similar to the previous expectation.Positive Earnings SurpriseSprint delivered a positive earnings surprise of 600% in the last reported first quarter of 2017 result (ended Jun 30). Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 129.47%.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for Sprint has climbed for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.The EPS growth for the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017 is estimated to accelerate 43.8% and 57.8%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to soar 89.1%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism over prospects of this stock.Favorable  Style ScoreGrowth investors look for stocks with aggressive earnings or revenue growth potential, which propel share price. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1  or 2 offer the best opportunities in the growth investing space.Notably, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Price PerformanceHowever, the price performance has been impressive. Over the past year, shares of Sprint have soared 5.2% as against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance looks dismal, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 18.4%, over the same time span.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

164,CCI,"On Oct 2, we issued an updated research report on Boston, MA-based, leading international wireless tower operator,American Tower Corp (AMT  -  Free Report). Let’s have a look at the overall performance of the stock.Price PerformanceOver the last three months, the price performance of American Tower has been impressive. The stock has inched up 3.3%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.5% over the same time span. When compared to the market at large, the stock’s performance looks depressing, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 3.6%, over the said time frame.Considering the stable performance of the stock, we expect American Tower to scale higher in the coming quarters.A Broker FavoriteWe note that earnings estimates for American Tower have exhibited a healthy uptrend.Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 has moved up 0.6% to $1.67 per share and 0.6% to $1.70, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has increased by 10 cents to $6.71.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for American Tower has moved up for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.The sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to accelerate 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively. For 2017, sales is expected to surge 15.1%.The EPS growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to accelerate 202.9% and 262%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to soar 238.9%.The upward estimate revisions reflect optimism over prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeAmerican Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 5G networks. Next-generation 4G LTE and 5G networks along with increased usage of smartphones and tablets are boosting demand for tower leasing. Additionally, the company’s increased investments in Asia are paying off.We believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets have driven its top line and lent a competitive edge. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core revenue growth. Notably, within the Property segment, revenues from the United States totaled $897 million (in second-quarter 2017), up 8.07% year over year. Meanwhile, total international revenues amounted $741 million, up 24.12% year over year. Within this, revenues from Asia totaled $295 million, increasing a whopping 31.11% year over year. EMEA revenues grossed $160 million, up 18.52% year over year. Latin America revenues totaled $287 million, up 21.09% year over year. The company’s total revenue from international business is likely to outperform revenues from the United States in the next three to seven years.American Tower continues to generate most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases with major wireless carriers. Further, the company provides on-site maintenance as well as servicing of antennas, amplifiers and base station equipment. The $100-million tower lease agreement with telecom behemoth AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) has helped American Tower to raise 2017 revenue guidance.We are also impressed with American Tower’s efforts to reward stockholders with a quarterly cash distribution of 66 cents on shares of its common stock. The distribution will be paid on Oct 17, 2017 to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Sep 29, 2017.All these above factors have also played a pivotal role in driving the company’s outlook.Hiked GuidanceFor 2017, American Tower anticipates property revenue to be $6,480-$6,580 million. Net income is expected to be $1,355-$1,405 million. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $4,045-$4,105 million. Consolidated AFFO is expected in the range of $2,835-$2,885 million.DownturnsCustomer concentration is very high for American Tower. The company’s major customers include AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. They account for nearly 65% of American Tower’s quarterly revenues. The loss of any one of these customers or consolidations will have a significant material impact on the company’s top line. Rapid expansion in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets increases revenues. Geographic diversification may jeopardize the bottom line as tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market. Also, it increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks.Stiff competition, integration risks, rising operating expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet act as major dampener to American Tower. In addition, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may lead to serious financial fluctuation for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s upcoming results also face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Moreover, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp (SBAC  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

165,CCI,"On Sep 25, 2017, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report), a leading wireless communication tower operator in the United States, was downgraded by a notch to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The price performance of Crown Castle was impressive over the last three months. The stock added 0.9%, outshining the industry’s loss of 2.8% over the same time frame. Crown Castle’s extensive tower portfolio, increased demand for infrastructure, strong business outlook, healthy leasing activity, continued acquisition of towers and growing demand for mobile broadband have given its expansion prospects a lift.Wireless services are gaining ground based on technological advancements and network upgrade. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management. Crown Castle taps this opportunity as over 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless service providers like Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report). The company has acquired 9,700 wireless towers from AT&T and taken over 7,200 wireless towers of T-Mobile US.The deployment of 5G network should also drive growth in the company’s tower and small cell assets as wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks.We look forward to see how Crown Castle’s ongoing efforts to reposition itself from a tower company to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity) through the purchase of several fiber operators will influence its upcoming quarterly results. The latest acquisition of privately held Wilcon Holdings LLCwill enable Crown Castle to attain ownership of over 28,000 route miles of fiber. Wilcon is the premier service provider of dark fiber, lit transport, Internet access and colocation services in Southern California and currently, it owns 1,900 route miles of fiber in Los Angeles and San Diego. The company has also inked a deal to acquire LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) from Berkshire Partners, Pamlico Capital and other investors for approximately $7.1 billion in cash (subject to certain limited adjustments). If this proposed acquisition goes through, it will enable Crown Castle attain ownership of over 60,000 route miles of fiber. Over the last two years, Crown Castle purchased three fiber operators: FPL FiberNet Holdings, LLC (in Jan 2017), Quanta Fiber (called Sunesys, in Apr 2015) and 24/7 Mid-Atlantic Network (in Sep 2014).We are also impressed with Crown Castle’s continued efforts to reward its shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $18.1424 per share of preferred stock, payable on Nov 1, 2017 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on Oct 15, 2017.Notably, Crown Castle has raised its outlook for 2017. The company expects Site Rental revenues in the range of $3,504–$3,529 million. Site Rental cost of operation is projected in the $1,071–$1,096 million band. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $2,389 million and $2,414 million. Interest expense (inclusive of amortization) is estimated in the $552-$582 million range. FFO is projected at $1,623-$1,653 million. AFFO is expected between $1,813 million and $1,838 million. Net income is anticipated between $426 million and $476 million.However, the company continues to struggle with persistent headwinds like high customer concentration and consolidated wireless industry. Customer concentration is high for Crown Castle. Notably, the top four among its customers, namely Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, account for majority of its total revenues, of which AT&T contributes significant site rental revenues. Loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will significantly affect the company’s top line. Consolidation in the wireless industry may also reduce demand for cell tower deployments and therefore is expected to have an adverse effect on Crown Castle’s top line.Evolution of new technologies may reduce demand for site leases. Further, the recent developments of satellite-delivered radio and video services will weigh on the need for tower-based broadcast transmission. In addition, frequent changes in demand for network services and infrastructure support will tend to increase volatility in Crown Castle’s revenues.Additionally, with the increasing popularity of the Voice over WiFi network in metro cities and both mobile handset manufacturers and wireless carriers rapidly adopting the technology, SBA Communications’ revenues may come under pressure.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

170,CCI,"Leading international wireless tower operator, American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 27, before market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.64%. Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.78%.The price performance of American Tower has also been impressive over the last six months. The stock returned 31.7%, outshining the industry’s gain of 3.4% over the same time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCustomer concentration is very high for American Tower. The company’s major customers include AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. They account for nearly 65% of American Tower’s quarterly revenues. The loss of any one of these customers or consolidations will have a significant material impact on the company’s top line. American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets. Although this geographic diversification will boost revenues, it may jeopardize the bottom line as tower operations in the emerging markets are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market. Also, it increases the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks.Moreover, stiff competition, integration risks, rising operating expenses and a highly leveraged balance sheet act as major dampeners to American Tower. In addition, the ongoing consolidation trend among telecom and cable TV operators may lead to serious financial fluctuation for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s upcoming results also face threats from emerging technologies like Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi). Moreover, American Tower competes fiercely with tower operators like Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, American Tower continues to benefit from increased investment of wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks. We further believe that the company’s tower buyouts in emerging markets and long-term tower leases with major wireless carriers have driven its top line and lend it a competitive edge over rivals. American Tower’s Indian, EMEA and Latin American operations account for almost 50% of its organic core-revenue growth.Earnings Whispers                                             Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Tower is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Tower has an Earnings ESP of -1.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.52, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Tower has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise  American Tower Corporation (REIT) Price and EPS Surprise | American Tower Corporation (REIT) QuoteStock to ConsiderHilltop Holdings Inc. (HTH  -  Free Report) from the broader industry has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it expectedly reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27.
