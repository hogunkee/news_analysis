0,TJX,"Retail is dead. Long live retail! After years of intense pressure from Amazon.com (AMZN), brick-and-mortar retail stocks like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and TJ Max owner TJX (TJX) have rebounded. And the best mutual funds have been picking up shares.In addition to retail stocks, the best-performing mutual funds have also been putting money into the semiconductor, medical, transportation and banking sectors over the last three months.Seventeen top funds invested approximately $70.7 million in Macy's. Such buying has helped boost the department store chain's share price from a November low of 17.41 to a recent high of 41.33. Macy's ended Tuesday's trading at 39.96.Kohl's saw 16 of the best mutual funds scoop up an estimated $40.4 million worth of shares from March to May. Kohl's initially cleared a 67.10 double-bottom buy point on May 29. But the Wisconsin-based retail stock really blasted higher on June 4. Kohl's closed Tuesday's market session at 78.32, around 13% above the entry.TJX, Famous Footwear owner Calares (CAL) and building products retailer W.W. Grainger (GWW) have also been rising over the last few months. Grainger is extended from its recent breakout, while Calares is looking to retake a 36.10 buy point in an early stage flat base. The stock is currently 3% below that entry.Although Amazon didn't join its retail rivals on this month's list, its stock has been showing strength. Amazon is now out of buy range from its latest buy point.Apparel manufacturer PVH (PVH) did make the list and has just fashioned a new breakout. After reporting a 43% spike in earnings on May 3, the owner of leading brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein is now 1% above a 163.88 entry.Fellow clothing maker Oxford Industries (OXM) cleared an 84.42 buy point on June 1, and is currently trading 10% above that price.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBoeing (BA), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) topped the latest list of new buys, with each pulling in over $1 billion in new investments.Fifty-three top funds invested approximately $1.9 billion in Boeing, while 69 funds put an estimated $1.2 billion into Adobe. Forty-one mutual funds laid down their chips in semiconductor giant Texas Instruments to the tune of just over $1 billion.Boeing lifted off past a 348.67 buy point in May and is currently 6% beyond that price. Adobe is around 35% above the 186.37 entry it cleared in early January, while Texas Instruments is working on a new base.Wolverine World Wide (WWW) led the list of stocks being sold with 22 net sellers (40 selling minus 18 buying). Despite that selling, the retailer of outdoor clothing and work footwear cleared a 33.92 recently and has now climbed out of buy range.Fellow retail stock Dillard's (DDS) was also near the top of the list with 16 net sellers (26 selling minus 10 buying). Like Wolverine, Dillard's has climbed sharply higher this month.Norfolk Southern (NSC), Harsco (HSC) and Chemed (CHE) also showed a significant number of net sellers.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookHow To Find Good Growth Stocks: A Mutual Fund Pro's Emotion-Free ApproachU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%Which Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest Growing Companies?Looking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

1,TJX,"After a year of scorching revenue gains, teen-centric retailer Five Below (FIVE) now faces questions on whether there's life after fidget spinners.XThe small, propeller-like toys, held between one's thumb and finger and spun for enticingly long periods of time, met a hyperactive nation's fidgety needs last year. They also jolted Five Below's sales higher.When Wall Street sensed last spring and summer that the trend had reached its limit, the company's stock wavered during that time. But the good news for Five Below is that children also like fake slime. And they like foam toys called squishies, and things with mermaids on them, and grips that stick onto the backs of smartphones.They might also appreciate, as investors do, that the company plans to open around 125 U.S. stores this year, and could open hundreds more in the years ahead.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Fads are important to Five Below,"" Dougherty analyst Jeremy Hamblin said. ""But they're not the be-all, end-all.""Those items — spinners, squishies and a broad supporting cast of other items sold for $5 or less — have made Five Below one of the few standouts in a retail industry grappling with an e-commerce upheaval. Its $5 price range has kept Amazon (AMZN) at bay, for now.Annual same-store sales have come in positive since 2007. The company's stock has sprinted 70% higher over the past 12 months. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Five Below also is targeting at least 20% net income and sales growth through 2020, which some analysts say is attainable. Shares were down 1.8% Friday afternoon amid a broad market sell-off to near 71.25.And as toy-store chain Toys R Us prepares to liquidate its U.S. stores, their loss could be Five Below's gain.""The company today represents kind of a rare breed in retail, and that's a young, fast-growing, dynamic company that has lots of room to grow,"" BTIG analyst Alan Rifkin said. ""Growth in retail is so rare that investors are grabbing stories like this and really running with it.""Other discount retail chains, like Burlington Stores (BURL) and TJX Cos. (TJX), have tried to Amazon-proof themselves by using low-priced clothes and home products as a reason to actually go to stores. Once customers are in, they might find a marked-down item they like — and didn't know they wanted — and buy it. The retail industry calls that experience the ""treasure hunt.""Five Below's stores aim to do the same thing, but for a younger crowd.""Consumers want experiences, and kids can be turned loose in the stores and it's a treasure hunt,"" Rifkin said of Five Below. ""They can go around the store and put (items) in their basket that they want that they didn't really realize that they wanted before. It's tough to get that on the internet.""Five Below's products are organized into eight different ""worlds,"" or categories, like Room, Style, Sports, Tech and a section called Now, for trendy or seasonal items. The store offers headphones, phone cases, fitness gear, blankets and pillows. There's also heli balls — a ball with helicopter propellers attached to it — themed after Marvel superheroes. That wide array, Hamblin said, allows it to compete with a variety of different brick-and-mortar and online retailers.A KeyBanc analysis of products at Five Below and similar products at Amazon last year found that overall, Five Below's products were 53% less expensive. They offer ""value that is not replicated"" at the online retailer, KeyBanc said in a note to clients.""We think that's a winning formula in the retail world,"" said KeyBanc analyst Brad Thomas. Thomas was among those who sensed the fidget spinner trend might have been ending last spring.That formula also includes plans to open up a whole lot more stores, following expansions into big states like Texas and Florida. The company opened 15 of them in California last year, with plenty of room to advance into San Francisco and San Diego. The company, which already has some 650 stores in 32 states, plans to open 125 stores this year, and says its store count could eventually reach 2,500.Further, Chief Executive Joel Anderson is a veteran of Toys R Us and Walmart (WMT). Its merchandising chief, Michael Romanko, has a team that has been able to sniff out trends early. The company also plans to open more distribution centers, including one in the Midwest in 2021.""Which, to me, I interpreted as them saying 'We're gonna continue that 20% growth for even longer than what most investors had expected,'"" Hamblin said. ""And I think what's why you've seen the stock rally even though the market has come in.""The analyst praise for Five Below comes as Toys R Us plans to shut down operations in the U.S. and liquidate its 735 U.S. stores. The company filed for bankruptcy protection last year, following mounting debt and competition from companies like Walmart and Amazon.""We think in a world where Toys R Us no longer exists, or is soon to no longer exist, that brands will increasingly be looking to Five Below to grow their own revenue,"" Thomas said.But Hamblin notes that the fallout from big retail bankruptcies can be ""notoriously difficult"" to predict. The Toys R Us implosion could lead to a discount frenzy, pulling in bargain-seeking customers before the stores are vacated, temporarily thinning customer traffic at Five Below.As Five Below's stock climbs, analyst expectations have climbed with it. During fiscal 2017, the company delivered same-store sales gains that were as high as 9.3%. That number could be difficult to top this year. Analysts also worry the stock is getting expensive.The company, when it reported fourth-quarter earnings last month, also offered a tempered outlook for the year ahead, with full-year earnings-per-share and revenue forecasts coming in below expectations.As the company expands at a brisk pace, attracting qualified people to fill management and staff positions will remain a challenge. Hamblin said the company plans to have five distribution centers in 2021, up from two today. Growing such operations over a relatively short period of time could also be a challenge.RBC also notes that Five Below ""sells predominantly 'discretionary' goods ('wants' vs. 'needs') and by extension is susceptible to risk of a protracted economic downturn"" as customers spend more on the things they need. Any downturn could make a dramatic expansion plan look like a bad idea in hindsight.Even as the company grows, it isn't as ubiquitous as Walmart, Target (TGT) or Toys R Us. The company has launched an e-commerce segment that, while comprising a fraction of sales, could make it more recognizable.""The e-commerce is helping increase the awareness of this company. That's a challenge too,"" Rifkin said. ""There are people in many parts of the country that have never heard of the concept of Five Below.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Five Below Beats Q4 Views But Guides 2018 Low; Burlington In Buy ZoneOllie's Bargain Outlet Shares Sink Late On Weak Revenue GuidanceJust Don't Do It: These 6 Top Stocks Teach Key Lesson In Market CorrectionRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

5,TJX,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value. Keep in mind that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action doesn't always translate into actual trading in the next regular session.China's Shanghai composite roared 2.5% higher on Monday, after tumbling into a bear market in recent weeks. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3%. and Japan's Nikkei 1.2%. European markets showed modest gains intraday.During last week's holiday-shortened week, the stock market averages were volatile but ultimately rallied. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant. If you haven't already, you should read the latest Big Picture column.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines. Square (SQ) has also been acting well. PayPal (PYPL) is close to record highs, but its recent breakout fizzled and its RS line has been going sideways since late 2017.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These 5 Stocks Have RS Lines At Highs, Including This IPO BreakoutDon't Discount These 4 Top Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesCybersecurity Leader Qualys Rebounds After Sell SignalHow Many Top Growth Stocks Are Forming Bases Now?IBD Stock Of The Day Nears New Buy Point After 46% Run In 2018

53,TJX,"Carter's (CRI) shares are plummeting below their 50-day moving average, after the children's apparel retailer revealed disappointing first-quarter guidance.Holiday-quarter profit rose 30% to $2.32 a share, easily topping views for $2.20 a share, while 10% revenue growth to $1.027 billion narrowly missed consensus for $1.028 billion.And 2018 guidance for adjusted EPS growth of 15% and 5% net sales gains compared well enough to analyst estimates for a 14% earnings increase and 5% revenue rise for the year.But it was Carter's Q1 outlook that disappointed investors, having projected a mere 2% sales gain on ""comparable"" adjusted diluted EPS of 97 cents.

"
59,TJX,"Department stores such as Macy's (M), J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) sold off Monday on little news, as investors continue to lower their prospects for traditional retailers as shoppers increasingly shift to Amazon.com (AMZN) and other e-commerce sites.Macy's fell 3.8% to 29.37 on the stock market today, trading at its lowest levels since early February, when takeover buzz began.Kohl's sank 4.8% to 38.56, setting a seven-month low intraday.J.C. Penney retreated 2.3% to 5.85, hitting a five-year low. Regional department store operator Dillard's tumbled 4.5% to 49.79, also hitting its worst levels since early 2012.IBD's Retail-Department Store group, rated dead last out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, was the biggest losers in Monday's session. Macy's and Kohl's were among the very worst performers on the S&P 500 index Monday.Department stores are working hard to try to be viable, emphasizing their online presence. But Amazon is grabbing a huge share of online sales growth and boasts bigger shipping discounts than even major retailers. Brick-and-mortar chains hope to better-leverage physical stores for online pickups and returns. But at the same time they are slashing their store count. That lowers costs, but calls into question the very omnichannel model they are trying to use to battle Amazon.IBD'S TAKE: Despite their brick-and-mortar woes, traditional retailers are seeing big online sales gains, but from very low levels.Target (TGT) fell intraday to a five-year low, though the retailer closed up 8 cents to 54.37. Target has been lumped in with department stores, especially after its weak Q4 earnings report and guidance.Amazon, for its part, rose 0.55% to 856.99. Amazon is still in buy range from an 821.75 entry and is setting up in a four-weeks-tight pattern with an 860.76 buy point.As for other retailers, Wal-Mart (WMT) isn't doing as badly as some of its rivals. Wal-Mart saw sharp online sales growth over the holidays, with U.S. same-store sales rising. Wal-Mart is re-emphasizing lower prices, a push that's squeezing everyone from Macy's to Target to grocers such as Kroger (KR).Wal-Mart shares closed up 0.1% to 59.98 Monday. But Wal-Mart stock is below its 200-day line and its relative strength line shows the retail giant is an S&P 500 laggard.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) and Burlington Stores (BURL) are near highs, but they too retreated Monday, down 1.3% and 2%, respectively.RELATED:Macy's, Costco, Kohl's And Other Retailers Are Getting SlammedRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingTarget Dives To 2014 Levels: 'We're Slow And Have Too Much Inventory'J.C.

Same-store sales grew 4.6%.Outlook: Q1 EPS of 67-70 cents, with the midpoint below consensus of 70 cents, on sales growth of 5%-6%, below consensus for 6.5%, with comp sales up 1%-2%.

The stock cleared an 81.10 buy point from from a cup-with-handle base last month.Off-price retailers are the teacher's pets of the retail space.

63,TJX,"In Wall Street's eyes, retailers not named Amazon (AMZN) stunk in 2017, until they didn't, buoyed toward the end of the year by holiday hopes and anticipated corporate tax-cut benefits.X Now that the eggnog and bubbly have worn off and we're beginning to see which stores really felt the Christmas spirit, what can we expect from a sector challenged by a massive cultural shift in the way people shop? Does 2018 spell more doom for your neighborhood mall, or a turning point for brick-and-mortar shops?The ""retail Armageddon narrative can moderate in 2018 as better holiday season results demonstrate that a good balance of bricks & clicks can yield growth,"" wrote Baird analysts.But if Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney's (JCP) solid November-December results – but crummy stock reaction – tell us anything, it's that not everyone has faith that one good retail Christmas can translate into continued momentum through the brand new year.""It's amazing – everybody is so short-sighted,"" NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen told IBD, adding that the holidays have ""nothing to do with the success of 2018. (It's) a statement into the consumer psyche at the time.""The key festive season can account for up to 30% of some retailers' revenue for the entire year, per National Retail Federation calculations. Retail Metrics says December same-store sales are up 10.3% as of Monday, better than consensus for 7.2% comps.But thanks to aggressive discounting and year-round promotions, selling a lot of goods doesn't necessarily translate to a lot of profit for stores.And that ""false read on good news"" could lead to a ""lot of bad news and challenging news come February,"" said Cohen, as shoppers close up their wallets after chucking out the tree and taking down the lights.""Nowadays, you could be so far in the hole that a good holiday is just going to basically break you even,"" he told IBD. ""And does it mean good momentum going into the next? No. You're as good as your last sale was.""Expect more consolidation and store closures. In fact, commercial real estate services giant Cushman & Wakefield estimates more than 11,000 closures this year, a jump from last year's 9,000 shuttered storefronts.So far in 2018, Macy's has already named 11 more of the 100 stores it's in the process of closing. And Sears Holding (SHLD) on Thursday announced a deathblow to over 100 Kmart and Sears stores, as the storied department store chain, once the nation's largest retailer, continues to cling on for life.But closing a few doors isn't a bad thing, per se, in this ""over-stored"" America filled with dead malls and an abundance of shops and half-hearted foot traffic. Savvy brick-and-mortar retailers are instead beefing up their digital side in order to take on Amazon, as well as each other.""The market shouldn't ignore all traditional retailers and fawn all over Amazon and other digitally native companies,"" wrote Jefferies retail analyst Randal Konik in a Tuesday report. He said that brick-and-mortar stores' efforts to shutter stores and improve their e-commerce operations ""should lead to profit margin stabilization and improving (free cash flow) over the next 12 months.""Even department stores, despite all the murmurs about the death of the mall, should be fine.Konik sees potential headwinds for Macy's and J.C. Penney this year, ""given the success click-to-brick players have had in apparel/accessories,"" but also highlighted the steps department stores have taken to adapt, such as Kohl's (KSS) partnership with Amazon.""We keep waiting for the shoe to drop on a couple of retailers, the J.C. Penneys and the Sears,"" Cohen said. ""But you know, again, if they can make it through '15 and '16, they can certainly make it through '17.""But there's a lot of debt coming due in the next two to three years, Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins told IBD in December. It's ""hard to imagine a retailer being able to grow their business enough to grow a cash flow strong enough to pay off high debt levels.""Who's most likely to run into trouble this year? Mid-size specialty chains, predicts Cohen.Wal-Mart (WMT) gets its fair share of kudos for focusing on its digital operations, starting with the acquisition of Jet.com in 2016 and continuing with the pickup of a handful of online players such as ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy last year. That, combined with its forward-looking tests – in-fridge delivery, anyone? – and competitive measures have given it decent Street cred against Amazon.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) should do well, say experts, who mostly still have faith in the ""treasure hunt"" vibe that stores like Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington Stores (BURL) emanate. In the clothing space, few things appear more Amazon-proof to research firm Cowen than a bargain bin filled with the promise of discounted brand names.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen hails T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX as his ""best idea"" for the year, and believes off-pricers as a whole will continue to grab market share from department stores and other full-price peers. He holds an outperform rating and recently increased price target of 88 on TJX.""In a challenging retail environment where most retailers are seeing traffic declines, off-price is driving traffic gains,"" wrote Jefferies' Konik, who has a hold rating on TJX and Ross Stores. ""This has led to strong, consistent comparable sales performance and well-controlled inventories in the channel, as their wide and shallow inventories rapidly turn to give shoppers something new and fresh to discover with every visit.""But Konik offers a word of caution. He sees an ""imminent"" threat in Amazon, and says off-price retailers' lack of a proper online presence – irregular inventory and e-commerce listings don't exactly go hand in hand – ""will eventually take a toll.""Smart-speaker/AI technology could be the next big thing to upend regular old commerce.Research firm Magid says voice-enabled commerce and artificial intelligence tools have ""the potential to disrupt and disintermediate retail and manufacturing.""That may leave retailers out in the cold if manufacturers go directly to consumers. In fact, packaged goods companies ""will either merge or forward integrate and acquire retail, as they realize a voice-controlled world is really, really bad for them,"" predicted L2's Scott Galloway in late December.Cowen's Chen believes voice recognition, which should reach 25%-30% penetration, will be the next mobile phone. ""Retailers will need to interject themselves into the smart and connected home and find ways to make their brands relevant to frequent audio interaction despite the challenges of lack of visual cues,"" he said in a Dec. 26 note to clients.Chen also predicts that ""previously unlikely consolidation will occur,"" and that Wal-Mart and Target (TGT) ""will undergo a cycle of M&A in order to develop customer capabilities similar to AMZN.""Loup Ventures even believes Amazon will acquire Target, calling it the ""ideal offline partner for Amazon"" because of its ""shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.""Analysts tend to have mixed emotions about Target, pegging it either as a distant third wheel in the Amazon-Wal-Mart war, or a contender making some smart moves. NPD's Cohen falls into the latter camp, highlighting Target's recent acquisition of same-day delivery company Shipt, its holiday performance and private-label successes in apparel.""I think Target is going to be a huge winner,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon Holds Prime Position With Record 60 Million Subscribers

64,TJX,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) is on track to leapfrog Macy's (M) and TJX (TJX) in apparel and footwear sales his year, jumping from the fourth position to second, behind Wal-Mart (WMT), says a marketplace analysis by Wells Fargo Securities.X Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow says Amazon's gross merchandise volume this year will approach $18.5 billion, up 19% from the prior year. Boruchow estimates that Amazon has tripled its sales in apparel and footwear over the past five years. He also estimates that Amazon's total share of the apparel and footwear sales online will approach 30% this year, up from less than 20% in 2011.""Thus, Amazon is clearly becoming a formidable player in the industry,"" wrote Boruchow.Wells Fargo has an overweight rating on Amazon and a price target of 1,525.According to Euromonitor data, Amazon sells roughly five times as much apparel and footwear online as the second-largest online player, Wal-Mart.Fighting back against Amazon, Wal-Mart has moved aggressively into e-tailing. Wal-Mart said its e-commerce business is set to expand by 40% next year as it goes toe-to-toe with Amazon.  Wal-Mart is also trying to steer more customers toward its website and get more of them to pick up orders in-store.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock, has a Composite Rating of 69 out of a possible 99. On Cyber Monday, Nov. 27, Amazon shares hit a record high of 1,213.41. Amazon.com is still mildly extended from a 1,083.41 buy point despite a 2.4% washout in big turnover Monday.Also checking in on Amazon's apparel business was Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel in a report issued Tuesday.""Amazon is already one of, if not the, largest apparel retailers,"" Siegel wrote.Amazon does not break out sales figures for apparel and footwear.""Given Amazon's continued push into apparel, and the adoption by new vendors and new customers coupled with the launch of Amazon Wardrobe and new private-label apparel lines, we believe Amazon will continue to see double-digit growth and is among, if not already, the world's largest apparel retailers,"" Siegel wrote in a research note to clients.Siegel has a buy rating on Amazon and price target of 1,360.Shares of Amazon gained 0.7% to close at 1,141.57 on the stock market today.

Same-store sales rose 3% in Q2. U.S. comps in February, excluding gasoline, rose 2%, below the 3% gain predicted by Retail Metrics.Effective June 1, annual fees for individual and business memberships in U.S. and Canada will go up by $5. Fees for Executive memberships will go up by $10. Costco sees the changes affecting 35 million members, with about half of them Executive members.Membership fees contributed $2.65 billion to Costco's fiscal 2016 revenue, which totaled $118.7 billion for the year. Those fees accounted for the bulk of Costco's operating income.Stock: Costco sank 4.5% late. Shares closed up less than 0.1% at 177.98 in the stock market today. Costco stock is well out of buy range after clearing a 165.05 entry point from a cup-with-handle base.Why It Matters: For the same reason that TJX (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) matter — they're all retailers that aren't floundering.Last month, Costco reported 5% in comparable-sales gains for January, excluding currency impacts and gas-price changes, marking the biggest comp-sales gain in over two years. This comes at a time when big-box retailers like Target (TGT) are struggling amid a war with Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Plus, some on Wall Street are speculating that Costco is mulling another increase to its membership fees. UBS analysts believe a fee hike is ""still likely"" in 2017, citing Costco's history of raising fees every five or six years.RELATED:Burlington Stores Stock Hits New High On Strong Earnings, OutlookCostco Soars On Biggest Comparable Sales Gain In Over 2 Years

68,TJX,"Add Sears Holdings (SHLD) and Sears-owned Kmart to the list of companies that are shedding some Trump-branded products — but the company insists that politics has nothing to do with it.The major retailer said on Saturday that Sears and Kmart would no longer carry several dozen Trump Home products, according to Reuters.""As part of the company's initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items,"" said Sears Holdings spokesperson Brian Hanover, according to a statement acquired by the outlet.""Amid that streamlining effort, 31 Trump Home items were among the items removed online this week,"" he said. Those products were reportedly sold only online and not in brick-and-mortar Sears and Kmart stores.But responding to recent headlines via blog post, Sears said Monday that the changes reflect a routine shuffle of its product assortment and that ""hundreds"" of Trump and Ivanka Trump items are available on Sears.com through third-party marketplace sellers.""I think any fair observer can understand why this confusion was generated and why we prefer to remain focused on serving our members and our marketplace sellers and leave the politics to others,"" wrote Sears Holdings Vice President of Corporate Communications Chris Brathwaite.Sears shares plunged 8.1% to close the regular trading session at 6.40 on the stock market today.

Those weeks marked the period leading up to the election.IBD'S TAKE: With or without scrutiny from the president, retailers have been facing challenges, and malls have been forced to ramp up the drama in the age of Amazon (AMZN). Here's what that looks like.Boycotts of Trump-branded goods have surfaced in the form of the Grab Your Wallet campaign and criticism online. The President fired off a tweet at Nordstrom on Wednesday, less than a week after reports emerged that the upscale department store was dropping his daughters line of merchandise.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Nordstrom said the change was a reflection of sales performance.While this is far from the first time that Trump has singled out an individual company on Twitter (TWTR), his tweet at the department store has raised concerns about ethical conflicts of interests and a blurred line between his roles as president and businessman.Despite the attack, Nordstrom shares rose sharply on Wednesday to notch its biggest one-day gain in two months. But Nordstrom dipped 2.3% Monday morning.Fashion news site Racked.com has reported that Neiman Marcus, Belk, HSN and ShopStyle have dropped Ivanka Trump merchandise.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT)-owned Jet.com also appears to have pulled Trump-branded goods, Mic reported, though Wal-Mart itself still offers Trump merchandise.T.J.

71,TJX,"E-commerce leader Amazon (AMZN) has significant momentum heading into 2018 and could beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates if the expectations of a Wall Street analyst prove accurate.X GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives estimated Amazon received between 45% and 50% of holiday online retail sales this year, up from 38% during the same period last year. The sales gains came despite a strong online performance by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), and with Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) also holding their own, Ives said in a research note to clients.Wal-Mart has stepped up its game and is on pace to significantly increase its market share online this holiday season, Ives said. But Amazon holds an advantage with its Prime membership program, where customers pay $99 a year and receive free shipping and numerous other perks, turning them into loyal Amazon fans and shoppers. Ives estimates that there are 88 million Prime customers, up about 40% from last year. The average Prime customer spent 22% more this holiday season than the year-ago period, he estimates, ""which speaks to the pure power of the Amazon consumer model,"" Ives wrote.""While Walmart is emerging as Amazon's biggest sole competitor online, we believe customer overlap remains small today as Prime membership growth and Amazon's stronghold on e-commerce remain hard to penetrate as we expect this trend to continue to play out in the near-term heading into 2018,"" Ives wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on the exclusive IBD Leaderboard list of top stocks. Amazon shares are currently extended from a 1,083.41 buy point. The latest breakout was from a late-stage base, and the stock broke out in a sudden rush of buying from near the base's lows, both negatives.Amazon on Tuesday touted its biggest holiday sales season ever. Among its success stories, in one week alone more than 4 million people joined its Prime service, either through free trials or paid memberships. Amazon does not reveal total Prime customers.Amazon scored record sales on Cyber Monday and Black Friday as consumers responded to a raft of promotions.""The ring-fence that Amazon has built around its Prime customer base has significantly benefited the company in a fiercely competitive pricing environment with much more competitive prices and inventory from Wal-Mart in particular seen over the last month, (and) with Target and Best Buy also holding their own based on our analysis and retail tracking,"" Ives wrote.He maintained a rating of highly attractive for Amazon, with a price target of 1,350 and calling it a top pick for 2018.Amazon shares rose 0.5% to 1,182.26 on the stock market today. Amazon shares hit a record high of 1,213.41 on Nov. 27.Ives projects Amazon can beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates by 4% to 5% if his holiday sales estimates are accurate.The retail sector has been showing strength recently, from long-ailing department-store titans like Macy's (M) to discount chains like Wal-Mart. Also stepping up its game against Amazon, Target recently announced that it would buy an online delivery company to expand its same-day delivery services to shoppers.In terms of Amazon's next strategic move, wrote Ives, ""We believe pharmacy and health care is the natural logical next step to take in 2018 as the company looks to further expand its consumer stronghold.""Early this month Amazon received two price-target hikes, following a five-day conference on cloud computing that demonstrated its growing strength in artificial intelligence.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon's Booming Apparel Business In Position To Pass Macy's, TJXLooking For The Next Big Thing?

77,TJX,"One of Burlington Coat Factory's biggest obstacles in recent years might have been right there in the retailer's name: coats. There was a bit too much emphasis on coats, many believed, and not enough on T-shirts, dresses, table linens, fragrances, makeup and other things that exist outside the business of cold winters — in essence, the sales opportunities for retailers in the other three seasons.But after being taken private a decade ago and public again in 2013, the off-price chain — now called Burlington Stores (BURL) — has tried to turn that perception around. Perhaps most importantly, Burlington has put more effort into expanding and improving its home, beauty and women's sportswear items, which can work better as gifts and draw more store traffic in the non-winter months. ""And now obviously they don't call themselves Burlington Coat Factory,"" RBC analyst Brian Tunick told IBD. ""So that should be some signal to you and the shoppers that they used to make (all) of their profits in the holiday quarter, and they would live and die by the cold winter.""In years past, coats made up nearly a third of annual sales, according to RBC, but the company says that as of 2015 they were down to 6%. And as larger rivals Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX (TJX) pick away at ailing higher-end department stores, investors appear to believe that Burlington Stores has ample room to do the same as it adds more types of products to its racks and shelves. ""Those are businesses that help 'de-weatherize' the company,"" Tunick said. In the process, over the past year, shares of Burlington, whose roots trace back to the 1920s, have outperformed off-price rivals and specialty retailers that have been increasingly worn down by Amazon.com (AMZN) and discount wars. Burlington's stock price has more than doubled since the end of 2015, compared to the 22% gain for Ross Stores and the 7% gain for TJX. Burlington's stock has a solid IBD Composite Rating of 79 as of Thursday, coming off higher levels seen earlier.Those gains also come as more customers, particularly those who are low-income or with finances still fragile after the recession, choose value over brand name when they shop. ""(Burlington) stands to benefit from a secular shift in consumer demand to the off-price format in both the long-term and near-term,"" Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul said in a November research note.
"
78,TJX,"Unlike higher-end stores, off-price stores like Burlington, Ross and TJX get a bit more protection from Amazon due to the experience of actually shopping at their stores. In that so-called ""treasure hunt,"" shoppers walk in, don't entirely know what they're going to buy, stumble upon a marked-down item, buy it, and come back hoping to be pleasantly surprised again.""Our assortments are broad and shallow,"" the company said in a written statement. ""In other words, we don't like to have more than six of any particular style in a store. If you see it, you better buy it or it won't be there the next time you come in.""That experience, for now, is difficult to duplicate online. Burlington and TJX get less than 1% of their sales from their websites, while Ross doesn't even have an e-commerce operation, Tunick said. Even as Burlington broadens the treasure hunt for home, women's, accessories and footwear lines, the expansion is still well behind that of other off-price rivals, leaving the company room to grow more, RBC notes.Burlington's store count at the end of 2015 was around 40% of Ross' and around a fifth of TJX's, making it ""significantly underpenetrated throughout the United States compared to its peers"" TJX and Ross, Drbul said in the research note.Burlington, however, also has a large men's tailored clothing area and other ""special occasion"" wear, as well as Baby Depot, which sells baby clothing and other supplies — areas intended to keep the chain different from rivals. The company's still-large supply of coats and other winter-wear — RBC in August forecast that 56% of Burlington's earnings per share for 2016 would come from the fourth quarter — also help to set it apart, even as it puts more of a focus elsewhere. Those segments keep the average store sizes of Burlington bigger than its rivals. But average store sizes and inventory have begun to shrink as the company moves away from selling so many coats. The company in the past few years has also begun using ""pack away"" inventory, in which a retailer purchases products on the cheap and sells them later, giving it more flexibility with the vendors from which Burlington buys excess goods.IBD'S TAKE: While malls become miniature ghost towns, off-price retailers are still largely gaining in store traffic. Elsewhere in the discount retail space, discount grocery stores are also largely insulated from e-commerce. Burlington's buying model, the company said, also makes the chain more flexible when retailers cancel orders due to events like warmer winters, backups at ports and hurricanes — all of which have happened in recent years.But even as the company tries to make its profits less winter-dependent and works to draw more high-quality vendors, analysts say Burlington has work to do in shedding its ""coat factory"" reputation. Seemingly around-the-clock discounting in the retail space, along with Burlington's store sizes, could still weigh on sales and margins. And Burlington, for now, still depends a lot on the winter, and even that's not a guarantee.""Last winter was the warmest winter ever,"" Tunick said, after a harsh cold snap in 2013 and 2014, and some massive snowstorms in the 2014-15 winter. ""So no one quite knows,"" he added.Still, Burlington's store makeover and broader product offerings could help customers stick around, rather than flock to higher-end stores, if the economy improves and states boost minimum wages. Low gas prices and cheap groceries could also free up more room for spending. And amid erratic weather patterns, more giftable items in the fragrance and bath-and-body categories could help prop up the company if future winters stay warmer. And analysts like the company's prospects under President-elect Donald Trump. If Trump cuts taxes, that helps. But if he hacks away at international trade deals, Burlington would still be in decent shape, given that much of what the company sells is bought from third-party vendors, as opposed to having a whole lot of those items sourced directly from a country like Mexico. The company declined to speculate on how a Trump administration might affect business. But other analysts felt that the company could stay comfortable regardless of who had won the office in the November election. Cowen analyst John Kernan wrote in a research note in October that Burlington was well positioned due to its plans to offset payroll increases with ongoing expense-control programs, as well as the potential for rising lower and middle incomes to help build its customer base.Kernan also wrote that Burlington had a ""modest exposure to global trade issues and foreign exchange rate fluctuations."" Shares of Burlington gapped up in late November and have remained above the 80 level since then. On Monday, shares were up marginally to 85.49.RELATED: How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of RetailWhich Retailer Will Win Christmas This Year?

Trump also returned to attacking the costly Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet, saying he'll save billions of dollars as he pushes more competition. Lockheed, which has said that it is reducing per-jet costs after years of overruns and delays, said that it's promised to ""aggressively"" reduce F-35 expenses.

81,TJX,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

Analysts were modeling for EPS of $2.03 on sales of $14.36 billion.Semiconductor-equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) beat fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings targets and guided higher for the current quarter.

Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September.

But the struggling retailer said earnings per share next year could fall by as much as 20%, citing flat same-store sales and plans to spend money on e-commerce, private brands and other investments. Dick's shares fell Tuesday but rose for teh week. However, Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) reported better-than-expected earnings, sending their shares soaring Friday.

87,TJX,"Target (TGT) sees a ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter and gave weak earnings guidance Wednesday, as an analyst warned it may get squeezed further by rivals like Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT).XThe big-box retailer's earnings per share fell 12.5% to 91 cents, but beat by a nickel, as revenue rose 1.4% to $16.67 billion, better than forecasts for $16.61 billion.Same-store sales rose 0.9%, more than double estimates for a 0.4% gain. Comparable traffic grew 1.4%, and comparable digital sales jumped 24%.But Target expects Q4 EPS of $1.05-$1.25, below the consensus of $1.27, with same-store sales flat to up 2%.""While we expect the fourth-quarter environment to be highly competitive, we are very confident in our holiday season plans,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough warned Target is facing more competitive pressure from online retailers and Wal-Mart, adding that online sales aren't as profitable for Target vs. its in-stores sales due to shipping costs.""We believe both of these competitive issues will pressure profit margins and thus limit earnings growth moving forward,"" Yarbrough wrote in a note.Shares tumbled 10% to close at 54.16 on the stock market today, diving below their 50- and 200-day averages. Wal-Mart, which reports Thursday, fell 1.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Target appears to be lagging behind Amazon's e-commerce muscle and Wal-Mart's online strategy that has included acquiring small online shops and Jet.com, as well as allotting space on its site for Lord & Taylor's higher end offerings.As Target sticks closely to its ""signature"" categories in the home, apparel, baby and wellness space, much of its success has been found in its private label brands, including kids apparel line Cat & Jack, which raked in $2 billion in its first year on the market.Another headwind against Target's earnings are the investments it has been making in such private label brands as well as logistics, wage hikes and store remodeling.""These investments are absolutely essential for Target's long-term growth and viability but are a short term drag on the retailer's bottom line,"" analyst Ken Perkins at Retail Metrics wrote.Meanwhile, as retailers get ready for the crucial shopping season, Target is offering free shipping of its roughly 1,700 ""curated"" gift selections available for under $15.Wal-Mart said early this month that the number of stores offering its online grocery pickup service have doubled since last year's holiday season.The company also noted that this is the first holiday season when shoppers can get free two-day shipping without a membership fee on $35-plus orders for more than 2 million items.RELATED:Cisco, Tencent, NetApp, NetEase And Target Lead Investing Action PlanHow Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchTJX, Dick's Sporting Goods Sink; Advance Auto Parts Soars On Q3

93,TJX,"Black Friday. Cyber Monday. Super Saturday. The annual retail running of the bulls is a treacherous terrain of sharpened elbows and trigger-happy mouse clicks for shoppers trying to get the best deal possible.The stakes are even higher for the stores themselves: The National Retail Federation has said that sales in November and December can account for anywhere from 20%-40% of a retailer's yearly sales. Perhaps fortunately for department stores like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and others, there's nowhere to go but up this Christmas.""Given the fact that last year was so horrible, the comps are easy,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar.As weather, inventory issues, heavy discounting and e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) weighed, Macy's reported a 4.7% same-store sales decline in November and December of last year. Kohl's Q4 2015 comps edged up a mere 0.4%. Overall, last year's holiday retail sales disappointed with only 3% growth, said the NRF, less than expected.Holiday 2016 should prove to be a little less dire. The NRF predicts a 3.6% retail gain in November and December to $655.8 billion; online sales are seen rising 7%-10% to $117 billion. And retailers are feeling bullish. Target (TGT), Macy's and Nordstrom (JWN) all raised guidance going into the all-important shopping season.Predictably, online sales continue to eat into brick-and-mortar market share. Traditional stores are again gearing up to do battle with Amazon and friends.Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals from Monday to Friday so that they start essentially the minute Thanksgiving Day is over. Target's ""10 Days of Deals,"" which include both in-store and online promotions, already started on Saturday.""If you look at the companies that reported earnings, it's e-commerce that's driving a significant amount of the growth,"" said Weishaar. ""What's unique in it is mobile is becoming a higher penetration of the digital section, so that would be something new. I don't think a lot of the companies have figured out how to convert the sales on mobile.""Shopping via smartphone is the next frontier. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are projected to be the biggest mobile-shopping days of the year, said Adobe.One consequence of a ramp-up in retail digital wars, however, is that fewer people head into brick-and-mortar shops.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says the industry could see a ""significant slowdown"" in Black Friday foot traffic.Traffic fell in the mid-single to high-single-digits on Black Friday 2015, and retailers could see an equal or even greater decline this time around, he said, particularly as other shopping events during the year dilute the impact of the post-Thanksgiving sales day.Besides Cyber Monday and Super Saturday, the menu of existing shopping holidays has grown to include Amazon's Prime Day and even China-based Singles Day, among others.Foursquare's data are a little more optimistic; the company predicts a 3.5% year-over-year slide in Black Friday foot traffic, which would be ""far less severe"" than the prior year's figures.""The importance of Black Friday from a traffic (perspective) to brick-and-mortar stores is going to continue to decelerate,"" said Weishaar. ""With more people shopping online, the one specific day becomes less important.""IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. Broadly speaking, inventory levels are cleaner in Q4, which translates to more targeted, strategic discounting instead of promotional wars, said Weishaar. But even in the absence of ""everything must go""-type sales, that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't expect to see a whole lot of deals floating around.Which retail names will be winners this year?Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel pointed out in a recent note that execs at various retailers have alluded to a challenging, promotional holiday season. But there are gems to be found.""Although the election triggered a surprising sense of hope (and short squeezes), we believe much uncertainty remains and would rather buy quality companies that have lagged,"" he wrote, calling out Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as his top pick and noting that the recent Lululemon Athletica (LULU), HBI and Kate Spade (KATE) sell-offs look ""interesting.""Still shining is the off-price sector, as consumers remain hesitant about paying full retail for products and stores have a tough time escaping the ""always-on-sale"" cycle.

And even though Home Depot (HD), TJX (TJX), Coach (COH), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) compete in separate categories — home improvement, off-price clothing, handbags, millennial apparel, athletic goods — there's little doubt that online behemoth Amazon and the broader shifting retail landscape are, to some degree, impacting them all.Analysts see the home-improvement retailer's Q2 per-share profit rising 12% to $2.21 on 5% revenue growth to $27.8 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Look for possible talk on the earnings call about Sears Holding's (SHLD) recent decision to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN). Home-improvement retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's (LOW), which are big appliance sellers, sold off initially on that news. The sector generally has been  seen as having more of a buffer from the power of the e-commerce giant — but Amazon's foray into groceries, fashion and a host of other areas are enough to give retailers the jitters every time it makes a move.Shares dipped 0.4% to 154.26 in Monday's stock market trading. Home Depot, a Dow industrials component, is in a flat base with a 160.96 buy point.The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent is expected to report flat year-over-year EPS of 84 cents and 6% revenue gains to $8.32 billion.Off-price stores are another group that have, in the past, been labeled ""Amazon-proof"" as department stores struggle to adapt to a digital-first shopping environment. But growth has slowed for TJX and other off-price chains. Look for signs of continued resilience or potential chipping in its report.

They pulled back on Tuesday, retreating 1%-3% in morning trade.E-commerce and other nonstore sales jumped 1.5% in October, the best gain since May. The sector has been a big retail leader for years. But Amazon (AMZN) shares have been selling off hard since reporting weaker-than-expected profit growth on Oct. 27. Amazon profit tripled (up 206%), but fell well short of views. Amazon also gave cautious holiday guidance.Amazon stock fell 2.7% Monday, approaching its 200-day line. But Amazon rose 2.6% before Tuesday's opening bell.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's surprise presidential win has boosted blue chips and small caps. Here's the case for a Trump bull market.Meanwhile, it's unclear what holiday shoppers will be buying in stores or online. It does not appear to be a blowout year for gadgets. Apple (AAPL) has the iPhone 7 and other new products. But Apple missed sales estimates in the latest quarter and gave a conservative outlook, even with Samsung reeling from its Note 7 overheating fiasco.Fitbit (FIT) issued a dismal holiday sales forecast, though the wearables maker may face tougher competition from the Apple Watch 2. Meanwhile, action camera maker GoPro (GPRO) recalled its new Karma drone after previously giving a weak holiday outlook.RELATED:Home Depot Lifts Outlook After Q3 Earnings, Sales Top ForecastsDick's Sporting Goods Sees Weak Earnings For Holiday QuarterTJX Cos.

102,TJX,"Home improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street estimates amid weak traffic, a day after larger rival Home Depot (HD) reported strong results and in-line guidance.Estimates: Earnings per share to jump 20% to 96 cents, on 10% revenue increase to $15.859 billion, up 10%.Results: EPS advanced 10% to 88 cents; revenue climbed 9.6% to $15.74 billion.Outlook: Lowe's sees full-year EPS of $3.52 and sales growth of 9%-10%. Analysts expected $4. Even with Lowe's Q3 miss, that assumes a Q4 earnings shortfall as well.""While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October, which put pressure on our profitability in the quarter,"" CEO Robert Niblock said.Shares: Lowe's fell 2.9% to close at 67.02 on the stock market today after losing 1.4% on Tuesday. Home Depot, which reported earnings on Tuesday, rose 0.8% to 125.33 after sinking 2.6% on Tuesday.Home Depot on Tuesday said the housing market was still working in its favor, but its full-year guidance was only in line with expectations despite beating in Q3.Home Depot's same-store sales growth — 5.9% in the U.S. and 5.5% overall — easily outpaced Lowe's 2.7% gain. Home Depot has been growing faster than its smaller rival in most quarters over the last several years.IBD'S TAKE: Even as home improvement stocks contend with potential rate hikes, the broader construction industry could see a bigger uptrend if President-elect Trump carries out plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.Investors have had concerns about home-improvement spending, discounting, weaker big-ticket spending and, for Lowe's in particular, how its acquisition of Rona would affect margins. Still, big-ticket items flooring and appliances remained solid for Home Depot in the third quarter.RELATED:Dick's Sporting Goods Sees Weak Earnings For Holiday QuarterOctober Retail Sales Jump 0.8% As Retail Stocks SoarTJX Cos.

108,TJX,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) shot up Thursday after announcing that it is selling Kenmore appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN), including Alexa-enabled smart appliances, a team-up that comes after years of struggle to compete against the e-commerce giant.XBut the news also triggered a broad sell-off in home improvement chains Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), along with Best Buy (BBY). All three are big sellers of appliances.""This marks the broadest distribution of Kenmore, America's most trusted home appliance brand, outside of Sears branded stores and related online retail platforms,"" Sears said in a statement. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.The move follows Sears' deal in January to sell its Craftsman line of tools to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and comes amid questions about Sears' future, after warnings earlier this year about its ability to continue as a going concern.Meanwhile, Amazon is expanding its reach in traditional brick-and-mortar retail and agreed to acquire Whole Foods Market (WFM) last month.Sears shares were up 10.6% to 9.60 in the stock market today, near session lows after spiking to 10.76 in the morning.

But the home-improvement retailer offered a full-year forecast that was merely in line with expectations.Earnings per share rose 18.5% to $1.60, topping views for $1.58. Revenue rose 6% to $23.154 billion, past estimates for $23.044 billion, but the second straight quarter of slightly decelerating growth. U.S. same-store sales climbed 5.9%.

Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman said in a research note that the guidance was raised ""primarily to reflect a lower share count and tax rate.""Home Depot said it continued to expect full-year revenue growth of ""approximately 6.3 percent,"" roughly in line with views, and comp growth of roughly 4.9%.Home Depot rose before the open, but closed down 2.6% to 124.40 in the stock market today.

126,TJX,"Shares of TJX (TJX) -- the parent of off-price stores T.J.

Micron Technology, up sharply Monday on raised guidance, announced an Intel (INTC) deal and a big buyback after the close. In addition to its own repurchase plan, Adobe said it will buy Magento, a key rival to e-commerce software firm Shopify, which tumbled.

174,TJX,"Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods (WFM) acquisition, the launch of Prime Wardrobe, and Nike's (NKE) decision to sell directly on the e-commerce site have shaken up the grocery and broader retail space, but recent sell-offs could actually prompt ""more investable"" opportunities in retail, says one analyst.X ""Although it may take time for investors to be willing to re-enter the space, we believe this may actually have made the 'winners' within our retail/brands coverage (which have already been coping through the Amazon threat) more investable,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel on Monday, arguing that apparel ""is no 'deader' than it was two weeks ago.""Who are the Amazon-resistant names on his list? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Nike and Signet Jewelers (SIG). Ralph Lauren (RL) is also seen potentially benefiting.""With fewer 'safe havens' across the broader consumer landscape, multiple premiums around anything thought to be 'safe' will likely be reinforced,"" he said.Amazon closed down 1% at 993.98 in the stock market today. Ulta finished 1.8% higher, TJX added 1%, Ross gained 0.7%, Nike rose 0.8%, and Signet climbed 3.2%.And while Amazon's foray into ""try before you buy""-style at-home shopping with Prime Wardrobe treads further onto department store and apparel retailers' turf, Siegel wonders if the offering could actually be a boost for brands, given the number of store closures happening on the brick-and-mortar level.The additional distribution provided by Amazon, of all places, could help offset lost distribution at department stores, he said.IBD's TAKE: Meanwhile, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and other tech heads met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of Modi's meeting with President Trump on Monday.

175,TJX,"Target (TGT) shares tumbled Wednesday, as the big-box retailer took an ax to its full-year earnings guidance and said it plans for a ""challenging environment"" during the rest of 2016.Target said it's lowering earnings expectations to $4.80-$5.20 a share, down from a prior outlook of $5.20-$5.40. Analysts as of Wednesday morning expected $5.13 per share.For the current quarter, Target sees 75-95 cents in per-share profit, on the light side of current expectations for 95 cents, and said it is projecting a 2% drop to flat revenue growth at outlets open more than a year, or same-store sales.Shares fell 5.4% to 70.63 in the stock market today after falling as low as 69.90. But the stock closed below its 50-day line for the first time since early July.During the second quarter, earnings edged up a penny to $1.23 per share, topping estimates by 11 cents. Meanwhile, revenue slid 7% to $16.17 billion, just a hair short of consensus for $16.18 billion. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, weighing on revenue. Not having pharmacies and clinics to count toward results also dragged on revenue, it said.CVS Health (CVS) last year acquired almost 1,700 pharmacies and 80 clinics from Target and re-branded them as CVS pharmacies.According to Reuters, management told analysts on the call Wednesday morning that Target had experienced meaningful pressure in electronics, marked by a double-digit comp decline. About a third of that pressure is fueled in part by declining sales of Apple (AAPL) products.Apple product sales fell 20% vs. a year earlier, highlighting the problem with the tech titan's aging product lineup.Management also reportedly said Target's grocery business disappointed during the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Target isn't the only one who has turned in lackluster guidance this week. TJX, normally a standout in a struggling retail space, offered weak guidance Tuesday. But some maintain that it could be a sound investment: ""Why TJX Stock Could Still Be A Good Buy Despite Off-Price Outlook.""But the retail major is trying to keep up in an e-commerce-heavy shopping environment. As comparable digital-channel sales rose 16% in the second quarter, Target is looking to continue investing in its digital capabilities. On the call, the company indicated that it will increase its ship-from-store capacity, according to Reuters.CVS shares fell 1 cent to 97.55. Apple stock lost 0.15% to 109.22.Target rival Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) closed up 4 cents to 72.93. Wal-Mart will report earnings on Thursday.

176,TJX,"American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) beat quarterly estimates but saw comp sales cool sharply, while Children's Place (PLCE) lifted its outlook after a strong quarter.Overall retail sales were flat in July after three straight months of gains, the Commerce Department reported last week. Many retailers, restaurants and other consumer-related companies have reported sluggish demand.But some retailers are performing better than others.

That's after hitting a three-year high of 19.55 on Monday. The stock, which had risen for the past eight weeks, is just below an 18.59 buy point cleared last week.Why It Matters: American Eagle, a leading teen and young adult retailer, is among a handful of apparel chains to break out in recent weeks amid a mixed consumer environment. American Eagle also may offer clues about how well the back-to-school shopping season has gone.Estimates: Analysts see a loss of 23 cents per share vs. a 33 cent per share loss in the year-earlier quarter. Sales are seen up 0.6% to $368.6 million.Results:  The retailer reported a loss of 1 cent per share and a 1.4% increase in sales  to $371.4 million. Same-store sales were up 2.4%.Children's Place raised its full year EPS outlook to $4.60-$4.70 from an earlier outlook of $4.17-$4.27.

Sales rose 4% to $419.4 million.Stock: Children's Place, a children's apparel retailer, climbed 1% to 86.69 after hitting a record 90 in early trading. On Tuesday, the stock finished the day at 85.86, up 2.7% ,closing above an 85.01 buy point in a consolidation, a bullish chart pattern. Volume was strong.Why It Matters: Like American Eagle, Children's Place offers hints about consumer spending, notably the back-to-school shopping period.IBD'S TAKE: Ross Stores and Lululemon Athletica are apparel retailers that have broken out. Is Children's Place next? Take a deep dive in this IBD Stock Analysis. Lower-ranked Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) topped quarterly estimates after the close, sending the stock up late.Urban Outfitters (URBN), another young adult apparel chain, soared 15% after better-than-expected Q2 earnings late Tuesday.Off-price apparel chain Ross Stores (ROST) reports Thursday.

While a cup-without-handle base has a six-week minimum length and a cup with handle must be at least seven weeks, a flat base can be as short as five.See Full Series On Smart Chart ReadingOff-price apparel and home goods retailer TJX Cos. (TJX)  started to pull back on July 22, 2011, in what would become the first week of a seven-week flat base (1). The market was in an uptrend, but faced rising distribution. The market status shifted to ""uptrend under pressure,"" then ""market in correction"" by July 28.How do you know what the market's real trend is? Check the Market Pulse table in the daily Big Picture column or in ETF Market Strategy.Like the dollar stores, investors were playing TJX as a somewhat recession-resistant stock: The worse the economy becomes, the more shoppers like to save money.TJX was taking advantage of the economic downturn to build its market share and extend the reach of its TJ Maxx, Marshall's and Home Goods chains.The stock broke below its 10-week moving average in heavy trade, but found support several times at its 40-week moving average during the base. Normally, a flat-base buy point comes from the base's high point generally near the left side of the base. But in this case, TJX set up an early option, at 56.66 — a dime above the Aug. 25 high — for aggressive investors (2). It cleared that buy point in heavy trade, during a seven-day run-up that followed support at its 200-day line (please see a historical daily chart, available at IBD's sister service, Marketsmith.com).However, the market began pulling back just as that run-up peaked on Sept. 20. The market status shifted to ""under pressure"" Sept. 22 and to ""correction"" the next day.TJX pulled back 6.6% below the 56.66 buy point, stopping just short of the 40-week moving average and the 8% sell trigger (3). It wavered higher in light trade.The stock finally broke free from its 10-week moving average in November, after the market shifted back into ""confirmed uptrend"" status.TJX climbed 64% from its September 2011 breakout and 134% from its initial breakout in February 2010 to its high in 2012.(Editor's Note: This story originally ran in the Jan. 18, 2013, edition of IBD.)

188,TJX,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares are up big in late trade following a beat-and-raise quarter and better-than-expected double-digit same-store sales gains.Estimates: Profit to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on 19% revenue growth to $1.27 billion. Same-store sales to rise 11%.Results: $1.91 EPS on net sales of $1.31 billion. Same-store sales of 14.3%, including retail comps of 10.9%.Outlook: Ulta boosted full-year guidance to 9%-11% in same-store sales growth, up from prior guidance for 8%-10% comps. It sees mid-20s percent range EPS growth vs. prior outlook for low-20s. E-commerce sales growth is now expected to be in the 50% range vs. 40%.Stock: Shares jumped in late trade, up as much 6% and well over the 300 mark after the closing bell. Shares rose 4.5% to 293.04 on the stock market today, retaking their 289.37 buy point earlier, after Wednesday's dive sent shares below their 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty logged same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the ""Amazon effect,"" say experts.The retail sector looks cringe-worthy and investors are looking for bright spots. Those have typically come in the form of off-price chains like TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington Stores (BURL) (the latter of which is popping Thursday on results), and beauty specialists like LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora and Ulta Beauty.Meanwhile, Amazon.com (AMZN)-related worries and poor same-store sales growth at department stores are wreaking their usual havoc on the sector this quarter.RELATED:Why Ulta Beauty Shares Fell Out Of Buy Range Ahead Of EarningsAnother Wild Ride From Ulta Beauty After Earnings?

189,TJX,"TJX (TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, disappointed investors with a first-quarter revenue and profit guidance miss early Tuesday, but shares started creeping back up during the call as management announced plans to introduce a new home-decor concept, Homesense, to American shoppers and expressed bullishness in the face of broader retail combustion.""Home is a driver for TJX,"" said CEO Ernie Herrman in response to an analyst query, adding that the company's home businesses have been ""a little stronger than apparel."" He also alluded to home goods being less susceptible to the impact of poor weather, which weighed on comparable sales during the quarter.""We think nobody can replicate the fashion and the quality level we have at our home businesses,"" he said on the call. ""We think strategically this is not a short-term vision.""Herrman was fairly mum about the details, but said that there would be an ""extremely visible difference"" between Homesense and its American sister, HomeGoods, that would propel customers to shop at both stores.While Homesense shares the same name as TJX's home-goods stores in Canada and Europe, spokespeople told Investor's Business Daily that the U.S. Homesense would be different.In Canada, the self-described ""home fashions off-price"" store can be found as stand-alone locations or as superstores, in which a HomeSense is teamed up with a Winners or Marshalls store, according to the HomeSense site. There are currently 106 stores across 10 Canadian provinces.The U.S. concept is slated to debut toward the end of the summer, said Herrman.While TJX's Marshalls and T.J. Maxx locations in the U.S. logged flat comparable sales, HomeGoods comps grew 3% during the April-ended quarter, better than FactSet views for 2.4% growth.Aware of the broader troubles of the retail sector, management brushed off the threat of e-commerce and Amazon (AMZN). People are still shopping for clothes at TJX-owned stores, was the message.Herrman said Q2 is ""off to a solid start,"" with inventory in a good position, and later added that the company is ""still gaining apparel market share in the U.S.""Shares of TJX tumbled 4.1% to 73.76 on the stock market today after falling to a six-month low of 73.17 earlier. On May 10, TJX tried to break out of a consolidation resistance area. But shares have sold off since then in the wake of grim news from other retailers. Off-price rival Ross Stores (ROST), which reports earnings on Thursday, was down 1.4%.In Q1, TJX's profit rose 8% to 82 cents on 3% revenue growth to $7.78 billion, vs. consensus for 79 cents a share and $7.88 billion in sales. Same-store sales rose 1%, below some estimates.Management sees Q2 EPS of 81-83 cents vs. 84 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected 92 cents. TJX sees full-year profit of $3.71-$3.78, up 5%-7%, also below views. The company said currency effects and wage increases weighed on its guidance.Off-pricers like TJX and Ross enjoyed a reputation for being untouchable by Amazon, thanks to the in-store treasure-hunt nature of bargain-rack shopping. But Tuesday's weak sales and guidance raised concerns that status may be under threat as the rest of retail suffers a face-melting sell-off.Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS) plunged last week amid grim results and a growing fear that department stores don't know how to stop the bleeding. Macy's and Dillard's have hit their lowest levels in more than five years, while J.C. Penney is at record lows.And Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO has resorted to blasting vendors in a blog post, in a bid to un-smear the long-ailing retailer's name in the press. That's sent Sears shares tumbling 12.3% on Monday.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will WorkHere's One More Thing Amazon May Be KillingWhat To Expect From Target, Wal-Mart In The Wake Of Mall Meltdown
"
190,TJX,"To the ever-expanding list of Things Uber Is Disrupting, add malls and their parking lots.At Macy's (M) investor day on Tuesday, Doug Sesler, executive vice president for real estate, suggested that the increased use of Uber had led to a decrease in the need for the vast stretches of land reserved for mall-customer parking.""We're all talking about driverless cars, we're talking about the increased use of Uber,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is we don't need the massive parking lots that we needed in the 1970s.""Macy's has been bruised by retail's woes in the era of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a reinvigorated Wal-Mart (WMT). It's thrown a variety of ideas at the wall to make use of its stripped-out floor space and 130-plus million square feet of real estate, and half-filled parking lots could offer a new option.Sesler said that when Macy's owns store space, they also typically own parking space with it. He said those swaths of pavement can be used for other retail space – a Starbucks (SBUX) at the corner of a parking lot, he suggested – or residential, office or hotel space.The company has formed an alliance with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), a real estate company, to look at different ways to use its stretches of real estate.Macy's has also considered bolting restaurants onto the outside of its big-box locations to generate traffic and add atmosphere and rental income. The company has put office space above its stores in Seattle and is marketing the upper portion of its State Street flagship store in Chicago, where it hopes to make similar conversions to office space.The company is overhauling its large Union Square location in San Francisco to create 10,000 square feet for small shops across the front – space the company has just started to market for rent, Sesler said. In New York, the company said it is looking at ways to jumpstart shopper traffic in its Herald Square flagship – possibly with an indoor-and-outdoor rooftop area featuring restaurants and after-work hangouts.IBD'S TAKE: As Amazon and off-price retailers wear down department stores, retailers like Ulta Beauty have gotten by relatively unscathed. Here are five takeaways from Ulta's most recent quarterly earnings. What's more, Sesler said, Macy's department stores are in 72% of the nation's high-end 'A' malls — those most likely to weather the ongoing storm of store bankruptcies and closures.Still, nothing at the 2-1/2 hour presentation could distract Wall Street from the company's gross-margin forecast.Shares finished 8% lower on Tuesday after CFO Karen Hoguet during the presentation warned that gross margins for the year were on track to be 60 to 80 basis points lower than last year. Among the factors she cited were excess inventory following the holidays and heavy promotions in the beauty business. She said she expected inventory levels to even out by the fall season.Macy's fell 0.4% to 21.81 on the stock market Wednesday, sinking intraday to their lowest level since September 2010.Macy's initially rebounded Thursday morning after Nordstrom (JWN) announced that it is mulling a ""going private"" move, but Macy's closed down 0.2%. Nordstrom shares skyrocketed 10.3%, though that was well off their intraday highs.J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS), which tumbled Tuesday on Macy's warning, reversed lower Thursday to end down 4.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Sears (SHLD) closed off 1.7%.Still, management on Tuesday said that beauty and home products were doing well within its off-price ""Backstage"" concept. Within apparel, where Amazon has become a big threat, Macy's is trying to rid its inventory of duplicate items and bring more exclusive items and faster fashion to store racks.CEO Jeff Gennette also emphasized the changes in the way people shop – the way physical stores and websites can play off one another when a consumer weighs what they want to buy – and Macy's opportunities in that evolution.""There's a place for both Amazon and Macy's to succeed with our customer,"" he said.Management said that it was ""open to all options"" in developing its e-commerce, and said that Wal-Mart's approach to its online business – including buying outlets like Jet.com – was ""quite interesting.""Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, in a research note Wednesday, said Macy's had done a ""good job articulating its challenges"" and that if its turnaround succeeded, ""America's love for shopping will be reengaged."" But he said an epic battle with Amazon would continue.""We think customers are 'familiar' with Macy's but don't really 'love' it,"" he wrote.Wal-Mart edged higher Thursday after rising slightly Wednesday following a retreat Tuesday. Amazon on Tuesday offered discounted Prime subscriptions to people on government aid, going after key Wal-Mart customers.RELATED:This Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail MeltdownSears Stock Tanks As CEO Accuses Suppliers Of Exploiting It

192,TJX,"X Target's (TGT) logo may be the bull's-eye, but it's Wal-Mart (WMT) that has painted a target on Amazon's (AMZN) back.The big-box retailer's first quarter came with a hefty 63% power-up in U.S. online sales. Management downplayed how much of that benefit came from the acquisitions of Moosejaw and ModCloth during the quarter, saying most of that was organic growth at Walmart.com.""The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on the earnings call. ""The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up.""CFO Brett Biggs later added that plans were in the works to ramp up online-segment growth and drive in-store traffic. Gross merchandise volume rose about 69%, including acquisitions, he said, calling it ""extraordinary growth.""Globally, Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth had already accelerated to 29% in Q4 from 20.6% in Q3, 11.8% in Q2 and 7% in Q1 a year ago.As rival Target is in the midst of revving up its own digital engine, Wal-Mart has moved aggressively, acquiring Jet.com last year as well as Shoebuy this year, in addition to Moosejaw and ModCloth. It is also reportedly in talks to acquire menswear label Bonobos.""The positive impact of Jet.com on the online business is significant, with our view that the level of acceleration will continue to widen the gap between Wal-Mart and its brick-and-mortar competitors,"" said Moody's Lead Analyst Charlie O'Shea via email.And Cowen's Oliver Chen sees Wal-Mart, which now offers two-day shipping for $35 purchases and discounts for picking up online items in store, gnashing its teeth to gain turf online.""Competitive weapons vs. Amazon should include training and development of 225,000 associates and 100 training academies, 90% of the United States is within 10 miles of a store, and online grocery is available at 670 locations,"" he wrote. Chen has an outperform rating and 83 price target on the stock.Shares of Wal-Mart rallied 3.2% to a two-year high of 77.54 on the stock market today. But would-be buyers might want to wait, wrote Buckingham Group's John Zolidis, who advocated waiting for a more attractive entry as Wal-Mart shares are already above historical valuation levels.Shares of Target rose 1.4%, and Amazon added 1.45%.In Q1, Wal-Mart's profit edged up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street forecasts for a 2% dip, but revenue notched up 1.4% to $117.54 billion, just missing views for $117.74 billion. U.S. same-store sales rose 1.4%, better than consensus views for a 1.3% gain, as traffic grew 1.5%.For the current quarter, Wal-Mart sees EPS of $1 to $1.08, though the midpoint is below consensus views for $1.07, with U.S. Wal-Mart same-store sales up 1.5% to 2%.On Wednesday, Target's report provided a bit of a bright spot in a retail landscape that turned especially bleak last week when department stores reported grim results or guidance.

193,TJX,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Chief Executive Mary Dillon made clear Tuesday that while prestige brands are enjoying a period of growth, the specialty beauty retailer has no intention of straying from the high- and low-end assortment of cosmetics, skin care and hair care products that has made it so popular.When asked at Oppenheimer's 16th Annual Global Consumer Conference about potentially adding more prestige brands to stores, Dillon replied, ""One might ask, 'Why would we do that?' """"We really believe the magic of our proposition is we're not going to be shifting and becoming so predominantly prestige,"" she said, emphasizing the strength of Ulta's curated mix of prestige and mass brands.While not explicitly naming Sephora, Dillon said that Ulta might add slightly more prestige products, but it is ""important to know that we won't ever dramatically continue to shift"" Ulta's product mix toward a more heavily high-end assortment. LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora, Ulta's main competitor in the specialty beauty space, does not carry mass brands like Revlon or L'Oreal.The company also touched on its real estate strategy, with Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten telling investors that a ""theoretical perfect co-tenant mix"" largely includes off-pricers like TJX's (TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx and shoe seller DSW (DSW).""We love to be near Target (TGT) stores, historically, but we've seen our stores in all types of different environments,"" he said.The sluggishness of the broader retail space hasn't extended its tendrils to buyers of cosmetics and beauty products, and Ulta's e-commerce numbers are hopping. First-quarter e-commerce sales alone grew 38.8%, and overall same-store sales rose 15.2%, year over year.""(E-commerce) is clearly very fast-growing for us, (a) small percentage of our business today,"" said Dillon. ""We obviously expect that to grow a lot -- it will probably be double what it is today over the next few years.

It now expects a mid- to low-single-digit decline in same-store sales at outlets open more than a year, a drastic reduction from prior expectations for positive low-single-digit comparables.For the second quarter, the company guided for a mid-single-digit same-store sales decline.Shares closed down 8.4% at 14.68 in the stock market today after trading as low as 13.25. Teen retailer Abercrombie (ANF) rose 1% while American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) slid 1.3%.During the quarter, Express' earnings grew 14% to 25 cents a share, missing estimates by 2 cents, on revenue that was more or less flat from the prior year at $502.9 million. Analysts had expected $521.1 million.Same-store sales slid 3%. Online sales edged down 1%.Express is far from alone in dissatisfying investors.

That was ahead of analyst views for 70 cents earnings per share and $1.3 billion in sales.Same-store sales at outlets open more than a year during the quarter rose 3%. The value-store chain sells food, furniture, household items and electronics.For the second quarter, Big Lots expects 42-47 cents earnings per share and flattish to 2% gains in same-store sales.For the year, the company guided per-share profit to $3.35-$3.50, up from an earlier outlook for $3.20-$3.35, and affirmed guidance for low-single-digit same-store sales in fiscal 2016.Shares shot up 14.1% to 50.95 in the stock market today, blasting out to a 14-month high and nearly setting an all-time bestBig Lots' well-received results come on the heels of Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) eye-popping quarterly earnings, proving that it's not entirely a retail wasteland out there. Off-price retailer TJX (TJX) has proven to be another star in an otherwise bleak segment.

196,TJX,"X Even TJX (TJX), one of the rare shining gems of the retail sector, is getting munched Tuesday after falling short of revenue, same-store sales and guidance estimates.Investors likely hoped the off-price heavyweight — parent to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods — and home-improvement chain Home Depot (HD) would offer bright spots for the retail-weary who had had enough of the dismal results coming out of Macy's (M) and its department store brethren last week.Off-price and home improvement, after all, are often highlighted as retail segments that show some resistance to Amazon's (AMZN) viral spread.Home Depot shares rose to a record high intraday after earnings and sales topped views.But, TJX shares, down 4% to 73.81 in the stock market today, are getting shoved around in the same manner as retail peers Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Staples (SPLS).Athletic apparel and equipment retailer Dick's plunged 13.7% to 41.03, hitting its lowest level since June 2016. First-quarter earnings met expectations at 54 cents a share, up 8%, but revenue missed forecasts by a hair (sales rose 10% to $1.83 billion), and same-store sales growth of 2.4% disappointed.Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser remains an advocate for the retail chain, which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular athletic brands.He says Dick's ""has an issue with the 1Q17 calendar, not with Amazon,"" citing calendar shifts, and posits that full-year guidance is ""reasonable, as the noise subsides.""What ails the retail sector is multifold: an overabundance of brick-and-mortar stores, a sluggish apparel space, the continual shift to online shopping and, of course, Amazon.Office-supply giant Staples reported a same-store sales decline of 3% in Q1, as per-share profit met views for 17 cents and revenue sank a more-than-anticipated 19% to $4.15 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.5 billion.Office supplies is another area that Amazon has encroached upon in its rise to the top.Staples shares fell 3.5% to 8.99, tumbling back below their 50-day moving average but closing just above their 200-day line after sinking to 8.81 intraday.Urban Outfitters (URBN) reported weaker-than-expected earnings, revenue and comps after the market close. Earnings per share tumbled to 13 cents a share while revenue was $761 million. Analysts had projected a 36% profit decline to 16 cents a share on less than 1% revenue growth to $768.1 million.Urban Outfitters' same-store sales fell 3.1% more than expected.Shares of the young-adult apparel chain fell initially in late trading, but then reversed higher for a 1% gain. Urban Outfitters shares fell 2.3% to 20.46, hitting a 16-month low intraday.The stock has hardly glimpsed light above their 50-day moving average this calendar year, as teen and youth stores struggle to attract an audience. Aeropostale and Wet Seal have filed for bankruptcy, and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) once the hit of the early aughts, confirmed last week that it is in early-stage talks to be bought out.

197,TJX,"Target (TGT) reported much-better-than-expected earnings and sales early Wednesday and gave upbeat guidance, a rare positive report from the retail sector ahead of Wal-Mart's (WMT) quarterly numbers Thursday.Estimates: Profit to drop 29.5% to 91 cents a share as revenue slips 3.6% to $15.62 billion.Results: Earnings fell 6% to $1.21 a share with revenue down about 1% to $16.017 billion. Same-store sales slid 1.3%, but that was far less than the 3.7% drop expected.Outlook: Q2 EPS of 95 cents-$1.15, with the midpoint above views for $1.00, on a same-store sales decline in the low single digits. Target did not formally revise its full-year guidance, but noted that the strong Q1 performance suggests that the retailer will top the midpoint of its prior targets.""After starting the quarter with very soft trends, we saw improvement later in the quarter, particularly in March,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. ""We are in the early stage of a multiyear effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity.""Stock: Shares rose 3.3% to 56.33 soon after the opening bell in the stock market today. The stock is not in a great place, with a Relative Strength rating of 8 (a sign of underperformance vs. the S&P 500) and a 50-day moving average that undercut the 200-day back in February. Since December, shares have only come up for air above their 50-day line for about two weeks, total. Wal-Mart shares rose 0.9%.As retail stocks suffer one devastating blow after another (even off-price chain TJX (TJX) got munched on earnings results), Target's shares have resembled those of department stores, which had a disastrous week last week, rather than big-box counterpart Wal-Mart.Target's online strategy is notably behind that of Wal-Mart, which is broadly credited as being in better shape to fight off Amazon's (AMZN) march down the retail war path.Wal-Mart has already bought Jet.com, and so far in 2017 alone, it has announced deals to buy e-commerce properties ModCloth, Shoebuy and Moosejaw.

198,TJX,"X The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 ended mostly flat Tuesday, but the Nasdaq composite added 0.3% as Wall Street liked the look of more earnings reports out of China but dissed a couple of reports in the retail sector.Sina (SINA) gapped out of a lengthy consolidation, rising 18%, on strong earnings. The stock's open price of 88.89 was a legitimate entry, but Sina is now extended in price. Sina still has a considerable stake in Weibo (WB), which also reported earnings. Shares of the China-based microblogging site soared 25%, also on strong earnings. It's also extended.Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today.IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) buoyed the Dow with gains of more than 1%. Nasdaq 100 winners included NetEase (NTES), Baidu (BIDU) and Yahoo (YHOO).In the airline group, American Airlines (AAL) reversed higher, ending the session just below a 47.49 cup-with-handle buy point. Warren Buffett increased his exposure to American and Southwest (LUV) in the first quarter. Shares of Southwest added 0.4% to 58.27. It's also working on a cup-with-handle base with a 58.83 buy point.A couple of retail reports showed that weakness has started to spread beyond the department store operators. TJX (TJX) slumped nearly 4% on a sales miss and weak guidance, while Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) plunged 14% on weaker-than-expected same-store sales growth. After falling 6% last week, shares are down 14% more so far this week.Home Depot (HD) was a bright spot in retail as shares added 0.6% to 158.26, although they erased much of the early gains. U.S. same-store sales growth rose 6% in the quarter, well above the consensus estimate of 4.3%. Home Depot is another example of a stock that's extended in price. It's been on a nice run after a breakout over a 137.42 buy point in January. It found support at its 10-week moving average in April near 147.Several China-based names in the IBD 50 soared.

199,TJX,"The major indexes showed flattish action Tuesday as sellers pounded discount retail names (think the likes of TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST)) and buyers lifted the top names in the Chinese internet, e-commerce and social media space (think Sina (SINA), Momo (MOMO), Weibo (WB), JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA)).At 1:30pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average rose minimally while the Nasdaq composite added 0.2% and notched a new all-time high of 6163.The S&P 500 was virtually flat. However, both the Dow industrials and the 500 continue to ride on the north side of their 50-day lines, a good sign.On April 24, as seen in the Market Pulse table embedded within IBD's daily Big Picture column, the current outlook for equities got an upgrade from ""Uptrend under pressure"" to ""Uptrend resumes."" The uptrend was confirmed all the way back on June 30 of last year.Among industry groups, many of the worst performers in IBD's 197 group rankings came from the retail sector, including leisure goods, jewelry, apparel and shoes, and discount and variety.Volume is running slightly higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Monday. Breadth is negative on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq, with declining stocks outweighing rising ones by a roughly 7-to-5 ratio.In the Chinese web space, Sina staged an impressive breakaway gap, rushing past an 85.34 buy point in an eight-month base, following sterling Q1 results (earnings of 50 cents a share vs. a 4-cent loss in the year-ago quarter, revenue up 49%). Shares jumped more than 18% to 99.61 in a whale of volume. The average turnover is 781,000 shares; at 12 p.m. New York time, more than 6 million shares had already exchanged hands.One could have also bought Sina ahead of the Q1 results when the stock popped up above an 80 early buy point, 10 cents above the Feb. 23 intraday high. From that day, Sina created a nice 10-week flat base with a 14.5% drop from head to toe.For now, Sina is extended well past the traditional buy point as well as the opening price near 89. One could see if it stages a light pullback in modest volume over the next few weeks and see if it gives investors a second chance to buy near Tuesday's opening price. Otherwise, wait for a new base to form, or a first and second test of the 10-week moving average. Check out a long weekly chart of Sina, and you'll see that the latest long base is likely a second-stage one after years of bottoming out in price, from 147 in 2011 to a low of 31.92 in early 2015. That's the classic sign of a bottoming base. A MarketSmith chart allows you to easily look at historical time frames.Alibaba, up nearly 2% to 123.69 and a new high, will report Q1 results after the close Thursday. Expect earnings to rise 40% to 66 cents a share, which would mark an acceleration from increases of 24%, 39% and 30% in the prior three quarters. Alibaba's Q1 growth could be getting some help from an easy year-over-year comp; in Q1 2016, profits actually declined 4% to 47 cents a share.Meanwhile, financial software firms are quietly making nice moves. Most of these are in the small-to-midcap range.The stock initially cleared a cup with handle at 104.67 in February. The initial breakout was slow, but Alibaba did not trigger any defense-type sell signals. The stock's breakout gain has now exceeded 17%. Alibaba has a float of 1.02 billion shares and a market value of $314 billion. SS&C Technologies (SSNC), Pegasystems (PEGA) and Jack Henry (JKHY) also show good relative strength and decent Composite Ratings, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.SS&C, up more than 1% to 37.65 in heavy turnover, has gained more than 10% since clearing a six-month cup-type base with a 34.29 buy point on Feb. 16. In early April, the stock showed a fine test of support at the 50-day moving average, promoting a new entry point near 35.On April 27, the expert in management software for banks and money managers extended its streak of double-digit EPS and revenue growth to eight quarters.Q1 profit jumped 19% to 44 cents a share as revenue climbed 26% to $407.7 million. One would prefer to see EPS growth be stronger than revenue growth. Interestingly, SS&C's revenue has grown faster than the bottom line for seven quarters in a row.Also in the same financial software group, Guidewire Software (GWRE) is producing a new base and is edging past a 62.78 handle buy point on a long, saucerlike base. While the 68 Rating is just mediocre, that's typical for stocks that form bases stretching for nine months to a year or more.Back to the retail sector, TJX gapped down more than 3% to 74.11 in volume that is running more than four times usual levels. The operator of TJMaxx, Marshalls and Home Goods deep-discount stores reported an 8% increase in fiscal Q1 earnings to 82 cents a share, better than the 4%-to-5% gains seen in the prior three quarters.But TJX's revenue growth slowed to 3%, down from gains of 8%, 10%, 7%, 7% and 6% in the prior five quarters.TJX is now well below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. The big-cap play had broken out of a somewhat odd-looking double-bottom base at 79.26 in mid-July last year, but gained only 5.5% before turning tail.A true CAN SLIM leader will have the gusto to rally as much as 20% to 25% past a proper buy point in a good base (be it a cup with handle, double bottom, or flat base) before making a significant dive in price.RELATED:How To Sell At The Top: Do You Know How To Spot Market Distribution?This Chinese Social Media Play Has More Than Doubled In 2017; Where Is The Next Buy Point?How To Find Great Stocks: What Are The Elements Of A Super Cup Base?How To Use Charts I: What Is The Bottoming Base Pattern?How To Use Charts II: Why Do Flat Bases Work For Some Great Winners?How Are Retail Groups Faring?

200,TJX,"X Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Tuesday. Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX), two Amazon.com (AMZN)-resistant retail giants, are on tap with earnings Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, Cisco Systems (CSCO) is nearing a buy point ahead of its quarterly results as analysts and investors see it as a cybersecurity play amid the WannaCry global ransomware attack.Futures for the Dow industrials rose about 0.1% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were fractionally above fair value. S&P 500 futures edged lower.On Monday, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index both rose 0.5% to record highs, with cybersecurity and energy stocks leading the way. The Dow industrials gained 0.4%.In Asia trading Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.25%, hitting a 17-month high. China's Shanghai composite advanced 0.75%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.1%. In European trade intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE rose 0.6%, hitting an all-time high. Germany's Dax lost 0.1% while France's Cac-40 sank 0.3%Home Depot, a Dow component, reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday morning, sending shares toward a record high. Home Depot has been rallying more or less for the past three months, trading at record highs, with no potential buy point in sight for now.Improving housing and job markets are fueling demand for the home improvement giant. Building supplies is an area where Amazon has not made huge inroads for now.TJX, an off-price apparel and home goods retailer, also is set to report before the opening bell early Tuesday. TJX and other off-price chains were seen as relatively safe from Amazon because they offer branded goods at deep discounts with a treasure hunt aspect.TJX stock broke out past resistance in a consolidation on May 10. But shares have sold off sharply since then in the wake of brutal reports from Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and J.C. Penney (JCP), followed by Sears Holdings' (SHLD) public feud with a key supplier.Cisco Systems, another Dow stock, doesn't report until Wednesday night. But shares rallied 2.3% to 34.23 on Monday in heavy volume, just below a 34.63 buy point. Morgan Stanley upgraded the networking giant on Monday, citing its faster-growing software and security businesses. Computer security stocks have soared in the wake of the global cyberattack.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is uprooting more and more businesses, from its bookstore origins to cloud computing. Here's one more thing Amazon may be killing with its remorseless expansion.Cisco's security business is just 6% of its total revenue, but that's enough to make it a significant rival to some pure-play companies. Still, Cisco revenue has been declining as the lumbering giant transitions.Meanwhile, Ford (F) plans to cut 10% of its global workforce, which is about 200,000 people, the Wall Street Journal reported late Monday, citing sources.Meanwhile, Chinese internets Weibo (WB) and majority owner Sina (SINA) both topped first-quarter estimates early Tuesday. Weibo, a short-messaging social media operator, has already broken out to a new high, while Sina is near a buy point. Stratasys (SSYS) also is on tap as 3D printer stocks have skyrocketed since 3D Systems (DDD) reported recently.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why Are Growth Stocks Outperforming?Cisco Near Buy Point As Analyst Touts New Efforts Before EarningsAmazon: Dot-Com Survivor Turned River Monster Has Fueled 64,000% GainStratasys Earnings Up Next As 3D Printer Stocks Take Flight

201,TJX,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday. The operator of Sears and Kmart stores' results were not as bad as analysts had expected. But the adjusted per-share loss was wider than a year earlier while sales fell rapidly, as the venerable retailer fights to survive in the face of Amazon (AMZN) and fierce competition among brick-and-mortar chains.Estimates: A per-share loss of $3.05, widening from a year-ago loss of $1.86 per share. Revenue was seen diving 25% to $4.054 billion. (Net income, before excluding a slew items, was a $244 million, the first positive reading in two years and above Sears' forecast, swinging from a loss of $471 million a year earlier.)Results: Adjusted per-share loss of $2.15. Revenue sank 20% to $4.30 billion. Same-store sales tumbled 11.9%.Stock: Shares jumped 13.5% to 8.48 on the stock market today, after hitting 9.90 intraday. J.C. Penney (JCP) rallied 0.2% and Kohl's (KSS) 2.5%.Sears' stock-market downward spiral deepened last week after CEO Eddie Lampert began calling out some of the struggling retailer's vendors in public, accusing one supplier of trying to ""embarrass us in the media to force us to let them out of their contract."" In March, the company said ""substantial doubt"" hung over its ability to keep operating.Lampert's dispute with the supplier, One World, which provided tools for Sears' Craftsman brand, followed more depressing results from Macy's (M) earlier this month, leading to a wide retail sell-off. J.C. Penney's dismal results dragged shares to an all-time low. IBD'S TAKE: The dire financials out of the retail sector has led to speculation over whether it has any hope left at all. Analysts aren't ready to call retail dead, but they do believe the industry has too many stores. The narrative for mid-tier retailers like Sears is that they've suffered over the years due to a retreat from shoppers to e-commerce sites like Amazon and discounters like TJX (TJX).But even TJX's results this month missed expectations, although its push into home goods and optimism against a bleak industry backdrop appeared to assuage investors.Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) on Wednesday sank on weak earnings, guidance and April housing data. However, Home Depot (HD) fared better. The stronger housing market during the quarter had meant more business from DIY homeowners and contractors.RELATED:Abercrombie Spikes On Buzz Of American Eagle, Cerberus BidHere's One More Thing Amazon May Be Killing

""Compared to our expectations going into the quarter, our revenue was higher due to strong performance in gaming, a better-than-expected result in mobile, and the improvement of overall sales trends due to the arrival of delayed federal tax refund checks.""For the second quarter, Best Buy expects adjusted earnings per share of 57 to 62 cents, or about 60 cents at the midpoint. Analysts were modeling for 59 cents EPS.Best Buy forecast Q2 revenue of $8.65 billion, up 1.4%, based on the midpoint of its guidance.

203,TJX,"Foot Locker (FL) blamed delayed income tax returns for sluggish sales early in Q1 that weren't made up later in the quarter and reported results that missed forecasts.Estimates: EPS virtually unchanged at $1.38, with revenue edging up 1.4% to $2.015 billion.Results: EPS of $1.36 on revenue of $2.00 billion. Same-store sales rose 0.5%, below consensus views.""The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April,"" said CEO Richard Johnson said in a statement.Stock: Shares sank 16.7% to 58.72 in the stock market today, hitting a nine-month low. After building a cup-with-handle base through April, the stock failed to clear a 77.80 entry point, ultimately wilting past its 50-day moving average this week.On Thursday, Hibbett Sports (HIBB) topped earnings forecasts though same-store sales sank 4.9%. On Tuesday, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) plunged after missing sales estimates.Aside from a few choice retailers — namely, Wal-Mart (WMT) — the entire sector has been getting battered in recent weeks on weak earnings results. Even those that topped views, such as Target (TGT), still recorded year-over-year declines.Foot Locker results also provide a glimpse into how Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA) are performing at the retail level.Nike shares reversed an earlier sell-off to rise 0.2%, while Under Armour bounced back to gain 1.1%.

Shares finished 0.7% lower at 61.07, and rival TJX (TJX) ticked down 0.4% to 74.48.Retailers like the Gap have suffered as consumers opt to make purchases online and at discount retailers like Ross and TJX, whose Q1 sales and profit forecasts reported this week nonetheless weren't up to Street expectations.Macy's stock crashed last week on disappointing results, and Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO said some of its suppliers are trying to exploit the doom-hype surrounding the company to work out better deals for themselves. There are still some bright spots in retail, with Wal-Mart, L Brands (LB) and Children's Place (PLCE) rallying on strong results.For the discounters, physical space has maintained its appeal in part due to what the industry calls the in-store ""treasure hunt"" — that is, when customers walk in looking for a bargain and find a deal they didn't expect.And TJX on Tuesday said it is looking to home goods, which CEO Ernie Herrman said are less vulnerable to weather fluctuations. Home goods have been ""a driver"" for the company, he said, as they have for other retailers.Off-price chain Burlington Stores (BURL), for instance, has reduced its dependency on coats for its sales in part by sprucing up its home and beauty product lines.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongWal-Mart Targets Amazon, Pulls Away From Rivals Online; Stock At 2-Year HighTarget's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

205,TJX,"X President Trump's political woes sent the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite tumbling, but not for long. But Alibaba (BABA) and other China internet stocks rallied on generally upbeat reports. Dow retailers Wal-Mart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) had strong results, but many other retailers are struggling. Dow tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) sold off on its weak guidance.An ongoing stream of damaging media reports took their toll on President Trump, raising concerns that he'll be too distracted or too weak to push tax cuts through this year, if at all. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.6%. But stocks slashed losses on Thursday and Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 off 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.6%. Credit Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and the other FANG+ stocks, along with Alibaba (BABA) and other Chinese internets.Alibaba's Q1 EPS rose 37% to 63 cents, but missed the consensus by 3 cents as tax expenses and spending on its entertainment and cloud computing businesses ramped up. Revenue jumped 60% to $5.61 billion, beating views. The Chinese e-commerce giant also OK'd a $6 billion buyback. Shares rose 0.5% Thursday after falling 5% early, then rose to a record high on Friday. On Wednesday, archrival Tencent (TCEHY) reported EPS surged 57% in local currency to 22 cents, beating by a penny, as revenue popped 55% $7.18 billion. Tencent stock hit new highs.On Tuesday, internet portal Sina (SINA) and its majority-owned social messaging site Weibo (WB) reported stronger than expected earnings. Weibo reported daily active users of 154 million, up 28% vs the year earlier. Weibo shares soared 25%, Sina 22%.Specialty online retailer Vipshop (VIPS) reported in-line earnings, better-than-expected revenue and solid guidance, but shares tumbled 10.3%.Baozun (BZUN), an Alibaba-backed provider of e-commerce services for brand partners, reported EPS that just met views. Shares dived 12% on Wednesday, but were up 8.6% for the week.Target (TGT) earnings fell 6% while sales dipped 1% to $16.02 billion, but those were not as bad as feared. Comps skidded 1.3% but better than the expected 3.7% tumble. Shares rose Wednesday but finished the week up just 0.4%, still close to five-year lows. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Q1 profit unexpectedly ticked up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street estimates for a 2% dip, though 1.4% sales growth to $117.54 billion just missed. Still, U.S. same-store sales rose, unlike Target and many other retailers. The megastore credited organic growth at Walmart.com for its 63% boost in U.S. online sales, although it also acquired two e-commerce properties, Moosejaw and ModCloth, during the quarter. Wal-Mart shares rose 4.1% to a two-year best.Cisco Systems (CSCO) adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 5% to 60 cents, beating views by 2 cents. Revenue fell 1% to $11.94 billion, above estimates but the sixth straight year-over-year decline as the networking giant transitions from sluggish switch and router hardware to software and security. Current-quarter revenue guidance was far short of forecasts, in part because of concerns that President Trump's economic and tax agenda has stalled.Cisco shares fell 6.7% for the week.Home Depot (HD) reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates, making it one of the few retailers that isn't cracking under the weight of e-commerce, discounts, discounters, too many stores and not enough traffic. The home-improvement chain hiked its full-year EPS forecast, which was still below expectations. Home Depot shares hit a record high Tuesday but dipped 0.4% for the week. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports next week, lost 0.3%, but in buy range.The semiconductor equipment manufacturer's second-quarter profit rose 132% while sales climbed 45% to $3.55 billion, both better than expected. It was the third straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth for Applied Materials (AMAT). For the current quarter, Applied gave EPS and sales targets above the consensus. Applied Materials jumped early Friday, but closed up just 0.4%.RELATED:Applied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% AgainSalesforce.com said fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up 17% vs. a year earlier, with revenue rising 25% to $2.39 billion.

Salesforce shares rose early Friday but reversed for a 0.4% decline.RELATED:Salesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year OutlookT.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods parent TJX (TJX) turned in mixed results, missing on revenue, as same-store sales grew 1%. Guidance was soft. The off-price chain said it is introducing a home-fashions concept to the U.S. this year. Ross Stores (ROST) pulled ahead of estimates with 82 cents in per-share profit and $3.3 billion in sales. Comps grew 3%. But Q2 profit guidance missed, and full-year EPS outlook was a little light. Off-price retailers have typically been gems, but both TJX and Ross are trading below their 50-day moving averages amid a greater retail shudder. TJX shares fell 3.9% for the week. Ross rose Friday, paring its week loss to 2%.Computer-aided design software firm Autodesk (ADSK) saw its stock surge 14.7% to record levels Friday after it beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30. Autodesk lost 16 cents a share excluding items on revenue of $486 million, when analysts were looking for it to lose 24 cents a share ex items on sales of $470.4 million. The San Rafael, Calif.-based company is taking a revenue hit as it continues its business model transition from licensed software to cloud computing services. Another design software firm, Synopsys (SNPS), also posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings. It earned 88 cents a share excluding items, up 9%, on sales of $680 million, up 12%. Wall Street was expecting 86 cents and $672 million. But shares fell nearly 4.65% for the week.Jack in the Box (JACK) earnings beat Q1 forecasts, and the burger chain said it was looking at ""potential alternatives"" with regards to Qdoba, its fast-casual Mexican chain. CEO Lenny Comma said that over the past year it ""has become apparent"" that the company's valuation ""is being impacted by having two different business models."" Shares nearly hit a record high intraday Wednesday, but pared gains for a 3.75% weekly rsise.As Jack in the Box expands delivery services, so has McDonald's (MCD). The Golden Arches announced the expansion of its delivery service to Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio.Sears Holdings (SHLD) CEO Eddie Lampert said on the corporate blog that speculations on the ailing retailer's potential demise had hurt business. Lampert also said that tool supplier One World, seeking to get out of its contract with Sears, had threatened to sue the retailer and had sought to embarrass them. The CEO said Sears ""has paid and continues to make all payments to One World"" and that it would defend itself against any legal action. Sears shares sank 17.4%.The pharmacy and wireless markets could be the next Amazon (AMZN) next targets. An unconfirmed report that the online giant is seeking to break into the drug-dispensing business weighed on Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) midweek. But it may not be smooth sailing for the online giant in this competitive space, Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes wrote that the established players have access to discounted drugs that Amazon is unlikely to beat and already offer drug delivery by mail. Plus, the regulatory and infrastructure hurdles to building out a pharmacy business are high. Amazon is also said to be in talks with Dish Network (DISH) over a wireless partnership. Word of a deal is awaited.The race toward an autonomous driving future continues to heat up. On Tuesday, BMW Group, Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) announced a partnership with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to bring self-driving kits to multiple automakers.

American Eagle (AEO) had mixed results with EPS of 16 cents missing analyst views by a penny while sales rose 1.7% to $761.8 million, above views. But the teen retailer sees Q2 EPS of only 15 to 17 cents, below views for 23 cents, and continuing gross margin pressures. Both stocks hit multiyear lows.Dick's Sporting Goods' (DKS) first-quarter earnings rose 8% to meet expectations of 54 cents per share but sales rose 10% to $1.83 billion, short of views. Same-store sales only grew 2.4%. Dick's shares tumbled. Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB) topped EPS views, though same-store sales fell. Foot Locker missed on earnings, sales and same-store sales early Friday, sending its shares sharply lower.Stratasys (SSYS) reported first-quarter earnings that met forecasts, as shares of the 3D printer maker proceeded to go on a roller-coaster ride on a wobbly outlook, down 6.6% for the week.Hotel search platform Trivago (TRVG) posted better-than-expected sales and earnings for the first quarter, The recent IPO's stock shot up to 21.89, a new all-time high, closing the week up 6.6% at 19.01, but near the low of the weekly range.

But while Wal-Mart closed at two-year highs, the other retailers had a less-positive day.Children's Place (PLCE) delivered a beat-and-raise quarter that has shares shot up initially in the stock market today, as profit grew 48% to $1.95 a share and revenue rose 4% to $436.7 million from the prior-year quarter.That easily beat consensus for $1.64 a share on sales of $422.5 million.Same-store sales rose 6.1%, which the children's clothier said was its highest Q1 comparable-sales figure ""in over a decade."" The highly watched metric is a contrast to the negative slide from department stores last week and from Target (TGT) on Wednesday.Children's Place ""continues to execute extremely well in a tough environment,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, ""with strong inventory control, expanding (average unit retail), and margin expansion.""The company upped its full-year outlook to $7.10-$7.20, up from prior guidance for $6.50-$6.65. Analysts are currently looking for $6.66 a share for 2017.Children's Place shares shot up to 124.90 soon after the open, just below Monday's record 125.30, but reversed sharply, closing down 0.45% at 111.10.Ralph Lauren (RL) beat on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings grew 1% to 89 cents a share, beating views for 78 cents; revenue fell 16% to $1.57 billion, but the slide wasn't as bad as expected. Still, Ralph Lauren, apparel retailer and clothier, reversed from early gains to finish off 1.9%.And shares of Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB) did manage to close up 2.6% after disclosing Q1 results late Wednesday that did not disappoint, even as same-store sales dropped 9%. The company nudged up full-year profit guidance to $3.10-$3.40 from $3.05-$3.35.Sporting goods retailer Hibbett (HIBB), which carries Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and other popular brands, beat on profit. Hibbett's same-store sales, however, fell 4.9% in Q1. Shares initially ran up to 24.75, but reversed to trade down 0.65% to 22.90.On the flip side, things are pretty bad for Ascena Retail Group (ASNA). The parent of women's apparel brands Ann Taylor, Loft and dressbarn, among others, is tanking in a major way, down 26.8% to 2.07 after slashing Q3 and full-year guidance. Ascena hit 17-year low of 1.65 intraday.Management now expects 10-15 cents in fiscal 2017 earnings, a fraction of its earlier guidance for 37-42 cents. For Q3, it sees 4-6 cents EPS, down from 7-12 cents in prior outlook.Ascena CEO David Jaffe said ""we ... no longer believe it appropriate to expect a stabilization of traffic and resulting normalization of comp sales against softer demand in the year-ago period."" He expects the specialty retail environment to ""remain challenging"" for the next year or two.As for Wal-Mart, shares rose 3.2% to their best levels in two years as earnings topped and e-commerce sales surged 63%.RELATED:Wal-Mart Signals It's A Real Amazon Rival As Online Sales Spike 63%Target's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchEarnings Distractions Before Next Trump Bombshell: Investing Action PlanThis Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail Meltdown

211,TJX,"XA massive beat on profit, revenue and comparable-store sales estimates would normally elicit delight from the Street, but against the backdrop of a retail existential crisis, Target's (TGT) first-quarter results produced more of a cautious sigh of relief.""Overall we believe the result is better than feared, particularly given worsening trends across the majority of retailers,"" wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, who rates the stock a hold with 58 price target. ""That said, the ongoing and increasingly rapid shift of consumer spending away from traditional retail channels remains a significant watchpoint for all retailers.""For the quarter, Target's per-share profit slid 6% to $1.21 as sales dipped about 1% to $16.017 billion, well above consensus for 91 cents a share on $15.62 billion in revenue. Same-store sales slid 1.3%, but that was far less than the 3.7% drop expected.Target's digital efforts are under scrutiny as Wal-Mart (WMT) goes on an e-commerce M&A spree this year and people take more of their shopping online and away from brick-and-mortar stores. The awful week department stores just experienced has made Amazon's (AMZN) reign even more pronounced.Investors are nonetheless pleased about Target's less-horrible-than-anticipated results. Shares finished 0.9% higher on the stock market today, even as the broader market sold off Wednesday, but pared gains after rising as much as 4.5% earlier. Wal-Mart, which reports Thursday, ended flat to remain below buy range.Buckingham Group analyst John Zolidis said he was ""encouraged"" by Target's results, citing its outlook and ""legitimately improved"" balance sheet, and is bullish on the retailer's strategic plans. He holds a buy rating and 71 price target on the stock.But concerns about the future of retail are likely to dog the big-box chain.""However, the quarter is unlikely to sway the entrenched bearish view of most investors which hold that terrestrial retailers will continue to lose share to the online channel for the foreseeable future,"" wrote Zolidis on Wednesday.In Q2, Target sees earnings of 95 cents to $1.15 a share, the midpoint of which tops current views for $1 a share.""We are in the early stage of a multiyear effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. ""As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity.""Cowen analyst Oliver Chen wrote that he believes Target's results ""bode well"" for Wal-Mart, which reports Thursday morning.

213,TJX,"One characteristic of the current stock market is the number of stocks forming shallow consolidations.This is a good sign because it suggests that sellers aren't able to drive a stock very far south without bringing in buyers.Two stocks posting new highs Tuesday fit that description.Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) cleared a 72.52 buy point in a base-on-base pattern during Tuesday's session, closing at 74.84. The base's depth was less than 10%. Volume was strong.A base-on-base pattern is partly defined by the previous pattern. Notice how the low in the current pattern stopped just above the high of the previous base. This is characteristic of a base on base.Qorvo broke out of the previous base Feb. 1, popping above a 64.90 buy point. The stock gained almost 12% before retreating and starting work on the current consolidation. Because the gain did not reach 20%, the base count remains second stage.Qorvo's quarterly earnings have been lumpy (0%, 6%, 31% and down 18%), but the Street expects earnings in fiscal 2018 ending in March to rise 18%.The midcap company has some concentration in revenue. Although that adds risk, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fiscal 2016, one customer accounted for about 37% of revenue. The customer is widely believed to be Apple (AAPL).The concentration could grow in the second half of this year, according to Qorvo. ""We expect to expand our dollar content at our largest customer later this year,"" said CEO Robert Bruggeworth at the earnings call May 4.SS&C Technologies (SSNC) has been trying to clear and hold above a 37.58 buy point in a 12% deep flat base.

218,TJX,"Amazon (AMZN) is frequently touted as one of the greatest threats to the traditional brick-and-mortar retail industry. But it is off-price stores, not the mega e-commerce giant, that is seen reaping a billion-dollar gain from department store closings this year, as Macy's shutters over 60 locations and JCPenney closes the doors on 138 stores.""Of the roughly $1.6 billion of sales freed up from the J.C. Penney's (JCP) and Macy's (M) store closures, we believe off-price retailers are in a position to capture up to $1 billion dollars of these sales over the next 12 months (based on locations within 30 miles of the named store closings),"" wrote Wedbush analyst Morry Brown in a Monday research note.The biggest off-price winner by same-store sales growth? Burlington Stores (BURL). The chain is positioned to gain the most comp action, since it has the most overlap with department store exits, said Brown. That is followed by T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX (TJX) and then by Ross Stores (ROST).But by dollar amount, TJX will likely come out the major gainer. Wedbush sees the closings presenting a $549 million opportunity for TJX, and a $207 million and $196 million opportunity for Ross Stores and Burlington, respectively.Consumers could easily take their shopping online if the nearest Macy's or JCPenney shutters. But there's a strong likelihood that they'll take their business to the nearest off-pricer — and Wedbush says its projections might be on the low end, even taking Amazon and online retailers into account.""While a scenario in which off-price siphons off roughly 50% of abandoned sales from the JCP/M door closings would appear to be a fair scenario, we note historical precedent suggests this analysis could prove conservative, even accounting for online market share gains,"" wrote Brown. ""Since 2007, department store sales losses and off-price sales gains have closely tracked each other, with off-price revenues more than overtaking department store share losses.""IBD'S TAKE: The rapidly changing retail landscape can be tough to track. For the latest in the space, bookmark IBD's retail and e-commerce sector news hub. What becomes of the full-price landscape down the road?""Presumably, much of the full price business eventually moves online, through some combination of: (1) Amazon, (2) smaller niche e-commerce retailers or (3) vendor's owned websites,"" said Brown.TJX, Ross Stores and Burlington Stores edged up 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, on the stock market today.

342,TJX,"After a solid holiday shopping season in which retailers benefited from lower gas prices and a recovering economy, January brought more upbeat news for the sector, especially among specialty chains like Ulta (ULTA) — an IBD Leaderboard stock — that were able to keep promotions down and traffic up.

369,TJX,"Follow Alan Elliott on Twitter @IBD_AELliott and on Facebook.Stock futures held slender losses ahead of Wednesday's open, as commodities were generally quiet and company news drove the bulk of early action.Dow futures eased to an 8-point loss, off their hour-earlier lows. Nasdaq futures were weaker, 13 points below fair market value, but also off their earlier lows. S&P 500 futures slipped 4.7 points.The stock market today opens freighted with yet another distribution day, as the S&P 500 raised its count to seven on Tuesday. The Nasdaq shows eight distribution days. The numbers are a measure of selling by large investors, and counts rising above five days send a clear caution sign to investors that the market is under pressure.The S&P 500 ended Tuesday level with its 200-day moving average. Keep an eye on the index today to see whether it will hold or surrender that level of support.There's not much in store on Wednesday's economic calendar: wholesale inventory numbers from the Commerce Department are due out at 10 a.m. ET. At 10:30 a.m., the Energy Information Administration is due to report its weekly oil inventories, which can have an influence on oil prices.Oil futures bobbed higher Wednesday morning after taking a deep dive Tuesday. Brent crude traded up more than 1%, holding above $40 a barrel.

407,TJX,"According to U.S. mall landlords, the rumors of the death of brick-and-mortar retail are greatly exaggerated.“There is no question there is a lot of change,” Taubman Centers Chief Operating Officer Bill Taubman said in an interview at the International Council of Shopping Centers annual convention, which was held in Las Vegas this past week. “But retail has always been about evolution. Someone is always bemoaning the change in the market and how it’s impacting things.”Bleak earnings forecasts from department-store companies, including Macy’s (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), along with bankruptcy filings by firms such as Sports Authority and teen-clothing chain Aeropostale, have rattled investors in retail landlords. A Bloomberg index of regional mall landlords, which includes the shares of Taubman Centers (TCO) and Simon Property Group (SPG), has dropped almost 8% recently, double the decline in the broader Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Index.Retailers are being hurt by the rise of Internet shopping, changes in consumer tastes and declining visits to big-city shopping districts by tourists deterred by the strong dollar. Retail rents on Madison Avenue in Manhattan have fallen to $1,644 a square foot on average, down 3% from last year, according to a report this month by the Real Estate Board of New York.Sales have suffered this year at malls that rely on shoppers from Europe and Latin America, said Taubman, whose properties include high-end destinations such as the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and Beverly Center in Los Angeles. Spending by travelers from China hasn’t dropped off much, he said.Despite the turmoil, demand for space has held up, Kimco Realty (KIM) Chief Executive Officer Conor Flynn said during a panel discussion at the Las Vegas convention. New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based Kimco is adding more grocery stores to anchor its shopping centers, a reliable source of business, he said.The market will get more clarity on retailers’ demand for space when Sports Authority auctions off its stores, Flynn said. Once the largest U.S. sporting-goods retailer, the company filed for bankruptcy in March after saddling itself with $643 million of debt.“We are watching shadow supply,” Flynn said. “We don’t want a shock to the system where there is a ton of square-footage coming online at the same time.”Plenty of retailers are thriving, said Matt Lougee, a senior vice president at DDR (DDR), a company that owns shopping centers across the U.S. Lougee cited TJX (TJX), the owner of discounters T.J. Maxx and Marshalls that last week boosted its earnings forecast, as an example of a company that is benefiting from the shift away from full-price apparel. The perception that lost revenue is all going online isn’t accurate, he said.“Those dollars are going somewhere,” Lougee said in an interview in Las Vegas. “They went to a different channel, not necessarily the Internet.”Property owners in the retail business will always have to contend with filling empty stores as part of the normal course of business, Vereit (VER) Chief Executive Officer Glenn Rufrano said on a panel in Las Vegas.“Retailers will always lose space, not because they are retailers, but because they are bad merchants,” he said.Related: Dollar Tree, Discount Retailers Dominate New-Highs ListWal-Mart Re-Thinks Small Format Strategy As Dollar Stores SwarmSluggish Retail Sales?

408,TJX,"In factor investing with ETFs, the sum may be more than the parts.To be sure, single-factor exchange traded funds have dominated recently. Specifically, strategies to smooth the ride in a bumpy stock market.Investors have poured $5.28 billion in new money into iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) so far this year -- or more than a third of the $12.97 billion in assets that it holds. That's made it the No. 1 equity ETF in terms of net inflow.However, the average investor may not fully grasp the risk-reward trade-off tied to single factors, says Rob Nestor, head of iShares smart beta.Low volatility ETFs have historically offered protection in down markets.  But they tend to underperform in market rallies, taking away from their returns over a full market cycle. An investor seeking to beat the market may end up feeling short-changed.Investors should not expect low volatility ETFs to outperform the market over a full market cycle. They should use low volatility strategies to reduce risk and to aim for a smoother ride, Nestor says.Nestor believes multifactor ETFs may be a good choice for many investors.""The multifactor approach is for the investor who wants to outperform, but not on a highly volatile path,"" Nestor said.Certain stock characteristics or ""factors"" -- such as size, quality, value and momentum -- have historically rewarded investors. They're also very lowly correlated to one another. So while the factors can be volatile individually, they help to reduce overall portfolio risk when combined, according to Nestor.Basically, multifactor ETFs aim to offer market risk with higher returns. Low or minimum volatility ETFs offer the market return with less risk.Multifactor ETFs have proliferated as investors seek to both outperform and manage risk. More than two dozen multifactor ETFs have launched within the past year from multiple issuers.IShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) has racked up assets of $86.2 million in just over a year since its launch. LRGF focuses on financially healthy firms (quality), inexpensive stocks (value), smaller companies (size) and trending stocks (momentum).Its 141 large- and midcap holdings include Accenture (ACN), TJX Cos. (TJX) and Gilead (GILD).This month, iShares launched nine new multifactor ETFs focused on equity sectors such as technology and finance.John Hancock also offers a multifactor ETF suite.According to ETF firm Global X, the four multifactor funds in its ""Scientific Beta"" suite have all outperformed their market-cap-weighted benchmarks, with lower volatility, since launch. Global X Scientific Beta Japan (SCIJ) was down 0.3% year to date through May 19 vs. a 4.8% loss for iShares MSCI Japan (EWJ).""Multifactor funds are the latest evolution in smart beta investing,” said Jay Jacobs, director of research for Global X. “The rigorous research put into these strategies, combined with the low fees and increased tax efficiency associated with ETFs, represents an attractive alternative to expensive actively managed mutual funds.”Keep in mind that multifactor funds haven't much been tested in the real world. Jacobs also cautioned that not all multifactor ETFs are the same. He advised investors to assess the quality of the methodology. In particular, he noted that increasing a portfolio's factor exposure at the expense of diversification has been shown to result in lower risk-adjusted returns.""Multifactor ETFs backed by a methodology that adheres to academic research and seeks to maximize risk-adjusted returns are likely more appropriate as core portfolio holdings,"" he added.At CLS Investments, multifactor ETFs tend to be used in simple portfolios holding a handful of funds. Single-factor ETFs fit better in more complex portfolios.""That way we control exposures more to our liking,"" said Rusty Vanneman, CIO of the Nebraska-based firm, which manages north of $6 billion in assets.The firm emphasizes the use of factor-based, smart beta ETFs ""that will enhance performance relative to market benchmarks,"" according to Vanneman. In a low-growth climate, the firm favors high-quality stocks and accesses them through iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL).Smart beta ETFs (also called strategic beta or alternative beta ETFs) include factor-based strategies. They typically tweak traditional indexes to boost returns, reduce risk or generate income.BlackRock projects smart beta ETF assets will reach $1 trillion globally by 2020, and $2.4 trillion by 2025. That's a 19% annual organic growth over the next five to 10 years, and double the rate of the overall ETF market.

409,TJX,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Wal-Mart (WMT) reported strong results, but Target (TGT), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) were among those with weak results or outlooks. Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years. Weekly jobless claims fell sharply after spiking to the highest since February 2015 in the prior week. Industrial production was strong in April, but manufacturing surveys for May from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed unexpected deterioration.Existing-home sales and housing starts rose for April, while builder sentiment was steady in May.Mega-investors piled into Apple. Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday May 13 that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple last quarter, valued at about $1.07 billion at quarter’s end. Midweek, Greenlight Capital disclosed it raised its stake in Apple 30.7% to 8.2 million shares, and billionaire George Soros' Soros Fund Management said it took a 3,100-share stake in Apple. Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search. Google Home, expected to ship in 2016, will compete with the Amazon.com (AMZN) Echo. Google’s new “Allo” messaging app features artificial intelligence, like Facebook's new “chat bot.” Google’s upcoming Android N upgrade to its mobile operating system will feature a virtual reality mode. However, Google did not unveil a VR competitor to Facebook’s Oculus Rift. Apple rival Xiaomi plans to ship its Android-based TV set-top box to the U.S. in 2016.Both home improvement chains topped estimates on strong housing market growth and favorable spring weather, raising guidance. But Home Depot fell 2.5% on Tuesday and 1% for the week, as same-store sales growth cooled from 10.2% in Feb. to 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Meanwhile, Lowe’s shares climbed 6.4% to an all-time high, breaking out of a nearly four-month long consolidation.Salesforce.com reported Q1 EPS and revenue that topped views as the business software provider signed more big deals with enterprise customers. Billings rose 31% year over year, accelerating from 28% in Q4. Salesforce.com increased its full-year revenue guidance slightly to $8.2 billion. On its earnings call, management touted a new cloud alliance with Amazon Web Services. Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts. The American Petroleum Institute reported a drawdown of 1.14 million barrels. U.S. production continues to fall while gasoline demand ramps up.Oil prices hit fresh seven-month highs during the week. U.S. futures closed the week at $47.75 a barrel, up 3.3%.Goldman Sachs said that oil could hit $50 per barrel later this year as the market “likely shifted into deficit in May,” earlier than Goldman expected. But the supply deficit will be short-lived and will swing back to surplus next year.FMC Technologies (FTI) and France’ Technip announced a merger that would rival oilfield service giants Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL).Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reportedly offered to buy Apache (APA). But Oxy said it didn’t “have any knowledge” about an offer. In November, Anadarko (APC) withdrew a bid to buy Apache, which had rejected the offer.Wal-Mart and Target moved in opposite directions after issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Target’s Q1 EPS increased 17% to $1.29, beating views for $1.19. But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online. Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

412,TJX,"Holiday hiring is in full swing, and this year — like last year — the biggest employment gains are expected in a handful of retail sectors, according to the Pew Research Center.In November, clothing companies and department stores accounted for more than half of retail job gains, adding 121,600 and 114,700 jobs, respectively, noted Pew Research in a report issued Friday.Last year, nearly a third of the retail-job surge over the holidays occurred in clothing/accessories stores, with 202,400 jobs added from October through December. Department stores followed with 177,400 new jobs.Retail payrolls typically rise 3% to 4% between October and December, Pew said. Some 626,200 retail jobs were added in November and December last year, for a 4.1% gain over the earlier year.Other big holiday hirers are general merchandise stores and sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores, Pew said.Macy's (M) announced in late September that this year it would hire seasonal associates for about 86,000 positions at its Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores and in other parts of the company, up about 3.6% from 2013, with 10,000 of the jobs based in fulfillment centers that support online ordering and other aspects of Macy's ""omnichannel"" selling strategy.This holiday shopping season is broadly shaping up stronger than expected so far in terms of retailer revenue, despite some reports of a lackluster Black Friday. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5% year over year in November, according to a Retail Metrics index, while forecasts had called for just a 3.4% rise.Considering factors such as earnings growth and stock market gains, Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX (TJX) are the highest-rated stocks in IBD's retail-apparel group, which is ranked 34 out of 197 industry groups in stock market performance. Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's are the highest-rated stocks in the retail-department store industry, though the sector itself is ranked relatively low.What happens after all that holiday hiring? What goes up must come down. Retail payrolls typically fall 5% to 6% between December and February, Pew's research noted. Last year, the retail sector shed 888,000 jobs in the two months after December. That was more than the number hired over the holidays, as some retailers with disappointing results laid off staff or closed poorly performing stores.""If history is any guide, retail payrolls will rise again this month before dropping sharply after the New Year,"" wrote Pew Research's Drew DeSilver.Sectors that don't much change their hiring policy over the holidays are nonseasonal grocery and drug stores and building materials and garden supply stores, which hit their peak payrolls in summer.Related: Costco, Gap Lead Solid November Holiday Start.

429,TJX,"The specialty retail sector is off to a promising start to the holiday shopping season, according to a new report from Sterne Agee, with names like Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Ross Stores (ROST) leading the way.In a note released Monday morning, Sterne Agee analyst Ike Boruchow said the first two weeks of November ""appear to show signs of hope for retailers, as checks/data points suggest a solid start to the month.""Foot traffic has ""improved meaningfully,"" he said, with ""the best readings since late July."" Meanwhile, promotional activity ""has ticked down"" although it still remains elevated overall.""Though November saw an unseasonably warm start to the month with above-average temperatures, store traffic reversed just in time for the holiday season,"" Boruchow noted. ""The reversal in trends is a welcome sight following a sluggish post-BTS (back-to-school) selling season, especially considering these were the strongest traffic readings since July.""In terms of stocks favored by investors, Boruchow said the top names are dominated by ""high-quality, defensive"" retailers such as Ross and T.J. Maxx owner TJX (TJX) as well as beauty names like Ulta and Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH).Ulta, an IBD 50 stock, has a Composite Rating of 99. It is the highest rated stock in IBD's Retail-Specialty group, which ranks No. 19 of 197 industries tracked.

Fiscal third quarter sales and profits met consensus expectations, but full-year earnings guidance didn't. The sell-off stopped at a test of the stock's 10-week moving average, seriously damaging efforts to shape a three-month cup base.

461,TJX,"JCPenney (JCP) missed on first-quarter revenue and cut gross margin guidance for the year on Friday, adding to the retail massacre that was earnings week.Shares closed down 2.8% as the struggling lower-tier department store reported a 32-cent per-share loss, though the result was better than views for a 38-cent per-share loss and narrower than the prior-year loss of 57 cents a share.But sales had been expected to rise from the previous year, and an unexpected 2% dip to $2.81 billion missed consensus estimates for $2.92 billion. Same-store sales dipped 0.4% during the quarter. Cowen, for one, had estimated a 4% gain. JCPenney's men's division performed well, along with Sephora beauty counters, footwear and handbags.JCPenney Chief Executive Marvin Ellison reiterated 2016 comp guidance for 3%-4% but dropped gross margin outlook to a 10-30 basis point increase, down from prior guidance for a 40-60 basis point rise. Adjusted earnings per share are still expected to be positive.The company's results capped off a week that knocked around department store stocks, with Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) all turning in vastly disappointing quarterly figures. Macy's missed on revenue and cut earnings guidance, while Nordstrom and Kohl's each missed on the top and bottom lines.The shares of all three were sent reeling by the results. Investor's Business Daily's retail-department stores group plunged 14% for the week.The Commerce Department said Friday, however, that retail sales notched a 1.3% gain in April.""Next week should bring more positive results from the likes of Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW), two of the busiest locations we have visited all spring, as well as from off-price leader TJX (TJX) and potentially from discounter Target (TGT) and apparel chain American Eagle (AEO),"" wrote Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins in a Friday note.""Should they all miss expectations, we would be even more concerned about the state of retail,"" Perkins said.RELATED:Retail Sales Spike 1.3%, Best Gain In A Year, Easing Consumer FearsNordstrom, Kohl’s Add To Retail-Sector CarnageMacy’s Warning Triggers Retail Meltdown As Amazon Dominance Grows.

462,TJX,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

463,TJX,"T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX (TJX) could outperform Macy’s (M) domestically in 2017, says Credit Suisse.While the firm said it remains cautious on the off-price sector, noting its high square-footage growth amid the entry of new competitors, it also noted the industry's improved sales productivity.“If current trends continue, we expect that sometime in 2017 that TJX's domestic annualized sales (for Marmaxx and HomeGoods) will exceed that of Macy's -- the largest department store in the U.S, by sales,” wrote Credit Suisse analyst Michael Exstein.This is important, he explains, because department stores ""create legitimacy"" when it comes to the brands and price points offered for a significant chunk of the products stocked by off-price retailers.“This raises significant strategic questions of what happens next for the off-price industry,” he said. “How do they sustain their value proposition as the gap in sales and, in turn, customer reach narrows further between themselves and department stores? How long will the vendor community tolerate the high returns enjoyed by off price as they continue to function strictly as a conduit from vendor to retail customer?”TJX shares closed up 1.3% at 78.62 and are now extended above their 78.49 buy-range ceiling.The company also announced Tuesday that it had bumped up its quarterly dividend by 24%, to 26 cents per share, and plans to buy back $1.5 billion to $2 billion in shares in fiscal 2017.Macy's shares rose less than 0.1%.Of the off-price companies in its coverage -- TJX, Ross Stores (ROST), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Stein Mart (SMRT) -- Credit Suisse said the group's collective share price index rose 23% in 2015, ahead of the 18% decline of its mall anchor index and the S&P 500's 13% gain last year.So far this year, its off-price index has gained at close to the same pace as mall anchors.RELATED:Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon’s ClutchesMacy’s Downgraded As Amazon Poses ‘Increasing Threat’

Lululemon Athletica logged a 17% EPS decline and 14% revenue rise in its previous quarter.Lululemon has a devoted following, but its offerings face mounting competition not just from athletic peers Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA), but also from a swath of other companies looking to capitalize on the ""athleisure"" apparel style that remains in vogue.Outlook for the year ahead will guide Lululemon's shares following the earnings report.""Sentiment is bullish ahead of 4Q, but a conservative 1Q guide could drive (near-term) downside given its recent run,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger in mid-March. ""Any pullback creates a buying opportunity, as we see upward EPS revisions and a strong year ahead.""Greenberger, who calls Lululemon the investment bank's ""favorite turnaround story,"" has an overweight rating and 68 price target on the stock.Three years ago, Lululemon had to deal with a recall debacle involving a crop of yoga pants that exposed more than consumers were hoping for.

482,TJX,"The off-price channel continues to show strength as TJX (TJX) posted fourth-quarter results that comfortably topped expectations and announced a dividend hike and share buyback. Separately, big-box retailer Target (TGT) missed views but its same-store sales and better-than-expected guidance were enough to reassure Wall Street.TJX's Q4 earnings rose 6.5% to 99 cents per share, a nickel above views. Revenue grew 8% to $8.96 billion, ahead of forecasts for $8.73 billion. Same-store sales rose 6%, with positive comp growth in all segments. TJX is the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods.Comps and EPS growth ""significantly"" exceeded the company's own expectations, said CEO Ernie Herrman.""Once again, customer traffic drove our entire consolidated comp increase,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""It was also the primary driver of our comp increases at every division in the fourth quarter and full year as we continued delivering consumers a differentiated offering at extreme value. We are convinced that we are gaining market share profitably around the world.""TJX also announced plans to hike its regular quarterly dividend by 24% to 26 cents a share and said it will repurchase $1.5 billion to $2 billion in shares during the year.For 2017, TJX sees $3.29 to $3.38 in diluted per-share earnings, which includes the impact of currency exchange and a previously announced wage initiative. Analysts currently expect $3.61.The company expects the same factors to weigh on Q1, and is expecting 68 cents to 70 cents in earnings per share for the quarter, below current Wall Street views for 74 cents.That doesn't worry Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen.""Though we acknowledge FY17 guide was below St, we believe stock should hold up given history of conservatism in guide and quality/sustainability of (off-price) business model,"" he wrote Wednesday.TJX shares closed up 2.1%. Rival Ross Stores (ROST) shares added 1.6% in the stock market today.Meanwhile, Target said it earned $1.52 per adjusted share in Q4, a 1% rise from last year and 2 cents below views. Sales dipped 0.6% to $21.63 billion, just shy of consensus estimates for $21.75 billion.Comps grew 1.9%, above estimates and driven by 1.3% traffic growth. That gain was offset by the impact of the sale of its pharmacies and clinics to CVS Health (CVS), said Target. Online sales climbed 34%.Despite the earnings and revenue misses, Target shares rose 4% as investors focused on the better-than-expected comp and digital growth, as well as guidance. Chen wrote in a separate note that he was ""impressed"" by Target's Q4 traffic-led comp beat, ""digital outperformance"" and continued strength in its signature categories of baby, wellness, kids and style.He reiterated an outperform rating on the stock, as Target is ""gaining share in a difficult backdrop.""For the year, the retailer expects to earn an adjusted $5.20 to $5.40 per share, well above current analyst forecasts for $5.16 a share. For Q1, Target sees $1.15 to $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share, the midpoint of which is a penny above views for $1.19 a share.Major competitor Wal-Mart (WMT), by contrast, cut its sales guidance for the year and missed Q4 revenue forecasts when it reported in mid-February.

After Wal-Mart's pay hike, retailers like Ross, off-price rival TJX (TJX) and Target (TGT) followed.The planned pay hike also weighed on Ross’s full-year earnings per share guidance of $2.59-$2.71, which missed forecasts for $2.75. Comparable-store sales are seen rising 1% to 2%. For Q1, the company sees EPS of 69-72 cents, lower than views for 76 cents.The dimmer forecast comes amid broader fears of a recession, more aggressive off-price offerings from Macy’s and Nordstrom, and pressures for better accommodations for labor across the industry.“As we enter 2016, we continue to face our own challenging multiyear comparisons in an increasingly uncertain and volatile macroeconomic and retail environment,” Ross CEO Barbara Rentler said in a statement.“As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook when forecasting sales and earnings for the coming year.”Q4 earnings per share rose 10% to 66 cents, topping by 2 cents. Sales increased 7% to $3.25 billion, edging past views for $3.21 billion. Comps rose 4%.Those results came despite tough holiday promotions from rivals.

Last summer, Cowen had predicted that Amazon would topple Macy's (M) as America's No. 1 apparel retailer by 2017.""In 2016, we believe investors can't ignore Amazon, the growing giant in the retail world,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent note to clients. ""We suggest buying companies who can offer an 'un-Amazon-able' brand proposition.""Ross appears to have done just that. It is included in that brief list of companies impervious to Amazon's market-share grab, along with off-price retail rival TJX (TJX), upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware (RH), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) and beauty-product vendors Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH) and Ulta (ULTA).The distinction is notable for this unassuming chain of off-price stores, since the rest of the retail field has been working hard to fend off the creeping advance of e-commerce.Macy's has turned each and every store into a mini-fulfillment center in order to expedite online shipping orders. Nordstrom (JWN), known for its tech spending, has set aside $1.5 billion, or 35% of its $4.3 billion five-year capital plan, for tech and supply chain investments.Even TJX has an e-commerce presence, though it remains a relatively small one. In general, selling items online isn't easy for off-pricers that have a revolving door of merchandise.""Such a potpourri is not necessarily conducive to traditional online (shops),"" said Cowen's Chen.Visitors to Ross's website won't see any online offers, and no way to peruse its inventory outside of a physical store. Could its lack of an e-commerce segment hurt the company down the road?""I don’t think it’s a big issue right now,"" said William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin. ""Could it become a big issue over time? Sure, it could. At this time, they don’t feel it could be profitable.""An online shop would bring greater access to shoppers.""I think it merits exploration because the reality is, with the prevalent use of mobile phones, it’d be nice for them to tap into that device that everybody has,"" said Chen. But with a selection of mostly low-ticket items, ""the main issue is shipping costs.""Hofkin highlighted one benefit that TJX has seen from its online efforts; it is reaping incremental traffic from customers who stop by stores to make returns and wind up picking up a few things while they're there. That happens about 70% of the time, he said.But shoppers are likely to want to visit Ross stores in person, even stopping by brick-and-mortar locations as often as once a week, said Chen.""It’s about the treasure hunt -- that isn’t something that you can replicate online,"" he said.Ross also retains other advantages.Unseasonably warm weather late last year prompted an inventory pileup for many stores, which in turn prompted heavy discounting as cold-weather gear didn't leave shelves as quickly as hoped. Other retailers' inventory management was ""appalling"" last year and over the holiday season, said Morningstar's Weishaar.But Ross is not expected to shoulder the same burden from winter's toasty start as its department-store brethren -- in fact, weather woes for other companies can translate to cheap buys for off-pricers, which often source from overstocked suppliers.""(It can) allow (Ross) and TJX to buy some excess merchandise in the marketplace at substantially better prices, which can support future sales and margins,"" William Blair's Hofkin said via email. ""(Ross) also likely has less weather exposure, given its larger (California) and sunbelt presence.""Between 20%-25% of Ross Stores are located in California, he said.Analysts also highlight Ross's buying strategy. The company purchases a lot of ""packaway"" inventory, i.e. basics that can be bought at a low price now but then sold seasons later, regardless of what's in fashion.While high inventory levels aren't generally regarded as a positive for most retailers, Ross' 48% packaway level doesn't trouble Wall Street. Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger called it a ""strategic advantage"" and wrote in November that packaway ""typically provides (Ross) customers with the greatest value and produces the highest merchandise margin, enhancing financial returns.""How does Ross rate against its primary rival, TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls? Both are broadly well-regarded. Both have been outperforming their retail peers.The TJX customers, though, tend to come from from a wider range of household incomes, and they generally spend more per visit than the average Ross customer. TJX products also have higher price points. T.J. Maxx, for example, stocks a selection of high-end items more in line with what one might find at Saks Fifth Avenue, including $600 Versace watches and Fendi purses that go for a ""discounted"" price that is still nearly $3,000.Ross also is a domestic play. As of the end of its most recent quarter, the company had 1,276 Ross Dress for Less locations in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, plus 172 DD's Discounts across 15 states. Conversely, TJX operates stores in Canada, Europe and most recently Australia, with its 2015 acquisition of Trade Secret.Ross shares are up roughly 13% over the last 12 months, in stark contrast to its broader category, IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which has fallen 16%.Ross's third-quarter earnings for the period ended Oct. 31 grew 13% to 53 cents a share, topping views by three cents. Revenue growth of 7% to $2.78 billion pulled ahead of forecasts for $2.77 billion.Management is ""solid as a rock,"" said Cowen's Chen. ""I think they have good strategies that are balanced.""What kind of speed bumps could Ross encounter in the future?Wage increases could put pressure on margins, noted several analysts. But the minimum wage hike in California -- which is now $10 an hour as of the start of 2016 -- could also help Ross, said Chen, as the lower-income shopper now has more money in his or her pocket.And deeper discounts at Macy's and other department stores could also lure in bargain hunters as competition for shoppers heats up.Ross declined to provide comment for the story. Its executives generally do not grant media interviews, said a Ross spokesperson.""There’s a certain degree of privacy because in the industry you don’t want to reveal too much to your competitors,"" said Chen, ""and because there’s competition for goods and competition for how you should change your store to capture share.""

"
556,TJX,"TJX (TJX) topped estimates and raised its guidance going into the all-important holiday quarter, and the off-price retailer doesn't appear to be burdened by the same inventory and pricing issues that plague full-price peers.In contrast to Macy's (M) and Nordstrom's (JWN) weak results and forecasts last week, TJX lifted its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to 4%-5% from a prior outlook for 3%-4% growth. Q3 earnings edged up over 1% to 86 cents per share, topping by 2 cents, and revenue grew over 5% to $7.75 billion, vs. views for $7.73 billion.""It's a broader reflection of core middle- and lower-income consumers, which makes up 70% of the population,"" Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins told IBD. ""They are looking for value.""TJX shares climbed 3.85%, and Wal-Mart gained 3.5%.Fourth-quarter and full-year guidance fell short of expectations, however, as the company accounted for a variety of factors — including its late October acquisition of Australian off-pricer Trade Secret — that should weigh on EPS growth by 9%.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) saw a 14% drop in Q3 EPS to 99 cents, topping by a penny. Revenue dipped 1.3% to $117.4 billion, missing views, but U.S. comps grew for the fifth straight quarter amid turnaround efforts.Shift In Spending HabitsA ""healthy U.S. consumer backdrop,"" cleaner stores and upgraded staffing, among other factors, will likely drive holiday demand at Wal-Mart, noted Cowen & Co.'s Oliver Chen, who has a market perform rating on the stock.But Wal-Mart still faces competition from Amazon (AMZN), said Perkins, and the big-box retailer is also feeling the heat from dollar stores like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).Weighing on traditional retailers and department stores is a shift in spending habits. Perkins pointed to off-pricers' post-recession success as a reason why Macy's, Nordstrom and other companies are pursuing the discount space themselves, with offshoots like Macy's Backstage, Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off Fifth, among others.And in an increasingly cutthroat shopping environment that pits brick-and-mortar shops against Amazon and other online shopping destinations, the battle is being fought on several fronts.But shoppers also aren't as interested in apparel, say both Perkins and Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. Those dollars are going into a variety of different areas, including home goods and bigger-ticket items such as automotive needs.Outside of cheaper products, another advantage that off-pricers like TJX and Ross Stores (ROST) have is faster and higher inventory turnover, giving it a flexibility that makes it more akin to fast-fashion favorites Forever 21 and Zara than Macy's or Nordstrom.""The ones that are outperforming right now are the ones that are most responsive to what consumers want,"" Weishaar said.Traditional retailers have a six- to nine-month lead time for orders, she explained, while off-pricers can buy merchandise much closer to the start of each season. This helps to ""weatherproof"" against factors such as, say, a warmer fall that keeps shoppers enjoying the changing foliage instead of shopping for snow boots.When asked about the impact of warm weather — which several other retailers have blamed in recent earnings reports — TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz said that she'd ""rather not talk about weather,"" focusing instead on her team's performance.""That's all about execution and delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time,"" she said on the post-earnings call. ""Every year, we learn and we get better at weatherproofing our business. It just comes back to the model — we keep ourselves very flexible.""For department stores, improving lead time is easier said than done, said Perkins. ""It's like trying to turn around a battleship.""The good news for shoppers, at least, is that Santa's likely to deliver plenty of discounts for the holidays.Perkins said he expects the promotional environment to be ""comparable, if not even steeper"" and potentially more aggressive than last year's holiday quarter, as retailers try to get rid of leftover inventory from the fall.Weishaar was even less optimistic: ""It's going to be horrible. It's going to be one of the worst we've seen in a long time.""
"
557,TJX,"Never mind ""Let It Snow."" Heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, retailers are more likely singing ""Let It Go"" from the movie ""Frozen"" as they try to shake off disappointing quarterly earnings results and a bad week that collectively sank merchant stocks.Nordstrom (JWN), Macy 's (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) were among those that reported the week of Nov. 9, with Nordstrom and Macy's turning in weak results and discounted forecasts, and J.C. Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week.

Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion. Shares slid 4%.""We believe retail is in a state of transition as brands wrestle with how to compete against growing & dynamic pureplay online retailers,"" wrote Chen.RELATED:Retail Sales Weak, Except For Amazon, EcommerceMacy's Stock Selloff Could Be Tip Of Iceberg4 Reasons TJX, Off-Price Retailers Will Keep Surging.

559,TJX,"Online sales grew 20%, a deceleration from the previous quarter's 30% growth. Target's Q3 digital sales missed management's earlier guidance for 30% year-over-year growth, said Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen in a Wednesday report.

608,TJX,"Did department stores Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) move their earnings out of the doldrums and back onto the growth track in the third quarter?Investors will learn the answer when the two top department stores kick off retail earnings season and report quarterly results this week. If analysts' expectations are on target, both companies will see their earnings decrease.So far, the signs aren't good, analysts say. The department store group saw their shares get hammered on Monday as several negative reports came out on the segment.Macy's shares tumbled after Citigroup lowered its price target on the retailer. Deutsche Bank also issued a negative report on Macy's and other mid-tier department store operators Kohl's (KSS) and Dillard's (DDS), noting they ""may be about to limbo underneath what is already a very low bar as they report potentially very underwhelming Q3 results and Q4/holiday guidance.""Macy's shares closed down 5.4% on the stock market today.JPMorgan also issued a negative report on several department stores on Monday noting Macy's, Dillard's, Kohl's and Nordstrom have ""too much cold-weather inventory,"" among other things. Nordstrom shares closed down 4.7% on Monday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Macy's to see earnings decline 13% from a year earlier to 53 cents a share when it reports third-quarter results on Wednesday before the opening bell. That comes on top of a 20% drop in the second quarter.They see a 1.6% decline in sales to $6.1 billion, following a 3% decrease in the second quarter, to mark the third straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines.Macy's is generally regarded as a well-run chain, with a strong sales channels, but it has reported lower year-over-year revenue in five of the last seven quarters.The sales trend comes as spending has been shifting from traditional shopping-mall department stores and apparel chains toward experiences and non-tangible goods such as wireless services and entertainment, amid ever-growing competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Investor's Business Daily's department store industry group ranks retailers No. 192 out of 197 industry groups.Macy's has recently undertaken a number of initiatives to propel growth, including entering the lucrative off-price retail arena, where it would compete with operators such as TJX Cos. (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST). In September, Macy's debuted its new off-price retail brand, Macy's Backstage, with three New York City metro area stores and three more set to open in 2015.Nordstrom is also generally regarded as a well-run chain with a strong omnichannel presence. The company has fared particularly well with its growing chain of Nordstrom Rack off-price stores.Nordstrom is expected to see earnings slip 0.7% vs. a year earlier to 72 cents a share when the high-end department store operator reports third-quarter results on Thursday after the close. That would follow a 2% decline in adjusted earnings in the second quarter and mark the fourth-straight quarterly drop in earnings.Analysts expect the upscale department store operator to see a 7.4% rise in revenue to $3.4 billion. That would follow a 9% gain in sales in the second quarter.On Oct. 1, Nordstrom announced that it closed the sale of its credit card portfolio to TD Bank USA for $2.2 billion. The agreement also makes TD Bank the exclusive U.S. issuer of Nordstrom-branded Visa and private-label consumer credit cards.In connection with the closing, Nordstrom's board authorized a special cash dividend and an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The company said it would pay a special cash dividend of $4.85 a share on Oct. 27, to shareholders of record on Oct. 12.Follow Marilyn Much on Twitter @IBD_MMuch.

"
610,TJX,"Arms filled with skirts, tops and shorts, the 18-year-old New York native was on the final stretch of her buying spree at Forever 21, where she had already spent $700 in the past month on a wardrobe for her soon-to-start college freshman year.
"
611,TJX,"Wicks prefers Forever 21 over teen apparel retailers such as American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), where she buys her jeans.
"
612,TJX,"""The clothes are cuter and more reasonably priced at Forever 21,"" said Wicks. ""Forever 21 has clothes to fit your style no matter what it is, while American Eagle has only one style.""
"
613,TJX,"It's a sign of the times. Shelves bulging with trendy clothes at cheap prices, fast-fashion outfits such as Forever 21 and H&M are among the rivals siphoning share from traditional teen apparel retailers at a time when high teen unemployment has prompted young consumers to change how, what and where they shop.
"
614,TJX,"Runway To Take Home
"
615,TJX,"Fast-fashion designs are based on the most recent fashion-house trends fresh from the runways that are brought to stores very quickly.
"
616,TJX,"Forever 21, H&M, Zara and other chains set up design shops internally and come up with their own differentiated offerings, which they bring into stores in small lots, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
617,TJX,"Once a collection is gone, it's not replenished, but replaced with the next wave, providing a ""continual sense of newness"" in the store, he says.
"
618,TJX,"""The core of fast-fashion's strategy is to quickly turn low-priced apparel and accessories to entice consumers to consistently update their wardrobe in line with rapid and sometimes unpredictable fashion trends,"" adds Cowen analyst John Kernan in a report.
"
619,TJX,"The inexpensive prices, says Kernan, enable young women to buy items they wear a few times, or sometimes only once.
"
620,TJX,"Teens are willing to swap logos and status-branded items for low prices and a steady stream of new trendy gear at places such as Forever 21.
"
621,TJX,"Apps Vs. Apparel
"
622,TJX,"Fast-fashion chains are leaving traditional teen retailers such as American Eagle, Aeropostale (ARO), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Zumiez (ZUMZ) in the dust. But the sector is suffering for a variety of reasons.
"
623,TJX,"Off-price operators including TJX Cos. (TJX) and websites such as eBay (EBAY) and Overstock.com (OSTK) also grab a piece of cash-strapped teens' spending dollars.
"
624,TJX,"Teens have cooled on apparel as their spending on Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other tech-related gear and accessories become more important status symbols.
"
625,TJX,"""Teens would rather outfit their cellphones than outfit their own bodies,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group.
"
626,TJX,"Young adults have little money to spend: Unemployment among those age 16-19 is still 19.1%. Parents are struggling with poor employment and wages.
"
627,TJX,"And there are just too many stores chasing too few teens.
"
628,TJX,"""Specialty teen retailing remains at overcapacity domestically with growth continuing to outpace the teen population,"" according to a 2014 Piper Jaffray survey of 7,500 teens at an average age of 16.4 years.
"
629,TJX,"From 1999 to 2007, the industry grew at a 39% compound annual growth rate, while the teen population grew at a low single-digit rate, says the survey. Over the last five years, the teen population has contracted while teen-retail square footage has expanded at a low single-digit rate per year.
"
630,TJX,"For all these reasons, teen retailers have significantly underperformed other merchants since the start of last year, says Perkins. In Q1, the segment reported an earnings decline of 130% — an outright loss — vs. an estimated 4.2% drop for the industry as a whole. Analysts see another loss for the teen apparel group in the current quarter.
"
631,TJX,"Limited spending power has prompted teens to ""migrate"" to the fast-fashion chains where they get more bang for their buck than they do at the teen apparel stores, adds Brain Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors.
"
632,TJX,"Cheap Chic
"
633,TJX,"""These fast-fashion companies have done a phenomenal job undercutting all the traditional mall retailers on price, and they're giving teens an assortment that can't be found anywhere in the mall,"" said Sozzi.
"
634,TJX,"""If these stores can offer something like a pair of jeans for about 50% less than at, say, American Eagle, the teen is willing to have lower-quality merchandise as long as the assortment looks fashionable from 10 yards away.""
"
635,TJX,"Fast-fashion chains turn over merchandise quickly and offer teens new floor sets weekly to create buzz and excitement.
"
636,TJX,"The chains turn their merchandise in weeks, and in other instances it's months.
"

640,TJX,"Accessorizing Trend
"
641,TJX,"Cohen says there's been a lack of fashion innovation in the teen space, which has created a ""void.""
"
642,TJX,"""The categories that were driving teen spending growth in the past are not growing,"" he said. ""They're trading down and spending on accessories rather than clothing.""
"
643,TJX,"They're buying less-expensive things like leggings instead of jeans and tights instead of pants.
"
644,TJX,"It's all about ""accessorizing,"" be it in fashions or their electronics, Cohen says.
"
645,TJX,"""There's been a shift in fashion preference away from uniform dressing where logos were more important toward mix and match and personal style,"" said Citi Research analyst Oliver Chen.
"
646,TJX,"And with a lack of any ""dominant"" fashion trend, multiple trends are working, he adds.
"
647,TJX,"Teens are dressing with different brands and mixing high-end and low-end items rather than wearing one brand ""head to toe,"" he says.
"
648,TJX,"What do teen retailers have to do to lure their customers back?
"
649,TJX,"""They need to focus on executing on trend-right products, and they need to rationalize their store bases,"" said Chen.
"
650,TJX,"They also need to ""reinvent their brands to stay relevant,"" he adds.
"
651,TJX,"Bringing merchandise into stores more quickly to ""generate buzz"" and become more competitive with the fast-fashion retailers is also important, adds Perkins.
"
652,TJX,"They also need to make their websites more mobile friendly and easy to use, he adds, as well as create more of a store ""experience"" so teens want to hang out and shop there.Rita Wicks was doing some serious shopping at the Forever 21 store in Times Square on the first Monday in June.Arms filled with skirts, tops and shorts, the 18-year-old New York native was on the final stretch of her buying spree at Forever 21, where she had already spent $700 in the past month on a wardrobe for her soon-to-start college freshman year.Wicks prefers Forever 21 over teen apparel retailers such as American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), where she buys her jeans.""The clothes are cuter and more reasonably priced at Forever 21,"" said Wicks. ""Forever 21 has clothes to fit your style no matter what it is, while American Eagle has only one style.""It's a sign of the times. Shelves bulging with trendy clothes at cheap prices, fast-fashion outfits such as Forever 21 and H&M are among the rivals siphoning share from traditional teen apparel retailers at a time when high teen unemployment has prompted young consumers to change how, what and where they shop.Runway To Take HomeFast-fashion designs are based on the most recent fashion-house trends fresh from the runways that are brought to stores very quickly.Forever 21, H&M, Zara and other chains set up design shops internally and come up with their own differentiated offerings, which they bring into stores in small lots, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.Once a collection is gone, it's not replenished, but replaced with the next wave, providing a ""continual sense of newness"" in the store, he says.""The core of fast-fashion's strategy is to quickly turn low-priced apparel and accessories to entice consumers to consistently update their wardrobe in line with rapid and sometimes unpredictable fashion trends,"" adds Cowen analyst John Kernan in a report.The inexpensive prices, says Kernan, enable young women to buy items they wear a few times, or sometimes only once.Teens are willing to swap logos and status-branded items for low prices and a steady stream of new trendy gear at places such as Forever 21.Apps Vs. ApparelFast-fashion chains are leaving traditional teen retailers such as American Eagle, Aeropostale (ARO), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Zumiez (ZUMZ) in the dust. But the sector is suffering for a variety of reasons.Off-price operators including TJX Cos. (TJX) and websites such as eBay (EBAY) and Overstock.com (OSTK) also grab a piece of cash-strapped teens' spending dollars.Teens have cooled on apparel as their spending on Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other tech-related gear and accessories become more important status symbols.""Teens would rather outfit their cellphones than outfit their own bodies,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group.Young adults have little money to spend: Unemployment among those age 16-19 is still 19.1%. Parents are struggling with poor employment and wages.And there are just too many stores chasing too few teens.""Specialty teen retailing remains at overcapacity domestically with growth continuing to outpace the teen population,"" according to a 2014 Piper Jaffray survey of 7,500 teens at an average age of 16.4 years.From 1999 to 2007, the industry grew at a 39% compound annual growth rate, while the teen population grew at a low single-digit rate, says the survey. Over the last five years, the teen population has contracted while teen-retail square footage has expanded at a low single-digit rate per year.For all these reasons, teen retailers have significantly underperformed other merchants since the start of last year, says Perkins. In Q1, the segment reported an earnings decline of 130% — an outright loss — vs. an estimated 4.2% drop for the industry as a whole. Analysts see another loss for the teen apparel group in the current quarter.Limited spending power has prompted teens to ""migrate"" to the fast-fashion chains where they get more bang for their buck than they do at the teen apparel stores, adds Brain Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors.Cheap Chic""These fast-fashion companies have done a phenomenal job undercutting all the traditional mall retailers on price, and they're giving teens an assortment that can't be found anywhere in the mall,"" said Sozzi.""If these stores can offer something like a pair of jeans for about 50% less than at, say, American Eagle, the teen is willing to have lower-quality merchandise as long as the assortment looks fashionable from 10 yards away.""Fast-fashion chains turn over merchandise quickly and offer teens new floor sets weekly to create buzz and excitement.The chains turn their merchandise in weeks, and in other instances it's months.The traditional teen retailer requires a longer lead time of six to nine months and typically rolls over merchandise a couple of times a season, Perkins adds.How do the fast-fashion retailers produce so quickly? They have ""massive supply chain infrastructure,"" says Kernan. They also ""tend to buy millions of yards of fabric far in advance of production"" since they don't know what style or fit they'll need.The factories ""in turn are fed consistent business and orders"" from these retailers, he adds.Accessorizing TrendCohen says there's been a lack of fashion innovation in the teen space, which has created a ""void.""""The categories that were driving teen spending growth in the past are not growing,"" he said.

""This is not a weak forecast,"" she said.The Federal Reserve took cautious steps Wednesday toward normalizing years of extraordinary monetary policy, dropping a pledge to be ""patient"" about raising interest rates from near zero but signaling that the pace of tightening will be slow.An April meeting rate hike is ""unlikely,"" the central bank said. Fed Chair Janet Yellen later did note at a press conference that such a step is possible ""at any later meeting"" but added, ""Just because we removed patient doesn't mean we are going to be impatient.""Policymakers appeared to see a slower path of rate rises than they had at past meetings and Yellen cited some global headwinds, including a surging dollar.The S&P 500 rose 1.2% on the dovish tone. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 13 basis points to 1.92%. The dollar, which has skyrocketed on Fed tightening plans while other central banks eased aggressively, suffered its worst loss vs. the euro in years.The expected and highly anticipated removal of the ""patient"" reference signaled a central bank moving inexorably toward tightening policy as the job market firms decisively, while still retaining some flexibility.""It will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when (the committee) has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term,"" policymakers wrote.They also took note of economic activity that ""has moderated somewhat"" since the Fed's last meeting.

884,TJX,"Coming off a strong fourth quarter, many retailers have recently gotten more cautious about their outlooks for 2015, causing analysts to cut their earnings estimates. As Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said in an email on Friday, many retailers blame investment spending on tech and wages, West Coast port closures and foreign exchange headwinds due to a…
"
885,TJX,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
886,TJX,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
887,TJX,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
888,TJX,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
889,TJX,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.
"
890,TJX,"Fuel And The Freeze
"
891,TJX,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
892,TJX,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""
"
893,TJX,"The month's results were a mixed bag.
"
894,TJX,"Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.
"
895,TJX,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
896,TJX,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
897,TJX,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
898,TJX,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
899,TJX,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
900,TJX,"April Outlook
"
901,TJX,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"
902,TJX,"The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.
"
903,TJX,"L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.
"
904,TJX,"Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.
"
905,TJX,"Old Navy Nails Sales
"
906,TJX,"Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted a 2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of an estimate for a 0.5% gain.
"
907,TJX,"The gain was led by its Old Navy brand, which saw a 14% rise in the month's same-store sales.
"
908,TJX,"Stein Mart posted an 11.2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of views for a 3% increase.
"
909,TJX,"Action-sports retail operator Zumiez (ZUMZ) reported a 5.5% increase in same-store sales for the month late Wednesday, below forecasts for a 6.5% rise.
"
910,TJX,"Drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD), which reported fourth-quarter results Wednesday morning, posted a 4.3% increase in March same-store sales, ahead of views for a 4.1% gain.
"
911,TJX,"Perkins says that despite the miss, Zumiez did better than a lot of retailers.
"
912,TJX,"PriceSmart, which owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, saw a 7.3% rise in the month's same-store sales, topping views for a 3.6% gain.

914,TJX,"'Dismal' Retail Economics
"
915,TJX,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.
"
916,TJX,"He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""
"
917,TJX,"Why? ""At the end of the day, the flat reading doesn't pick up any Easter lift to the numbers, and (the month) was weaker than the January and February performance,"" he told IBD.
"
918,TJX,"He expects April same-store sales to rise 1% vs. a year earlier amid tough comparisons with last year, when April same-store sales rose 6.2%.
"
919,TJX,"But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.
"
920,TJX,"""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""
"
921,TJX,"Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.
"
922,TJX,"""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.
"
923,TJX,"Perkins said the high-end consumer is ""driving the lion's share of spending.""
"
924,TJX,"And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).
"
925,TJX,"High-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Kate Spade (KATE) are among the luxury retailers Perkins cites as doing well. He says off-price apparel retail operators such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) are also faring well.
"
926,TJX,"Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""
"

""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""April OutlookThis month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.Old Navy Nails SalesMajor apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted a 2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of an estimate for a 0.5% gain.The gain was led by its Old Navy brand, which saw a 14% rise in the month's same-store sales.Stein Mart posted an 11.2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of views for a 3% increase.Action-sports retail operator Zumiez (ZUMZ) reported a 5.5% increase in same-store sales for the month late Wednesday, below forecasts for a 6.5% rise.Drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD), which reported fourth-quarter results Wednesday morning, posted a 4.3% increase in March same-store sales, ahead of views for a 4.1% gain.Perkins says that despite the miss, Zumiez did better than a lot of retailers.PriceSmart, which owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, saw a 7.3% rise in the month's same-store sales, topping views for a 3.6% gain.Teen retailer Buckle (BKE) saw a 0.5% decline in the month's same-store sales, short of views for a 0.1% drop.'Dismal' Retail EconomicsMichael Niemira, chief economist at the research firm Retail Economist, calculates March same-store sales rose 0.2% vs. a year earlier.He called the month's sales performance ""dismal.""Why? ""At the end of the day, the flat reading doesn't pick up any Easter lift to the numbers, and (the month) was weaker than the January and February performance,"" he told IBD.He expects April same-store sales to rise 1% vs. a year earlier amid tough comparisons with last year, when April same-store sales rose 6.2%.But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.Perkins said the high-end consumer is ""driving the lion's share of spending.""And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).High-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Kate Spade (KATE) are among the luxury retailers Perkins cites as doing well. He says off-price apparel retail operators such as Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) are also faring well.Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""Overall, he sees an improvement in the pace of same-store sales growth for the broad retail industry to around 2.5% vs. a 1% to 1.5% pace in the first quarter.

928,TJX,"""Flat"" is not a high-currency term in the investment trade.Flat earnings, flat sales and falling flat — none stirs joy in investors' hearts.But the flat base lives in another category. This base often shows a stock impatient to move on to new highs.It says a stock is not in need of a deeper shakeout, correcting 15% or less. While a cup-without-handle base has a six-week minimum length and a cup-with-handle must be at least seven weeks, a flat base can be as short as five.Off-price apparel and home goods retailer TJX (TJX) started to pull back on July 22, 2011, in what would become the first week of a seven-week flat base. (1) The market was in an uptrend, but faced rising distribution. The market status shifted to ""uptrend under pressure,"" then ""market in correction"" by July 28.Like the dollar stores, investors were playing TJX as a somewhat recession-resistant stock: The worse the economy becomes, the more shoppers like to save money.TJX was taking advantage of the economic downturn to build its market share and extend the reach of its TJ Maxx, Marshall's and Home Goods chains.The stock broke below its 10-week moving average in heavy trade, but found support several times at its 40-week moving average during the base. Normally, a flat-base buy point comes from the base's high point generally near the left side of the base. But in this case, TJX set up an early option, at 56.66 — a dime above the Aug. 25 high — for aggressive investors. (2)It cleared that buy point in heavy trade, during a seven-day run-up that followed support at its 200-day line. ( Please see a daily chart.)However, the market began pulling back just as that run-up peaked on Sept. 20. Market status shifted to ""under pressure"" Sept. 22 and ""correction"" the next day.TJX pulled back 6.6% below the 56.66 buy point, stopping just short of the 40-week moving average and the 8% sell trigger. (3) It wavered higher in light trade.The stock finally broke free from its 10-week moving average in November, after the market shifted back into ""confirmed uptrend"" status.TJX climbed 64% from its September 2011 breakout and 134% from its initial breakout in February 2010 to its high in 2012.

930,TJX,"Power centers, now a big part of the American shopping experience, are showing an unexpected durability.
"
931,TJX,"These open-air retail behemoths — perhaps anchored by a big-box store, supermarket or office supply chain — have weathered the recession and intensifying e-commerce rivalry, though that combo proved lethal to some tenants.
"
932,TJX,"By reconfiguring buildings and landing expansion-minded national discounters, specialty grocers and other chains, landlords have pared the average vacancy to 6.3% nationwide from a peak of 10.2% in the first quarter of 2009, according to Garrick Brown, research director for commercial real estate brokerage Cassidy Turley.
"
933,TJX,"That's better than the overall retail property sector — including malls, grocery-anchored neighborhood centers and lifestyle shopping centers — which has an average vacancy of around 8.7%, says Brown.
"
934,TJX,"In the midst of the recession, most retail prognosticators couldn't have imagined such a dramatic occupancy rebound in power centers, a concept that emerged in the late 20th century to accommodate big-box or ""category killer"" retailers that sell a group of related goods such as electronics or office supplies in copious amounts of space.
"
935,TJX,"Some major power center tenants including Borders Group, Circuit City and Linens & Things died off. Meanwhile, survivors such as Office Depot (ODP), Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Best Buy (BBY) are generally looking to reduce the number of stores or the size of some stores, or both, as online competitors continue to pressure the formats.
"
936,TJX,"New Things In Store
"
937,TJX,"While that would seem to spell trouble for the hulking power center properties, which range from roughly 250,000 square feet to nearly 1 million, so far it hasn't.
"
938,TJX,"""Looking at the big picture trends, the power center is the product type where you would expect to see the most damage — basically we're in the twilight of the big box,"" Brown said. ""But really what we're seeing is power centers completely adapt.""
"
939,TJX,"Among their other adjustments, power center landlords have shifted their attention to retailers less susceptible to online poaching and more agreeable to occupying a space that may fall short of their preferred specifications, he adds. Landlords are signing TJX Cos.' (TJX) T.J. Maxx, Ross Stores' (ROST) Ross Dress for Less, Five Below (FIVE), Nordstrom (JWN) Rack, and other discount or off-price clothing and soft goods retailers.
"
940,TJX,"Power center owners also are adding more grocers, which like the traffic that national retailers in the centers generate, said Joseph Tichar, senior vice president of corporate operations for Cleveland-based DDR (DDR), a real estate investment trust that owns 117 million square feet of primarily power center space in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Brazil.
"
941,TJX,"Traditional power center anchor tenants Wal-mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have been expanding their grocery offerings into more stores, he said, while specialty grocers like Whole Foods (WFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and Trader Joe's continue to proliferate.
"
942,TJX,"Both groups are taking market share from traditional grocery stores, according to a DDR investor presentation that cited U.S. Census Bureau data.
"
943,TJX,"""The grocery business has been evolving rapidly and competition in that space is fierce,"" DDR's Tichar said. ""Consumers are telling us that they don't need to shop in a traditional neighborhood center to buy groceries.""
"
944,TJX,"Regardless of what type of tenant they're hunting, power center owners are paying particular attention to identifying retailers with strong balance sheets, cash flow and credit — traits that the defunct big boxes too often lacked. To a large extent, those requirements have put the focus on national chains in favor of either local or regional operators, Tichar says.
"
945,TJX,"Power center landlords also are rearranging space to accommodate new tenants or to reduce the footprint of anchor tenants. In Chicago, for example, DDR spent $11.6 million to consolidate several small shops and construct more space in its Brookside Marketplace power center to make room for T.J. Maxx, Ross Dress for Less, Pier 1 Imports (PIR) and Panera Bread (PNRA).
"
946,TJX,"Properties Under Pressure
"
947,TJX,"Despite the rebounding optimism around power centers, the properties still face challenges, notes Suzanne Mulvee, director of retail research for Property Portfolio Research, a subsidiary of commercial real estate information provider CoStar Group (CSGP).
"
948,TJX,"To cut down on overhead, discount retailers generally want rent to represent about 6% of revenues versus the 10% to 12% that more traditional retailers have historically aimed for, she says. Plus, certain power center tenants such as bookstores and electronics sellers still face a rather daunting e-commerce threat.
"
949,TJX,"""I think there's a lot of pressure on the sector,"" she said. ""These tenants are being forced to compete with Amazon (AMZN), and as Amazon increases its speed of delivery to customers, it has the potential to erode market share materially.""
"
950,TJX,"Tichar acknowledges that the changing retailing landscape had pressured power center rents. Typically the REIT aims for tenants to pay a rental rate that reflects about 10% of revenues, on average, across its properties. It's now at about 8%, he says.
"
951,TJX,"Future Of Shopping
"
952,TJX,"Yet a host of retailers and grocery concepts are still in expansion mode and virtually no new power center construction is taking place, he says. So as tenants see their year-over-year sales and market share grow, DDR will have more opportunities to achieve its 10% goal.
"
953,TJX,"Additionally, hundreds of leases at below-market rental rates with weaker retailers are set to expire over the next few years, he adds, and the company is proactively marketing the space to line up better tenants at higher rents. In one example, the company suggests that it could increase rents in 11 Barnes & Noble locations by 25% to 75% when the retailer's leases end in 2016, according to an investor presentation.
"
954,TJX,"""In retail, especially in the power center space, people like to talk about the death of the big box and the fact that there are a lot of retailers that have had to close their doors,"" Tichar said.

955,TJX,"Retailers kicked off the holiday season on a sour note with disappointing November sales gains in reports out Thursday.
"
956,TJX,"Deep discounts throughout the month didn't do much to spark a spending spree, a sign that retailers could be in for some tough sledding as they enter the holiday season's home stretch.
"
957,TJX,"Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts had forecast a 2.9% gain. That was a sharp deceleration from October's 4% increase.
"
958,TJX,"Two of the best-performing retailers over the past five years, Costco Wholesale (COST) and L Brands (LTD), both missed November views. Their results, says Perkins, reflect the tough retail environment that prompted widespread discounting throughout the month, well before the usual Black Friday promotions.
"
959,TJX,"""The overall results were very disappointing,"" said Perkins. ""Santa delivered some early coal to retailers during November and during the Thanksgiving/Black Friday holiday weekend. It says that retailers are in for a real dogfight this holiday season.""
"
960,TJX,"Deep Discounts In Store?
"
961,TJX,"Retailers are going to find it difficult to ""squeeze blood from a stone,"" he adds, given that most consumers don't have excess discretionary dollars to spend.
"
962,TJX,"It means that stores will have to offer 50% off or more to get consumers to spend, Perkins says.
"
963,TJX,"L Brands cited a late Thanksgiving as a major negative. For November the company reported a sales decrease of 5% from October, its first negative monthly comp since October 2009. Analysts had forecast a 1.2% decrease. The parent of Victoria's Secret indicated that it expects December comps to rise in the low- to mid-single digits, Perkins says.
"
964,TJX,"Costco's total company comps, including gasoline sales, were up 2% vs. a year ago, missing views for a 3.5% gain. It was its smallest gain for the giant warehouse club discounter dating back to September 2009. Costco's core U.S. comps, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, came in at a 3% rise, short of forecasts for a 4.5% gain.
"
965,TJX,"Perkins says Costco's showing reflects the ""broader consumer caution out there and their unwillingness and inability to open their purse strings.""
"
966,TJX,"Regional discounter Stein Mart (SMRT), a strong performer of late, was also off its game in November. It posted a 3.1% rise in comps for the month, slightly missing views for a 3.2% rise.
"
967,TJX,"Apparel giant Gap (GPS) gave some cheery news late Thursday when it reported a 2% rise in November comps, well ahead of the 0.7% expected gain. But action-sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ) saw a 1.7% lift, sharply missing forecasts for a 2.8% rise.

968,TJX,"Perkins says the November showing overall ""doesn't bode well for the final stretch"" of the holiday season — it suggests the holiday period will be weaker than expected.

969,TJX,"A Warmer View

970,TJX,"Despite the soft November showing, Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, remains optimistic and is sticking to his November-December holiday forecast.

"
972,TJX,"The economic factors he refers to include a ""strong"" GDP report on Thursday.
"
973,TJX,"Niemira forecasts a gain of 3.4% vs. a year ago in GAFO (general merchandise, apparel and accessories, furniture and other) sales for November-December. That would compare with last year's 3% increase, he says. Niemira calculates November comps for the 12 monthly reporting retailers he tracks came in up 2.1% vs. a year ag o.
"
974,TJX,"He expects December same-store sales growth to come in at 3% to 4%, and says that's conservative and may come in stronger — as this year Cyber Monday sales will be pushed into December while last year that online shopping frenzy occurred in November.
"
975,TJX,"""Cyber Monday would give an even larger lift to December's sales,"" Niemira said.
"
976,TJX,"November's soft showing, Niemira says, raises some questions. One is: ""How representative of the broader industry were the results, especially given the 10.1% gain in November same-store sales J.C. Penney (JCP) reported,"" he said. ""Is J.C. Penney taking market share from other retailers?""

"
978,TJX,"""November same-store sales are very worrisome,"" she said. ""They suggest that consumers are procrastinating and waiting for last-minute deals. They believe that as they approach the holiday the deals will get better. That doesn't bode well for retailers. It's a very promotional environment, and that means they will have to continue to do so.""
"
979,TJX,"Old Stock For New Year
"
980,TJX,"Another concern for Martis: Thursday's revised GDP number ""suggests retailers have high inventory levels,"" she says, which ""speaks to discounting going into January."" So when January arrives and consumers use their gift cards, she adds, they'll do so to buy discounted items vs. full-price items, which might hurt the bottom line.
"
981,TJX,"Thomson Reuters analysts have lowered their November-through-January comp expectation to 1.7% from their month-old 1.8% view. That would be slightly higher than last year's 1.6% rise in comps for the quarter but still below the ""healthy"" level of a 3% gain, Martis says.

1013,TJX,"The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This shift in buying pattern has compelled retailers to come up with innovative ways to market their products. Retailers who have responded quickly to it by staying ahead technologically stand in good stead. Be it department stores, discount retailers, supermarket chains or grocery players, all are in the race of survival of the fittest.A Look at Economic BackdropAmericans are way more confident now, brushing aside recent hiccups like the U.S.-China trade concerns, higher gasoline prices and tightening of monetary policy.Thanks to a robust job market as evident from the fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits and jobless rate hovering at an 18-year low. This along with tax reform and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence, which rose close to 18-year high in May. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy. Per industry experts, second-quarter GDP rate likely to come ahead of 4%.Notably, U.S. retail and food services sales in May advanced 0.8% to $502 billion, following an upwardly revised reading of 0.4% gain in April, per the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, retail sales improved 5.9% from May 2017. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism.How is the Retail-Discount Industry Placed?Pick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. Certainly, this Zacks Retail-Discount Industry has borne the brunt of heightened online competition. Nevertheless, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. However, can technology alone help retailers survive Amazon’s (AMZN) growing dominance in the ultra-competitive retail environment?We believe that unhealthy price competition to gain market share and attract footfall might weigh on the industry’s margins, which occupies a which occupies bottom 24% position in the list of Zacks industries (195 out of 256). Further, rise in costs due to new fulfillment options and incremental wages are the primary headwinds plaguing the industry.However, the recent ruling Supreme Court ruling that allows states to collect sales tax from online purchases even if a company doesn’t have any physical presence in that state may provide some respite to discount retailers, who have been playing dual in-store and online role. But competition will continue to remain stiff going forward and this might hurt profitability.Nevertheless, there are few stocks which have outperformed the industry’s growth of 5.5% in a month.The Three MusketeersBurlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) has made multiple changes to its business model to adapt to the ongoing transformation in the sector. Notably, it has increased vendor counts, made technological advancements and initiated a better marketing approach. These along with effective inventory management and cost containment efforts have helped bolster the gross margin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current fiscal year has increased 2.7% to $6.04 in the past 30 days. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have jumped 11.4% in a month. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ross Stores’ (ROST  -  Free Report) commitment toward better price management, merchandise, cost containment and store expansion plan have been aiding its quarterly performance. The company’s proven off-price business model along with competitive bargains continues to make its stores an attractive destination for customers. Additionally, the company has been committed toward improving merchandise assortments in the ladies’ apparel business in order to boost the top line. These factors collectively underscore the company’s solid potential. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 10.4% in a month’s time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current fiscal year has improved by a penny to $4.05 in the past 30 days.The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) has showcased an impressive run in the bourses, courtesy of its impressive comps record. Comps have been gaining from continued rise in consumer traffic and strength in merchandising policies. These factors along with TJX Companies’ off-price model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products have been driving its stores and online performance. The company also remains focused on its sales-driving efforts, which are expected to help it witness further market share gains. All these bode well for this Zacks Rank #3 stock that has advanced 8% in a month.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Prior to this, management had anticipated earnings to rise 17 to $4.73-$4.83 per share.However, wage increases are still expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2%.

Also, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has comfortably outpaced the S&P 500 and the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector that gained 14.4% and 29.4%, respectively.   While impressive comparable store sales (comps) growth remains TJX Companies’ main growth driver, the company is also gaining from its other strategic initiatives.  Robust Comps Growth TJX Companies has been posting positive comps for quite some time, driven by greater customer traffic that has been rising for 15 straight quarters.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, TJX Companies’ consolidated comps grew 3% year over year, fueled by greater customer traffic at all major segments. Management remains particularly impressed with the performance of Marmaxx and the superb show put up by its home and apparel categories. Notably, all major segments reported higher comps, courtesy of consumers’ favorable response to the company’s brands and impressive merchandise assortments at reasonable prices. Management remains optimistic about fiscal 2019 and remains focused on implementing its sales initiatives to attract traffic. TJX Companies’ stores are also expected to benefit from solid merchandise assortments and brands. That said, management projects comps to grow 1-2% in both the second quarter and fiscal 2019. Aggressive Expansion Efforts The company remains poised on its aggressive expansion strategies. It is regularly opening stores and expanding fast across the United States, Europe and Canada. Keeping with this, TJX Companies added around 71 stores in the first quarter. Now with almost 4,141 stores across nine countries, TJX plans to continue expanding its store base with plans to operate about 6,100 stores in the long term. Further, with increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. Impressive Sales Initiatives TJX Companies’ off-price model, along with its strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products, has been driving its performance, both in stores and online. Also, the company remains committed toward boosting comps growth, through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs. Incidentally, TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at its stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, which is unique among off-price retailers, and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help to improve customer engagement. These factors have been fueling TJX Companies, which has witnessed year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines for a while now. The trend was retained in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, wherein inventories also remained favorable. Markedly, the company’s favorable inventory position is likely to allow it to take advantage of solid opportunities in the market for branded merchandise. Management remains impressed with its consistent rise in customer traffic and is encouraged to witness continued market share gains. Consequently, it raised its fiscal 2019 bottom-line view and now projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $4.04-$4.10, representing a 5-6% increase from the year-ago period. All said, we believe that TJX Companies’ robust sales-driving efforts should continue attracting greater customer traffic and boost comps growth, which remains TJX Companies’ key driver.  Check Out More Promising Stocks Amazon.com Inc.

We note that consolidated inventories on a per-store basis increased 7% (up 6% on a constant-currency basis) year over year during the first quarter. Additionally, TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums have been boosting traffic in its stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program also help to improve customer engagement.An aggressive store-opening strategy has been driving the company’s performance. It is opening stores regularly and is expanding rapidly in the United States, Europe and Canada. While many retailers are resorting to store closures, TJX Companies added around 71 stores in the first quarter. With almost 4,141 stores across nine countries, the company plans to continue expanding its store base, with a long-term target of 6,100 stores. Further, with increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen e-commerce business.Additionally, the company intends to take advantage of solid opportunities in the market for branded merchandise. Undoubtedly, such well-chalked sales boosting initiatives keep management encouraged about delivering a sturdy performance in fiscal 2019. That said, management projects comps to grow 1-2% in fiscal 2019. Backed by such endeavors and expanding brand popularity, which has been fueling overall performance, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 25.1% in the past three months, comfortably surpassing the industry’s rise of 16%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Markedly, TJX Companies is not the only company gaining from comps growth. Other discount retailers such as Burlington Stores, Inc (BURL  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) have benefited from growing store traffic, courtesy of effective merchandising initiatives. Well, such aspects have been aiding these discount stores to fend-off and survive the dominance of online giant — Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Few Hurdles in the WayHigher wages have been an aspect of worry for TJX Companies for a while. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, wage rise dented earnings growth by approximately 2%. Going ahead, higher wages are expected to negatively impact second-quarter and fiscal 2019 earnings by nearly 2%. Apart from this, management expects increased freight costs to weigh on results.Nevertheless, TJX Companies has many reasons to cheer and stay positive on the journey ahead, courtesy of effective strategies to drive store traffic and sales. That said, we expect the company’s strategic initiatives to continue aiding growth and maintain its position in investors’ good books.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1017,TJX,"Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) saw its stock price pop marginally on Wednesday as part of a month-long climb that has seen shares of the off-price clothing retailer surge nearly 6%. Now, let’s see if Ross’ run looks poised to continue by taking a quick look at its first-quarter earnings outlook.Over the last year, shares of Ross have surged nearly 33%, outpacing its industry’s climb of roughly 23%—which includes the likes of Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) and TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report). Ross also crushed the S&P 500’s 13.4% climb.With that said, Ross stock could stall if the company reports lower-than-expected first quarter financial results Thursday. Ross might be under even more pressure since fellow brick-and-mortar retailers Macy’s (M), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have all reported their Q1 earnings, with mixed results. This means investors need to pay close attention to Ross’ most up-to-date top and bottom line estimates.Q1 OutlookRoss is projected to report quarterly revenues of $3.53 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. This would mark a 6.9% climb from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to soar by 29.27% to reach $1.06 per share.However, investors also need to understand what chance Ross has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price keep on moving upward, while a miss could lead to a decline—at least in the near-term.  Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Heading into Thursday, Ross’ Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—called for earnings of $1.07 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Ross is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 1.17%, meaning investors can consider ROST a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday.  Investors should also note that Ross has topped quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing 15 quarters.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1018,TJX,"Shares of Target (TGT  -  Free Report) tumbled over 5.5% on Wednesday after the retail giant reported lower-than-expected first quarter earnings. This seems like a bit of an overreaction, which means investors might want to take a look at Target’s current growth outlook and other fundamentals to see if they should consider buying Target stock.First QuarterTarget’s adjusted first-quarter earnings climbed roughly 9.4% to touch $1.32 per share, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38. Meanwhile, Target’s Q1 revenues jumped 3.4% to $16.78 billion, topping our estimate of $16.53 billion.The big-box retailer’s digital sales surged 28%, while overall traffic popped 3.7%. This growth helped comp sales pop 3%. Target’s comp growth looks even better compared to rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), which saw its U.S. comp sales grow 2.1%, with comp traffic up just 0.8%.Overall, Target investors should be pleased with this top line expansion and same-store sales growth because this is what will matter in the long run as the company invests heavily in its future.Business InitiativesTarget’s bottom line was negatively impacted by an array of new growth initiatives that it undertook to adapt to changing shopping patterns and compete against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers. Target remodeled 56 stores and opened seven new locations, and that's just the start.On top of rolling out three new brands, Target introduced its online ordering, curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” in more than 250 stores. The company also expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, allowing customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery. Lastly, Target introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations.Some of these moves are part of Target’s $7 billion reinvestment plan, which currently runs through 2020, to update stores and open smaller locations in urban markets.OutlookMoving on, Target now projects its comparable store sales will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range. The company also expects to report adjusted Q2 earnings between $1.30 and $1.50 per share. This high-side projection comes in well above our current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 per share, which marks a nearly 9% climb from the year-ago period.Looking ahead to the current full-year, our estimates are calling for Target’s revenues to hit $72.7 billion, representing a 1.2% climb. Meanwhile, Target’s earnings are projected to surge by over 12% to $5.29 per share. With all that said, let’s move on to Target’s recent price performance, before we take a look at what kind of value the stock presents at the moment.Price MovementComing into Wednesday, shares of Target had climbed roughly 31% over the last year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% surge. Target stock has also outperformed its industry’s 23% gain, which includes the likes of Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report), TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report), and others. Year to date, shares of Target have also performed above its industry’s average.Investors will also see that Target stock has crushed Walmart’s performance over the last year. Furthermore, spurred by Wednesday’s decline, Target stock currently rests almost 10% below its 52-week high.ValuationLastly, Target stock is currently trading at 14.2X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant discount compared to the broader, nonfood retail-wholesale market industry’s 27.2X. Target stock is also trading well below its industry’s 18.1X.Over the last 5 years, Target stock has traded as high 20.1X, as low as 10.9X, and at a 5-year median of 14.3X.Therefore, investors can say with some confidence that Target stock appears relatively attractive at its current level, especially considering how it stands against its peers and rival Walmart, which is currently trading at 16.9X.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1020,TJX,"Retail REIT, Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) announced the groundbreaking at Dania Pointe’s Phase 1 retail part. Encouragingly, this project in Southern Broward County, FL, has grabbed much attention and its Phase 1 is already around 80% preleased to a number of national and regional retailers.Slated to open for the 2018 holiday season, Phase 1 consists of 300,000 square feet of retail space. It will enjoy presence of popular brands like TJ Maxx of The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report), Hobby Lobby, BrandsMart, as well as several restaurants.The move is a solid step toward the realization of the broader mixed-used project – Dania Pointe. Upon completion, Dania Pointe will become an open-air lifestyle community, with around 1 million square feet of retail and restaurants space, complemented by up to 500,000 square feet of Class A office space, 1,000 luxury rental apartments and condominiums, and two signature hotels.Situated just next to I-95, this property will serve as the central location for residents going north and south on I-95, as well as east and west on I-595. Moreover, it is situated less than 10 minutes from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades. Also, the site is only 20 minutes from upscale communities of Weston and Plantation to the west, Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach to the north, and Hollywood and North Miami Beach to the south. This makes the property easily accessible to tourists and tri-county residents.Mixed-use DevelopmentsNotably, mixed-use developments have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character, greater housing variety and density. These developments bring down the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable the companies to grab the attention of people, who prefer to live, work and play in the same area – a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U.S.In addition to Kimco, Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) is exploring the positives of mixed-use developments. The company announced a new mixed-use ground-up development – Mellody Farm – in Vernon Hills, IL, in Apr 2017.In ConclusionKimco’s premium properties in high-growth areas, presence of well-capitalized retailers in its tenant roster, investments in high-quality neighborhood and community shopping centers, and shedding of non-core assets augur well for growth. However, rising online sales, store closures, tenant bankruptcy and earnings dilution, led by high disposition activity, remain causes of concern.Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, year to date, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, shares of Kimco underperformed the industry it belongs to.

1021,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 15, before the opening bell. This leading off-price retailer’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ten straight quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of 4.1%.With this in mind, let’s now look into some factors that are likely to impact second-quarter results.Which Way are Estimates Treading?A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as well as for 2018 has been stable over the past 30 days at 84 cents and $3.88, respectively. Further, estimated earnings for fiscal 2018 depict a year-on-year growth of 9.9%.  The same for the second quarter depict a growth of 2.4% from the prior-year period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8.32 billion for the said quarter, depicting a 5.6% growth from the prior-year period. Also, revenues for fiscal 2018 are expected to increase 7.3% to $35.59 billion. What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that TJX Companies is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as well as a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TJX Companies has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 84 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteFactors Influencing the Quarter TJX Companies expects pre-tax margins to remain under pressure for the next few quarters due to an increase in employee payroll. The company announced a wage hike of all full- and part-time hourly U.S. store associates during the fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 conference call, which is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2018 earnings. Further, the company expects incremental investments, additional supply chain costs and pension costs to dent margins in the coming quarters.             Margins of the company are also seen to be facing the crunches of rising product costs. TJX Companies, being an off-price retailer, cannot increase the price of its products, which leads to lower margins. Moreover, lack of exposure in the emerging markets as well as currency related headwinds continue to pose as challenges for the company.Such aspects have been bearing brunt on the company’s share price performance. Over the past six months, shares of TJX Companies have declined 7.2%, comparing unfavorably with the Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 12.9%.Nevertheless, we are optimistic about TJX Companies’ business expansion initiatives, which include aggressive store opening strategies. The company has been opening stores regularly and expanding rapidly across the U.S., Europe and Canada. Dedicated marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums have been boosting traffic at its stores. Notably, TJX Companies has delivered positive comparable store sales growth in the past 32 quarters. The company has been undertaking numerous initiatives to boost online sales. We expect that the company’s strategic efforts would aid lifting up its performance in the forthcoming periods.Do Retail Stocks Catch your Attention?

Both Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) are leading off-price retailers that offer name-brand apparel and home goods, but most importantly, they both know their customers, and have adapted to meet the demands of their core base over the years.The losers this season also have some shared characteristics. Staples  and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report) operate within troubled businesses, both of which have suffered tremendously against the rise of e-commerce.How will these predictions stand up? We’ll just have to wait and see. ROST, TJX, and SPLS are all expected to report later this month, while BBBY is not reporting until September.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

1023,TJX,"Retail REIT Kite Realty Group Trust (KRG  -  Free Report) has announced the opening of Nordstrom Rack at Portofino Shopping Center in Houston, TX (MSA). The move is aimed at enhancing shoppers’ experience at this property with high-quality merchandising mix.Specifically, with the occupation of 27,252 square feet of space at this shopping center, Nordstrom Rack joins the cohort of several existing anchors like T.J. Maxx of The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), DSW Inc. (DSW  -  Free Report), Old Navy of Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and others.Notably, the Portofino Shopping Center, which is located 30 miles north of downtown Houston in the suburban community of Shenandoah, comes under Kite Realty’s Redevelopment, Repurpose and Reposition (3-R) initiative. The property is slated to benefit from the recent addition of the 13,000 square feet of space which resulted from the construction of two new stand-alone buildings.With the addition of Nordstrom Rack, the above-mentioned property becomes well poised to draw decent traffic from its affluent neighborhood. In fact, it is close to The Woodlands which has occupied a place in the Top 50 Best Selling Master Planned Communities in the nation.However, retail REITs have been suffering as mall traffic continues to shrink amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference to e-retail, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Such an environment has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified. In addition, when there are substantial store closures in the middle of the lease term, not only are mall landlords hurt but tenants occupying space in the mall are equally affected because their shop visits depend on the mix of specific types of retailers.Retail REITs are countering these challenges and making concerted efforts to give their properties a facelift through redevelopment, repositioning and improving merchandising mix in an attempt to attract customers. Nevertheless, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and is hence likely to limit growth in the profit margins of retail REITs in the near term.Kite Realty is also likely to feel the brunt in the near future. In fact, in the past three months, its shares have declined 23.3% which is wider than its industry’s descend of 10.9%. Currently the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Did it keep up the momentum in the last holiday quarter?3.    L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) has struggled as its premier brand, Pink, has slowly gotten off trend.

In fact, other off-price retailers, such as Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report), have also been deriving strength from efficient merchandising policies.Moreover, the company’s sales-driving efforts are supported by an aggressive store opening strategy. TJX Companies opened around 258 stores during fiscal 2018. With almost 4070 stores across nine countries, the company plans to continue expanding its store base. It projects to open approximately 600 stores in the long term. Like TJX Companies, Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) — a major discount-retailer — has also been undertaking store-expansion initiatives to bolster sales.Additionally, with an increasing number of consumers opting for online shopping, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. The company’s strategic prices combined with effective offers, in-store return policies as well as marketing and advertising campaigns have bolstered online and store businesses considerably.Considering such well-chalked strategies, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2019 sales is pegged at $8,503 million, reflecting 9.2% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales across Homegoods, Marmaxx, TJX Canada and TJX Europe to advance 15%, 4.3%, 15.2% and 20.4% respectively, on a year-on-year basis for the first quarter.Earnings Front for Q1 Looks PositiveRobust endeavors to drive sales combined with benefits from tax reforms led management to provide an upbeat earnings view for the first quarter.

1031,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $66.66 on Jul 24, closing at $66.90. Declining pre-tax margins, lack of exposure in the emerging markets and currency headwinds have been creating challenges for the company of late. The impact of such factors is visible on the company’s share price performance. Shares of TJX Companies have declined 15.2% in the last three months compared with the broader Retail-Wholesale sector’s gain of 3.5%.Let’s now take a closer look at some of the challenges that TJX Companies has been dealing with.Wage Hike and Higher Costs TJX Companies announced a wage hike for all full and part-time hourly U.S. store associates. The hike led to a rise in selling, general and administrative costs during the first quarter of 2018. Higher wages are expected to keep pre-tax margins under pressure for the next few quarters. In fact, it is expected to affect fiscal 2018 earnings by 2%. Further, the company expects incremental investments, additional supply chain costs and pension costs to pressurize margins in the coming quarters.Moreover, being an off-price retailer, TJX Companies cannot increase the price of its products despite rising product cost. This consequently leads to lower margins.Other Headwinds TJX remains exposed to unfavorable foreign currency translations owing to a considerable international presence. Currency headwinds dented sales by two percentage points during the first quarter of 2018. Unfavorable currency translations are expected to hurt results in the near term.Although the company is well placed internationally, it does not have any presence in developing markets which deprives the company of benefits from high growth opportunities in developing nations.Bottom-LineWe are optimistic about TJX Companies business expansion initiatives which include aggressive store opening strategies and plans to add more categories to the online shopping site. Its brand enhancing plans in the form of product innovation and marketing campaigns are also appealing. While these efforts are expected to boost store traffic, we are cautious about the challenges which may dent the company’s performance in the near term.Given the mixed pros and cons, TJX Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for Better Stocks in the Retail Space?

1032,TJX,"We expect The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 21. In the preceding quarter, this producer and seller of alcohol beverages delivered a positive earnings surprise of 51.1%.A look at the company’s earnings trend shows that Boston Beer has delivered a positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 63.4%. Unsurprisingly, investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Boston Beer surpasses earnings estimate.Which Way are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share for the fourth quarter has remained stable over the last 30 days. However, the estimate reflects a decline of about 46.3% from $1.75 per share earned in the year-ago quarter. Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Quote Analysts polled by Zacks expect fourth-quarter revenues to be $208.2 million, down 5.1% year over year.Factors at PlayBoston Beer is banking on its three-point growth-plan focused on the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives and long-term innovation to lift performance. The company's focus on pricing, packaging and product innovation, along with brand development, are also likely to boost its operational performance and market position.Moreover, the company’s brand-building efforts and initiatives to add new products remain key revenue drivers. Boston Beer strongly believes in reinvesting its profits toward capital expenditures than distributing the same to shareholders. The company has always been seeking strategic opportunities to expand its business through inorganic means, which, we believe, will certainly help it capture considerable market share from rivals.Given the sturdy results in the preceding quarter, the company raised the lower-end of its previously stated earnings guidance range for fourth-quarter 2017. Boston Beer now anticipates its adjusted earnings per share in the band of $5.60 to $6.20, compared with $5.00 to $6.20 projected earlier.These factors led the company’s shares to surge 13.7% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 0.8%.  However, soft depletion trends have been a cause of worry for Boston Beer for quite some time now. This softness in depletion volumes mainly stems from the weakness in Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands as well as the soft craft beer and cider categories. Additionally, persistent challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop can’t be ignored. Per the company, depletion trends are likely to be soft throughout 2017.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model shows that Boston Beer is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Earnings ESP of +29.18% and the company’s Zacks Rank #1 make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1036,TJX,"While many retailers have been ailing under soft traffic stemming from intense competition and rising consumer preference for online shopping, The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) has been defying such industry trends and witnessing growth in its store traffic. Well, the company’s impressive merchandising policies and other sales-driving efforts have been benefiting its comparable store sales (comps), thereby driving the top-line performance.However, the company has been incurring high wage costs for quite some time now and also expects the same to hurt its bottom-line growth in fiscal 2019. It looks like these factors have kept investors somewhat cautious about the stock. Evidently, shares of this leading off-price retailer have gained only 4.1% in the past year, as against the industry’s growth of 16.5%.  So, let’s analyze both sides of the story and see if this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s endeavors can counter its ongoing hurdles. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereEffective Merchandising and Marketing Efforts Boost TrafficTJX Companies’ comps have been gaining from consumers’ favorable response to the company’s brands and impressive merchandise assortments at reasonable prices. Moreover, strong merchandise margins reflect the company’s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off-price business model. In fact, other off-price retailers, such as Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report), have also been deriving much strength from efficient merchandising policies.TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns have also been driving traffic at its stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program also help improve customer engagement.Driven by such efforts, TJX Companies witnessed growth of 4% in comps, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the 3% rise in the year-ago quarter. These factors, combined with favorable currency translations, helped net sales to advance nearly 15.8% year over year during the fiscal fourth quarter.Further, management stated that it remains optimistic about comps growth in fiscal 2019 and will continue to focus on implementing sales-driving efforts to attract traffic. Management hopes that stores will benefit from solid merchandise assortment and brands. Accordingly, comps are expected to grow 1-2% in fiscal 2019, while an improvement of 1-2% is expected in the first quarter.Store & E-commerce ExpansionIn an effort to sustain the sturdy comps performance, TJX Companies also resorts to frequent store openings, and has been expanding at a rapid pace across the United States, Europe and Canada. It opened around 258 stores during fiscal 2018. Now, with almost 4070 stores across nine countries, TJX Companies intends to continue expanding its store base, with plans to open approximately 600 stores over the long term. The company is aimed at opening approximately 400 Homesense stores in the United States in the forthcoming period. In respect of TJX Canada, the company foresees opportunities to expand into rural areas. Management is impressed with the steady progress of its business across Europe, enabling it to continue as one of the major off-price retailers in the region. Like TJX Companies, Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report), a major discount-retailer, has also been undertaking store-expansion initiatives to bolster sales.Additionally, with increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to strengthen its e-commerce business. The company’s strategic prices, combined with effective offers and in-store return policies, have aided boosting its online business considerably.Can Efforts Offset Wage Woes?TJX Companies has been bearing the brunt of rising wage costs for a while. During the fiscal fourth quarter, wage rise dented TJX Companies’ earnings by approximately 1%. In fact, the company expects pre-tax margins to remain under pressure for the next few quarters due to an increase in employee payroll.Though rising wage costs remain a concern, TJX Companies has nevertheless many reasons to cheer and remains positive on its journey ahead, courtesy of its effective strategies to drive store traffic and sales. Encouragingly, the company’s strong fundamentals have also led management to provide a positive outlook for fiscal 2019. That said, we expect the company’s strategic initiatives to continue aiding growth and also enhance investor sentiments, in the forthcoming periods.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1037,TJX,"We saw a market sell-off in the Dow yesterday, due in part to an earnings miss for Walmart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) Q4 2018. Shares of the world’s biggest retailer sold off nearly 10% yesterday; the Dow 30 was down 1% overall.Though Walmart missed earnings estimates by 3 cents per share, the company beat on the top-line, and saw growth in comps (for the 14th straight quarter), and store traffic and storage were both up year over year. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company did lower the bottom end of its full-year guidance, but there is not much justification for a 10% sell-off in the shares, in our view.That is unless you consider that the gains Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) have made in the retail space — obviously, mostly online but now increasing its presence in the big-box space with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Three weeks ago, Amazon posted blowout Q4 results with a 143% positive earnings surprise, with net sales up 38% year over year. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also saw 19% online retail growth for full-year 2017.Basically, the question that arises here is: Does Amazon’s gain necessarily equate Walmart’s loss?Based on our current Zacks Ranks for both companies, we would argue that it does not. Walmart, despite its Q4 difficulties — which, by the way, many analysts had predicted — has continued to grow its online business even as Amazon has continued to power ahead. Walmart also seems to have plenty of faith in its CEO Doug McMillion, who recently celebrated his 4th anniversary as the head of the company. In short, those who understand Walmart best are those who tend to see the least problems with the company.We therefore see the current sell-off in WMT shares as somewhat of a buying opportunity. That said, we also have a slew of Zacks Rank #2 retail companies we cover at this time, including Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report), TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report). As we enter the thick of retail earnings season, we anticipate strength from the companies on our list yet to report.

1040,TJX,"Return on equity is one of the most sought-after metrics for an investment. The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit-churner and a profit-burner. It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity.To shortlist these gems, one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze the basic ROE at an advanced level. Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierImportance of Du PontAlthough one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks.

1041,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) has been underperforming the industry for a while. The company’s shares have gained 10.3% in the past six months compared with its industry’s rally of 24.3%. TJX Companies’ performance has been sidelined due to dismal comps and persistent struggle against higher wages.We note that higher wages dented the company’s bottom-line growth by 1% during third-quarter fiscal 2018, with its pre-tax margin declining 10 basis points. Wage hikes are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018. Further, during the third quarter, the company reported flat comps against 5% growth recorded in the year-ago quarter. In fact, this also broke the company’s long trend of delivering positive comps growth. Management stated that adverse weather conditions combined with soft demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division, were largely responsible for weak store sales.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been undertaking several initiatives to boost sales and offset ongoing hurdles.Strategies to Boost Brick-and-Mortar and Online SalesWith an effort to revive comps, TJX Companies has been resorting to aggressive store openings. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking the total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Also, management is encouraged by the initial response to the recently opened 3 HomeSense outlets in the United States and its first TK Maxx outlet in Australia. Notably, the company plans to take the store count to 5,600 in the long term along with approximately 260 stores scheduled for opening in fiscal 2018. In North America, TJX Companies plans to add more than 1,400 stores in the long term, with plans to double Marmaxx’s U.S. count. The company is focused on expanding HomeGoods chain to at least 1,000 stores.Alongside inducing growth in the brick-and-mortar front, TJX Companies has also been undertaking measures to improve performance in the e-commerce arena. The company plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores. The company has also been recruiting experienced internet management team to encourage greater efficiency and boost online sales.  Other Noteworthy Initiatives  TJX Companies’ dedicated marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums are also encouraging and are expected to boost sales. Further, its gift-giving initiatives, which is unique among off-price retailers, and loyalty card program are expected to improve customer engagement. The company’s sales enhancing initiatives also include introducing products through innovation.TJX Companies’ inventory management initiatives are quite noteworthy. In fact, the company’s off-price business model derives much retail strength from disciplined inventory management. Driven by these efforts, consolidated inventories per store were down 4% on a currency-neutral basis, at the end of the third quarter. Further, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with solid inventory position and other sales-driving.All said, we expect that investors will show greater optimism in the stock in the upcoming periods, which will aid a revival in stock price in 2018.Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

1042,TJX,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.TJX Companies Q3 Earnings & Sales Up Y/Y, Comps FlatTJX Companies reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the company’s earnings of $1.00 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also met the higher end of management’s guidance range. Further, the bottom line grew 10% from adjusted earnings of 91 cents in the year-ago period. Notably, currency translations had a 4 cents positive impact on earnings per share.Net sales advanced 6% year over year to $8,786.2 million, backed by improved traffic. Also, currency translations benefited consolidated net sales growth by 1%. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,876 million.TJX Companies' consolidated comps remained flat year over year, in comparison with 3% rise witnessed in the preceding quarter. Results were affected by hurricanes, with demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division also being hurt by warm temperatures in the United States. Nonetheless, trends at the division improved eventually as weather normalized. Further, the company witnessed greater traffic and transactions at all major segments.Segment-wise, comps rose 3%, 4% and 1% respectively, in HomeGoods, TJX Canada and TJX International segments. On the contrary, comps slipped 1% at Marmaxx.     Gross margin expanded 0.3 percentage points to 29.8%, thanks to gains from inventory hedges and enhanced merchandise margins. This was partly offset by greater supply chain expenses and expense deleverage on flat comps.However, selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.5 pp to 18.1% due to increase in wages and costs associated with hurricanes. TJX Companies' consolidated pre-tax profit margin dipped 0.1 pp (from adjusted pre-tax margin) to 11.6% of sales. High wages have been a hurdle for the company for a while now. Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,364.2 million, long-term debt of $2,229.8 million and total shareholders’ equity of $4,645.6 million. Cash flow from operations for the first three quarters of the fiscal was $1,929.4 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased 4.9 million shares for $350 million and paid dividends worth $197 million. For fiscal 2018, the company still expects to repurchase shares worth approximately $1.5-$1.8 billion.During the quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total store count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017.Q4 GuidanceTJX Companies remains encouraged about the fourth quarter, courtesy of the solid holiday season opportunities. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings (excluding a nearly 11 cents benefit from an additional week in the quarter) in the range of $1.14-$1.16 per share, reflecting 11-13% increase from the year-ago period earnings. Wage increases are expected to hurt bottom line growth by 1%, while currency is likely to positively impact earnings growth by 1%. The company expects consolidated comps growth of 1-2% in the fourth quarter.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, TJX Companies raised the lower end of its earnings guidance. The company now projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.80-$3.82, compared with the prior range of $3.78-$3.82. The adjusted guidance (excluding benefit of 11 cents from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018) will represent an 8% increase from the year-ago period earnings. While wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2%, the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation will positively impact earnings growth by 1%. Also, currency is likely to have a 1% positive impact on fiscal 2018 bottom-line growth. Comps are still expected to grow 1-2% for fiscal 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release and in the last month, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates.

Both these factors have helped TJX companies attract solid consumer traffic, which has been aiding its performance for a while now.However, the company has been incurring high wage costs for quite some time now and also expects it hurt bottom-line growth in fiscal 2018. It looks like these headwinds have dented the company’s stock performance. Evidently, shares of this leading off-price retailer have lost 4.6% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 6%.  So, let’s analyze both sides of the story and see if the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth drivers can combat these hurdles and continue to fuel results.Strategic Initiatives to Boost SalesTJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help the company to improve customer engagement. Further, the company remains focused on innovation and has been introducing new products to drive sales. Incidentally, the company’s newly launched U.S. home concept, HomeSense, will offer consumers a different mix of home fashions from HomeGoods at good value.Focus on E-Commerce & Stores ExpansionWith consumers’ changing shopping patterns, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales by recruiting an experienced internet management team. The company’s official website tjmaxx.com, accessible from tablets and smartphones, appeals to the young generation — the company’s main target consumers. TJX plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores. However, TJX Companies also remains committed to its solid store opening strategy. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Notably, TJX plans to take the store count to 5,600 over the long term, with plans to open approximately 260 stores in fiscal 2018.While many retailers are struggling with soft traffic, TJX Companies’ off-price model and aforementioned sales driving efforts help it draw considerable traffic. Another retailer which is benefiting from an off-price model is Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report), which boasts a solid top-line growth trend.Q3 Retails Solid TrendComing back to TJX Companies, the company has been witnessing year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines for over a year now. Notably, this trend was retained in third-quarter fiscal 2018 despite the adverse impact from hurricanes. The top-line growth can be largely attributable to solid customer traffic, which is backed by the company’s impressive merchandise mix, along with the other sales-driving efforts. Further, strong merchandise margins reflect the company’s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off-price business model. Further, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with its solid inventory position and other sales-driving efforts keeping it well placed for the holiday season.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat’s Weighing on TJX Companies?TJX Companies has been reeling under high wage costs for a while now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018 higher wages dented the company’s bottom line growth by 1%, with its pre-tax margin going down by 10 basis points. Also, selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, inched up 0.5 pp to 18.1% due to increase in wages and costs associated with hurricanes. Unfortunately, wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018.The company also posted flat comparable store sales in the quarter, with results being affected by hurricanes, with demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division also being hurt by warm temperatures in the United States. Nonetheless, trends at the division improved eventually as weather normalized, keeping it well placed for the fourth quarter.Thus, we believe that TJX Companies strategic initiatives are most likely to offset the barriers and continue the growth story of this company with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.6%.Looking for More?

1097,TJX,"Big moves from giants such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) helped lift the market and boost investor confidence on Monday.But despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding nearly 400 points and the S&P 500 climbing over 1.18%, investors shouldn’t assume that the recent extended sell-off is completely over. This means investors should remain aware of the most recent analyst sentiment, and as always, focus on stocks that are likely to top earnings estimates.Finding stocks that beat analysts’ expectations is a great and proven way to beat the market. With that in mind, one way for investors to try to make solid returns—especially during somewhat volatile times—is to pick stocks expected to beat earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.With all of this said, we are giving our readers a free look at five strong stocks in order to help them identify a handful of companies that seem ready to top earnings estimates this week.1.      Builders FirstSource, Inc.

1098,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 28. While the company posted in-line earnings in the last quarter, the off-price retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2% in the trailing four quarters. The company has been gaining from its robust efforts to attract traffic and drive sales, which have also helped it overcome hurdles related to escalated wage costs.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Let’s see what’s in store this time.Factors Driving the QuarterTJX Companies has been witnessing year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines for over a year now. Notably, the top-line growth can be largely attributed to solid customer traffic, which is backed by the company’s impressive merchandise mix, along with the other sales-driving efforts. Further, strong merchandise margins reflect the company’s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off-price business model.Among the company’s sales driving efforts, we commend its focus on store expansion, e-commerce as well as marketing initiatives. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Also, management remains encouraged by the initial response to its recently opened 3 HomeSense outlets in the United States and its first TK Maxx outlet in Australia. TJX Companies has also undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales by recruiting an experienced internet management team. The company’s e-commerce business Sierra Trading Post is also working toward growing its business. Moreover, TJX’s official website tjmaxx.com, accessible from tablets and smartphones, appeals to the young generation — the company’s main target consumers. TJX Companies plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores.Further, TJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help the company to improve customer engagement. Further, in order to encourage more frequent visits and cross-shopping of brands, the company is expanding its loyalty programs in the U.S. and Canada. Together, these factors are likely to drive the company in the fourth quarter. Incidentally, during its third-quarter conference call, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with a solid inventory position and other sales-driving efforts keeping it well placed for the holiday season.Increased Costs Pose ConcernsHigh wage costs have been a hurdle for TJX Companies for a while now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, higher wages dented the company’s bottom line growth by 1%, with its pre-tax margin going down by 10 basis points. Further, wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018, which also remains a threat to the upcoming results.Final Thoughts & Q4 ExpectationsNevertheless, TJX Companies’ robust sales-boosting initiatives are likely to help the company overcome these hurdles and fuel growth. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings (excluding a nearly 11 cents benefit from an additional week in the quarter) in the range of $1.14-$1.16 per share, reflecting 11-13% increase from the year-ago period earnings. Wage increases are expected to hurt bottom-line growth by 1%, while currency is likely to positively impact earnings growth by 1%. The company expects consolidated comps growth of 1-2% in the fourth quarter.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.28, which shows a 24.3% surge from $1.03 recorded in the year-ago period. In fact, the company’s earnings estimate was revised upward in the last seven days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $10,821 million, up 14.3% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that TJX Companies is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Well, TJX Companies Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +2.52% makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies that possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.28% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

1125,TJX,"When the stock market began to tumble in late July, many investors swiftly gave up on equities and ran to the relative safety of U.S. Treasuries. But the paltry 2.1% yield on the 10-year T-note doesn't provide much comfort.
"
1126,TJX,"The recent market weakness and heightened risk of another recession isn't a reason to dump equities altogether, however.
"
1127,TJX,"Attractive Yields
"
1128,TJX,"For investors with a long-term time horizon, stocks look pretty attractive right now. The yield on the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 3.2%, and the earnings yield (inverse of the P/E ratio) on the S&P 500 is an attractive 8.4%.
"
1129,TJX,"While recent economic data has been weak and the odds of a recession have risen, there is still a good chance we're just facing sluggish economic growth for the next couple of quarters. If this is the case, these metrics point to plenty of upside for stocks.
"
1130,TJX,"Moreover, investors should realize that not all stocks will get beaten up if we do enter a recession.
"
1131,TJX,"Value is the Best Defense
"
1132,TJX,"Studies have shown that the best protection against the loss of capital in a down market isn't earnings growth but rather valuation. Those former high-flying stocks with irrationally high P/E ratios will get hit the hardest, no matter what their growth forecasts are. Stocks with low double-digit or single-digit P/E ratios, on the other hand, have much less downside risk.
"
1133,TJX,"Stocks That Bucked the Trend in 2008
"
1134,TJX,"Investors may be surprised to learn that there were 30 stocks in the S&P 500 that finished in the green in 2008. Granted, many were bought out earlier that year, and a few were biotechs with hit products. But take a look at some of the other top performers from '08:
"
1135,TJX,"Family Dollar Stores (FDO): +36%Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report): +18%AutoZone (AZO): +16%Hasbro (HAS): +14%General Mills (GIS): +7%McDonald's (MCD): +6%Waste Management (WM): +1%
"
1136,TJX,"Most of these are value-oriented retailers or consumer staples that were trading at reasonable prices before the crash.
"
1137,TJX,"But it's not just about value. Once a bull market resumes, investors want to own stocks with earnings growth potential so they don't miss out on the upside. The key is to find those stocks that offer both growth and value.
"
1138,TJX,"Stocks Bucking the Trend in 2011
"
1139,TJX,"The 14% drop in the S&P 500 since July 22 has sent shares of a lot of good companies lower, but it hasn't sunk all stocks.
"
1140,TJX,"Here is a list of value stocks that have held up quite well so far. They also each have strong earnings growth potential and should rise along with the market when it rebounds:

"
1143,TJX,"12-Month Forward P/E: 12.5
"
1144,TJX,"This off-price retailer thrived during the Great Recession as middle-income consumers went bargain shopping. As the economy began to recover, the customers never left. The company continues to churn out positive same-store sales growth with the unemployment rate north of 9%.
"
1145,TJX,"Earnings estimates have been rising consistently over the last few months, sending the stock to a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). Based on current consensus estimates, analysts expect 14% EPS growth this year and 12% growth next year.
"
1146,TJX,"Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report)
"
1147,TJX,"Price Change Since July 22: +4%
"
1148,TJX,"12-Month Forward P/E: 11.2
"
1149,TJX,"Advance Auto Parts has held up strong in the weak market, much like it did in 2008. The auto parts retailer continues to benefit from customers holding onto their cars longer and repairing them rather than replacing them.
"
1150,TJX,"Analysts are currently projecting 19% EPS growth from AAP in 2011 and 14% growth in 2012. Despite this, shares trade at just 11.2x forward earnings, a discount to its 10-year historical median of 14.4x.
"
1151,TJX,"Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)
"
1152,TJX,"Price Change Since July 22: -3%
"
1153,TJX,"12-Month Forward P/E: 11.1
"
1154,TJX,"Wal-Mart is another retailer that has held up well despite the carnage on Wall Street. The stock was one of few to thrive in 2008 too.
"
1155,TJX,"People may think Wal-Mart has no growth prospects left. Analysts disagree. Based on consensus estimates, analysts project 10% EPS growth this year and 9% growth next year. On top of this growth, the company pays a dividend that yields a solid 2.8%.
"

"
1157,TJX,"Price Change Since July 22: -2%
"
1158,TJX,"12-Month Forward P/E: 8.5
"
1159,TJX,"Schweitzer-Mauduit International Inc. produces premium specialty papers primarily for the tobacco industry. This is certainly a defensive industry, but the company has excellent growth prospects too. 
"
1160,TJX,"Analysts are projecting 22% EPS growth in 2011 and 29% growth in 2012. Estimates have risen significantly since the company delivered solid second quarter results on August 3. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
1161,TJX,"The Bottom Line
"
1162,TJX,"If you're worried about further stock market declines, think twice before exiting equities altogether. These value stocks have all held up well so far, and their growth potential provides plenty of upside if the market turns back around.

1164,TJX,"Conn's, Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 5. The company has posted earnings beat for six straight quarters now, with an impressive trailing four-quarter average of 493.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 49 cents, which remained stable in the last 30 days. However, the estimate reflects significant growth from 5 cents in the year-ago quarter. Conn's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Conn's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Conn's, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayConn's has been gaining from its unique retail business model, which has also helped the company to deliver solid retail gross margins in recent quarters. The expansion in the segment’s margins can be attributed to favorable mix across product categories as well as lower warehouse, delivery, and transportation expenses.In addition, the company remains focused on undertaking strategic initiatives to solidify its credit division. Also, management is optimistic about growth in the credit platform on the improved credit trends. Meanwhile, the company’s store-expansion efforts are impressive as it intends to introduce five to nine new stores, thus leveraging the current infrastructure. Moreover, Conn's transformation plan bodes well, positioning it for sustainable growth in future.However, Conn’s top line remains soft, as it has lagged sales estimates in four of the last six quarters. Furthermore, same store sales are expected to decline in mid-single digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $428.7 million, down nearly 1% from the year-ago quarter.Given the mixed factors, let’s wait and see if Conn’s can maintain its positive earnings streak in the to-be-reported quarter as well.What Does the Zacks Model Show?Our proven model does not show that Conn's is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter.

1165,TJX,"Tuesday, November 14, 2017Regular day trading Monday fought back from pre-market declines to finish slightly in the green, as softness in Asian markets look to be providing a gentle headwind on Western markets again this morning. Futures are again in the red, as forecasts for China’s economy expect it to slow in Q4. This is somewhat offset by better-than-expected GDP in Germany: +0.8% from the +0.6% analysts were looking for, on slightly stronger exports and capital investments.The main piece of econ data here at home this morning is the monthly Producer Price Index (PPI), which came in hotter than we were expecting for October: +0.4% versus the +0.1% consensus, with the ex-food & energy read also at 0.4% (+0.2% was expected). The headline also matched September’s 0.4%; year over year we see +2.8% — the best year-over-year PPI read since 2011.These numbers help illustrate the continued slow seep of inflation into the economy, as well as the fact that hurricane effects continue to roll off the data. It’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out later, that will help the Fed solidify its rate increase plans for its December FOMC meeting (or not). The CPI not only gives a good indication of inflation metrics month by month, but also gives insight into consumers’ coping mechanisms with higher (or lower) prices.Q3 Earnings RundownZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) posted a typical positive earnings surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: earnings of $1.84 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $25.03 billion easily surpassed the $24.52 billion we had been looking for. This is at least the fifth straight earnings beat for Home Depot, whose trailing 4-quarter average was +3.8%.Home Depot also upped its full-year guidance from estimates, and expect comps to be up 6.5% year over year. The company said the balance of hurricane affects created a net loss of $51 million in the quarter, but things appear to be looking up for Home Depot for the year as a whole.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed report this morning, meeting the $1.00 per share expected while sales reached $8.76 billion, beneath the $8.88 billion the Zacks consensus anticipated. Hurricanes — including dozens of stores on the devastated island of Puerto Rico — and warmer weather hit the discount retailer in the quarter. Forecasts for fiscal 2018 (January end) are also beneath estimates.Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report) shares are rocketing up 18% in today’s pre-market following a big beat on the bottom line: $1.43 per share versus a $1.22 consensus estimate. Sales of $2.18 billion came in slightly under the $2.21 billion expected. This marks the first earnings beat for AAP in the last 4 quarters, and the stock had been down more than 50% year to date before this morning’s bid-up.DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) is selling off following its earnings release before the opening bell, even after beating estimates on its top and bottom lines: 30 cents per share outperformed the 26 cents expected, and revenues $1.94 billion surpassed the $1.89 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, reports of pressured margins suggest the company will underperform expectations, perhaps by as much as 20% in 2018. Shares are down 4% ahead of the opening bell.Finally, private investment firm Roark Capital has offered to buy Buffalo Wild Wings  for $150 per share this morning, sending shares surging more than 26% in today’s pre-market. This follows BWLD’s strong Q3 report from a couple weeks ago, when the stock also surged more than 20%; year-to-date, however, the specialty food and drink establishment was down 24%.

1166,TJX,"Third quarter earnings season is winding down, but this week there are still over 250 companies expected to report earnings, with many of them being the big retailers.The retail sector has been one of the gloomiest groups on Wall Street. Many investors believe that they will ALL be Amazoned. But the department stores have already reported and it wasn’t too bad. Will the others follow suit?Tracey looked through the retail earnings charts to find those with the best track records this week. Some of these are trading near new highs, but some are not.Keep an eye on comparable store sales guidance as well as the earnings miss or beat. It’s just as important as beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.All 5 of these companies have had great comparable store sales results in the last few quarters. Can they do it again in a challenging retail environment?5 Top Retail Earnings Charts1.    Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) is a beast. Not only has it beat every quarter for 5 years it is also crushing the comparables. In the second quarter, it did a 6.3% sales comp. Almost no one in the industry is doing it as well as Home Depot.2.    TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) is cashing in on the popular Home Goods chain, which did a 7% sales comparable last quarter. Consumers are willing to spend on their homes. But TJ Maxx’s shares have been a bit weak. Will another good quarter boost the stock out of its narrow trading range?3.    Children’s Place (PLCE  -  Free Report) is a mall-based retailer who hasn’t missed in 5 years. This type of specialty retailer was supposed to be Amazoned, and its competitor, Gymboree, was, as it declared bankruptcy and closed 330 stores. But this gave a boost to Children’s Place. It had a 3.1% comparable last quarter.4.    L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) used to be the darling of the Street with its popular Pink brand but Pink isn’t as popular as it once was and it has also exited swimwear. It pre-announced sales comps of 2% and shares are off the lows.5.    Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) was supposed to be Amazoned years ago but instead of caving in to the competition, it upped its game and came roaring back. Its last earnings miss was nearly 5 years ago and it did a 5.4% comp last quarter, among the best in the industry. Can it keep the momentum heading into the holiday season?Want to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

1167,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 14, before the opening bell.We note that this leading off-price retailer’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of 3.2%.Let’s now look into some factors that are likely to impact third-quarter results.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has been stable in the past 30 days at $1.00. Further, estimated earnings depict a year-on-year growth of 9.9%. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,885 million for the said quarter, reflecting an improvement of 7.2% from the prior-year period.Factors Influencing the QuarterHigher store traffic has been benefiting TJX Companies’ comps for the last 33 quarters.  In order to maintain sales momentum in stores, the company has been adhering to aggressive store openings and brand-enhancing initiatives. Evidently, TJX Companies plans to open approximately 260 stores during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018. Further, the company’s HomeSense store concept (launched during the second quarter) is expected to aid comps this season.In order to support store traffic growth, TJX Companies has been undertaking strategic marketing and advertising campaigns. Its gift-giving initiatives and loyalty card program have aided improved customer engagement. TJX Companies has also been ramping up e-commerce business and plans to add more categories to the online shopping site.The company is aiming to invest categorically to differentiate e-commerce business from its brick-and-mortar stores. Such efforts are likely to augment TJX Companies’ business and thereby benefit top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteHowever, the company has been struggling with rising costs and expects pre-tax margins to be under pressure during the third quarter, thanks to an increase in employee payroll. Further, the company expects incremental investments, additional supply chain costs and pension costs to dent performance. So let’s see if TJX Companies’ growth endeavors can counter these hurdles in the third quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that TJX Companies is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Although TJX Companies carries a Zacks Rank #2 its Earnings ESP of -1.20% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.Zumiez Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #2.Home Depot Inc.

1168,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues improved year over year. While hurricanes and warm weather posed as headwinds, improved traffic at major segments and enhanced merchandise margins fueled results.  Quarterly DetailsThe company’s earnings of $1.00 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also met the higher end of management’s guidance range. Further, the bottom line grew 10% from adjusted earnings of 91 cents in the year-ago period. Notably, currency translations had a 4 cents positive impact on earnings per share.Net sales advanced 6% year over year to $8,786.2 million, backed by improved traffic. Also, currency translations benefited consolidated net sales growth by 1%. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,876 million.TJX Companies' consolidated comps remained flat year over year, in comparison with 3% rise witnessed in the preceding quarter. Results were affected by hurricanes, with demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division also being hurt by warm temperatures in the United States. Nonetheless, trends at the division improved eventually as weather normalized. Further, the company witnessed greater traffic and transactions at all major segments.Segment-wise, comps rose 3%, 4% and 1% respectively, in HomeGoods, TJX Canada and TJX International segments. On the contrary, comps slipped 1% at Marmaxx.     Gross margin expanded 0.3 percentage points to 29.8%, thanks to gains from inventory hedges and enhanced merchandise margins. This was partly offset by greater supply chain expenses and expense deleverage on flat comps.However, selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.5 pp to 18.1% due to increase in wages and costs associated with hurricanes. TJX Companies' consolidated pre-tax profit margin dipped 0.1 pp (from adjusted pre-tax margin) to 11.6% of sales. High wages have been a hurdle for the company for a while now. We also note that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 4.3% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 3.9%.  Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,364.2 million, long-term debt of $2,229.8 million and total shareholders’ equity of $4,645.6 million. Cash flow from operations for the first three quarters of the fiscal was $1,929.4 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased 4.9 million shares for $350 million and paid dividends worth $197 million. For fiscal 2018, the company still expects to repurchase shares worth approximately $1.5-$1.8 billion.During the quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total store count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017.Q4 GuidanceTJX Companies remains encouraged about the fourth quarter, courtesy of the solid holiday season opportunities. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings (excluding a nearly 11 cents benefit from an additional week in the quarter) in the range of $1.14-$1.16 per share, reflecting 11-13% increase from the year-ago period earnings. Wage increases are expected to hurt bottom line growth by 1%, while currency is likely to positively impact earnings growth by 1%. The company expects consolidated comps growth of 1-2% in the fourth quarter.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, TJX Companies raised the lower end of its earnings guidance. The company now projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.80-$3.82, compared with the prior range of $3.78-$3.82. The adjusted guidance (excluding benefit of 11 cents from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018) will represent an 8% increase from the year-ago period earnings. While wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2%, the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation will positively impact earnings growth by 1%. Also, currency is likely to have a 1% positive impact on fiscal 2018 bottom-line growth. Comps are still expected to grow 1-2% for fiscal 2018.Looking for Promising Stocks?

"
1174,TJX,"There is an interesting story working its way around the Street about YouTubes desire to challenge companies like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) by offering streaming movies through its website. The news seems to have touched shares of NFLX in today's session, trading down more than 3.5% on an up day for the overall market. 
"
1175,TJX,"At this point, the plan is highly speculative, with nothing concrete announced. To Netflix's favor, it already has the ability to deliver movies online, which it does very efficiently and at a very competitive rate. Beyond that, the company has a massive catalog of movies to draw from. YouTube has the might of its owner, Google, Inc. (GOOG) behind it, but there would be much work needed to make a material impression on Netflix's loyal customers.
"
1176,TJX,"Focus List AdditionsMulti-Fineline Electronix, Inc. (MFLX) was added to the portfolio after the close. MFLEX manufactures flexible printed circuits and other components for the electronics industry. The company has surprised on the Zacks Consensus Estimate 3 out of the last 4 quarters, including the most recent quarter where it beat by 19.35%. Sales rose 4.1% year over year to $174.5 million on continuing strong demand for smart phones and portable electronic devices like netbooks. The stock is trading with an attractive valuation of 15.3x forward earnings. It also has a PEG ratio of 0.93. MFLEX is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock.
"
1177,TJX,"Merit Medical Systems Inc. (MMSI  -  Free Report) was also added to the focus list after the closing bell. The company develops and manufactures disposable medical devices in radiology and cardiology. Shares of MMSI have traded mostly sideways for the last month after a nice run up from March lows. The current-year estimate is up 1 penny in the last month to 81 cents per share. The next-year estimate is bullish, projecting earnings growth of 25%. This Zacks #2 rank stock operates with a Zacks industry rank of #29 out of 217.
"
1178,TJX,"Growth and Income UpdatesFamily Dollar Stores, Inc. (FDO) announced that fiscal fourth-quarter net sales increased 2.6% year-over-year to about $1.8 billion. Comparable store sales were up 1% year-over-year. The numbers were below expectations. FDO also reiterated its earnings guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, noting that the range is between 39 and 43 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents was increased from 39 cents over the past 2 months. FDO's fourth-quarter report is scheduled for release on October 7. 
"
1179,TJX,"Management explained that the results were affected by last years stimulus package, adding that the companys changes and repositioning of categories resulted in some temporary disruption, but customers are responding well to the improved shopping experience.
"
1180,TJX,"We continue to like the discount retail play in this economic environment but are concerned by todays drop of 9%. Because the weaker-than-expected sales were impacted by the aforementioned temporary disruptions, we hope to see a bounce back in shares in the near future as investors bet on strong sales going forward. We will continue to hold here but will keep a very close eye on FDO.      
"
1181,TJX,"T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share, stating that it is payable September 28 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 14.

"
1183,TJX,"Lubrizol Corporation (LZ) continued with its hot streak, hitting yet another 52-week high of $65.25 today on heavy volume. The stock finished up 3.18%.
"
1184,TJX,"As stated yesterday, we're going to continue to let this stock ride the momentum until either the fundamentals or the technicals break down. It appears to have the all-time high, $69.53, set in October 2007, in its sight.The TJX Cos.  (TJX  -  Free Report) gained 2.6% after August sales came in lower, but were better than expected. Discounters saw a year-over-year improvement, something not many retailers have seen in quite some time. Upper-end stores continued to see numbers decline. 
"
1185,TJX,"This slowing decline is great for discounters like TJX and we will continue to hold it. Some shoppers are coming back, but clearly prefer to find the best deals out there.
"
1186,TJX,"A Growth and Income AdditionAlcon Inc. (ACL) was added to the Growth & Income portfolio after the close. The company is the world's largest eye care company. Alcon makes surgical equipment and other ophthalmic products. The company has good history of earnings and currently has 3 consecutive surprises. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is up over the past 3 months, to $6.42 from $6.23, which is good enough to give the company a Zacks #2 Rank. Alcon also boasts an impressive profit margin and ROE of 34% and 39%, respectively. Its peers average negative figures in these categories.
"
1187,TJX,"Competition in the retail industry has always remained intense as more companies keep entering the sector and expand their stores, online presence and continuously innovate to augment their offerings.However, off-price retailers are seen to be operating steadily amid such pressures. Such retailers are attracting more consumers owing to their low price business model compared with traditional department stores. One such off-price retailer that has been gaining from improved store traffic is The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report). We note that the company has maintained a solid earnings trend and has outpaced estimates in the last 11 quarters.Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been aiding the company’s performance and few of the challenges it has been dealing with.Comps Growth and Store ExpansionHigher store traffic has been benefiting TJX Companies’ comps growth for the last 33 quarters.  In order to improve the growth momentum, the company has been adhering to aggressive store openings and brand enhancing initiatives.With almost 3,800 stores across nine countries, TJX Companies is focused on increasing store count to 5,600 over the long term. It plans to open approximately 260 stores in fiscal 2018. In July, the company announced plans to launch a new chain of stores called Homesense, which provides furniture, lighting and art. The company has opened its first Homesense store recently, with a few more stores slated to open during the fall. Similar store expansion strategies are seen to be followed by other major discount retailers such as Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report).Other Initiatives to Boost Sales The company’s aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums have also been boosting traffic at its stores for the past few quarters. Its gift-giving initiatives, which is unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help to improve customer engagement. E-commerce Expansion Although discount retailers have been comparatively slow on adapting themselves with e-commerce growth, they are now gradually focusing on increasing their online presence and thereby capitalize on omni-channel capabilities. Moreover, the online shopping platform has been widening consistently with growing consumer preference and technological advancements, thanks to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report).TJX Companies has also not kept itself aloof from this phenomenon and has been undertaking several initiatives to boost online sales. The company’s e-commerce business, Sierra Trading Post, is working towards growing its business. Moreover, TJX’s official website tjmaxx.com, accessible from tablets and smartphones, appeals to the young generation — the company’s main target consumers. TJX plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically to differentiate it from its brick-and-mortar stores.Rising Costs Remain a Concern Being an off-price retailer, TJX Companies cannot increase the price of its products despite rising product costs. Further, the company expects incremental investments for its stores and online channel to lead to additional supply chain costs and employee payroll. This would subsequently pressurize margins in the coming quarters.Nevertheless, we remain confident regarding the company’s business expansion initiatives and expect them to yield positive results, thereby offsetting ongoing incremental cost related challenges.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1189,TJX,"Consumers are showing a willingness to spend, even as they watch their budgets.
"
1190,TJX,"This morning, the Commerce Department said that retailers saw sales rose 0.5% last month, excluding motor vehicles and parts. Furniture & home furnishing stores, health & personal care stores, general merchandise stores and gasoline stations all saw increases of 0.8% or better.
"
1191,TJX,"(The hangover from the Cash for Clunkers program resulted in an 11.8% drop in sales at auto dealers. This skewed the overall change in retail sales down to -1.5%.)
"
1192,TJX,"The increase may seem surprising given the economic backdrop. After all, unemployment is rising towards 10% and another wave of foreclosures could be forthcoming as adjustable rate mortgages reset. On the other hand, the majority of Americans are employed and the improving economic data is probably giving consumers some confidence, even if the sentiment surveys are less clear.
"
1193,TJX,"Plus, the Commerce Department's data is backed up by rising sales at several retailers. For instance, Limited Brands (LTD), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) saw an improvement last month.
"
1194,TJX,"Of course, some of the biggest increases continue to occur at the discount retail chains. Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) both said September same-store sales jumped by 7% or more.
"
1195,TJX,"Sales Benefiting From Several Factors
"
1196,TJX,"There was no single key driver to explain the improvement in sales. Traffic was better and Target noted that the average transaction continues to improve. Costco (COST  -  Free Report) executives observed that though coupon use has increased, consumers are still spending essentially the same amount of the register.
"
1197,TJX,"Unseasonably cool weather may have also played a role. TJX saw increased demand for fall apparel. The good weather across much of the country may have also given people reason to go out and shop. Not to mention that the calm hurricane season probably helped stores in the Southeast.
"
1198,TJX,"Again, the economy is also playing a role. With business conditions stabilizing, consumers are more willing to open their wallets. Though spending patterns will remain comparatively depressed well into 2010, and probably longer, even relatively small increases can make a difference in the data.
"
1199,TJX,"Retail Remains A Top Sector
"
1200,TJX,"Despite rising unemployment, Retail has been among the top-ranked sectors for many months. Several retailers have been able to top analyst expectations, resulting in positive earnings estimate revisions.
"
1201,TJX,"Last week, several companies raised their third-quarter guidance, including KSS, ROST, TJX and TGT. Though LTD did not provide any guidance, 10 out of the 15 covering analysts raised their third-quarter projections. The full year Zacks Consensus Estimate has recently been raised on all 5 companies.
"
1202,TJX,"There is no doubt that retailers still face challenging conditions. The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend 1% less this year than last year. However, as long as retailers continue to perform better than expectations, their stocks should continue to rise. This is why I hold Retail SPDR (XRT  -  Free Report) in Zacks ETF Trader.

1258,TJX,"Enjoy the weekend.
"
1259,TJX,"Regular day trading Monday fought back from pre-market declines to finish slightly in the green, as softness in Asian markets look to be providing a gentle headwind on Western markets again this morning. Futures are again in the red, as forecasts for China’s economy expect it to slow in Q4. This is somewhat offset by better-than-expected GDP in Germany: +0.8% from the +0.6% analysts were looking for, on slightly stronger exports and capital investments.The main piece of econ data here at home this morning is the monthly Producer Price Index (PPI), which came in hotter than we were expecting for October: +0.4% versus the +0.1% consensus, with the ex-food & energy read also at 0.4% (+0.2% was expected). The headline also matched September’s 0.4%; year over year we see +2.8% — the best year-over-year PPI read since 2011.These numbers help illustrate the continued slow seep of inflation into the economy, as well as the fact that hurricane effects continue to roll off the data. It’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out later, that will help the Fed solidify its rate increase plans for its December FOMC meeting (or not). The CPI not only gives a good indication of inflation metrics month by month, but also gives insight into consumers’ coping mechanisms with higher (or lower) prices.Q3 Earnings RundownZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) posted a typical positive earnings surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: earnings of $1.84 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $25.03 billion easily surpassed the $24.52 billion we had been looking for. This is at least the fifth straight earnings beat for Home Depot, whose trailing 4-quarter average was +3.8%.Home Depot also upped its full-year guidance from estimates, and expect comps to be up 6.5% year over year. The company said the balance of hurricane affects created a net loss of $51 million in the quarter, but things appear to be looking up for Home Depot for the year as a whole.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed report this morning, meeting the $1.00 per share expected while sales reached $8.76 billion, beneath the $8.88 billion the Zacks consensus anticipated. Hurricanes — including dozens of stores on the devastated island of Puerto Rico — and warmer weather hit the discount retailer in the quarter. Forecasts for fiscal 2018 (January end) are also beneath estimates.Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report) shares are rocketing up 18% in today’s pre-market following a big beat on the bottom line: $1.43 per share versus a $1.22 consensus estimate. Sales of $2.18 billion came in slightly under the $2.21 billion expected. This marks the first earnings beat for AAP in the last 4 quarters, and the stock had been down more than 50% year to date before this morning’s bid-up.DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) is selling off following its earnings release before the opening bell, even after beating estimates on its top and bottom lines: 30 cents per share outperformed the 26 cents expected, and revenues $1.94 billion surpassed the $1.89 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, reports of pressured margins suggest the company will underperform expectations, perhaps by as much as 20% in 2018. Shares are down 4% ahead of the opening bell.Finally, private investment firm Roark Capital has offered to buy Buffalo Wild Wings  for $150 per share this morning, sending shares surging more than 26% in today’s pre-market. This follows BWLD’s strong Q3 report from a couple weeks ago, when the stock also surged more than 20%; year-to-date, however, the specialty food and drink establishment was down 24%. This morning’s news looks to finally swing Buffalo Wild Wings into the black for calendar 2017.

1266,TJX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.3% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.TJX Companies Q2 Earnings and Revenues TopThe TJX Companies reported impressive second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, driven by improved traffic and margin improvements, as well as higher market share at each of its four divisions. Following the results, the company raised its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance. In the reported quarter, adjusted earnings of 85 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents by 1.2%. Earnings also exceeded management’s guidance of 81–83 cents per share. The bottom line grew 1.2% year over year, backed by higher consumer traffic and improved margins. Currency hurt earnings by 4%, as management had expected. However, it compares unfavorably with the 3-cent positive impact it had on earnings in the preceding quarter.Quarterly DetailsNet sales increased 6% year over year to $8.358 billion, backed by an increase in comps and improved traffic. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.329 billion by 0.3%. Currency headwinds negatively impacted sales by 1 percentage points (pp).TJX Companies' consolidated comps grew 3%, higher than the preceding quarter’s comps growth of 1%, but lower than the 4% comps growth in the year-ago quarter. Comps growth in the quarter was also higher than the management’s guidance of 1–2% growth. Higher comps at HomeGoods and TJX Canada increased 7% each, while comps increased 2% and 1% in Marmaxx and the International segment, respectively.Gross margin contracted 0.9 pp year over year to 28.5%. The downside was primarily due to losses related to the company’s inventory hedges. Nevertheless, the company witnessed strong increase in merchandise margins.However, selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, increased 0.1 pp to 17.8% due to increase in wages, as was anticipated by the company. TJX Companies' consolidated pre-tax profit margin contracted 0.9 pp year over year to 10.7% of sales.Other Financial UpdatesDuring the second quarter, the company repurchased 7.5 million shares for $550 million. For fiscal 2018, the company now expects to repurchase approximately $1.5–$1.8 billion shares, which was earlier expected to be approximately $1.3– $1.8 billion shares. We note that in Feb 2017, the company’s board has approved an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program.Cash and cash equivalents were $2.45 billion as of Jul 29, 2017, while long-term debt was $2.23 billion. Shareholders’ equity was $4.54 billion as of Jul 29. Cash flow from operations were $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, while capital expenditure was $506.9 million, resulting in free cash flow of $596.1 million.During the quarter, the company increased its store count by 51 stores to a total of 3,913 stores. It had increased square footage by 5% over the same period last year.Q3 GuidanceTJX Companies issued its guidance for third-quarter fiscal 2018. The company expects earnings in the range of 98 cents to $1.00 per share, while the prior-year adjusted earnings were 91 cents. Wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 1%. Currency headwinds are likely to positively impact earnings by 3%, while the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation will have a positive impact on earnings growth by an additional 2%. The company expects comps growth of 1–2%, while last year’s growth.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, TJX Companies has raised its earnings guidance. The company now projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.78–$3.82, compared with the prior range of $3.71–$3.78. The adjusted guidance (excluding benefit of 11 cents from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018) would represent a 7–8% increase from fiscal 2017 adjusted results of $3.53 per share. While wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2%, the change in accounting rules for share-based compensation will positively impact earnings growth by 2%. Comps are also expected to grow 1–2% for fiscal 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.The TJX Companies, Inc.

1267,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is well poised to achieve growth on the back of its brand enhancing initiatives, aggressive store opening strategy and improving e-Commerce business. These factors also aided the company to improve margins and market share, leading to better-than-expected results in its recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2018.Though shares have been declining for the last several quarters owing to disappointing comps growth and higher costs, the stock has turned around and started moving up over the last one month on the back of solid fundamentals. Shares of this discount retailer have gained 6.8% in the last one month compared with the industry’s increase of 4.7%.Let’s now take a closer look into some of the factors that have been aiding the company’s performance as well as few of the challenges it has been dealing with.Initiatives Boosting Performance TJX Companies posted its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results wherein both earnings and revenues exceeded expectations, driven by margin growth, improved traffic and higher market share. As traditional retailers struggle in the face of changing consumer tastes and competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), TJX Companies has maintained its solid earnings trend and outpaced estimates for the last 11 quarters. In fact, higher traffic has been benefiting comps growth for the last 33 quarters. However comps growth rate is slowing down. The company’s consolidated comps grew 3% in the second quarter, lower than the 4% growth in the year-ago quarter.TJX Companies has an aggressive store opening strategy. The company regularly opens stores and is rapidly expanding across the United States, Europe and Canada. With almost 3,800 stores in nine countries, the company plans to increase the number of stores to 5,600 over the long term. TJX Companies plans to open approximately 260 stores in fiscal 2018. In July, the company announced plans to launch a fourth chain called Homesense, which provides furniture, lighting and art. The company has opened its first Homesense store recently, with a few more stores slated for the fall.An increasing number of retailers are focusing on online businesses spread to a greater number of customers. TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and is aiming to add more categories to the online shopping site to differentiate the same from its brick-and-mortar stores.The company’s aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have also been aiding sales growth. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program also help in improving customer engagement.Factors Posing Concerns Being an off-price retailer, TJX Companies cannot increase the price of its products despite rising product costs. Moreover, lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores. To add to its worries, TJX Companies has also been experiencing an increase in employee payroll. Higher wages are expected to negatively impact fiscal 2018 earnings by 2%. Further, the company expects incremental investments, additional supply chain costs and pension costs to pressurize margins in the coming quarters.Bottom Line TJX Companies’ business expansion initiatives which include store openings, e-Commerce growth and marketing campaigns are quite appealing and are expected to yield favorable results. While these efforts are expected to boost store traffic, we are cautious about the challenges which may dent the company’s performance in the near term.Given the mixed pros and cons, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

1268,TJX,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with the upcoming festive season, the spotlight is back on the sector. Most of the retailers kick start their holiday season from Thanksgiving Day as buying on this holiday has become an emerging trend. Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) has decided to keep stores open, a tradition which it has been following since 2013, per media reports.This time the department store chain will open its doors at 5 p.m. and will remain open until 2 a.m. It will again reopen its stores on Black Friday. To take on online rivals, brick-and-mortar retailers do not want to miss out a single opportunity to attract shoppers who start early and seek attractive deals, and so keep their doors open on Thanksgiving. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s move is seen as part of its effort to aggressively capitalize on the holiday season, in order to provide cushion to its dwindling top and bottom line. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 unveils that net sales declined decreased 7.4%, 3.9%, 4.2% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, while earnings per share plunged 28.6%, 15.6%, 69.6% and 3.3% during the respective quarters. During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017 the scenario was no different, as net sales declined 7.5% and 5.4%, while earnings per share fell 40% and 11.1%, respectively.Macy’s dismal top and bottom lines performance has remain the primary concern for investors and this has gravely hurt the stock's performance. We note that the stock has plunged roughly 29.9% in the past six months wider than the industry's decline of 15.8%.The holiday season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, and retailers are well on their toes to capitalize on this festive spirit, flooding the markets with offers and promotions.Opposition to Remaining OpenThe issue of stores remaining open on Thanksgiving has been played up by a movement, largely dependent on social media. This includes pages on Facebook such as Boycott Black Thursday and Boycott Shopping on Thanksgiving Day. The idea is to reclaim Thanksgiving as a day to spend at home eating with the family rather than shopping. Consumers can then be free to shop on Black Friday.In the previous year companies such as The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) remained closed on Thanksgiving.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1269,TJX,"Shares of Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) jumped 10.67% in trading on Friday, closing at $59.02 per share, after reporting better-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results.Ross reported earnings of $0.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76. Earnings grew 15.49% year-over-year. The company also reported revenue of $3.431 billion, surpassing our estimate of $3.370 billion and growing 7.88% year-over-year.The company also stated that comparable store sales rose 4%. Ross Stores expects to earn between $0.64 and $0.67 per share during the third quarter.This positive earnings report comes in sharp contrast to falling retail stocks resulting from poor earnings and sales this week. Today, Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) fell 28% after missing analyst expectations, dragging other athletic retailers along with it. L Brands (LB  -  Free Report), the owner of Victoria’s Secret, also tumbled on Wednesday after reporting disappointing sales and a weak outlook for the third quarter.Ross owes its success partially to its strategy of being an off-price retailer. The company offers designer and brand name products at deeply discounted rates. This has attracted consumers to its 1,340 U.S. stores, allowing Ross to succeed despite e-commerce retailer threats, like from Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).TJX Companies Inc (TJX  -  Free Report), which owns T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and the popular HomeGoods, also reported second quarter earnings this week that beat our estimates. The success of both these off-price companies demonstrates that department stores like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) aren't doing well just because of online competition, but because consumers want quality products at low prices.ROST remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a VGM score of ‘A.’Want to learn more about retail?

"
1346,TJX,"6 sectors expected to decline more than 25%
"
1347,TJX,"Financials expected to rebound after disastrous 2008 (but poor quality EPS)
"
1348,TJX,"Third quarter expected to be down 22.6% year/year
"
1349,TJX,"Estimate cuts and increases for 2009 nearly in balance
"
1350,TJX,"Bottom up estimate for S&P 500 now $59.82 in 2009 versus $59.72 last week.

1351,TJX,"S&P 500 now expected to earn $74.48 in 2010 versus $74.24 last week
"
1352,TJX,"Top down estimates $56.54 and $67.79, respectively
"
1353,TJX,"Total Net Income GrowthEarly results bad absolutely, but better than expected based on 70 early reports
"
1354,TJX,"Total net income reported $29.5 billion versus $34.6 billion last year; down 14.7%
"
1355,TJX,"Financials only sector up from year ago (easy comps and questionable quality)
"
1356,TJX,"Remaining firms expected to post 36.2% decline
"
1357,TJX,"Staples expected to lead with small increase, followed by small declines in Health Care and Utilities
"
1358,TJX,"Materials and Energy expected to see massive year over year declines
"
1359,TJX,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected in the early going. While in this report we have not tracked revenues, there seems to be a general pattern where the source of the positive surprises is coming from much better than expected margins (both operating and net) rather than from better than expected revenue growth.
"
1360,TJX,"In other words companies are succeeding in cost cutting their way, if not to prosperity, then at least much better than feared results. While at the individual company level, this is almost always a positive, it is not necessarily so at the macro level. Cutting costs by reducing head count means that there are fewer jobs and less overall demand in the economy.
"
1361,TJX,"Still given the weak state of the economy, I suspect most investors will not be too picky about the source of the earnings improvements. The one exception to this might be in the financials where the earnings quality is weak due to FASB caving to political pressure and doing away with mark-to-market accounting. On the other hand, I have not seen any situations of massive mark-to-market of the liabilities but not the assets, like we saw in the first quarter.
"
1362,TJX,"The total earnings reported so far of the 70 firms that had reported by the Jul 20 close were $29.5 billion, a decline of 14.7% from the $34.6 billion those same 70 firms reported a year ago. There are only 2 sectors where the actual results that are in are worse than the remaining firms are expected to show, Staples and Industrials.
"
1363,TJX,"There are 2 ways of looking at this. The pessimist would say that the good news is getting out of the way early and that results will start to deteriorate. The optimist would say that there is a trend towards better than expected earnings. I lean towards the second explanation. Still, actual earnings growth has been a pretty rare commodity with only 23 of the 70 reporting firms actually posting higher net income than a year ago. I would note that it is still a pretty thin sample and that some sectors have many more reports in than others.

"
1404,TJX,"Late May saw the company blow past Wall Street expectations with fiscal first-quarter EPS of 39 cents, excluding items. Analysts were expecting a loss of 88 cents, making a positive surprise well into the triple digits.

1411,TJX,"However, as is always the case, this bit of optimism is tempered with the fact that the economy is struggling and retailers remain cautious. Lots of Retailers on the Zacks #1 Rank List
"
1412,TJX,"This is the second consecutive day that a retailer has been highlighted as the Zacks #1 Rank Top Performer; though the two retailers are quite different. On Monday, home decor specialty retailer Kirkland's, Inc. (KIRK) was highlighted with a gain of approximately 14% at midday.  
"
1413,TJX,"There are currently 39 retailers of one type or another on today's 225-stock Zacks #1 Rank List.

1414,TJX,"As Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) continue to lead the way in online shopping, a new player has come forth offering the consumer favorite two-day delivery: Overstock.com (OSTK  -  Free Report).Overstock is a popular online retailer that provides a broad range of products, including everything from apparel and accessories to home décor, furniture and electronics “at the best price possible.” If you have shopped on their website before, you’ll find it similar to Wayfair (W  -  Free Report) and a digital version of a TJ Maxx (TJX  -  Free Report) store.According to the New York Post, Overstock is in advanced talks with XPO Logistics (XPO  -  Free Report), a global transportation and logistics company, about creating a two-day delivery program. If implemented, the deal would allow the e-commerce firm to ship furniture and other bulky items in two days, something that would help Overstock compete with Amazon and Wayfair.If a deal were to happen, sources told the Post that Overstock would “outsource all of its warehousing, distribution, transportation, returns, and last-mile deliveries to XPO.”“Overstock [would] be able to become the first retailer to offer two-day delivery to 87 percent of consumers in the US. By selecting XPO, Overstock [would] leapfrog Wayfair,” the source continued.XPO also has a deal with Amazon, and its chief executive Bradley Jacobs announced earlier this year that the company will help the company manage its furniture and appliance warehouses.But if there’s going to be any winner out of this deal, it will likely be XPO Logistics, as the company has created quite the niche for itself in the delivery and online retail world, working with some of hottest names in e-commerce.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

This segment generates around 52% of its revenues and regularly posts strong operating margins.Also, the company’s investment in merchandising the brands, efficient catalog circulations and digital marketing boosts its e-commerce revenues. In addition, it is consistently improving its website and mobile shopping experience. The company will continue to strengthen its competitive advantages through innovation in e-commerce in the upcoming quarters.Importantly, Williams-Sonoma’s products primarily focus on home-furnishings and demand for its products is therefore related to the broader housing construction market’s performance. Positives like an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, a positive consumer confidence as well as a tight supply situation raise optimism about the housing sector’s performance in 2017. Thus, demand for William-Sonoma’s products should increase as well, thereby driving its revenues further.Soft Comparable Revenues a Major HeadwindWilliams-Sonoma has been witnessing soft comparable brand revenues for quite some time. The rate of increase of comparable brand revenues has decreased significantly from 7.1% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015 and 0.7% in 2016. Comparable brand revenues inched up 0.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, significantly lower than the 4.5% rise recorded in the preceding quarter. The rate of comparable brand revenue increase has softened across all the brands over the years.The PBteen brand has been hurt the most, thus reporting a 6.2% decline in comparable brand revenues in 2016 compared with a 2.7% fall in 2015. Comparable brand revenue of PBteen brand declined 14.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with a 1.9% increase in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the company expects comparable brand revenues growth in the modest 1–3% range for 2017. This does not indicate any significant improvement from the current trend.Share Price PerformanceThough Williams-Sonoma’s shares have lost 8.6% so far this year compared with the 0.5% gain of its industry, earnings estimate for the current year has moved slightly upward. This signals analysts’ optimism for the stock. Going forward, strong brand portfolio along with focus on innovation and transformation should drive the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksWilliams-Sonoma carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report), The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

1416,TJX,"Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report), holding company of Anthropologie, Free People, BHLDN, Terrain, and Urban Outfitters brands, delivered a massive second quarter earnings beat, reporting earnings of 44 cents per share on revenues of $873 million. Shares of Urban have been soaring ever since, and are up over 18% in late afternoon trading on Wednesday.Despite these top and bottom line accomplishments, Urban’s overall comparable sales did fall year-over-year, declining nearly 5%, though not as much as Wall Street was expecting. Breaking it down by its main brands, comps fell 4% at Anthropologie and almost 8% at Urban Outfitters, while at Free People, same-store sales increased 2.9%.Free People, a brand known specifically for its hippie style, has been a major growth factor for Urban Outfitters these past few years. Making up about 20% of Urban’s total revenue, Free People could help the retailer stay on this profitable path. But what is it about the brand that resonates with consumers?What is Free People?Most importantly, Free People is one of the few apparel retailers today that understands its customer. Like TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) know that their core customer is always hunting for deals, Free People knows how much their customer identifies with its central bohemian aesthetic.Free People’s key customer is very specific too: a “26-year-old girl, smart, creative, confident, and comfortable in all aspects of her being, free and adventurous, sweet to tough to tomboy to romantic. A girl who likes to keep busy and push life to its limits, with traveling and hanging out and everything in between,” the company writes on its website.And because the brand understands “her,” Free People’s seasonal collections continually reflect that vibe, a factor that makes it stand out from fast-fashion giants Zara, H&M, and Forever 21, three companies that have severely impacted traditional apparel retailers, and even its sister brand, Urban Outfitters.This intuition, however, has gotten Free People in trouble. Earlier this year, the Coachella music and arts festival announced that it is suing Urban for using the event’s name at Free People in order to sell merchandise. The brand’s retail items in question included things like the “Coachella Boot,” “Coachella Mini Dress,” and “Coachella Valley Tunic.”Coachella Is Suing Urban Outfitters for Using The Festival's Name To Sell Tunics And Boots https://t.co/8f4WDgacMP pic.twitter.com/Mq4X0IuiEr— LAist (@LAist) March 16, 2017In addition to its 120 store boutiques across the country, Free People product is sold in upper-end department stores like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Bloomingdales, which is owned by Macy's (M  -  Free Report), both of which have created in-store concept shops to attract shoppers to the brand.How Urban Can CapitalizeWhile it did suffer through a tough fiscal 2017, Free People is on the rebound, and in the last three quarters, the brand has posted positive comparable store sales. The same cannot be said for either the Anthropologie or Urban Outfitters brands. If Urban wants to continue surprising Wall Street like it did yesterday, it should absolutely take advantage of everything Free People offers.In addition to its loyal customers, Free People has mastered the art of social media, where the brand has been able to connect with its customers in a meaningful way. Its Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) account has 3.2 million followers, its Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account has 255,000 followers, and most notably, its Pinterest account has nearly 570,000 followers.With this type of following, Free People, has been able to cultivate the type of targeted engagement with customers, both old and new, that many retailers strive for. By posting catalog-quality pictures on Instagram, for instance, the company is able to see what products work and which ones don’t.  ???? on the mind. #mooncyclehatA post shared by freepeople (@freepeople) on Aug 14, 2017 at 4:35pm PDTAll of Urban’s core brands are popular on Instagram, with Anthropologie boasting 3 million followers and Urban Outfitters sitting at 7.3 million. What makes Free People stand out is its ability to stay consistent in aesthetic and in product. Urban should take what Free People has learned from its own social media success—targeted knowledge about its customers—and apply it to its other brands.Urban should also consider expanding Free People. Since its stores are much smaller in size compared to the average Urban Outfitters or Anthropologie, one could assume the company would not have to shell out a large amount of cash. This move, however, would be risky, as brick-and-mortar retail sales are in crisis. Over-saturation of the market would also be a concern, since Free People is still considered a covetable brand.But Urban Outfitters needs to do something, and Free People is right there for the taking. It’s one of the most desired brands among young women, with a bustling social media presence that gives its management key information about what designs and merchandise to introduce next. Free People is Urban’s bohemian dream, and has the potential to help boost the company’s bottom line moving forward.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

"
1455,TJX,"The trend towards thriftiness is benefiting discount retailers such as Big Lots and Dollar Tree
"
1456,TJX,"Recent trends made yesterday's bullish earnings report from closeout retailer Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report) not all that surprising.
"
1457,TJX,"Consumers have become thriftier, a trend I've discussed previously in this column.
"
1458,TJX,"Throughout the summer, discount-oriented stores have fared better than their ""full-price"" brethren. For example, Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) saw same-stores rise 6.5% in the second quarter, while Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF  -  Free Report) experienced a 4% drop.
"
1459,TJX,"The sluggish economy has consumers in savings mode. The Conference Board's August survey revealed that a greater proportion of consumers are increasingly worried about the labor market. At the same time, gasoline prices are still at very high levels - even after the pullback that occurred this month.
"
1460,TJX,"Falling home prices are causing consumers to feel less wealthy. Furthermore, the lower prices are making it more difficult to use home equity loans to support spending habits.
"
1461,TJX,"Then there is the credit crunch. Lending requirements have tightened across the board, while interest rates have increased.
"
1462,TJX,"A growing proportion of people are struggling to pay their credit cards. Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) stated in a recent SEC filing that its net charge-off rate rose again last quarter. (Charge-offs were 5.67% last quarter versus 3.47% a year prior.)
"
1463,TJX,"Finally, I stated in last Friday's Earnings Preview, Big Lots has a history of exceeding expectations. Yesterday's report marked the 10th consecutive positive earnings surprise.
"
1464,TJX,"Big Profits
"
1465,TJX,"Big Lots earned 32 cents per share from continuing operations during the second quarter, a sharp increase over last year's profit of 21 cents per share. Brokerage analysts had been expecting 27 cents per share. (The consensus estimate included positive revisions made over the past few weeks.)
"
1466,TJX,"Revenues rose 1.9% to $1.1 billion, aided by a 2.8% increase in same-store sales.
"
1467,TJX,"BIG believes it can maintain the positive momentum throughout the second half of the year. As such, it raised its full-year EPS guidance between $1.90 and $2.00 per share. Brokerage analysts were projecting $1.90 per share at the time of the report and it is likely we will see this forecast increased.
"
1468,TJX,"Dollar Tree Also Beats
"
1469,TJX,"This morning, before the open, Dollar Tree topped second-quarter expectations. The retailer reported profits of 42 cents per share, 2 cents above the consensus estimate and 27.3% higher than a year prior. It was the fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise for DLTR.
"
1470,TJX,"Sales jumped 12.5% to $1.09 billion, driven by a 6.5% increase in same-store sales. CEO Bob Sasser credited ""increased demand for basic, consumable product"" as the reason why more people shopped at his stores.
"
1471,TJX,"DLTR raised its full-year EPS forecast to between $2.33 and $2.43, up from prior guidance of $2.23 to $2.39. Recent upward revisions had put the consensus earnings estimate for this year at $2.43, but the recent surprise might have brokerage analysts viewing their projections as being too conservative.
"
1472,TJX,"Other Discount Retailers Doing Well Too
"
1473,TJX,"Several other companies within Retail-Discount Variety, besides BIG and DLTR have raised guidance recently, including Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report).
"
1474,TJX,"Ross Stores earned 54 cents last quarter, matching the high end of the company's preannounced earnings and brokerage analysts' expectations. Per share profits were 46% higher than a year prior.
"
1475,TJX,"Second-quarter revenues reached $1.64 billion, a 14% increase. The growth was led in part by a 6% increase in same-store sales.
"
1476,TJX,"Following the report, ROST raised its full-year guidance. The company now anticipates earnings between $2.33 and $2.38 per share, a projected increase in profits of about 24%. Nearly all of the 9 covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate up to $2.35 per share.
"
1477,TJX,"The TJX Companies earned 47 cents per share, matching expectations. Profits were 24% higher than a year prior.
"
1478,TJX,"Revenues rose 7%, reflecting a 4% increase in same-store sales. Higher traffic, as was the case with other discount retailers, helped sales.
"
1479,TJX,"TJX now expects to earn between $2.26 and $2.31 this year, versus $1.66 last year. The raised guidance prompted all 11 covering brokerage analysts to raise their full-year forecasts to an average of $2.31 per share.
"
1480,TJX,"BIG is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock. DLTR, ROST and TJX are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. Retail-Discount Variety also contains three other Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Family Dollar (FDO), Fred's  and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report).

1495,TJX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
1496,TJX,"Last week, discount retailer TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) raised its fiscal second-quarter EPS guidance to a range of 46 to 47 cents, excluding a two cent per share impairment charge. The company cited a 3% increase in July same-store sales and ""lean"" clearance levels. Following the update, 2 of the 9 covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts to 47 cents per share. The revisions were not enough to push the consensus earnings estimate above its current level of 44 cents, though the most accurate estimate is slightly more bullish at 45 cents per share. TJX has beaten expectations during 3 out of the past 4 quarters. TJX Companies is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 12, before the start of trading.
"
1497,TJX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises
"
1498,TJX,"Last month, NVIDIA (NVDA) warned that its second-quarter revenues and margins would be below guidance. The company blamed weakening demand, the delayed launch of a new product and downward pricing pressures. Since the announcement, the consensus earnings estimate has dropped from 28 cents per share to 9 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 1 cent per share. Last quarter, the video processor maker missed expectations by three cents per share. NVDIA is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 12, after the close of trading.

"
1503,TJX,"Key Points:
"
1504,TJX,"Consumers are spending, but they are looking for bargains
"
1505,TJX,"Cheaper gasoline prices are helping to boost store traffic at BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ)
"
1506,TJX,"Plunging trade-in values for SUVs are making it more difficult for consumers to afford new cars
"
1507,TJX,"Lackluster Retail Sales
"
1508,TJX,"Yesterday, the Department of Commerce said retail sales rose just 0.1%. Had stimulus checks not been distributed, there would have been a large decline instead.
"
1509,TJX,"Auto sales skidded 3.6% and furniture sales fell 1.4%. Electronics, building materials and restaurants also saw lower sales.
"
1510,TJX,"All other retail categories showed improvement, however. Not surprisingly, gas stations showed the biggest increase with a 4.6% rise in sales. Unfortunately, higher crude prices are not allowing the gains to translate into profits for the gas stations or the refiners that supply them.
"
1511,TJX,"Consumers Actively Seeking Discounts
"
1512,TJX,"Though the numbers show that consumers are continuing to spend, other data suggests Americans are being more selective about where they shop. This shift has benefited discount retailers, such as Family Dollar Stores (FDO).
"
1513,TJX,"Last week, FDO claimed that same-store stores sales surged 8% in June, well above its internal forecasts. CEO Howard Levine observed that the strength was broad-based and included improvement in both apparel and seasonal items.
"
1514,TJX,"FDO guided for fiscal-fourth quarter profits of 30 cents to 35 cents per share, when it reported fiscal-third quarter profits at the start of July. The guidance led all of the covering brokerage analysts to raise their quarterly forecasts by 3 cents to 32 cents per share.
"
1515,TJX,"Notably, the consensus earnings estimate for fiscal 2009 was revised higher as well. The average forecast now stands at $1.65, 7 cents higher than the consensus estimate of a month ago.
"
1516,TJX,"It's not just FDO that is doing well in the current environment. BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) and The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) also reported a significant increase in June same-store sales.
"
1517,TJX,"Gas Prices Attracting Consumers
"
1518,TJX,"BJS enjoyed an 8.3% increase, excluding gasoline. Store traffic rose 6% and the size of the average transaction was approximately 2% higher. These metrics show that not only were more people coming to the store, but that they were spending more once they walked in the door.
"
1519,TJX,"It is worth noting that the impact of gasoline sales extends beyond just the numbers. Wholesale clubs typically are one of the cheapest places to fill up. Therefore, the store traffic numbers are likely receiving a boost from shoppers who are walking in simply because they drove over for the gas. Nonetheless, the increase in transaction size suggests that consumers are shopping when the price is right.
"
1520,TJX,"About one-fourth of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their 2008 profit projections on BJS. The revisions have pushed the consensus earnings estimate 2 cents higher to $2.14 per share.
"
1521,TJX,"Discounts Are Helping Too
"
1522,TJX,"TJX realized a 5% jump in same-store sales last month. CEO Carol Meyrowitz credited summer weather for helping demand, though if it was just the weather other retailers would have thrived as well. In other words, TJX's lower prices were probably the primary driver behind the better sales.
"
1523,TJX,"Meyrowitz believes the positive momentum for her company will continue throughout this month and raised her second-quarter profit guidance to between 44 cents and 45 cents per share. Subsequent revisions by many of the covering brokerage analysts caused the consensus estimate to reach 45 cents, up 4 cents from a week ago.
"
1524,TJX,"The average forecast for the full-year was also revised higher. The 2008 consensus earnings estimate of $2.24 is 2 cents higher than the average projection of a week ago.
"
1525,TJX,"FDO is a Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") stock. BJS and TJX are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. All three are classified in Retail-Discount Variety. This group contains four other Zacks #2 Rank stocks: including Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), Freds  and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report).
"
1526,TJX,"SUVs Sitting On Dealer Lots
"
1527,TJX,"Last month's 3.6% skid in auto sales reflected several factors. The sluggish economy has made consumers thriftier, which means lower demand for new cars. Tightened credit standards and falling home equity means financing a car purchase is more difficult for some buyers. Then, there is the cost of gas, which makes lower-priced, more fuel efficient vehicles attractive to a broader audience.
"
1528,TJX,"Demand for SUVs has plunged and that has caused reverberations for auto dealers. SUVs carry higher margins and therefore create more profits for dealers on a per vehicle basis. Slackened demand means lower profit.
"
1529,TJX,"The drop in demand has also caused SUV prices to plunge. Thomas J. Folliard, CEO of CarMax (KMX  -  Free Report) observed on his company's fiscal first-quarter conference call that ""the rapid depreciation across this large product segment has been unlike anything I've seen in my career"".
"
1530,TJX,"Falling prices for SUVs not only hurt car dealer margins, but they also directly impact sales. Many consumers faced with lower trade-in values and a slack economy have difficulties coming up with the additional cash required to buy a new car. In such instances, they are either forced to scale back their purchase plans or continue to drive their current vehicles.
"
1531,TJX,"Given these factors, it is not surprising to see brokerage analysts cutting full-year profit projections on multiple companies within Retail/Wholesale Auto/Truck. This group contains three Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stocks - Asbury Automotive Group (ABG  -  Free Report), Group 1 Auto (GPI  -  Free Report) and Sonic Automotive (SAH  -  Free Report) - and four Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stocks - KMX, Autonation (AN  -  Free Report), Penske Auto Group (PAG  -  Free Report) and Rush Enterprises (RUSHA  -  Free Report).

1534,TJX,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) recently reported February sales, which totaled $1.3 billion. The result was up 6% from the year-prior $1.2 billion. Consolidated comparable store sales showed an increase of 3% on a year-over-year basis. This Growth & Income pick offers a ROE of 40%, squashing the industry average of 13%. The companys dividend yield of 1.1% also outperforms the industry.
"
1535,TJX,"Full Analysis
"
1536,TJX,"The TJX Companies is a worldwide off-price apparel and home fashions retailer with eight businesses, and more than 2,400 stores. The companys umbrella includes T.J.Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, and A.J. Wright, in the U.S., Winners and HomeSense in Canada, and T.K. Maxx in Europe. 
"
1537,TJX,"Bobs Stores is a value-oriented, casual clothing and footwear superstore in the Northeastern U.S. The companys off-price mission is to deliver a rapidly changing assortment of quality, brand name merchandise at prices that are 20-60% less than department and specialty store regular prices.
"
1538,TJX,"TJXs target customer is a middle to upper-middle income shopper, who is fashion and value conscious and fits the same profile as a department store shopper, with the exception of A.J. Wright, which reaches a more moderate-income market, and Bobs Stores, which targets customers in the moderate to upper-middle income range. 
"
1539,TJX,"The company recently reported February sales, which totaled $1.3 billion. The result was up 6% from the year-prior $1.2 billion. Consolidated comparable store sales showed an increase of 3% on a year-over-year basis. 
"
1540,TJX,"In mid-February, The TJX Companies posted solid fourth-quarter and full-year results, which included fourth-quarter income from continuing operations of 66 cents per share. The result topped last years 51 cents and was ahead of the consensus estimate. 
"
1541,TJX,"For the year ending January 31, 2009, TJX expects earnings per share from continuing operations to range between $2.20 to $2.25 per share. Analysts are forecasting $2.22, an increase form the two months-ago level of $2.12.
"
1542,TJX,"The companys earnings per share expected to grow by 13% over the next 3  5 years, which is in line with the industry average.
"
1543,TJX,"This Growth & Income pick offers a ROE of 40%, squashing the industry average of 13%. The companys dividend yield of 1.1% also outperforms the industry.
"
1544,TJX,"The U.S. financial markets will be closed on Monday, in observance of President's Day.
"
1545,TJX,"When trading resumes on Tuesday, the focus of earnings season will shift to the retail sector. Roughly 10% of the 377 companies reporting will be retailers, including S&P 500 members J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), OfficeMax (OMX), Safeway (SWY), TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Whole Foods (WFMI).
"
1546,TJX,"In addition to WMT, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) will be the other Dow component to report.
"
1547,TJX,"Speaking of the Dow, Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) will be added to the average at the start of trading on Tuesday, Feb 19. These two stocks will replace Altria (MO) and Honeywell (HON). Altria is spinning off its international operations next month. Honeywell is being dropped to increase the concentration of financial and energy companies in the average.
"
1548,TJX,"The minutes from the January Fed meeting will be released on Thursday, Feb 21. With the March meeting still four weeks away and Fed officials not giving any clear assurance that another rate cut is forthcoming, the consensus interpretation of the notes could move the market. Currently, fed fund futures are pricing in a 50-basis point cut.
"
1549,TJX,"Other economic data will include:
"
1550,TJX,"Tuesday - February National Association of Home Builders housing index

"
1552,TJX,"Thursday - January leading indicators, February Phili Fed survey
"
1553,TJX,"Fourth-Quarter Earnings Results
"
1554,TJX,"Call it the ""February Effect"". The fourth-quarter growth rates among S&P 500 companies that have reported this month are well above the growth rates seen for companies that reported in either January or February. Here is the breakdown:
"
1555,TJX,"Reported in December: Median EPS Growth = 9.3%, Median Net Income Growth = 4.5%
"
1556,TJX,"Reported in January: Median EPS Growth = 8.6%, Median Net Income Growth = 6.8%
"
1557,TJX,"Reported in February: Median EPS Growth = 13.9%, Median Net Income Growth = 9.7%
"
1558,TJX,"The difference is partially attributable to the smaller proportion of financial companies and higher proportion of oil companies that have reported in February. As the retailers start to report, however, I do expect the growth rate for the February reporters to pullback.
"
1559,TJX,"Combined, the median per share growth rate for all S&P 500 companies to have reported so far is 10.5%. Median net income growth is 7.5%. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2.29:1, which is lower than what we have seen in past quarters. Median revisions to full-year earnings estimates are negative.
"
1560,TJX,"The numbers do not change much when the universe is expanded to the S&P Composite 1500 (S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600). Median EPS growth is running at 9.3% and median net income growth is 7.4%. Average earnings growth is negative. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 1.87:1.
"
1561,TJX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Feb 18 - 22
"
1562,TJX,"Although it's record of topping expectations is mixed, brokerage analysts are optimistic about Barrick Gold's (ABX  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results. Two brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts within the past week on the gold mining company, pushing the consensus earnings estimate up a penny to 54 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 55 cents per share. Barrick Gold is scheduled to report on Thursday, Feb 21, before the start of trading.
"
1563,TJX,"Last week, Cimarex Energy (XEC  -  Free Report) announced that fourth-quarter oil and gas production volumes rose 7% on year-over-year basis. This new data sparked two of the five covering brokerage analysts to raise their fourth-quarter profit projections. The consensus estimate calls for the company to have earned $1.18 per share, 14 cents more than the average estimate of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 89 cents per share. XEC has exceeded expectations for two consecutive quarters. Cimarex Energy is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Feb 20, before the start of trading.
"
1564,TJX,"Denbury Resources (DNR  -  Free Report) recently announced a 12% increase in its oil and natural gas reserves. The company also anticipates that its fourth-quarter production levels were above those reported for the third quarter. In response, two of the 10 covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts, pushing the consensus earnings estimate up a penny to 34 cents per share. DNR has topped expectations three times in the past four quarters, though its first-quarter results were 10 cents below expectations. Denbury Resources is scheduled to report on Thursday, Feb 21, before the start of trading.
"
1565,TJX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Feb 18 - 22
"
1566,TJX,"Half of the covering brokerage analysts have lowered their fourth-quarter profit projections on Champion Enterprises (CHB) within the past month. The  consensus earnings estimate of eight cents per share is two cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at seven cents per share. The downward revisions reflect concern about the adverse impact the credit crunch is having on manufactured home sales. CHB has missed twice during the past four quarters. CHB will report on Tuesday, Feb 19, after the close of trading.

The company upped its earnings guidance on strong sales, calling for a first-quarter earnings range of 47 to 49 cents per share.

1575,TJX,"Robust Sales
"
1576,TJX,"The company posted April sales of $1.43 billion, up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated comparable store sales increased by 3%. 
"
1577,TJX,"President and Chief Executive Officer Carol Meyrowitz said, We are very pleased that customer traffic has continued to increase significantly across virtually all of our brands, which led to April comparable store sales increasing by 3%, above our expectations. This was achieved on top of strong performance last year and despite one less selling day in April this year due to the Easter calendar shift. We attribute the strength in our business to the extreme value that we are offering customers on rapidly turning assortments of great brand names and fashions.
"
1578,TJX,"After delivering above-plan sales in February and March, the company upped its earnings guidance on strong April sales, calling for a first-quarter earnings range of 47 to 49 cents per share. Analysts responded by boosting the average earnings projection from 39 cents to 49 cents in just 1 week. 
"
1579,TJX,"For the current year, analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.97 per share, up from last weeks $1.91. Analysts are projecting earnings of $2.14 per share for the following year. A week ago, estimates stood at $2.09.
"
1580,TJX,"Industry-leading Stats
"
1581,TJX,"TJXs return on equity (ROE) of 41% more than doubles the industry average of 16%. The companys net profit margin of 5% tops the industry average of 3%. TJX pays an annual dividend of 44 cents per share, yielding an industry-leading 1.6%.
"
1582,TJX,"The bond markets and most government offices will be closed on Monday, Nov 12, in observance of Veteran's Day. The U.S. stock exchanges will be open, however. (Thanks to all veterans and current members of military for your service.)
"
1583,TJX,"Third-quarter earnings season shifts to the retailers with Dow components Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT  -  Free Report) scheduled to report. Joining them will be Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), Macy's (M  -  Free Report), TJX (TJX  -  Free Report) and 19 other retailers. In total, we have confirmed scheduled reports from 175 companies, 14 of which are in the S&P 500.
"
1584,TJX,"Coincidently, October retail sales data will be released by the Department of Commerce on Wednesday morning. In addition, October PPI and September business inventories will also be released around the same time. Thursday will feature the November New York and Philadelphia Fed surveys in addition to October CPI. October industrial production and capacity utilization numbers will be published on Friday.
"
1585,TJX,"The week's data may not have an impact on the market direction, however, because both stock and oil prices are being driven by emotion right now. The portfolio problems that banks are incurring are clearly worse than what has previously been stated and there is a lot of uncertainty about the how big problem really is. At the same time, concerns about the geopolitical situation and pure speculation have driven up the price of oil to new highs. Sentiment can push the market both too low and too high, and it is often difficult to predict when rationality will replace emotional trading. This said, I don't foresee the markets going below the lows set in August.
"
1586,TJX,"Third-Quarter Earnings Performance
"
1587,TJX,"As third-quarter earnings season nears an end, the rate of growth is better than what we had expected in early September. The median S&P 500 company achieved an 11.4% increase in earnings, about 250 basis points above the consensus expectations at the start of earnings season. Positive surprises have outnumbered negative surprises by a ratio of 2.6:1, which is a bit worse than last quarter, but still good overall.
"
1588,TJX,"The numbers for the S&P 1500 Composite (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) are similar. Median growth is running at 10.3% and positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a ratio of 2.1:1.
"
1589,TJX,"Fourth-Quarter Earnings
"
1590,TJX,"Looking ahead to the fourth-quarter, we expect the median company within the S&P 500 to achieve 8.9% growth. The inherent problem with this forecast, however, is that earnings estimates for the financial sector are continuously dropping. Simply put, there is not a Q4 2007 or a 2008 EPS forecast for banks that I would trust right now.
"
1591,TJX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Nov 12 - Nov 16Network Appliance (NTAP  -  Free Report) has exceeded expectations twice during the past four quarters. Its fiscal first-quarter earnings were inline with expectations. Though the consensus expectations have not changed for NTAP's fiscal second-quarter, the most accurate estimate suggests a positive surprise could be forthcoming. The most accurate estimate calls for per share earnings of 18 cents versus the consensus estimate of 16 cents. Network Appliance is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Nov 14, after the close of trading.
"
1592,TJX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Nov 12 - Nov 16PetSmart (PETM) recently lowered its third-quarter guidance to an adjusted range of 21 to 24 cents per share. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts cut their forecasts in response, resulting in a consensus earnings estimate of 23 cents per share and a most accurate consensus of 22 cents per share. Though the pet retailer has a record of either meeting or beating expectations, it seems logical that if consumers are cutting back on personal spending, they are probably also cutting back on what they are spending on their pets. Thus, there is a legitimate risk of additional cuts to earnings estimates following PETM's earnings announcement. PetSmart is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Nov 14, after the close of trading.

"
1598,TJX,"Earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid for both this year and next, on both a median firm basis and on a total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for both the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 12.80%. Both growth rates have held steady over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.2% versus 10.4% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 10.4% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near term recession. 
"
1599,TJX,"We would point to one methodological point however, which could be inflating the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies.
"
1600,TJX,"Note that unlike the growth rates in the Earnings Scorecard below, the numbers in this table represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms, not just those which have already reported. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing more than 33% this year and over 16% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is near the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors   Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)   account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. However, its a bit of a moving target for the super majors, as estimates for both years are being revised upward. 
"
1601,TJX,"The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very larger insurance losses in 2006 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the total earnings than the Energy and Materials sectors combined.

1603,TJX,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month stands at 1,170, which is markedly down from the 1,596 reported last week and the 2,702 reported two weeks ago. This is a normal seasonal slowdown as earnings season winds down. 
"
1604,TJX,"In each of the last five weeks, positive analyst revisions have outnumbered negatives. During the last three weeks however, the revisions ratio has been materially declining. Last week saw a huge drop off, from 1.35 to 1.08. This week, the drop off was much more modest, from 1.08 to 1.06. The change in the revisions ratio could simply mean that the tail end of earnings season saw a large number of negative revisions and the rolling average format is just now revealing the severity. As the weeks go by, fewer and fewer revisions are recorded and the ones recorded when the last batch of companies reported are steadily gaining more weight in the ratio. Regardless of the mechanics however, the declining ratio is a clear yellow flag regarding full-year EPS growth estimates. 
"
1605,TJX,"Lets not forget though, that the revisions ratio is just one metric used to illustrate the change in overall analyst expectations. The average four-week change in current year EPS estimates is another useful metric and remains slightly positive at 0.58%. While this pretty much mirrors the revisions ratio (both slightly positive), it can also paint a very different picture. For example, in utilities the four-week EPS increase is a slightly positive 0.23%. The revisions ratio on the other hand is a dismal 0.58. The difference is Dynergy (DYN), which saw its fiscal 2006 EPS estimates increase 53% over the last four weeks. Without Dynergy, the utilities sector would have recorded a 0.71% decrease in full-year EPS estimates. 
"
1606,TJX,"It is important to utilize multiple metrics in order to get the full story. Just because revisions are down does not mean that overall growth estimates are down. Full-year median growth estimates are actually slightly higher this week, up to 11.5% from 11.2%. It seems that, over the prior four weeks, the average 4-week EPS change has told a more accurate tale than the revisions ratio. Of course this will vary from week to week depending on the severity and directions of analyst revisions. The number of firms being revised up for 2006 also slightly exceeds the number being revised down, and the ratio of 1.13 is in line with the revisions ratio. Like the revisions ratio, this number has also declined significantly over the last month, but remains in positive territory.
"
1607,TJX,"Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Health Care saw a large drop-off this week, from 1.5 to 0.94. Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), both with 16 downward revisions, led the downturn. Other poorly performing sectors included utilities, consumer staples, and industrials, with ratios of 0.58, 0.55 and 0.35 respectively. 
"
1608,TJX,"Only two sectors over the last four weeks have had more firms with downgraded estimates than upgraded: Utilities and Consumer Staples. In the Consumer Staples sector, Costco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) unfortunately helped bring the sector down, each having over ten analysts cut estimates within the last four weeks. Both are retailers which cater to consumers at or below the median income. While we dont want to make too much of a few weeks worth of numbers, it could indicate that the lack of economic progress by Joe Sixpack in the current recovery is finally catching up to the business which serve him. On the other hand, several retailers with just a bit higher target market, including TJX (TJX  -  Free Report), Kohls (KSS  -  Free Report) and J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), which are all in the Consumer Discretionary sector, all saw strong upward revisions. In Utilities, it was Consolidated Edison (ED  -  Free Report) and Nisource (NI  -  Free Report) that led the freefall.

1610,TJX,"Looking ahead to next year the story is much the same, although the revisions ratio has dropped from 1.11 last week, to 1.06. Two weeks ago the ratio was 1.26. While the ratio is still above one, the decline is significant, particularly if it continues to trend downward. If the bursting of the housing bubble does prove to be a serious problem for the economy, most of the effect will be felt in 2007, not in 2006. No need to sound the alarm bells yet, but I would start getting very concerned if this ratio fell below 0.80 in the coming weeks. Materials, financial services and industrials are the revision ratio laggards regarding next years estimates. As with 2006, Energy and Telecom lead the pack.

"
1612,TJX,"With 95% of the S&P 500 reported, the second quarter earnings season is all but complete. Since last week, no new companies have reported, though there has been slight downward earnings revision activity. 
"
1613,TJX,"To recap the quarters results, there was healthy overall earnings growth along with a sky-high positive to negative analyst surprise ratio. The median company grew earnings almost 13% during the quarter. To keep these numbers in perspective, remember that this year all companies must fully expense employee stock options, while last year it was up to the company. Thus the 13% growth actually understates the true economic growth by a few percent. The Energy sector was far and away the earnings leader, posting an amazing 65.6% median growth rate, quarter-over-quarter. The next two leading sectors, industrial and telecom, lagged well behind with growth rates of 18.6% and 16.9% respectively. For the quarter, positive earnings surprises have outnumbered negatives by nearly four to one. 
"
1614,TJX,"Looking forward to the third quarter, EPS growth is expected to slow to just over 9%. Much of this slowdown is due to tougher comps in the energy sector, which is expected to post a still enviable median growth rate of 25%. Utilities and Tech are also expecting a slow down, with growth estimates at 7.8% and 5.7% respectively. Only the industrial and telecom sectors are expecting more favorable growth rates during the coming quarter. 
"
1615,TJX,"For the full year, median EPS growth is expected to come in at 11.5%. This is a slight upward revision from last weeks 11.2%. The growth leaders should be, as expected, the energy sector. The materials and industrials sectors should also post solid year over year EPS comparisons at 24% and 16.7%, respectively. The years laggard is expected to be Utilities, with an estimated year-over-year growth rate of 3.2%. Continued downward estimate revisions have plagued the utilities sector across the board, as is the case with companies like Progress Energy (PGN) and Nisource (NI  -  Free Report).

1617,TJX,"Market Cap versus Total Earnings
"
1618,TJX,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1619,TJX,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
1620,TJX,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.5%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
1621,TJX,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.6% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.6% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 14% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.6%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase. Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd. Even though the NASDAQ is at only 40% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
1622,TJX,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 21.6% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 43.3% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index. In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 9.8x 2006, and 9.3x 2007 earnings. Tech on the other hand is trading for 20.7x 2006 and 17.7x 2007 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.0x and 13.6x, respectively.

"
1627,TJX,"The central banks have been moving to stave off a potential credit crunch by pumping money into the banking system. The action is being caused by a growing number of financial firms who are encountering liquidity problems. Central bankers seem be aware that many recessions have been caused by a sudden swing from hubris to a credit crunch as rationality reappears; the recent moves to put more liquidity into the system is clearly an attempt to prevent history from repeating itself.
"
1628,TJX,"Although down materially on Thursday and continuing to decline as I write this on Friday morning, the U.S. markets remain in pretty strong shape. For the week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are essentially flat with the Dow down slightly. Relative to 12 months ago, all three indexes are up by double-digit margins. Such returns are hardly a sign of fear being priced into stocks.
"
1629,TJX,"August has historically been a tough month for stocks. The combination of earnings season ending and summer vacations leads to increased volatility and a lack of catalysts driving stock prices higher.

Thursday features July housing starts and the August Phili Fed index. The preliminary University of Michigan consumer confidence index will be issued on Friday.
"
1632,TJX,"Will any of the earnings or economic data matter? Its hard to say. The markets got a lift from Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) bullish report, but the gains were reversed by new credit worries. Probably, the best thing that can happen right now is a takeover of a large-cap company by a private equity firm, as this would reassure investors that the M&A market has not closed its doors. But given the current environment, this probably wont occur, so investors should keep some Dramamine by their side.

Combined, these revisions have pushed the consensus estimate up two cents to $2 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at $2.03 per share.

Brokerage analysts have not yet adjusted their forecasts in response to the new guidance, though the consensus estimate of 36 cents per share is two cents higher than the average projection of a month ago. The TJX Companies is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 14, before the start of trading.

The company said that revenues fell, on a sequential quarterly basis, to a range of $684 to $688 million and GAAP earnings would be between eight to nine cents per share. NTAP said the weak performance was caused by continued softness in enterprise storage spending. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts slashed their forecasts in response, causing the consensus estimate to plunge by seven cents to 10 cents per share. The networking equipment company beat estimates last quarter, but has missed twice during the past four quarters. Network Appliance is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 15, after the close of trading.

"
1643,TJX,"With over 29% of the S&P 500 reported, the third-quarter earnings season is well underway.  The results thus far have been undeniably positive.  Median reported EPS growth sits at nearly 11% and positive surprises outnumber negatives by over 5:1.  As the Dow continually reaches for new highs, its clear that the market has taken a sharp turn from the worry days of mid-summer.  As reports ramp up, the lagging corporate performance indicator will come into much clearer focus.  These results will help dictate whether or not the markets newfound enthusiasm has a leg to stand on.  
"
1644,TJX,"So far, the sectors seeing the largest number of companies reporting have been Financials and Consumer Discretionary.  Both sectors have performed well, with positive to negative surprise ratios of 5:1 and 9:1, respectively.  Another top performer, the Materials sector is leading the pack in terms of median growth.  Of the 20% of Materials companies reported, the median firm has grown EPS at nearly 46%, quarter over quarter.  This number is expected to fall off sharply however as new reports come in.  Median Q3 growth for all Materials firms listed in the S&P 500 is expected to come in at a still solid 21%.
"
1645,TJX,"For the full S&P 500, analysts are expecting 10% median third-quarter growth.  Just two weeks ago, the expected growth was 8.6%.  If this growth rate proves accurate, it will be slightly lower than the 12.9% seen last quarter.  If on the other hand, positive surprises continue at the rate seen so far, the growth rate would be very similar.  Going into each of the last two quarters, growth was expected to be much lower than it later proved to be.  That pattern seems to be repeating itself.  
"
1646,TJX,"The largest comparable growth drop this quarter is expected to come from the Energy sector.  Last quarter, the sector boasted 65.6% growth.  This quarter however, it is only expected to deliver 21.2% growth, although that should still put it at the top of the chart. On the plus side, lower energy prices bring operating costs down across the board and give consumers more discretionary cash flow.  Consequently, both Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples have logged favorable third-quarter results thus far, and further positive results could more than pick up the slack caused by lagging energy comps.

1649,TJX,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month was 1,714.  This is down from the 3,243 seen at the peak of the second quarter reporting season, but up significantly from just a few weeks ago.  In the coming month, we should once again test this peak as more quarterly reports are released.  
"
1650,TJX,"Over the last four weeks, there were 904 upward revisions and 810 downward.  This makes for a total revisions ratio of 1.12, up from last weeks 1.04.   The uptrend has continued now for several weeks and the 2006 revisions ratio has held solid above 1.  Continued positive EPS surprises could boost the ratio back to levels we saw during the peak of Q2 earnings reports.  Two months ago, for example, the ratio was 1.57. 
"
1651,TJX,"Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Energys ratio is at the bottom of the barrel, at 0.33.  Three weeks ago, energys ratio was 1.15.  Negative revisions were across the board here, from the super majors  Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)  to the independents (Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) to the drillers and refiners (Rowan (RDC  -  Free Report) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report)).  The weakness in oil and gas prices is the clear catalyst causing the slide.  On the upside of the revisions story, Consumer Discretionary has made its way to the front of the pack with an admirable ratio of 1.62.  Revisions were across the board, with middle income catering retailers like JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and TJX (TJX  -  Free Report) benefiting the most.  Two companies being downwardly revised however, were Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowes (LOW  -  Free Report).  Analysts are expecting both to be negatively impacted by the cooling housing market and have revised full-year 2006 and 2007 estimates downward.

1653,TJX,"Looking ahead to next year, the revisions ratio is slightly lower, at 0.96.  This ratio has been trending upward over the last few weeks and sits slightly above our last reported number, 0.89.  If full-year 2007 revisions stay positive as the total number of revisions pick up, we could see this metric revisiting its second quarter highs.  Two months ago for example, the ratio was 1.33.  If the ratio continues its ascent, I will become much more positive about the outlook for both the economy and the market.  
"
1654,TJX,"The bright point this week regarding 2007 revisions is clearly Consumer Staples.  The sectors ratio has reached 1.39.  Food product distributors McCormick (MKC  -  Free Report) and Conagra (CAG) both showed strong upward revisions, as did the more consumer focused General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report).  Other sectors seeing higher revisions ratios from the previous week were Utilities and Industrials.  Energys ratio was slightly higher than last week, though still a dismal 0.38.

"
1656,TJX,"On a full-year1  basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid.  Double digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis.  On a median basis, growth for the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 13.5% and 12.9%, respectively.  This growth rate has stayed relatively stable over the last several weeks.  On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.3% versus 10.2% next year.  While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 10.2% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near term recession.   Further, with the revisions ratios of both 2006 and 2007 near 1.0, a significant deterioration of the expected growth rate does not look likely at this point. 
"
1657,TJX,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates.  The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings.  Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase.  In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock.  These repurchases shrink the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies.  As mentioned above, stock options expensing counteracts this effect, and depresses the 2005 versus 2006 EPS comparisons.  
"
1658,TJX,"Unlike the growth rates in our Earnings Scorecard, the numbers in the table below represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms.  Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 34% this year and nearly 20% next year.  However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is at the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis.  The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors (XOM, CVX, COP) account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings.  Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip.  The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007.  
"
1659,TJX,"Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector.  This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2005 due to the storms.

"
1661,TJX,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization.  This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1662,TJX,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2005, 2006 and 2007, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
1663,TJX,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, with a weight of 21.5%, it has more influence than the Consumer Staples, Utilities, Materials and Telecom sectors combined. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.3% of the total expected earnings for 2006, or more than the total earnings of the Tech, Industrial and Utility sectors combined.
"
1664,TJX,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.5% of total earnings for 2006, but represents only 9.3% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to 14.0% in 2007, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Clearly at 9.3%, Energy is far from being in a bubble phase.  Frankly, I find the notion of an Energy stock bubble to be absurd.  Even though the NASDAQ is at only 50% of its early 2000 peak, a much stronger case could be made for Tech being bubbly than for Energy.
"
1665,TJX,"Looked at another way, Energy will provide 20.2% of the total incremental earnings in the S&P 500 this year, while that is down from the 44.0% of the total it provided last year, it is still far above its weight in the index.  In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 10.1x 2006, and 9.5x 2007 earnings.  Tech on the other hand is trading for 22.2x 2006 and 18.9x 2007 earnings.  The S&P is trading for 15.7x and 14.3x, respectively.  The P/E for 2007 equates to an earnings yield of 7.0% which is very attractive relative to a 10 year t-note yield of 4.78%.  The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

"
1668,TJX,"As the third quarter draws to a close, the number of estimate revisions is near a seasonal low point. That does not mean that estimate revisions are no longer significant. The total number of downward revisions over the last month now exceeds the total number of upward revisions. This is true for both this year and next year. This is the first time this year that this has occurred for stocks within the S&P 500. 
"
1669,TJX,"With the tail end of the second quarter earnings season behind us, third quarter earnings reports are already beginning to trickle in. Seven companies have reported thus far in what we define as the third-quarter: any reporting period ending in August, September or October. As a precursor to the coming season, numbers reported thus far look solid, with a median analyst EPS surprise of 9.4%. All seven firms reported higher than expected earnings.
"
1670,TJX,"On a full-year basis, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain solid. Double-digit gains are expected on both a median firm and total net income basis. On a median basis, growth for both the current and next fiscal year is expected to be 12.80% and 12.90%, respectively. Both growth rates have stayed relatively stable over the last several weeks. On a total earnings basis, the growth rates are more skewed towards this year, at 15.5% versus 10.7% next year. While the total growth rate is certainly predicted to slow, by no means is a 10.7% year-over-year growth rate tantamount to predicting a near-term recession. On the other hand, if the recent trend toward more downward revisions than upward revisions continues, those high expected growth rates will deteriorate.
"
1671,TJX,"We would point to a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. The rates are based on the forecasts of EPS, and then multiplied by current shares outstanding to get total earnings. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchase. In the first half, over $216 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. The shrinks the number of shares outstanding and boosts the EPS growth rate. Add in dividends paid out and over 80% of earnings were returned to shareholders rather than reinvested by the companies. Counteracting that for this year is the requirement that all firms now include employee stock options as an expense.
"
1672,TJX,"Note that unlike the growth rates in the Earnings Scorecard below, the numbers in this table represent the expected growth for all of a sectors firms, not just those that have already reported. Energy is expected to post rock-solid growth for both years on a median basis, with earnings climbing over 33% this year and over 17% next year. However, there is a real disparity for 2007 in the Energy sector, where it is near the front of the pack on a median firm basis but near the back on a total earnings basis. The key to that difference is that a handful of giant super majors   Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhilips (COP  -  Free Report)   account for over half of the sectors total expected earnings. Their earnings are currently expected to be flat to slightly down in 2007 relative to 2006, while the oil service and many of the E&P firms are expected to continue growing at a rapid clip. However, its a bit of a moving target for the super majors, as estimates for both years are being revised upward. The Materials sector shows a similar disparity for 2007. Going the other way, total earnings growth in 2006 is much higher than median growth from the Financial Services sector. This is largely due to the very large insurance losses in 2006 due to the storms. The Financial Services sector has more firms in it, and accounts for more of the S&Ps total earnings than the Energy and Materials sectors combined.

"
1674,TJX,"The total number of 2006 earnings revisions over the past month stands at 1,077, which is slightly down from the 1,170 reported last week and markedly down from the 1,596 and 2,702 reported two and three weeks ago, respectively. This was a normal seasonal slowdown as earnings season came to a close. 
"
1675,TJX,"Consistently this year, positive analyst revisions have outnumbered negatives. This week however, the story was a bit different. There were 479 upward revisions and 598 downward. This makes for a total revisions ratio of 0.80, a clear red flag. Three weeks ago the ratio was 1.35 and has since declined every week until finally dropping below one in the current week. Keep in mind however that this is occurring at a time when the total number of revisions is at a seasonal low point. If this persists as the third quarter earnings season gets underway, and total revisions start to pick up, it will be very serious indeed. The strong forecasted earnings growth is perhaps the single most important piece of evidence pointing to a strong economy in 2007. The low revisions ratio is the canary in the coal mine indicating that this pillar is perhaps not as strong as previously thought.
"
1676,TJX,"Remember, over two times as many analyst revisions went into the revisions ratio three weeks ago than did at todays number. Regardless of the mechanics however, the declining ratio is still a red flag and the fact that seven of 10 S&P industry sectors have ratios below one is a clearly bearish indicator. 
"
1677,TJX,"The revisions ratio is just one metric used to illustrate the change in overall analyst expectations. The average four-week change in current-year EPS estimates is another useful metric and remains slightly positive at 0.51%. To get a clearer picture, we remove the highest and lowest estimate revisions over the past four weeks (Fords EPS was revised into the negatives while Cienas (CIEN  -  Free Report) EPS was revised upward by over 450%). The resulting average 06 analyst EPS change over the last four weeks would have been  -0.21%. The revisions for Ciena were totally responsible for the Tech sectors strong showing on that metric. This pretty much mirrors the revisions ratio in being a bearish signal, though not quite as negative.
"
1678,TJX,"Looking more closely at individual revisions ratios, Health Care continued to see a large number of downward revisions, with its ratio falling from 0.94 last week to the current 0.78. The decline was helped along by continued downward negative revisions for Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report). Other poorly performing sectors included Consumer Staples, Materials, and Industrials, with ratios of 0.62, 0.58, and 0.44 respectively. 
"
1679,TJX,"In the Consumer Staples sector, Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) unfortunately helped bring the sector down, each having more than five analysts cut estimates within the last four weeks. Both are retailers which cater to consumers at or below the median income. While we dont want to make too much of a few weeks worth of numbers, it could indicate that the lack of economic progress by Joe Sixpack in the current recovery is finally catching up to the business which serve him. On the other hand, several retailers with just a bit higher target market, including TJX (TJX  -  Free Report), Kohls (KSS  -  Free Report) and J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), which are all in the Consumer Discretionary sector, all saw strong upward revisions.

"
1681,TJX,"Looking ahead to next year the story is much the same, although the revisions ratio has dropped from 1.06 last week, to 0.91. Three weeks ago the ratio was 1.26. While the ratio is barely below one, the decline is significant, particularly if it continues to trend downward. If the bursting of the housing bubble does prove to be a serious problem for the economy, most of the effect will be felt in 2007, not in 2006. No need to sound the alarm bells yet, but I would start getting very concerned if this ratio fell below 0.80 in the coming weeks (especially as the total number of revisions picks up). Materials, Financial Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the revision ratio laggards regarding next years estimates. As with 2006, Energy and Telecom lead the pack. The recent decline in energy prices may cause Energy to lose its leadership position in the revisions ratio rankings in coming weeks.

"
1683,TJX,"With 96% of the S&P 500 reported, the second quarter earnings season is all but complete. Since last week, only three new companies have reported. The remaining unreported companies, such as Bausch & Lomb (BOL) and Altera (ALTR), have delayed their fillings due to options-related accounting and other factors.
"
1684,TJX,"To recap the quarters results, there was healthy overall earnings growth along with a sky-high positive to negative analyst surprise ratio. The median company grew earnings over 12% during the quarter. To keep these numbers in perspective, remember that this year all companies must fully expense employee stock options, while last year it was up to the company. Thus the 12.3% growth actually understates the true economic growth by a few percent. The Energy sector was far and away the earnings leader, posting an amazing 65.6% median growth rate, quarter-over-quarter. The next two leading sectors, industrial and telecom, lagged well behind with growth rates of 18.6% and 16.9% respectively. For the quarter, positive earnings surprises have outnumbered negatives by nearly four to one. 
"
1685,TJX,"Looking forward to the third quarter, EPS growth is expected to slow to just over 9%. Much of this slowdown is due to lower comparable commodity prices in the energy sector, which is expected to post a still enviable median growth rate of 25%. Utilities and Tech are also expecting a slow down, with growth estimates at 7.8% and 5.7% respectively. Only the materials and telecom sectors are expected to record more favorable third-quarter growth rates.
"
1686,TJX,"For the full year, median EPS growth is expected to come in at 11.5%. This is unchanged from last week but up slightly from the 11.2% seen two weeks ago. The growth leader should be, as expected, the energy sector. The materials and industrials sectors should also post solid year over year EPS comparisons at 23.3% and 16.4%, respectively. The years laggard is expected to be Utilities, with an estimated year-over-year growth rate of 3.2%. Continued downward estimate revisions have plagued the utilities sector across the board, as is the case with companies like Progress Energy (PGN) and Nisource (NI).
