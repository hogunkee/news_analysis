8,LNT,"Utility stocks are providing much more than dividend payments in the current market. They hold four of the top 10 industry group spots with many components forming bases, sporting high Composite Ratings and showing accumulation. Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?Alliant Energy (LNT) has a Composite Rating of 91, helped by a strong Relative Strength Rating of 94. An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- and Up/Down Volume of 1.5 show a stock that has been getting steadily accumulated. Add on top of that a 3.4% dividend yield and the utility gets even more attractive.The company broke out of a cup with handle at 68.90 Tuesday, despite missing both earnings and revenues estimates. The company reported after the close Monday. In an earnings conference call Tuesday morning, the Midwest utility explained a 17 cents per share variance due to temperature that turned the morning's drop in share price to a breakout by the end of the day. Shares continued into 52-week high territory Wednesday but reversed course by the close.Xcel Energy (XEL) sports similar numbers. It has a stronger earnings record but is more sluggish on the Accumulation/Distribution Rating with a C+. At a more than $20 billion market cap, it has earned a frequent spot in the IBD Big Cap 20. The stock broke out in late January at 37.45 and just recently got extended from its buy range. It has a dividend yield of 3.4%.On the thinner side, Northwestern Corp (NWE) and Idacorp Holdings (IDA) both have average daily volume right around 300,000 shares.

15,LNT,"Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at LNT given that, according to its RSI reading of 26.52, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI?RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, LNT’s low RSI value isn’t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late.

24,LNT,"TELUS Corporation (TU  -  Free Report) has announced plans to speed up network services in Lower North Shore and promote development in certain regions of Quebec.The Canadian telecommunications service provider is planning to build Internet Protocol transport infrastructure and add LTE cell towers in Lower North Shore with the help of the federal government’s Connect to Innovate program and the government of Quebec’s Société du Plan Nord.TELUS is committed toward offering the best technology to its clients. The company intends to employ creativity and innovation to counter technical challenges in deploying the network along more than 400 kilometers of the Lower North Shore coastline. The primary hurdle is getting the region connected to the rest of the world through a wireless solution and establishing a land link between Baie-Comeau and Blanc-Sablon in the Quebec region.Such innovative solutions are likely to give 4,700 residents, across 1,750 households and nearly 100 business houses, access to 25 to 75 Mbps of Internet speed as well as mobile services.Furthermore, TELUS will use its technological expertise to connect rural communities across the region by developing a mixed network, combining optic fiber, microwave transmission and cell units. By 2020, the company expects to invest more than $300 million to provide ultra-high-speed Internet access to the entire eastern part of Quebec.TELUS continues to benefit from increased penetration of smartphones, higher average revenue per unit, improved wireless data services and expanding wireline fiber optic networks.  The company expects to see balanced growth in its wireless and wireline businesses owing to substantial investments in high-speed broadband technology and services and its Customer First strategy.Over the past three months, shares of TELUS have lost 3.9% outperforming the industry’s 10.9% decline.TELUS has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

25,LNT,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) — recently announced that the last project of Solar 4 All program has commenced operations. It will be used as backup during extended power outage in Department of Public Works (DPW) building located in Pennington Borough, NJ.Other three solar storage projects of Solar 4 All have already commenced services at Hopewell Valley Central High School, Cooper University Hospital and Caldwell Wastewater Treatment Facility in New Jersey. The Solar 4 All is a 158 megawatt-dc solar program, which is used to develop solar integrated projects to increase reliability of grid resiliency for unplanned prolonged outage.How This Storage System Works?The Pennington DPW solar storage system consists of 1,188-panels, 404-kilowatt-dc solar system with 200 megawatt-hour Tesla Energy lithium-ion batteries for storage. The project can provide power to 65 homes annually directly though grid. During day times, it recharges the batteries along with providing electricity to the building. At night, those batteries are used for supplying power. This way the system ensures emergency power service when required.Prospects in Solar IndustryPer a report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), solar electricity generation in the nation was 211 gigawatt-hour/day (GWh/d), which is likely to increase to 246 GWh/d in 2018. In spite of the rapid uptake, solar contributed just 1.3% of the total U.S. utility-scale generation in 2017, indicating immense scope for growth in the solar market.Realizing the fact that alternative energy will gain traction in the future, many utility providers have recently shifted their focus toward renewables as their preferred source of energy. Being no exception, Public Service Enterprise is also expanding its renewable assets apart from focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure.   With solar energy being a key area in the renewables space, the company is rapidly expanding its base in solar. As of Dec 31, 2017, PSEG Power owned and operated 414 MW dc of photovoltaic solar generation facilities across various states. To further expand its solar operations and support New Jersey Senate’s bill that requires utilities in the state to source 80% of their electricity from renewable energy by 2050, Solar 4 All seems to be an apt strategic decision by the company.Price MovementPublic Service Enterprise’s shares have returned 16.8% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.8%. Consistent investments in infrastructure projects and focus on expanding renewable assets have boosted Public Service Enterprise’s performance.Zacks Rank & Key Picks Public Service Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Ameren Corp. (AEE  -  Free Report), Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT  -  Free Report) and IDACORP, Inc.

27,LNT,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27. Going by the positive trends, the first quarter is poised to record the strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the S&P 500 members that have already reported are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassing revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview report, overall earnings in the first quarter for all the S&P 500 members are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s concentrate on the domestic-focused matured Zacks Utility sector. This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Autos sector is likely to register an earnings decline.The Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are also focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity.  However, the rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks are also accommodating the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at the Utility stocks, scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 2and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90% in the last reported quarter.

28,LNT,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) recently announced that its subsidiary Duke Energy Carolinas (“DEC”) is set to sell five hydroelectric plants to Northbrook Energy. These small plants are located in the Western Carolinas region and have a cumulative hydroelectricity generation capacity of 18.7 megawatt.The deal, struck through a competitive bidding process, is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019. While the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps, its closure is subject to approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other state regulatory authorities.Details of the DealThese Green/Broad River Basin and Nantahala area–based hydro stations are serving Duke Energy’s customers for a long time in Carolina. However, the company has been incurring higher operations and maintenance cost for these plants.Per the terms, DEC is going to purchase hydroelectricity generated by these plants for next five years from Northbrook Energy. Therefore, customers will continue to receive electricity from Duke Energy at a lower rate, since Duke Energy will no longer have to bear the cost of operation after the closure of the deal.  Shareholders may also enjoy the benefits from this long-term cost-saving initiative undertaken by the company in the form of increased dividend payouts and stock repurchases.Will This Deal Benefit Duke Energy?Hydro, being the first technology used to generate electricity, has been the largest source of renewable electricity in the United States. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), hydro generated more than 7% energy in 2017 and is expected to serve more than 35 million U.S. homes in average by 2050.It goes without saying that hydroelectricity has immense prospects in the Unites States. Evidently, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydropower Vision analysis finds that U.S. hydropower can rise from 101 GW of capacity in 2015 to nearly 150 GW by 2050.Therefore, to make most of the growing opportunities of hydropower, utilities are also shifting to renewables from coal. Duke Energy, being no exception, has also been expanding its renewable asset base.

Total earnings for the 272 S&P members that have released results till now, are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.  This is going to be another busy week with 900 companies expected to release earnings including 134 members of the S&P 500. Combining the results of the 272 S&P 500 members with the index’s 228 members yet to report, we expect total earnings to be up 5.4% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to drop 5.1%. Notably, at present, 10 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline. Read more details in our weekly Earnings PreviewCapital intensive utilities are impacted by rise in interest rates in twice in this year — in March and June. In addition, the hurricanes also adversely impacted the utilities operating in Texas and Florida.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for investors.To maintain their performance level, these utilities are resorting to cost savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and also focusing more on renewables energy to produce electricity to lower emission.  Let us take a sneak peek at the four utility stocks scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 2.Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) surpassed earnings estimates in the previous two quarters, resulting in an average beat of 5.20%.  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

36,LNT,"Alliant Energy Corp (LNT  -  Free Report) received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board to add 1,000 megawatts (MW) wind energy in Iowa by 2020. The company is planning to invest $1.8 billion to boost renewable energy, which can serve approximately 430,000 homes.In 2016, Alliant Energy received approval to add up to 500 MW of wind energy. Currently, Alliant Energy owns and operates four wind firms in the state, while it purchased power from other generators. The company has the capability to serve clean energy to 215,000 homes, which is expected to double once the wind generation assets commence operation.Rising Popularity of Wind EnergyIn the last few years, growth in the U.S. renewable energy industry was influenced by initiatives from the state and federal governments. Energy generation from traditional sources is being replaced by alternative sources — solar, wind, hydro etc. Courtesy of advancements in technology, costs of energy production from renewable sources are lowering. Declining cost and emission-less production are the primary reasons for increasing popularity of renewable sources.Per a recent report by Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), production from wind energy will increase in the near future. EIA expects wind energy to provide 6.4% and 6.9% of total utility-scale electricity generation in the United States in 2018 and 2019, respectively, up from 6.3% in 2017. With increasing asset installation, EIA expects wind to surpass hydro as the major source of renewable electricity generation.Price PerformanceAlliant Energy’s shares have rallied 8.5% in the last 12 months compared with 2.2% rise of the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlliant Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

37,LNT,"Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) is well positioned for long-term growth on strong economic development in its service areas, and ongoing investment in regulated natural gas and renewable energy assets.Alliant Energy has plans to invest nearly $5 billion during the 2018-2021 time frame. The company is successfully completing major construction projects on time and at or below budget. Constructive regulatory environment will enable the company to recover capital expenditures and thus improve earnings.Alliant Energy currently targets long-term annual earnings growth in the range of 5% to 7%. We expect Alliant Energy to keep up the good performance and achieve the earnings growth target on the back of a number of strategic initiatives undertaken by the company.Nearly 98% of the earnings of the company are generated from regulated operations. The regulated nature of Alliant Energy's operation provides strong earnings visibility, which has enabled the company to increase the annual dividend rate for more than a decade.Despite the strong positives, demand for the utility continues to vary with weather conditions, on which the company has no control. Milder summer and winter months could adversely impact earnings and performance of the company.Alliant Energy is subject to extensive environmental regulations at both federal and state levels. This could impact the company’s operations and its ability to recover costs from customers on a timely basis and hence the rate of return.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Alliant Energy have lost 1.7% narrower than the industry's decline of 5.5%.Alliant Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

38,LNT,"U.S. utility provider, Avista Corp. (AVA  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed a deal with its Canadian counterpart, Hydro One Ltd. Per the terms, Hydro One will take over Avista for a total cash of $5.3 billion. The merger is expected to close in the second half of 2018, and is still subject to approval from common shareholders and various regulatory authorities.According to most of the media sources, Avista’s shares took a 17–19% surge soon after the deal surfaced, in after-hour trading.Details of the MergerThe deal is aimed at creating one of North America’s largest regulated utilities, which will serve more than two million customers across the region. The new company will set up headquarters in Toronto.On completion of the merger, Avista will keep its existing corporate headquarters in Spokane, WA. The company’s management team and employees will also retain their positions. Moreover, the company will go on with its operations in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska as a standalone utility.Further, Avista’s operations will continue to be supervised by its own board of directors. This will ensure the protection of the interests of the Pacific Northwest and the communities it serves.Benefits of the MergerAs a result of the merger, Avista’s shareholders will receive $53 in cash per common share, which reflects a 24% premium to the share price as of Jul 18, 2017. The deal will be accretive to Hydro One’s earnings per share in the mid-single digits in the first full year of operation.From a strategic point of view, this acquisition deal will combine two industry-leading regulated utilities with over 230 years of collective operational experience and combined assets worth $25.4 billion. This, in turn, will enable the new entity to provide safer, reliable and high quality energy with a greater scale, diversity and financial flexibility.This merger is a notable one from an economic point of view as well, as it will involve no employee layoff from either of the two companies. Moreover, the rates at which customers of both Hydro One and Avista receive their electricity, will remain unchanged.Our TakeEnergy services in North America were operated under monopoly conditions throughout most of the 20th century. Following Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Energy Policy Act of 1992, deregulation moved into the electricity market in the region. This, in turn, promoted a healthy competitive business environment, encouraging more energy providers to foray into this market.In recent times, the states in the region, particularly those located in the Pacific Northwest, have been experiencing rapid customer and economic growth. To cater to this burgeoning market in here and expand into new lines of regulated utility business outside of its home country, Hydro One chose to take over Avista that has a strong presence in this side of the U.S.We believe this is in sync with the recent trend of continued interest from Canadian investors in US-based utility providers as has been witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Per a report by PWC, there were two inbound deals in the quarter representing 56% of total value in the North American power and utilities deals.Moreover, the combined expertise of these two companies will allow the new entity to deliver cost-efficient and more effective utility services to its customers. Further, since the new entity will not levy the cost of this deal on its customers by raising electricity rates, it may also attract more consumers, apart from boosting investors’ optimism in the stock’s growth expectations.Price PerformanceOver the last one year, Avista has outperformed the Zacks categorized Utility- Electric Power industry. During this period, the company’s shares gained 0.3%, compared with the industry’s loss of 1.6%. This could be because the company’s strong financials enable it to execute investor-friendly measures at regular intervals. Avista also poses strong competition to its peers like Atlantica Yield PLC , Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report) and Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT  -  Free Report).Zacks RankAvista currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend                   Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

43,LNT,"Alliant Energy Corp.’s (LNT  -  Free Report) Iowa Utility recently entered into an agreement with Apex Clean Energy for the construction of the 300-megawatt Upland Prairie Wind Farm, located in Clay and Dickinson counties, IA. The project is expected to power approximately 130,000 homes a year. The farm’s construction is anticipated to commence in the spring of 2018.Other DetailsAlliant Energy expects the wind farm to provide local tax benefits approximately worth $40 million over the life of the project. The company also forecasts to makelease payments of $45 million for the next 25 years to landowners, on account of this project.Notably, the company had received approval to add up to 500 megawatts (MW) of wind energy in 2016. In 2017, it filed for expansion of another 500 MW wind energy from the Iowa Utilities Board, which in turn will add new wind generation of 1,000 MW in Iowa. Cumulatively, the wind energy thus generated will be sufficient to power up to 430,000 Iowa homes a year. The combined projects represent an investment worth $1.8 billion.Our ViewWe believe that the above deal is in line with Alliant Energy’s long-term plans to invest heavily in natural gas and renewable assets over the next 10 years. Evidently, it has plans to invest nearly $11.3 billion over the 2016-2025 time frame. The company is currently concluding major construction projects on time and at or below budget.With the increasing demand for renewable energy resources, companies are adopting clean energy procurement as a strategic business decision to support their growth and business bottom line similar to Alliant Energy’s efforts to introduce cost-competitive wind energy for its customers. The latest project can be expected to boost up its future growth trajectory. Notably, such projects also enhance the company’s service reliability by adding more customers to its grid.Further, its expectation to add more construction and jobs is a testament to the fact that the company is focused to achieve its desired long-term growth through economic development in service areas.Price MovementAlliant Energy’s shares rallied 5.1% in the last three months compared with 4.3% gain of the industry it belongs to.The new electricity rates which were implemented during the month of April bolstered performance.Zacks Rank & Stocksto ConsiderAlliant Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

45,LNT,"We issued an updated research report on Companhia de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo (SBS  -  Free Report) or SABESP on Aug 18.Rising expenses, governmental interference and high debt levels might adversely impact the company’s profitability in the quarters ahead.  In the last month, American Depository Receipts of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock have lost 15.4%, underperforming roughly 2.6% decline of the industry.Here’s why investors seeking exposure in the utilities industry should avoid investing in SABESP:Rising Costs and Currency Translation: SABESP has been suffering from adverse impact of higher costs and expenses over time. In second-quarter 2017, its costs, administrative, selling and construction expenses grew 5.1% over the year-ago period. Also, the company’s results were adversely impacted by incurrence of exchange loss in the quarter. We believe that unwarranted rise in operating expenses as well as adverse impacts from currency translation will dent the company’s profitability.Highly Leveraged: Being highly leveraged, SABESP faces risks from increased financial obligations. Notably, the company had long-term debt of R$10.3 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017. In the first half, net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was 2.07x while net debt to equity was 0.63x.Its debt burden might increase further, as the company will be resorting to institutional financing to fund roughly 26% of its R$13.9 billion investment plan for 2017 to 2021.Governmental Interference: Of SABESP’s share capital, roughly 50.3% is owned by the government of Sao Paulo, giving it the power to select the majority of members comprising the board of directors and senior management.Under such circumstances, regulatory uncertainty or delay by the government in taking any decisions pose substantial hindrance. We believe such unwarranted political or governmental interference can jeopardize the company’s future planning and growth prospects.Stocks to ConsiderSABESP currently has $6.5 billion market capitalization. Better-ranked stocks in the Utilities sector include Fortis Inc. (FTS  -  Free Report), Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) and SJW Corporation (SJW  -  Free Report).

This can be attributable to continued shutting down of coal-fired power plants and addition of a natural gas-fueled plant to lower its carbon footprint.In the last two years, FPL has executed contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, consequently saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers. The company is planning to shut down one more coal unit, subject to approval from Florida Public Service Commission.Through several clean energy initiatives along with focus on increasing production, the company has saved nearly $8.6 billion in fossil fuel costs for customers since 2001.
