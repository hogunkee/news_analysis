281,HSIC,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.6%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 2.5%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health has so far progressed well with its 2018 PBM selling season. Per the last-reported numbers, gross new business wins totaled $6.2 billion while net new business wins grossed $2.4 billion along with an impressive client retention rate. This momentum is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite tough pricing competition, CVS health is currently gaining on high level of service and execution, competitive pricing along with unique integrated model.The company is also upbeat about sustaining the solid year-over-year earnings trend in the first quarter of 2018 on gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The performance is being driven by higher specialty pharmacy and pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation.Management stated that CVS Health’s specialty business is its top priority to help the company expand its customer base. CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, including Specialty Connect.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteFurther, the company expects drug price inflation, product launches and higher utilization to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.CVS Health also projects better-than-expected performance in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back ofscript utilization at retail. The company has projected a 1.5-3.25% rise in consolidated net revenues for the first quarter.Further, a strong flu season has led to the improved outlook. Overall, for the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $45.82 billion reflects a 2.9% increase year over year.Although CVS Health’s Retail/LTC business registered revenue growth after several quarters of a slump in the last reported quarter, there are multiple factors raising concerns. Firstly, the year-over-year growth was just a marginal 0.3%.Further, continued reimbursement pressure, increasing generic dispensing rate andrecent generic drug introductions have been affecting the business. This apart, marketplace changes that kept CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-basis point negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the previously reported quarter.However, CVS Health has been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card.The company also expects to witness revenue growth of 4% to 5.5% and operating profit growth in the low to mid-single digits range, within the Retail/LTC business.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health will beat estimates this earnings season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of +1.94%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CVS Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Please note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.40 reflects a 19.7% increase year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

However, the average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise is pegged at -0.03%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWithin structural heart, we are looking forward to Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN, ACURATE, and IRIS product lines, expected to strongly contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Earlier, the company stated that in2018, it expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to gross approximately $400 million.We are optimistic about the gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, the company has of late, successfully gained within this business on strong sales of WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device and its portfolio of complex PCI (percutaneouscoronary intervention) products.The WATCHMAN platform is anticipated to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.This apart, new launches within IC business like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and the company’s next-generation rotational atherectomy platform called ROTAPRO, are likely to strongly contribute to the top line in the upcoming quarter.We are also upbeat about the company’s ACURATE (TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) program, which has recently completed training of European sales and clinical teams.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote However, ahead of the company’s earnings release for the first quarter, we believe its IC business to be once again deeply impacted by the product recall issue within Europe. Notably, the company has recently announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall, last February.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies.However, the company is expected to face some downsides within this business too in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. These headwinds may come in the form of year-over-year difficult pacer comparisons and more competitions in the drug eluting stent space with some new entrants.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $420 million, 8.5% above the prior-year quarter’s reported count of $387 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the consensus mark of $289 million remains 9.1% ahead of the year-earlier quarter’s reported tally of $265 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific have been facing of late, remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from the international markets, it gets highly exposed to currency fluctuations. This apart, although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States as well as China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports, have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect the top-line numbers in the future.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Together, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Myriad Genetics, Inc.

(HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.34% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (DGX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.19% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

283,HSIC,"Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) Established Pharmaceuticals Division (“EPD”) business has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters. We expect this strength to get reflected in first-quarter 2018 results as well, which are scheduled for release on Apr 18.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q1 performance is expected to be.Key CatalystsThis business majorly focuses on emerging markets. Notably, the key emerging markets include India, Russia, China and numerous others in Latin America as well as Brazil along with other countries. Sales in key emerging markets increased 15% (up 12.5%on comparable operational basis) driven by double-digit growth in India, China and Latin America in the last reported quarter.Moreover, management believes that these emerging markets will continue to offer immense opportunities with favorable demographics.  Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues from key emerging markets of $844 million indicates a rise of 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.Although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports, has raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move may affect their sales performance in China in near term.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote We encouragingly note that, management expects high single-digit growth in EPD sales in the first quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues of $1.09 billion shows a rise of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.Favorable currency translation also had a positive impact of 1.4% on EPD revenues in the last reported quarter. We encouragingly note that, management expects foreign exchange to continue to act as a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.In EPD, Abbott’s consistent focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding product portfolio within core therapeutic areas is targeted specifically to address local market needs. These efforts from the company also continue to strengthen its leadership position in the EPD markets. Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia has contributed to the EPD business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc.

284,HSIC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Henry Schein has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.34, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.93. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Henry Schein’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 24.12 over the past five years. In fact, the current level stands close to the lows for the stock, suggesting that it could be a superb entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.01. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Henry Schein has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.08, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Henry Schein stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Henry Schein has a P/S ratio of about 0.82. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.37 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Henry Schein currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Henry Schein a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Henry Schein might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A. This gives HSIC a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite mixed. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past 30 days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a slightly positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the full year estimate consensus estimate has risen by 1.7% in the past month, while the current quarter has remained unchanged. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Henry Schein, Inc. Price and Consensus  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and Consensus | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteGiven these trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineHenry Schein is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank (among Bottom 17% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader industry factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

285,HSIC,"The medical device tax suspension up to Jan 1, 2020, is one of the very few amendments that have garnered the maximum number of bipartisan votes in the House.Since its enactment in 2013, the 2.3% tax has been quite a menace for the medical device industry. Per a statement by the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, the tax had a significant negative impact on medical innovation and employment. Considering this, the House placed a suspension on the tax from January 2016 to December 2017 only to bring it back on Jan 1, 2018.But recently, the House came up with a $31-billion bill on tax cuts, which included the abatement of the infamous medical device tax.While the MedTech fraternity has been cheering the latest repeal, the share price and net margin performance of the medical device manufacturers is showing a different story. Let’s delve deeper.How Glitzy is the Repeal for MedTech?Innumerable reports claim that the repeal will ramp up domestic production, increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation’s overdependence on offshore production.Further, MedTech bigwigs are expected to enhance the R&D, improve margins, launch products, reduce capital depreciation, invest in early-stage MedTech companies, execute clinical trials and in turn fuel the next generation of U.S. Medical-Device industry by reinvesting profits (tax savings).Notably, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) shelled out a lump sum $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Meanwhile, medical device giant Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) reported net earnings of $1.14 billion and paid approximately $229 million as medical device excise tax in 2015 — nearly 16% of earnings (data from a Med Device Online report). If the tax didn’t exist, analysts believe the companies could have used the cash to expand and improve their pipelines.This drew heavy criticism, compelling the Democrats and the Republicans to lift the tax.History Says a Different StorySince the tax was abolished in 2015-end, the companies were expected to rake in profits and also put up an impressive show on the bourses starting 2016. However, the price performance and margin trend contradicted expectations.In fact, the tax repeal news created quite a stir amongst analysts back in 2016, dealing a blow to shares of medical device manufacturers. Our data shows that the broader Medical-Products industry has underperformed the S&P 500 market in the last two years. The industry’s 31.3% cuts a sorry figure in comparison to the S&P 500’s 34.5%. Here we take a sneak peek at the net margin trend of companies since the last tax repeal. Although no single metric can determine the profitability of a business accurately, investors can count on net margin to get a fair idea of the amount of profit a company is making. A declining net margin post the tax repeal amendment throws light on the enormous risks and costs associated with the R&D and compliance requirements of MedTech manufacturers. This also raises a question on how will the tax repeal provide an impetus to the MedTech space, if it could do nothing significant two years back.5 Stocks Grappling With Declining Prices & Net MarginHere we have five MedTech stocks that have witnessed significant margin contraction despite the tax repeal in 2015.We would like to draw your attention to the share price and net margin performance of companies following the tax’s abolition in 2015.Over the past two years, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has been observed to underperform the broader markets. As per the latest share price movement, the stock lost 7%, comparing unfavorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 35.4%.The company has been facing escalating costs and expenses that are weighing on its margins. Also, the company’s reiteration of 2018 guidance despite the projection of favorable foreign currency translation fails to lift investors’ spirits. Over the past two years, Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has underperformed the S&P 500 index. The stock has lost 18.8%. We are disappointed with the continued deterioration in the company gross, operating and net margins, thanks to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, a tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure weigh on the stock.The U.S. healthcare products and service distribution industry is highly competitive and consist principally of national, regional and local distributors. In the North American dental products market, the company faces stiff competition from Patterson Dental business of Patterson Companies Inc. and Benco Dental Supply.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) share price movement has been disheartening over the past two years. The company has lost 7.1% in the period. A lackluster margin trend over the same time frame indicates the company’s failure to garner profits post the tax repeal.For the days to comeDENTSPLY expects gross and operating margins to remain flat to decline slightly from 2017 levels as underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by adverse foreign exchange and target inventory equipment reduction.Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. (MDRX  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two months. Notably, the stock has returned 5.2%, compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 35.4%. Further, the company’s margins have contracted significantly in the past two years.Allscripts also expects a modest increase in operating expenses. The company faces sluggishness in the international market and competition from larger players.Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two years. The stock has returned just 10.3%, much lower than the S&P 500 market. Further, the company’s margins have declined steeply in the past two years.Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses.Will the latest MedTech tax overhaul paint a different picture for these stocks?Will History Repeat Itself?Our analysis clearly shows that the broader industry hasn’t reacted positively to the tax repeal amendment that was legislated in 2015. If we consider the repeal’s effect on the MedTech space, the trend is expected to continue this time around as well!However, the MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This coupled with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, the strategic application of Artificial Intelligence in every sphere of healthcare can provide boost productivity in the MedTech space. Companies that have adopted AI technologies witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and are expected to record strong margin expansion as well.You never know, the current favorable trend might turn the tables for the MedTech industry!More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

We expect a similar trend in the fourth quarter.Favorable Dental Business Trends: The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is encouraging. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of at least low single-digit growth in North America’s dental consumable merchandise market in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues of $3.31 billion reflects an increase of 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.The company banks on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Starting Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to a considerable extent. Henry Schien will also continue to represent products from Planmeca, A-dec, Midmark, 3Shape and 3M as well as the dental equipment and consumer product lines of its longstanding partner Danaher under the KaVo Kerr brands.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. Quote Solid Animal Health Portfolio: We are optimistic about the well-diversified Animal Health product portfolio featuring software, diagnostic equipment, and surgical instruments. The solid product offerings have been driving growth domestically as well as globally.Notably, during the fourth quarter, Henry Schein acquired Merritt Veterinary Supplies and integrated it into its Animal Health business. Merritt has 4,500 veterinary clinics in Eastern United States, with a strong presence in the Southeastern part of the nation. The company offers a comprehensive line of products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and equipment. However, according to Henry Schein, this acquisition will drive earnings post 2017.Growing Medical Business: Henry Schein is consistently working on boosting its Medical segment. Notably, worldwide Medical revenues rose 8% year over year in the last reported third quarter. In October, the company inked an agreement with Cerebral Assessment Systems to distribute Cognivue. This is the first computerized cognitive assessment screening device cleared by the FDA for the detection of early signs of dementia. We believe this development will bolster growth for the company in the field of mental cognitive diseases.In the same month, the company announced an exclusive distribution agreement with Terason to distribute the latter’s uSmart 3200T NexGen. This development remains part of Henry Schein Medical’s Emergency Medical Services business.Broad Distribution Network: We are also upbeat about the company’s widespread distribution network. Apart from North America and Europe, the company has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in emerging nations like China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margin performance over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to the woes. Also, the entry of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States has intensified competition.Overall, Henry Schein expects 2017 EPS in the range of $3.59-$3.61, reflecting 8-9% growth from the 2016 adjusted EPS figure of $3.31.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of -0.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 96 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 97 cents.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of -0.94% makes surprise prediction difficult.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 97 cents, reflects a rise of 3.2% year over year.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +264.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

290,HSIC,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), also known as LabCorp, is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before market opens on Feb 6. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.9%. It has an average earnings beat of 2.3% for the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlaySimilar to last quarter, LabCorp is expected to gain on strength in the LabCorp Diagnostics segment in the fourth quarter  Notably, in the third quarter, revenues at this segment grew primarily banking on favorable price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions and organic volume.After several quarters of a weak show, Covance Drug Development has started to report revenue growth from the third quarter, on the back of the Chiltern acquisition, strong organic growth and favorable foreign currency translation. Chiltern has added highly complementary capabilities to LabCorp’s offerings, including scale expansion in Asia Pacific, broader reach in the fast-growing emerging and mid-tier biopharma customer segment and expertise in oncology drug development. All these factors should continue to benefit LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development topline in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteWe are also looking forward to the company’s latest deal with Agilent to make the latter’s cancer diagnostic test available for expanded use. This development should start to contribute to LabCorp’s top line from the fourth quarter itself. Also the company’s comprehensive laboratory partnership with Capital Health is a positive.As per LabCorp’s earlier-provided guidance for 2017, net revenue is now expected in the band of 8-8.5% year over year. This includes a 10-bps impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10.19 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to remain in the range of $9.40-$9.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.53 is within the guided range.However, over the last two years, LabCorp has faced several reimbursement issues that have hurt revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe reimbursement pressure will affect the company’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.LabCorp has been constantly trying to check the rise in operating expenses, which affected operating margin in the last reported quarter. Chances of a turnaround in the scenario any time soon are slim.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:LabCorp does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for LabCorp is -0.07%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

291,HSIC,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 6, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 23.8%. Moreover, Myriad Genetics beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, the average being 15%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Influencing Q2 ResultsSimilar to last quarter, MyriadGenetics is expected to gain from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance, led by solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests. Per the company, the GeneSight test represents significant opportunities. As GeneSight is placed in a highly under-penetrated preventive care market, the product has huge growth potential. Also, during the last reported quarter, the company announced favorable data from a multi-center, double-blind and randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of the GeneSight Psychotropic test on psychiatric treatment response in 1,200 patients with major depressive disorder. This is expected to stimulate expanded GeneSight adoption and payer coverage. Management expects consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead.We also encouragingly note that, over the last few months, Myriad Genetics has been making encouraging progress with the EndoPredict test. During fiscal 2017, the company received reimbursement approval for EndoPredict in France, Quebec and an increased number of German sites. The company also received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report) in August, within six months of the test launch in the United States.  Notably, full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90% of breast cancer patients. Moreover, according to Myriad Genetics, EndoPredict presents a global market opportunity of more than $600 million annually, with major demand in countries like Canada and the United States.Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA and Prolaris revenues, all of which make up the chunk of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio.The Prolaris testing’s volumes grew in double digits in the last reported quarter as well. We are also encouraged by the company’s receipt of a positive final Local Coverage Determination to expand Medicare coverage of the Prolaris test from Palmetto GBA, a MAC, in the first half of 2017. Moreover, management seems upbeat about the prospects of the Prolaris test as it represents a global market opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion annually.  Myriad Genetics witnessed continued year-over-year growth in Hereditary Cancer volumes, with pricing matching expectations in the last reported quarter. Per management, the company continued to witness a solid sample trend in this space. Last September, the company launched riskScore under its myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing portfolio. Notably, riskScore helps determine a woman's risk of developing breast cancer by combining genetic markers throughout the genome with the patient’s family and clinical history.Management believes that the company is well-positioned in breast cancer testing market for fiscal 2018, courtesy of encouraging Hereditary cancer volumes on steady growth and predictable long-term pricing. Thus, we believe the company is positioned to cash in on the huge potential in the breast cancer screening market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues of $189 million reflects a decline of 4.1% from the year-ago quarter reported number.On the flip side,unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and higher expenses owing to extensive pipeline of some testsmay impact margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Myriad Genetics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Myriad Genetics has an Earnings ESP of -3.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 23 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 24 cents.Zacks Rank: Myriad Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of -3.72% makes surprise prediction difficult.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 24 cents reflects a 7.7% decline from the year-ago quarter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1.

292,HSIC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp.’s (ABC  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled for release on Feb 6, are expected to show steady growth in the pharmaceutical distribution segment, a significant contributor to revenues.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 0.8%. AmerisourceBergen has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 4.6%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.AmerisourceBergen’s earnings in the preceding quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, courtesy of strong growth in Consulting Services, MWI Animal Health and World Courier businesses. Revenues rose almost 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment stands at $38.74 billion for the quarter under review. This reflects an improvement of almost 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Other Factors to ConsiderAmerisourceBergen’s Specialty Group performed impressively over the recent past with revenues rising 10.3% year over year in the last-reported quarter. The upside can be attributed to strong oncology product sales and solid performance by third-party logistics businesses. These factors are expected to play a pivotal role in boosting the segmental revenue in the first quarter as well.Other segment (this segment includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services, World Courier and MWI Veterinary Supply) also performed well in the last quarter. Revenues at the segment were up 12.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a record number of shipments in World Courier and strong volume and revenue growth at MWI. This segment is expected to maintain the performance in the quarter to be reported.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AmerisourceBergen’s first quarter earnings stands at $1.35 per share, down a penny year over year. The company expects EPS growth in the second half of fiscal 2018 to be much better than the first half, courtesy of benefits from the gradual onboarding of the Walgreens Rite Aid stores.The company also expects a slight rise in tax rate in fiscal 2018 as it had seen one-time benefits from R&D tax credits in fiscal 2017.Although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs along with lack of generic inflation, will affect the company’s bottom line.The temporary slowdown in the PharMEDium segment is expected to mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the first quarter. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive edge, it might affect the bottom line in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:AmerisourceBergen has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for AmerisourceBergen is +1.50%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AmerisourceBergen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

293,HSIC,"Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PACB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5%. Pacific Biosciences has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average negative surprise being 1.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key FactorsIn the past quarters, product revenues demonstrated consistent uptrend on strength in consumable revenues. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter product revenue stands at $18.6 million, reflecting an expected year-over-year decline by 10.7%. We believe that the termination of the agreement with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd effective February 2017 is likely to affect revenues in the yet-to-be reported quarter. The agreement had been signed for the development and supply of diagnostic products based on Pacific Biosciences’ Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) technology.Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. Quote Similar to the last two quarters, Pacific Biosciences’ fourth-quarter service and other revenues are expected to decline from the prior-year quarter. The decline was led by higher price RS service contracts being replaced with lower price sequel contracts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for service revenues stands at $3.5 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an expected year-over-year decline of 6.8%.However, the company expects service revenue and service related costs to level out and improve, leading to improved gross margin in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Pacific Biosciences’ fourth-quarter results:For 2017, the company expects 8-10% rise in operating expenses on a year-over-year basis. Further, management projects a loss for 2017 on a reported basis. Meanwhile, operating expenses in the third quarter of 2017 totaled $29.8 million, compared with $29.4 million a year ago. We expect the trend to affect the fourth-quarter bottom line too.The company continues to see significant strength in China business. Sales in China last quarter was more than 30% of the total sales. With China being the fourth-largest developing nation (in terms of nominal GDP), we believe the progress in the country will open up channels for Pacific Biosciences, thereby driving its top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is $22 million, reflecting a 15.4% decline from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 19 cents, narrower than the year-ago loss of 21 cents.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Pacific Biosciences does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Pacific Biosciences is +6.49%.

294,HSIC,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Feb 1.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by four cents delivering a positive earnings surprise of 2.96%. Also, it outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.4%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAfter a phase of sustained drag for several quarters in the company’s revenue per requisition performance, the last couple of quarters saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not. The company’s two Professional Lab Services engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Overall, we believe a lack of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives to continuously affect the company’s volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) till the economy turns around for better.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThis apart, unit price headwinds were less than 100 bps in the third quarter. While unit price challenges hovered in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for the rest of 2017 too.Also, in the last couple of years, Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues hurting its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act. We believe, reimbursement pressure will be reflected as an overhang in the company’s performance this soon-to-be-reported quarter too.Notably in December, the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association (“ACLA”) has come forward to support a lawsuit filed by ACLA against the Acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The lawsuit charged that the CMS, operating under the purview of HHS, has failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system.However, come what may, this leaves no impact on the company’s yet-to-be-reported quarter’s revenue numbers.On a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems well-aligned with its two-point growth agenda to accelerate the same and drive operational excellence.We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to build esoteric testing business and boost profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed a significant improvement via infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. Therefore we expect these growth drivers to replicate the company’s success story in its upcoming quarterly results, having thus remained active throughout, and drive the same primary metrics as well like the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company’s top line in the fourth quarter.The company expects 2017 revenues of approximately $7.71 billion (annualized growth of approximately 3%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is pegged at $7.94 billion, higher than the guided range.Moreover, the company’s 2017 adjusted EPS range remains within $5.62-$5.67. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.96 for the period also remains above the company’s projected range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of -1.74%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

(NTRI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25.Nutrisystem has an impressive track of beating estimates in all the four trailing quarters. Overall, the company’s record is favorable as evident from its four-quarter average positive surprise of 28.47%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this quarter.Factors at PlayNutrisystem’s innovative products are expected to expand customer base that will eventually drive reactivation revenues, which is generated from existing customers after the first nine months of their purchase. However, a sluggish dieting market and intense competition are primary headwinds in the near term.For the third quarter of 2017, management expects revenues in the range of $153 million to $158 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter revenues is currently pegged at $155.0 million, up 24.4%. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $25.6 million to $27.6 million. Earnings per share are expected in the band of 42-47 cents per share.On a positive note, the company portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of Nutrisystem have returned 3.5% as against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.However, overall activities of Nutrisystem during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

In fact, Thermo Fisher’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystThe acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to this Waltham MA-based company’s analytical instruments portfolio from the last two quarters. The acquisition has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteThermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in third-quarter 2017 performance.Overall, the company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the third quarter, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as strong volume leverage and productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments operating income is pegged at $233 million, in line with the sequentially last quarter’s reported number. Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of $1.11 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s third-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the third quarter.The company had spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through the last couple of quarters in 2017. A major development in this field is that Novartis’ chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy Kymriah, the first FDA-approved cell therapy for Leukemia, utilizes Thermo Fisher’s CTS Dynabeads Technology.We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to impressive results. Standout contributors in recent times are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017.Growth is also likely to be seen in applied markets such as, environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is currently betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities. These are advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition continues to impose challenges on the stock’s value.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Thermo Fisher has the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat.

298,HSIC,"Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after market close. The results are expected to show a decline in revenues at the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segment — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly affect its earnings, let us take a look at how things are shaping up before the release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues stands at $23,226 million, reflecting a decline of 3.8% sequentially and 4.8% from the year-ago quarter. This St. Louis, MO-based company is the largest PBM in North America. Although PBM is a highly competitive industry, a report by Market Research projects that the U.S. PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2014 and 2019.Taking this into account, Express Scripts has been consistently trying to expand its core PBM business. The company completed the acquisition of myMatrixx, a pharmacy benefit solution provider for the workers' compensation industry recently. Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth rate between 2% to 4% through 2020 for the core PBM business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales stands at $25,611 billion, up 0.8% on a year-over-year basis.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and Consensus | Express Scripts Holding Company Quote Factors at PlayComing to the major components, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM product network stands at $11,069 million, down 8.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM service revenues stands at $365 million, down 3.2% year over year. Lackluster performance in these segments is likely to mar Express Scripts’ revenues in the third quarter.Coming to the guidance for the third quarter of 2017, Express Scripts expects total adjusted claims in the range of $340 million to $350 million. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total claims stands at $243 million, down 2.1% sequentially.Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88 to $1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.In this regard, Express Scripts announced that its biggest customer, leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract in the third quarter itself.In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging for its drugs and operational failures. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated revenues of $52.6 million, compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Express Scripts has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

299,HSIC,"Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for release on Oct 19, are expected to show steady growth in instruments and accessories revenues — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive its third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 7.8%. Similar to the prior quarter, strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products are expected to be the main factors driving the surge in instrument and accessories revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for instrument and accessories revenues stands at $394 million for the third quarter. This reflects an increase of 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Continued development in European markets, solid access to the company’s products in Asia and new platforms in imaging and advanced instruments are likely to drive revenues at the segment.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteOther Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures is a catalyst for the third quarter. Overall, Q3 revenues are expected at around $752.3 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. Below are the other factors that might influence Intuitive Surgical’s quarterly results this earnings season.Solid Procedure Trends: Expectations of outperformance in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery, is likely to boost the company’s top line. Added to this, solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes is likely to lend Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the third quarter.Geographically, procedure growth in the third quarter is expected to be led by China, Germany and Japan. In Germany, procedure growth is likely to be supported by solid installed base expansion.Furthermore, procedure trends are expected to be solid globally, with growth led by general surgery and global urology segments.Systems & Service Unit Hold Promise: Solid growth in the company’s product and systems segment is expected to drive the company’s third-quarter earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at this segment stands at $216 million, up 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase reflects higher system placements and operating lease revenues.  However, this might be partially offset by lower average selling prices and lease buyout revenues at the segment.Coming to revenues at the services segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $145 million, up 11.5% on a year-over-year basis.Growth in System’s Installed Base: Buoyed by higher system placements and operating lease revenues, we expect the company’s total systems installed base to be 4231 units, up 82 units from the last quarter. It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical generated approximately $6 million in revenues from operating leases last quarter, compared with 4 million in the second quarter of 2016.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Intuitive Surgical does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Intuitive Surgical is -0.49%, as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.96 and the Zacks Consensus Estimates is pegged at $1.97. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intuitive Surgical carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

300,HSIC,"CR Bard Inc.  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings, after market closes on Oct 24. Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.92, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Also, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.03%.Delving into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, Lutonix DCB is used to treat patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the United States. We expect this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $989.8 million, up 5.1%.However, the management expects revenues growth of 5% to 6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the company projects revenues to increase between 6% and 7% from the prior year.Furthermore, the company's investments in emerging markets have strengthened its position internationally. We are also upbeat on the solid contribution from the company’s vascular product line. The urology and oncology segments are likely to drive third-quarter sales.On a positive note, the company portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of CR Bard have returned 1.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.On the flip side, a challenging Med-tech environment, especially in the hernia fixation and peripheral stent businesses raises concerns. The company continues to witness significant pricing pressure as well. Also, unfavorable foreign currency will continue to hurt top- and bottom-line growth.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat either this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CR Bard is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.95.

301,HSIC,"Patterson Companies Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) has had a dismal run on the bourses of late. Year to date, the company has lost 8.8%, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 15.3%.A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, unfavorable price movement, a competitive dental products distribution industry and integration risks pose significant challenges for the company.Political Qualms: The ongoing political conundrum pertaining to the repealing of Obamacare by the Republicans has given rise to uncertainties in the dental space. Last week, the MedTech space received a heavy blow with Trump’s latest ‘Executive Order,’ where he pulled the plug on Obamacare subsidies that reduce net health care costs for Americans with low income again.These legislations and regulations are expected to affect expenditures or reimbursements for dental services through private dental insurance plans. We believe this will mar Patterson’s overall results in the quarters to come.Dental Segment Lacks Luster: Patterson’s dental segment contributes significantly to total revenue every year (42.7% of net revenues in fiscal 2017). However, decrease in sales of CEREC and other digital technology equipment is likely to mar revenues for dental consumables and dental equipment.Furthermore, management at Patterson anticipates headwinds in technology equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018 as the company transitions to its new go-to market strategy with an expanded technology product portfolio.Declining Estimates: The estimate revision trend for Patterson has been unfavorable. For the full and next year, two analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months.As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year inched down 0.9% to $2.29 per share. The next-year earnings estimates dropped 1.2% to $2.48 per share. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteCutthroat Competition: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists principally of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson faces competition from another national full-service firm, Henry Schein Dental, a unit of Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report).In addition, there are at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level and hundreds of small local distributors. Patterson needs to continue to introduce products in the market to counter competition. Failure to do so will dent the company’s market share.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING (SONVY  -  Free Report) and Luminex Corp.

302,HSIC,"ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after markets close on Oct 26. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. with average earnings beat of 1.7% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, ResMed is expected to gain from strong performance in the domestic and international front. The company’s revenues in the domestic front were driven by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth in the previous quarter.Internationally, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism. The company believes this reimbursement grant will drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic revenues (including the contributions from Brightree) of $334 million reflects an increase of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues of $177 million indicates a rise of 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, fiscal first-quarter total revenues are projected at $501 million, up 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. QuoteHere are the other factors that might influence ResMed’s first-quarter results:Management is particularly upbeat about top-line contributions from launches made in the last fiscal and the last reported quarter. The introduced products include the AirFit  N20, the AirFit  F20, AirTouch full face masks, and the world's smallest continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — ResMed AirMini.ResMed continues to progress steadily on the back of its three-pronged growth strategy. In this regard, the company recently announced two tuck-in acquisitions under the Brightree product portfolio — Conduit Technology, LLC and AllCall Connect. Moreover, during the last reported quarter, the company progressed with Brightree's new offering Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for the home health and hospice market. We expect this to get reflected in ResMed’s top line in the first quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brightree revenues of $36.9 million reflects an increase of 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.On the flip side, management expects SG&A expenses margin in the band of 26-27% in the to-be-reported quarter, while it was 26.6% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, R&D expenses margin is projected at 7-8% for first-quarter fiscal 2018 as compared to 6.6% in the preceding quarter. This guidance reflects another quarter of gloomy operating margin scenario.Meanwhile, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from international markets. This exposes the company to foreign currency fluctuations. Notably, in the last reported quarter, foreign exchange movements hurt earnings by 3 cents per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the weaker Euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. This is likely to dent results in the first quarter.Moreover, overall macroeconomic uncertainties are a major obstacle for the company’s international operations.Also, the market for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) products is highly competitive with respect to product price, features and reliability. Other challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement pressure continue to hurt the stock.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:ResMed does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for ResMed is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimates are pegged at 65 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ResMed carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 65 cents reflects a 4.8% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

303,HSIC,"On Oct 13, we issued an updated research report on Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report), a leading distributor of health care products and services across the globe. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of price return performance, over the past month, the stock remained in line with the broader industry.We expect this trend to improve on balanced growth across all four operating segments of Henry Schein. We are also encouraged by the company’s efforts to grow internationally. Apart from North America and Europe, it has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as emerging nations like China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland. Also, the company continues to ride high within its dental business on majorly accretive strategic mergers and integrations. One colossal merger in this field is Poland-based Dental Cremer in 2016.Henry Schein Animal Health’s revenue growth has been consistently supported by niche acquisitions. At the beginning of 2017, the company had made a foray in the Brazilian animal health market with a 51% investment in Tecnew. Around the same time, the company announced its decision to acquire Southern SAS, which in turn might benefit its dental business through controlled and non-controlled pharmaceuticals as well as surgical supplies.Also, Henry Schein might gain from several trends in end markets like customer demographics. The increasing number of lives covered, following healthcare reforms in the United States, is likely to boost the company. Additionally, Henry Schein gains traction in animal health business on the back of tailwinds in North America as well as overseas markets. The burgeoning demand for animal health products in the United States should further drive the company’s growth. On the flip side, escalating costs and expenses continue to be a drag on the company’s margins and the bottom line. A tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure also weigh on Henry Schein’s stock.Key StocksSome better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are QIAGEN (QGEN  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

The company offers a comprehensive line of products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and equipment. Merritt generated revenues of approximately $115 million in 2016.According to Henry Schein, this acquisition will drive earnings per share after 2017.Henry Schein has been consistently trying to expand its Animal Health business.

There was 0.6% contribution from acquisitions during the quarter under review.Margin Trends         Gross profit increased 4.7% to $839.2 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin declined 50 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 27.4% due to a 7.2% rise in cost of sales, higher than the revenue growth rate.  Despite a 4.7% rise in selling, general & administrative expenses of $628.5 million, adjusted operating income improved 4.8% year over year to $210.7 million.

All four of its operating segments delivered strong year-over-year growth. The company’s strong share gains in both the North American and overseas markets along with strong revenues raise optimism.However, despite the better-than-expected earnings performance, we are disappointed with the company’s unchanged EPS guidance for 2017. Meanwhile, the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein’s gross and operating margin was due to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, foreign currency fluctuations continued to mar the company’s financials.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The latest scorecard shows an 11.6% year-over-year increase in total earnings for these members on 5.6% higher revenues. The earnings beat ratio was 74.5% and the revenue beat ratio was 69.2%.What’s in Store for the Medical Space?Medical, one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors, is absolutely no exception to this improvement trend. So far, 83.6% of the members from this sector have released the quarterly earnings results with earnings and revenue beats registered at impressive levels of 87% and 69.6%, respectively. With more and more companies lining up for their earnings announcement, the aggregate growth pace of this sector is expected to pick up further.Notably, the medical device industry boasts some powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sector’s laudable performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities.Let’s find out how five major Medical – Products companies within the broader Medical space are placed ahead of their earnings releases on Aug 8.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report): This renowned healthcare products and service distributor’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is encouraging. Notably, management expects at least mid-single digit growth in North America’s dental equipment market in the second quarter. The company is currently banking on digital dentistry as part of its strategic plan. It is thus busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties.Henry Schein is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult.Based on the Zacks methodology, a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely earnings surprise, while a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.

Also, the company recently received an FDA clearance for 3D revascularization device within its neuro franchise segment.The company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHenry Schein’s first-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments – Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in both North America and overseas markets. We expect a similar trend in the second quarter as well.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteNotably, during the to-be-reported second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighbourhood. This has enabled the company to be a complete solutions provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. In this regard, we note that management expects at least mid-single digit growth in North America’s dental equipment market in the second quarter. The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is thus busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s year-over-year deterioration in gross and operating margin over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.Meanwhile, per management, solid sales in the second quarter are likely to be partially offset by the timing of Good Friday this year. Notably, this international holiday has fallen in the second quarter this year as compared to last year’s timing which was in the first quarter.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to our woes. Also, advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the U.S. adds to the competitiveness in the market.Overall, the company’s reaffirmed its 2017 EPS guidance, reflecting growth of 16–18% from the year-ago period.For the second quarter of 2017, there has been no change in estimate revision over the last 30 days. The same has been observed in the magnitude of estimate revision, with earnings estimates remaining at $1.73 over the same time frame.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Henry Schein this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.73. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Moreover, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.4%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, we are upbeat about solid contributions from Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular business which comprises Interventional Cardiology (IC) and Peripheral Interventions (PI). In the last reported quarter, the company generated 39.2% of its total revenues from the highest revenue generating segment.We are optimistic about the IC business that will help the company maintain impressive global growth, courtesy of an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams. The division performed well in the last reported quarter, despite the LOTUS recall in Europe. Worldwide IC growth came on the back of strength in Structural Heart and complex PCI (percutaneouscoronary intervention) portfolio. However, the upside was partially offset by weak performance by the drug-eluting stents.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteWithin Structural Heart, we are looking forward to Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN, ACURATE and IRIS product lines that are expected to contribute to the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. The company expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to total approximately $400 million in 2018.The WATCHMAN program depicted impressive performance in first-quarter 2018. The product has been used in more than 50,000 implants, worldwide. Moreover, the company expects continued growth in this platform on the back of increased utilization and geographical expansion.Additionally, recent launches within the IC business like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and the company’s next-generation rotational atherectomy platform — ROTAPRO — are expected to contribute significantly to the top line in the upcoming quarterly results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IC revenues is pegged at $658 million, indicating an increase of 9.1% on a year-over-year basis. The company is expected to keep gaining strength in the business.In the last reported quarter, the PI business performed impressively on the back of higher sales of Drug-Eluting Eluvia Stents and Ranger Balloon in Europe. Geographically, the company witnessed strength in Asia as well. Boston Scientific’s Atherectomy Jetstream platform also performed well in the first quarter of 2018.The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter PI revenues is pegged at $296 million,  reflecting a rise of 8.4% year over year.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.47 billion indicates an increase of 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Also, the earnings estimates of 34 cents reflect a 6.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Other Factors at PlayAmong the other segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to surpass market levels, driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies.We are impressed with Boston Scientific’s recent acquisitions that have added several products (though many are under development) with immense potential. NxThera and nVision buyouts in Urology and Pelvic Health along with EmCision buyout in Endoscopy deserve a mention.The company is gradually strengthening its presence in the emerging markets  of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). In first-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered a 17% growth. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year). The company is currently looking forward to an improved performance ahead in China, following the recent approval of SYNERGY in this region.Boston Scientific is gaining traction in India as well. It is currently targeting about 10 emerging markets for additional emphasis. The company is also optimistic about core cardiology segment which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. This trend is expected to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter’s results.However, although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect the top-line numbers in the upcoming quarters.The company also provided second-quarter 2018 financial outlook. Adjusted EPS are expected in the range of 33-35 cents on revenues of $2.450-$2.500 billion. Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

315,HSIC,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical - Dental Supplies sector have probably already heard of Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report) and Merit Medical (MMSI  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system.

Financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Post the announcement, shares of BD inched down 0.04% to $244.55.Per management, the transaction is not expected to be accretive to BD’s financial results in fiscal 2018 or 2019.In the past year, the company’s shares have rallied 24.5% compared with the industry’s rise of 8.2%.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Coming back to the news, TVA Medical develops minimally invasive vascular access solutions for patients with chronic kidney disease who require hemodialysis.The recent integration is likely to boost BD’s core Medical segment.

317,HSIC,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the earlier-announced joint venture (JV) with Internet Brands, a KKR portfolio company, in a bid to fortify its Dental business. The companies have named the joint venture Henry Schein One. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Henry Schein One has integrated the portfolio of practice management systems under its dental practice management software company — Henry Schein Practice Solutions — with Internet Brands’ web-based software applications. The new company is expected to deliver integrated dental technology to help improve practice management, marketing as well as patient communication.Per Henry Schein, the newly formed JV will combine Henry Schein Practice Solutions' products and services like Dentrix, Dentrix Ascend, Easy Dental and TechCentral, Henry Schein's international dental practice management systems including Software of Excellence, Logiciel Julie, InfoMed, Exan and Labnet with the dental businesses of Internet Brands including web-based solutions such as Demandforce, Sesame Communications, Officite and DentalPlans.com. The combined entity registered pro-forma 2017 sales of approximately $400 million. Of this, approximately $100 million is drawn from Internet Brands’ dental businesses. Excluding the impact of around $4.5 million one-time transfer taxes, Henry Schein had earlier anticipated the deal to be immaterial to the rest of 2018 earnings per share and be accretive to its bottom line thereafter. Furthermore, annual synergies between $20 million and $30 million are expected to be realized by the end of the third year of the joint venture initiation.Dental Business — Major Growth DriverHenry Schein’s Dental business accounts for 48.1% of total revenues in the last reported quarter. Accordingly, it has been leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its foothold on this business. Moreover, Henry Schein signed distribution agreements with DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY) only last year, to distribute the latter's entire product line.We are also encouraged by Henry Schein’s reliance on part of its strategic plan, which is digital dentistry. The company is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Per management, the company’s solid performance can be attributed to its continued focus on offering a diversified portfolio and value-added services along with a favorable end market. Thus, we believe that Henry Schein’s latest tie-up is a strategic leap taken by the company.Market PotentialPer the company, a rise in oral healthcare expenditure within the dental industry, is predicted in tandem with the increase in middle-aged population (45 years and above). Moreover, Henry Schein is upbeat about the expected growth in dental insurance coverage along with lower insurance reimbursement rates, which lead to a frequent need for new technologies. We believe, this bullish sentiment will boost demand for Henry Schein’s products and services.Moreover, per a Transparency Market Research report, global dental practice management software market is likely to witness a CAGR of 11% between 2017 and 2025. Given its huge market potential, we perceive this latest development to help Henry Schein cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the market.Share Price MovementOver the past three months, Henry Schein has outperformed the broader industry.

Walgreens Boots has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 5.33%.

319,HSIC,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R. Bard.In April, Henry Schein HSIC announced its decision to spin off the company’s major segment global Animal Health business. We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses. According to the company, this transaction will enable it to make the most of the opportunities in the dental space in order to deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention.Apprehending that China’s drug distribution reform may slow down the company’s growth in the region (according to a Reuters report), Cardinal Health sold off its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for $1.2 billion.Following the announcement of its two major buyouts, Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson for about $4.33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines.A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure, sold itself to Hologic. Notably, Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately $1.65 billion.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Bright A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017, a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Per a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe and China showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s emerging markets’ business registered 17% growth in first-quarter 2018, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year).Key Picks from the SpaceIn the medical instrument space, we are positive on ABIOMED, Inc. ABMD and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

321,HSIC,"The First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund (QQEW  -  Free Report) was launched on 04/19/2006, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $547.47 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap GrowthCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer-term, value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.60%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.45%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 42% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Shire Plc (adr) (SHPG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.24% of total assets, followed by Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) and Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.49% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskQQEW seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index before fees and expenses. The NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index is the equal-weighted version of the NASDAQ-100 Index which includes 100 of the largest non-financial securities listed on NASDAQ based on market capitalization.The ETF has added roughly 3.91% so far this year and was up about 15.99% in the last one year (as of 05/18/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $52.79 and $63.23.The ETF has a beta of 1.14 and standard deviation of 15.67% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 103 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFirst Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, QQEW is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF  -  Free Report) and the PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF has $41.55 B in assets, PowerShares QQQ has $62.48 B. IWF has an expense ratio of 0.20% and QQQ charges 0.20%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

322,HSIC,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market, the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund (QQEW  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 04/19/2006.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexManaged by First Trust Advisors, QQEW has amassed assets over $546.73 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs.

For the first three months of 2018, net operating cash outflow was $70.9 million, compared with $52.6 million of cash outflow in the year-ago period.As a result of a blackout period related to the spin-off and merger of the company's Animal Health business, during the quarter under review, the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. At the close of the first quarter, the company had $200 million authorized for repurchase of common stock.2018 GuidanceExcluding costs related to restructuring and the spin-off and merger of Henry Schein’s global Animal Health business, the company has reiterated its 2018 EPS guidance. The company still expects EPS in the range of $4.03-$4.14, reflecting 12-15% growth from the 2017 adjusted EPS figure of $3.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted EPS is $4.09 remains within the guided range.Our TakeHenry Schein exited the first quarter of 2018 on a strong note with earnings and revenues steering past the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. All four of the company's operating segments recorded strong year-over-year growth. Henry Schein's strong share gains in the North American and overseas markets along with solid revenues raise optimism.Despite the better-than-expected revenue performance, we are disappointed with the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein's gross and operating margin due to higher cost of sales and expenses.We currently await the completion of the company’s global Animal Health business' planned spin-off. This business contributes nearly 30% to the company’s topline. The spin off, accordingly, is expected to bring in major changes to Henry Schein’s overall operating results.According to the company, following the spinoff, the Animal Health business will merge with privately-held Vets First Choice to form a new public company called Vets First Corp. We believe, this initiative remains a part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plan to focus more on dental and medical businesses.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp.

325,HSIC,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8. Last quarter, the company’s earnings met estimates. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the last few quarters, Henry Schein demonstrated solid growth across all four segments — Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in North America and overseas. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter.Favorable Dental Business Trend: The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is encouraging. In this regard, management believes the company is well-positioned to gain from the ongoing trend of digitalization in the global dental market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues of $3.17 billion reflects an increase of 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we are also upbeat about management’s expectations about the sustained dental equipment business growth in Europe and other regions.Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Starting Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of DENTSPLY SIRONA’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to a considerable extent. Also, per management, this agreement is expected to prove accretive to earnings per share from this year onward. Thus, we are looking forward to the deal’s contribution to Henry Schein’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. Quote In addition, Henry Schein continues to distribute products from Planmeca, 3Shape and 3M as well as the dental equipment and consumer product lines of its longstanding partner Danaher under the KaVo Kerr brands.Solid Animal Health Portfolio: We are optimistic about the well-diversified Animal Health product portfolio featuring software, diagnostic equipment and surgical instruments. The product offerings have been driving growth domestically as well as globally.Notably, during the fourth quarter of 2017, Henry Schein acquired Merritt Veterinary Supplies and integrated it into its Animal Health business. Merritt has 4,500 veterinary clinics in Eastern United States, with a strong presence in the Southeastern part of the nation. The company offers a comprehensive line of products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and equipment. However, according to Henry Schein, this acquisition will drive earnings this year onward. Thus, we are looking forward to the deal’s contribution to Henry Schein’s financials in the to-be-reported quarter.Growing Medical Business: Henry Schein is consistently working on boosting its Medical segment. Notably, worldwide Medical revenues rose 2.6% year over year in the fourth quarter. Last October, the company inked an agreement with Cerebral Assessment Systems to distribute Cognivue. This is the first computerized cognitive assessment screening device cleared by the FDA for the detection of early signs of dementia. We believe this development will bolster the company’s presence in the field of mental cognitive diseases.Broad Distribution Network: We are also upbeat about the company’s widespread distribution network. Apart from North America and Europe, the company has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in the emerging nations of China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland. We believe Henry Schein will continue to ride on the strength of its broad distribution network in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, at the beginning of March, Henry Schein signed a distribution agreement with Grifols, enabling the former to market and distribute the latter's 500mL Normal Saline solution (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) in the United States. With growing demand for saline products in the U.S. market, we believe this partnership will prove beneficial for Henry Schein.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margin performance over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of -0.36%.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 92 cents reflects a rise of 4.5% year over year.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank Stocks Here.Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

327,HSIC,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on Apr 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 24%. Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 22.6%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Invisalign System — A Major Growth DriverSimilar to prior quarters, Align Technology is expected to gain from continued adoption of Invisalign Technology in the first quarter of 2018 as well. Accordingly, the company projects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 264,000-269,000 in the to-be-reported quarter, up 26.9-29.3% from a year ago.Notably, in November 2017, Align Technology announced the achievement of a milestone of five million patients undergoing treatment with its Invisalign system.Interestingly, considering the fast-expanding market for clear aligner therapy, Align Technology has undertaken several strategies to drive the adoption of its core Invisalign product line. These include product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, promoting the Invisalign brand name and boosting international growth.The company has also been focusing on increasing the Invisalign utilization by orthodontists. Particularly targeting the teenagers, Align Technology has adopted marketing strategies to accelerate consumer demand by allowing GP dentists to treat increased number of cases with the Invisalign system.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteStrength in Scanner and Service BusinessAlign Technology has also been witnessing strong revenue growth from the Scanner and Service business over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has been witnessing increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to reflect in the company’s first-quarter results as well.At the same time, Align Technology has been focusing on expanding workflow options of iTero scanners. In this context, last November the company signed an agreement with Glidewell Dental to distribute the iTero Element intraoral scanning system with the latest glidewell.io In-Office Solution in North America.Align Technology had also signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental to make available its iTero Element intraoral scanning system as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada.Solid Global Prospects Align Technology had introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017. These are indicative of the growing popularity of its dental products in the international market.Further, over the recent past, Align Technology reported strong international Invisalign Technology volumes on continued strong performance in both EMEA and APAC regions.In the last reported quarter, EMEA, volumes were up on continued adoption of Invisalign Technology in core markets like the U.K., Spain and France, as well as rapid growth in smaller markets like Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. In the Asia-Pacific region, the company witnessed an impressive volume growth led by China, Japan and Australia. We expect to see a similar trend in the yet-to-be-reported quarter result as well.Overall, Align Technology projects EPS of 94-98 cents on revenues of $400-$410 million in the first quarter of 2018.

328,HSIC,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) also known as LabCorp, is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.38%. It has an average trailing four-quarter beat of 2.87%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLabCorp is likely to repeat its success trend from the last quarter. The company is expected to gain from a strong LabCorp Diagnostics segment in the period to be reported, banking on a favorable price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions and organic volume. Particularly, we are looking forward to the company’s partnership with Mount Sinai and the former owners of Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories (PAML), Providence and Catholic Health. Earlier, the company anticipated these three partnerships to benefit from a full-year ownership and growth to generate approximately $500 million as incremental profitable revenues in 2018. We expect this likely upside to get reflected in first-quarter results itself.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Within Covance Drug Development, we note that after a dull show for several quarters, the segment has started to report revenue growth from third-quarter 2017 onward on the back of the Chiltern acquisition, strong organic growth and a favorable foreign currency translation. With its buyout, Chiltern proved accretive to LabCorp’s portfolio, adding highly complementary capabilities to the company’s offerings including scale expansion in the Asia Pacific belt, a broader reach in the fast-growing emerging and mid-tier biopharma customer segments as well as expertise in the oncology drug development. All these factors should together continue to benefit the top line at LabCorp’s Covance Drug Development in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well.Significantly, the company is putting more emphasis on creating new growth opportunities in women's health, medical drug monitoring, genetics and oncology testing apart from critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe. Within Covance Drug Development, LabCorp expects these efforts to help fortifying its book-to-bill and net orders, driving its 2018 revenue conversion in the process.Also, the multi-year project LaunchPad, a business process improvement initiativeof LabCorp looks promising. The company’s last-year savings already achieved $20 million from the platform and further projects an additional net savings of $130 million through the three-year period ending in 2020, thereby substantially expanding the Drug Development margins.However, downsides might surface from the ongoing reimbursement issue. As stated by the company, the new PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) rates published by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement the market-based Medicare rates for lab testing. The statement reads that “The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U.S. labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories, dominated by independent labs”.We are therefore quite apprehensive about the entire scenario amid this current uproar. If the latest clinical lab fee schedule draft by CMS finally gets enforced sans amendment in favor of the testing laboratories, the continuation of LaunchPad, the projected growth at Covance, benefits from the Chiltern purchase and that from PAML and Mount Sinai plus the Covance LaunchPad process will all be offset by reduced PAMA rates.Per LabCorp’s previously provided guidance for 2018, revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 9.5-11.5% from 2017 including a likely improvement of 60 bps from a positive foreign currency movement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $11.48 billion. Adjusted EPS outlook for 2018 has been projected in the $11.30-$11.70 range. The consensus mark of $11.55 for the metric falls within the company’s forecast.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #2, a combination that suggests the company to likely beat on earnings this quarter.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Myriad Genetics, Inc.

329,HSIC,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the markets open.Last quarter, the company posted earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Zimmer Biomet missed the consensus mark in two of the preceding four quarters, the average being 0.29%. .Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsThe company is expected to report strong topline numbers within its S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm in the to-be-reported period. Last quarter, revenues at S.E.T. were driven by solid quarterly sales of the company’s surgical portfolio. Also, within upper extremities business, the company saw solid demand for a comprehensive shoulder line.In this regard, we note that since last November, the company has received several FDA clearances within S.E.T. and is particularly, excited about the approval of the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder system. We expect all these developments to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the first quarter itself.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote On the flip side, the company’s business within S.E.T has been in the recent past, massively ailed by supply issues and a continued pricing pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $435 million for S.E.T. revenues reflects a decline of 4.2% from the last quarter.We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from a strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Also, we are looking forward to top-line contributions from the company’s recent launch of products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage and Vitality + and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States.However, we are apprehensive about the ongoing revenue dissynergies related to the company’s U.S. spine sales force integration. Although Zimmer Biomet is working to resolve the impact of these dissynergies, chances of any near-term resolution are bleak.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million for Spine revenues indicates a 4.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter.Overall, first-quarter revenues are projected at $2.03 billion, up 0.9% sequentially.Other factors likely to influence Zimmer Biomet’s first-quarter results are:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. We are also enthusiastic about the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System last September. The knee system marked the latest addition to the company’s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $700 million for Knee revenues registers a 4.2% reduction from the last quarter.Within Hip business, we expect the company to once again demonstrate a sturdy performance in the Asia Pacific region. Notably, in the previous quarter, the company registered double digit sales growth within Hip in the aforementioned geography. The company is anticipated to produce improved quarterly sales from Taperloc G7 and Arcos systems. However, like all other segments, supply constraints should continue to limit Zimmer Biomet’s ability to meet demand of these high-growth brands.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $478 million for Knee revenues represents a 4.2% dip from the last quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in the other emerging markets, especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) zones. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from EMEA of $477 million denotes an improvement of 0.8% from the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $300 million from APAC in the quarter to be reported translates into a 6.5% fall from the last quarter. We believe, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting the company’s sales for over the past few quarters. The company has also been burdened with pricing woes.As a result, Zimmer Biomet struggled with a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.5% in 2017. In absence of any favorable changes on these lines, these headwinds might be mirrored in the company’s first-quarter results.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Zimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank #4, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Therefore, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Myriad Genetics, Inc.

330,HSIC,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.89%. Moreover, Thermo Fisher has surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.08%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsThermo Fisher has been going strong across its analytical instrument businesses with increasing global demand. Particularly, the company’s acquisition of FEI has been largely contributing to its analytical instruments portfolio over the past year. The buyout has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study as well as facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly, $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Quote Following the completion of the deal, the company has launched a host of products and expanded its Thermo Scientific Helios G4 DualBeam platform within the scope of material science applications. This should also get reflected in first-quarter 2018 performance.Apart from FEI-related development, another notable unveiling in the company’s Analytical Instruments business is its new line of Thermo Scientific air-quality monitors called the iQ Series. This platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services. This in turn is likely to contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the Waltham MA-based company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the period to be reported, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as a robust volume expansion plus productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments revenues is pegged at $1.138 billion, higher than the year-ago figure of $1.05 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s first-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and consolidating its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post impressive results in the first quarter.The company had spent $900 million on research and development in 2017 and the same trend is continuing through 2018. We expect all innovations and product introductions to substantially drive the company’s top line in the first quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also leads to solid results. Recent standout contributors are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher forecasts to maintain a bullish momentum for 2018.Moreover, growth is estimated in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities at its disposal including advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher facing a foreign exchange headwind on 2018 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, a hostile macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition consistently poses challenges to the stock’s value.Here’s What the Quantitative Model Predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Thermo Fisher has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of -1.29%, which leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. This is because a company needs positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus this combination does not suggest that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to outpace expectations this time around:Myriad Genetics, Inc.

331,HSIC,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results, after markets close on Apr 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.03% with the average earnings beat being 13% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong Product revenues. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues have been gaining from rising demand for sequencing consumables and instruments as well as the microarray range.Within consumables, the NovaSeq platform continues to see growth with close to 285 NovaSeq systems currently in customers’ hands since the launch last January. For 2018, NovaSeq shipments are projected in the range of 330 to 350.Management is hopeful that launches like S4 flow cell, Xp workflow and Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit will drive NovaSeq demand in the near term.Given the transition in Illumina’s high-throughput portfolio related to the NovaSeq introduction, instrument revenues have also been rising. Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $621 million reflects an increase of 26.5% from the year-ago quarter.Total Services and other revenues, which include genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenues from oncology agreements, have also been strong. The upside is being driven by strength in genotyping services due to sequencing instrument maintenance contracts and increased consumer demand.At NIPT, Illumina won Dutch National contract during the previous quarter along with some other encouraging developments. Per management, these factors will more than double sales from this business in 2018.  Moreover, the company is making progress with NIPT adoption, courtesy of continued uptake of VeriSeq NIPT Solution, which includes CE-IVD marked library prep and analysis software.With MiniSeq and MiSeq shipments accounting for roughly 60% of the new-to-sequencing customer demand and growing NextSeq adoption with commercial customers using the platform in production settings, Illumina’s benchtop portfolio has been encouraging.The bullish trend is expected to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $123 million shows a rise of 15% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s first-quarter results:In January 2018, Illumina announced the launch of the iSeq 100 Sequencing System. This next-generation sequencing system delivers excellent data accuracy, at a low capital cost, making Illumina technology available to virtually any lab. Since the company began shipping the product in January itself, investors will be watching out for the difference it will make to the top-line results in the quarter to be reported.Geographically, Illumina has been witnessing growing revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) led by sequencing instruments and consumables. Solid performance in Asia Pacific propelled by 12% shipment growth in Greater China also encourages us. Recently, management has noticed an uptick in demand from customers who are attempting to set up NIPT operations in China. We believe these developments will open channels for Illumina, thereby enhancing business growth.Although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move may mar sales in China in the near term.Total oncology testing was up 60% in the last reported quarter. Per management, the solid results were primarily led by continued growth in the translational liquid biopsy segment. Furthermore, Illumina continues to expect robust demand for oncology testing.Overall, first-quarter total revenues are projected at $743 million, up 24.2% from the prior-year quarter.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

Moreover, buoyed with the continued strong adoption of INTUITY Elite valve system, management expects INTUITY Elite valve system sales to remain on track to account for 25% of global aortic sales in fiscal 2018.Per management, in January 2018, the company had rolled out INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in the United States. Edwards Lifesciences also informed that the planned 2018 launch of INSPIRIS RESILIA in Japan is on track and progressing well.

Last quarter, the company’s earnings per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%. Moreover, Abbott has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past few quarters, Abbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory inthe Medical Devices business. The company has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Historically, the company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business, primarily on the back of contributions from FreeStyle Libre. This apart, investors are confident about Abbott’s developments in other businesses which form part of the Medical Devices segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical Devices revenues of $2.68 billion indicates a rise of 11.7% from the year-ago quarter.Similar to the prior quarter, Abbott is expected to gain from strong performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division (“EPD”) business, which has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diagnostic revenues of $1.76 billion shows a rise of 51.7% from the year-ago quarter.We encouragingly note that Nutrition is Abbott’s fastest-growing business, courtesy of an aging population, increasing rate of chronic diseases and the rise of the middle class in the emerging markets.

Also, the metric outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.83%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems well-aligned with its two-point growth agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.Per its new long-term growth outlook (beyond 2017), revenue increase for the period 2017-2020 is expected to be 3-5% with 1-2% growth projected from acquisitions. Earnings for the period are anticipated to rise faster than revenues in the mid-to-high single digit range.The company estimates revenue growth for the period 2017-2020 at 3-5%.  Per the company, its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions is creating promising opportunities for the top and bottom-line growth while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care.In this regard, we take a note of two recent strategic M&As by Quest Diagnostics. First, the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab, which should help strengthen the company’s position in the New York metropolitan marketplace. Second, the buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service MedXM, which should fortify Quest Diagnostics’ mobile provider capabilities and population health management solutions for health plans. These two transactions should garner favorable results in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to build esoteric testing business as well as boost profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed a significant improvement via infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. Therefore we expect these growth drivers to replicate the company’s success story in its upcoming quarterly results, having thus remained active throughout. Also, the performance is likely to drive the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company’s top line in the first quarter.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $7.7-$7.77 billion (annualized growth of 4-5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.94 billion, ahead of the company’s projected range.Excluding the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB (excess tax benefit associated with stock based compensation), adjusted EPS for the full year is projected in the band of $6.50-$6.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.10 falls below this guided range.On the flip side, after a phase of continual drag for several quarters in the company’s revenue per requisition performance, the last three quarters saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not.The company’s two Professional Lab Services engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — also carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Further, we should take into consideration the persistent headwind of unit price, which was moderately down in less than 100 basis points. Excluding the impact of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), the company expects unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain below 100 basis points with PAMA adding an extra headwind of approximately 50 basis points to it. This should also get reflected in the first-quarter results.Overall, we believe that lack of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously affect the company’s volumes (measured by the number of requisitions) till the economy turns around for better.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +3.19%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Abaxis, Inc. (ABAX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.56% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.34% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

335,HSIC,"GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3%. Also, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter average earnings miss is 16.5%.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported quarter’s revenues dropped 2.1% year over year. Apart from sluggishness at the U.S. & Canada segments, declining revenues at the Manufacturing/Wholesale segment led to this downside. In the absence of any growth catalyst, we expect a similar trend in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Moreover, GNC Holdings has a number of competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, supermarket firms and big U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we anticipate the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which in turn, might hurt margins.GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. Quote However, on the bright side,GNC Holdings’ international business has been a key growth driver for the company in recent years. Revenues at this segment increased 14.1% on higher cross-border e-commerce sales in China last quarter.In March 2018, the company announced plans to expand its presence in India. The company operates in collaboration with the master franchise partner, Guardian Healthcare Services Pvt. Ltd, in the country.Per the latest announcement, Guardian will add GNC Holdings’ products to 4000-plus stores across India by 2020. In this regard, 1000 new stores are expected to shelf GNC products in 2018 compared with approximately 50 retail locations at present. This apart, the company has been targeting other channels like retailing, e-commerce and distribution for expansion.Of late, the company has been experiencing solid growth in China. In this regard, last December, GNC Holdings announced plans of entering into a strategic partnership and joint-venture agreement with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, the company witnessed improvement in trends in Mexico, South Korea and Hong Kong.Although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tension between United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports has raised concerns for  MedTech players as any adverse move may affect their sales performance in China in near term.Furthermore, the performance of One New GNC is improving gradually. Notably, in 2017, more than 11 million consumers joined the company's loyalty programs. PRO Access, the company’s premium loyalty offering, enrolled nearly 850,000 members since its launch in March 2017. Apart from this, management is working on product pricing and innovation. Meanwhile, new consumer enrolment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for GNC Holdings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.GNC Holdings has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 20 cents reflects a 45.9% plunge on a year-over-year basis.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

337,HSIC,"In recent years, growing healthcare cognizance has led to continuous technological innovation in the dental equipment space. With time, it has emerged as the most favored sector for medical device investors looking for consistent and attractive returns. Let's delve deeper.Over the last 10 years, the dental supplies market has been faring better than the S&P 500 index. The market has gained 119.8% eclipsing the broader market's 101.4%.Per a Allied Market Research report, the global dental implants and prosthetics market is expected to catapult to a value of $12,743 million by 2023, at a CAGR of 8.8% from 2017 to 2023. And if we go by the estimates of the American Dental Association (published in Grand View Research), every year 5 million implants are carried out in the United States indicating huge market potential. In today’s fast paced times, implants are preferred over conventional removable dentures owing to comfort and convenience.Factors Driving Demand for Dental TreatmentHigh Demand Among Children and Teenagers: Per a Markets and Markets report, children and teenagers are expected to dominate the global orthodontic market in the coming years. A high number of patients with malocclusions and jaw disorders are likely to drive the demand. Also, rising need for fixed braces among children and teenagers will act as a major demand propeller. Notably, orthodontic treatments are more effective and successful in childhood or teenage.One of the noteworthy developments in this niche space is the launch of Align Technology’s clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017.Cosmetic Needs: Growing awareness esthetic needs has also been a major growth catalyst for the dental prosthetic market. Per Markets and Markets, global cosmetic dentistry is expected to make $22,362.4 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 6.8% during 2015-2020. Moreover, an increase in disposable income gives rise to higher demand for cosmetic dental surgeries.Rise in Geriatric Population: An aging population has also been a significant contributor. Higher incidence of calcium deficiency in older people leads to teeth loss. According to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial research, more than 24% of adults aged above 74 years have lost all teeth. People on medication for chronic and metabolic disorders also reach an edentulous state.Other Factors: Poor lifestyle choices and unhygienic dental care lead to higher demand for dental procedures. Increased dental diseases are another factor. Also, dental injuries caused by road accidents lead to higher demand for dental implants and prosthetics.Technological Advancement Shapes Dental Implant MarketThe global dental implant and prosthetic market is gradually shifting from conventional to a technologically-advanced one. Laser dentistry is much in demand among dental patients because of its painless procedurefor extraction of teeth, orthodontics and periodontal decay.

338,HSIC,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on Mar 28.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.79%. It is noteworthy that Walgreens Boots has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.43%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsOver the recent past, we have observed Walgreens Boots’ Retail Pharmacy USA division to witness comparable prescription growth and benefit from strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market.Meanwhile, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company exceeded 1 billion scripts on a 30-day adjusted and rolling annual basis for the first time, touching a new milestone.Furthermore, the company’s efforts to boost its digital capabilities have started paying off. In this regard, more than 20% of the company’s retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels with the Walgreens' mobile app, having been downloaded in excess of 50 million times since the launch.We are also encouraged by the increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Furthermore, the company has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote Meanwhile, strong market growth in certain emerging markets drove the company’s Pharmaceutical Wholesale division’s solid performance in the first-quarter fiscal 2018. We expect these trends to get reflected in fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $31.99 billion reflects an 8.6% rise on a year-over-year basis.Also, we are upbeat about the company expanding its global footprint with its decision to acquire 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On completion, this investment should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China. It is the retail pharmacy platform of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (""CNPGC"").Moreover, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell part of its investment in its Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for huge cash returns buoys optimism.We are also upbeat about Walgreens Boots’ plans to expand its existing group purchasing efforts with Express Scripts Holding Company, to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs. Since biosimilars have the potential to lower production costs, the move is considered to be a prudent and timely one.On the flip side, Walgreens Boots’ gross margin figures continued to contract in the last reported quarter as well. Lower pharmacy margins in the U.K., reflecting the reduction in funding, led to the downside. However, the company is working tirelessly to increase efficiency and provide high quality and cost-effective pharmacy services, in order to reduce overall pharmacy cost.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Walgreens Boots is +2.46%.

Also, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) are expected in the range of 24-25 cents compared with 7 cents in the prior-year quarter.

340,HSIC,"IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) is expected to beat earnings when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.3%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 9.4%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The upside was driven by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable and reference lab, strong acceptance of rapid assays and veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. Management expects the solid performance to reflect in the fourth-quarter results as well.We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. Management expects fourth-quarter results to show a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish new customer relationships and switch to commission-based compensation for instrument placements. Also, we expect the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs and instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG Diagnostics revenues of $425 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for fourth-quarter total revenues are projected at $491 million, up 10.9% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, IDEXX expects 2017 revenues in the range of $1,950-$1,960 million, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 10%.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Quote Here are the other factors that might influence IDEXX’s fourth-quarter results:We are upbeat about growth in the Water Business, which has been on a growth trajectory of late on encouraging test results in the United States and benefits from global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, in the last reported quarter, the business witnessed 10% organic growth. Management is also looking forward to benefits from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Water revenues of $27.3 million reflects an increase of 12.3% from the year-ago quarter.IDEXX continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal diagnostics market of emerging nations. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the fourth-quarter performance.Management also estimates 2017 EPS in the band of $3.22-$3.26, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents year over year EPS growth of 32-34% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents shows an increase of 25.9% from a year ago.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company’s high reliance on third-party distributors.

341,HSIC,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 1.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the average trailing four-quarter beat is pegged at 0.84%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Preliminary ResultsOn Jan 9, Boston Scientific announced an upbeat fourth-quarter 2017 preliminary sales performance. Year over year, preliminary net sales for the quarter has been forecast at $2.41 billion, up 9.9% on a reported basis, 8.1% on an operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER) and approximately, 6.8% on an organic basis. This reported preliminary revenue figure lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35 billion.Notably, organic revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as sales from the recent acquisitions of EndoChoice Holdings and Symetis SA.For 2017, the company has announced preliminary net sales of $9.05 billion, reflecting 7.9% growth on a reported basis, 7.8% increase on operational basis and a 6.6% rise on an organic basis compared with the prior-year number. The company’s preliminary tally again compares favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.99 billion.Key CatalystsBoston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote We are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, the company has of late successfully gained within this business on strong sales of WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device and its portfolio of complex PCI products.The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth. In this regard, Medicare reimbursement rates for DRG 274 increased by an average of 10.6% effective Oct 1, under which, 93% of WATCHMAN implants fall.All these developments are expected to have significantly boosted the IC business in the fourth quarter itself. The company earlier stated that it expects to end 2017 with more than 375 accounts implanting WATCHMAN and increased reorder rates in previously opened accounts.However, ahead of the company’s earnings release for the fourth quarter, we believe its IC business to be grossly impacted by the product recall issue within Europe. Notably, in February 2017, the company recalled one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe, due to device malfunctions. The company also delayed submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device.Recently, the company has announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States. Notably, while recalling the product last February, Boston Scientific announced the expected time of reintroduction of the LOTUS Edge delivery system in Europe by the first quarter of 2018. The company also expected to file the final Pre-Market Approval (PMA) module with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by January 2018.However, per the latest press release, the company is likely to provide a further update on the status of the LOTUS Edge Valve on Feb 1, 2018. This delay has been justified by Boston Scientific citing its continuous focus on manufacturing and regulatory milestones to support the long-term success of the Lotus platform. The company stated that it is working hard to implement necessary modifications in the device to pass the internal quality standards.However, this extra delay might lead to a further setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement business within the IC in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter IC revenues is pegged at $622 million, a 6.3% higher than the year-ago reported number of $585 million.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $417 million, 9.7% above the prior-year quarter’s reported count of $380 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the consensus mark of $303 million remains 10.5% ahead of the year-earlier quarter’s reported tally of $274 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing of late remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from the international markets, it gets highly exposed to currency fluctuations. For the full year, Boston Scientific predicts an unfavorable foreign exchange challenge to the tune of 700 basis points or 8 cents per share on earnings.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Boston Scientific does not have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Boston Scientific has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2.

342,HSIC,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 1, after market close.Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.2%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies, with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well. In the United States, transcatheter heart valve sales grew 20% year over year in the third quarter. Outside the United States, the underlying growth rate was 21%, with strong contribution from Japan.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote In the last reported quarter, growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $509 million reflects an increase of 17.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, fourth-quarter revenues are projected at $862.86 million.Here are the other factors that might influence Edwards Lifesciences’ fourth-quarter results:Investors are bullish on the Harpoon Medical acquisition, which was completed on Dec 6, 2017, with the intention to enhance the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy portfolio. However, the buyout is not expected to contribute significantly to fourth-quarter revenues.Meanwhile, the INTUITY Elite valve system was approved for Medicare's new tech add-on payment effective Oct 1, 2017. This recognized INTUITY as the latest technology to provide substantial clinical improvement over conventional valves. The company believes that many hospitals will be helped by this add-on payment over the next year and this should simplify adoption of this rapid-deployment valve that shortens minimally invasive and complex procedures.Edwards Lifesciences expects sales in 2017 to meet the high end of the $3.2-$3.4 billion range.Moreover, we note that the company projects total sales between $855 million and $895 million and adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents to 94 cents for the fourth quarter.However, the company expects some changes in fourth-quarter gross margin. Earnings are expected to be impacted by foreign currency fluctuation.Also, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to raise caution.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Edwards Lifesciences has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Edwards Lifesciences is +1.3%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 90 cents reflects a 20% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

343,HSIC,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30, before the markets open.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 1.2%. However, Zimmer Biomet has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 0.1%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, the company is expected to gain from strength in the S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm. In the last reported quarter, revenues at S.E.T. were driven by surgical business and sports medicine offerings such as Gel-One, Subchondroplasty and Quattro Link. Moreover, solid uptake of the A.L.P.S. Plating System within the foot and ankle portfolio boosted the segment’s performance. The company witnessed strength in IntelliCart System for fluid waste management.Historically, strong performance by key brands and 2016 acquisitions along with increasing focus on sales force specialization have been partially offsetting adverse impacts from supply issues and continued pricing pressure within the segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S.E.T. revenues of $443 million reflects an increase of 3% from the year-ago quarter reported number.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Also, we are looking forward to top-line contributions from the company’s launch of products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage and Vitality + and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States in October 2017.Moreover, although the LDR Holdings acquisition had insignificant contribution to the top line (30 basis points) in the third quarter at the initial phase of integration, it is expected to contribute 120 basis points to full-year revenues at CER. Also, management is hopeful of gaining from significant cross-selling opportunities that the acquisition provides on the back of a strong spine sales force in the United States.Continued uptake of Trauma One Plating System, SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System within the craniomaxillofacial and thoracic arm buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spine revenues of $192 million indicates a rise of 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Overall fourth-quarter revenues are projected at $2.03 billion, up 0.9% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Zimmer Biomet’s fourth-quarter results:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. We are also upbeat about the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System last September. The knee system marked the latest addition to the company’s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems. Also, Zimmer Biomet’s release of X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument, X-PSI Knee System, in the first half of 2017 buoys optimism. This is the world's first CE-Marked surgical planning system that allows for patient-specific implant positioning, solely utilizing the X-ray technology. These developments are expected to boost the fourth-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Knee revenues of $723 million indicates an uptick of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in other emerging markets, especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from EMEA of $467 million indicates an improvement of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from APAC of $313 million indicates a rise of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting sales for the company over the past few quarters. The company has also been dealing with pricing pressure. In this regard, Zimmer Biomet faced a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.1% in the last-reported quarter. In the absence of any favorable changes on these lines, these headwinds might reflect in the company’s fourth-quarter results.For the second half of 2017, management continues to expect impact from reduced sales expectations, continued spending on critical programs and rising manufacturing costs from the Warsaw North Campus facility.Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Zimmer Biomet this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of +0.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.11, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.10.Zacks Rank: Zimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.10 reflects a 1.9% decline from the year-ago quarter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2.

344,HSIC,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 30, after market close. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.3%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.Let’s take a look at Illumina’s announcement of preliminary fourth-quarter results at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference held in San Francisco, CA.Per the announcement, preliminary revenues for the fourth quarter are estimated at $775 million, up 25% year over year. The figure is also higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $748 million.The preliminary figure for 2017 revenues is $2.75 billion, up 15% from 2016 driven by the adoption of NovaSeq and growth in clinical and consumer genomics. The figure is also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 billion.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Similar to last quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong Product as well as Service and other revenues. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues increased primarily on higher sequencing consumable revenues. Total Service and other revenues demonstrate strong growth led by continued demand for NextSeq from NIPT customers and partners.The company expects fourth-quarter sequencing consumables to increase more than 30%, up $100 million from the year-ago quarter on the back of increased utilization in the high throughput systems and strong pull-through on NextSeq.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $621 million reflects an increase of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $121 million indicates a rise of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s fourth-quarter results:In November 2017, Illumina introduced its second FDA-regulated and CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing (NGS) system — NextSeq 550Dx. With this, Illumina now has a solid diagnostic NGS portfolio, courtesy of its NextSeq 550Dx and the MiSeqDx products. This portfolio is capable of meeting any clinical requirement for NGS-based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products. This is likely to boost the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Last October, Illumina announced the availability of the NovaSeq S4 flow cell and reagent kit for its NovaSeq 6000 System. Management expects to witness strong NovaSeq uptake through the fourth quarter of 2017 into 2018 and beyond. Moreover, in the same month, Illumina announced the availability of Nextera DNA Flex — a whole genome sequencing library prep product. We expect these factors to drive revenues as well.Also, encouraged by the solid third-quarter performance, Illumina raised its adjusted EPS to the band of $3.73-$3.78 from the earlier $3.60-$3.70.On the flip side, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding, which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Illumina has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Illumina is +0.84%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina carries a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 98 cents reflects a 1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are a few medical other stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

345,HSIC,"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jan 31. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.1%. Moreover, Thermo Fisher has surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystThermo Fisher has been going strong across its analytical instrument businesses with increasing global demand. Particularly, the company’s acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to its analytical instruments portfolio from the last three quarters. The buyout has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly, $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 performance.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Quote Apart from FEI-related development, another notable launch in the company’s Analytical Instruments business is its new line of Thermo Scientific air-quality monitors called the iQ Series. This platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services. This in turn is likely to contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Last but not the least, worth mentioning is the company’s recent completion of taking over the desktop scanning electron microscopy (SEM) solutions provider, Phenom-World. Thermo Fisher plans to integrate the business into its Analytical Instruments segment. Per management, addition of Phenom-World’s desktop SEM platform is projected to leverage its position in electron microscopy space and expand its entry-level plus desktop SEMs offerings for customers working in materials science, industrial manufacturing, life sciences and electronics industries.Overall, the Waltham MA-based company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the period to be reported, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as robust volume expansion plus productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments revenues is pegged at $1.303 billion, higher than the sequentially last quarter’s reported figure of $1.190 billion. Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of $1.11 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s fourth-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and consolidating its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post impressive results in the fourth quarter.The company had spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through 2017. We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the fourth quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to solid results. Recent standout contributors are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher forecasts to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017.Growth is also estimated in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities at its disposal including advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, a hostile macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition consistently imposes challenges on the stock’s value.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Thermo Fisher does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat this quarter.Zacks ESP: Thermo Fisher has an Earnings ESP of -0.2%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Thermo Fisher’s Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $2.66 reflects a 10.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

346,HSIC,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Jan 30, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 23.2%. Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 16.6%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThis leading manufacturer and marketer of a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage has been witnessing strong revenue growth from the Scanner and Service business over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has been seeing increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to reflect in the fourth-quarter results as well.At the same time, Align Technology has been focusing on expanding work flow options of iTero scanners. In this context, we are upbeat about the company’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. Moreover, the company launching a software upgrade to its iTero Element intraoral scanner that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the latest TimeLapse technology also boosts our confidence on the stock.Also, the company collaborated with exocad GmbH last March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, designing and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. With these positives in place, Align Technology is expected to witness solid top-line contributions from the Scanner and Service business in the fourth-quarter results.Investors may also be looking forward to the company’s recent signing of an agreement with Glidewell Dental to distribute the iTero Element intraoral scanning system with the latest glidewell.io In-Office Solution in North America. Per management, the collaboration will widen iTero’s reach to more than 50,000 dentists using Glidewell services. Notably, the company aims a launch in first-quarter 2018.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteAlign Technology achieved a milestone of five million patients undergoing treatment with its flagship clear aligner system — InvisAlign — in November 2017. The company has been adopting several strategies to drive adoption of its core InvisAlign product line.In terms of product development, in 2017, the company received two U.S. patents for Align Technology’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for InvisAlign aligner treatment. Moreover, in a bid to gain traction in the InvisAlign platform, Align Technology collaborated with Digital Smile Design last March.Meanwhile, in order to expand its Invisalign brand offerings, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution — Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement — for teens in certain markets of Canada, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) in the first half of 2017.Coming to geographic expansion, the company opened its first office in Canada — a major market in terms of opportunity for expansion and growth. Management launched InvisAlign Technology Lite in North America post its introduction in the EMEA. The company witnessed strong adoption, particularly among GP dentists.Moreover, Align Technology has been witnessing continued adoption of InvisAlign Technology in core markets in the EMEA and APAC regions. Interestingly, in the recently reported third quarter, the company achieved another milestone in terms of InvisAlign therapy adoption, where China became the second-largest InvisAlign market with United States topping the numbers. Align Technology registered almost a threefold year-over-year increase in its asset customer base, with major contributions from China. Also, in a bid to expand in the region, the company opened a InvisAlign Treatment Planning Facility in China last June.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $395.48 million in fourth-quarter 2017 indicates a rise of 34.9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

347,HSIC,"Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) Diagnostics business has been on a growth trajectory of late on solid contributions from all sub-segments — Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care. We expect this strength to get reflected in fourth-quarter 2017 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 24.Core Laboratories DiagnosticsIn June 2017, Abbott announced the CE Mark for Alinity hq, which has become the fifth diagnostic system to be launched in Europe along with the ongoing rollout of four instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point of care. This has strengthened the company’s Core Laboratory Diagnostics business considerably.Of late, the company has been in the headlines following the receipt of CE Mark and commercial launch of Alinity h-series integrated system for hematology testing. Notably, the Alinity portfolio covers clinical chemistry, immunoassay, blood and plasma screening, point of care, hematology and molecular diagnostics along with Abbott's AlinIQ. Interestingly, the company also continued the initial launch of certain new Alinity systems for the core laboratory, including ""Alinity c"" for clinical chemistry, ""Alinity i"" for immunoassay diagnostics and ""Alinity s"" for blood and plasma screening globally during the last reported third quarter.Continuing with the slew of developments, this Illinois-based global medical device company signed a $252-million managed equipment service contract with North West London Pathology (NWLP), hosted by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in August 2017. Per the terms of the collaboration, Abbott will be the authorized supplier of all analytical equipment and consumables, covering its Alinity ci and Alinity h series diagnostics instruments and AlinIQ. Per NWLP, the alliance, which presently covers 6% of the pathology market in the U.K., is expected to carry out 26 million tests per year. Thus, investors must be eagerly looking forward to the outcome of this deal on the company’s financials. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Core Laboratory Diagnostics revenues of $1.05 billion indicates a rise of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter reported number.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote Point of CareAbbott’s successful closure of the Alere acquisition after a prolonged legal battle has instilled confidence in investors. The buyout closed in October 2017 under amended financial terms in favor of Abbott. Taking the attractive prospects of Point of Care testing within the in vitro diagnostics market into consideration, Abbott is highly optimistic about the Alere integration. According to the company, the Alere buyout will significantly expand its diagnostics presence and create the broadest Point of Care testing portfolio with strong positions in cardio, metabolic, infectious disease and toxicology testing. Moreover, Abbott expects Alere to contribute around $475 million to its top line in 2017. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Point of Care revenues of $661 million indicates a massive rise of 389.6% from the year-ago quarter and a surge of 404.6% from the sequential quarter.Molecular DiagnosticsThrough 2017, Abbott has effectively focused on core areas and thus, the company has been strongly performing in the infectious disease testing business under Molecular Diagnostics. This has been partially offsetting declines due to planned scale down in other testing areas by the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $122 million indicates a rise of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.With these positives in place, Abbott anticipates mid-single digit increase in Diagnostics sales in fourth-quarter 2017.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Abbott does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Abbott is -0.62%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 73 cents reflects a 12.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

348,HSIC,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the market opens on Jan 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Moreover, Abbott has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Abbott is expected to gain from strong performance by the Established Pharmaceuticals Division (“EPD”) business, which has been recording operational sales growth in the last few quarters. Major part of this growth was stimulated by a series of strategic actions, including Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues of $1.09 billion shows a rise of 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.Apart from Russia and Latin America, the company also continues to expect strong growth in EPD in the upcoming quarters, particularly in China, on the back of a strong market position and competitive advantage. Also, as expected, third-quarter sales in India were driven by purchasing patterns following the implementation of a new Goods and Services Tax system that dented second-quarter sales in the country. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPD revenues from key emerging markets of $867 million indicates a rise of 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.We are also upbeat about the Medical Devices business, which has been on a healthy growth trajectory over the past few quarters. Abbott has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System. Historically, the company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business, primarily on the back of contributions from FreeStyle Libre. Following the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott achieved another major milestone after the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories Quote Moreover, last September, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. With these positives, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes Care revenues of $391 million indicates a rise of 26.1% from the year-ago quarter.This apart, the market is bullish on Abbott’s developments in other businesses which form part of the Medical Devices segment. In August 2017, the company announced FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) which is expected to boost top-line contributions from the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sub-segment. This segment has been the highest contributor to total Medical Devices revenues historically. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation revenues of $2.24 billion indicates a rise of 0.9% from the sequential quarter.Overall, fourth-quarter total revenues are projected at $7.37 billion, up 38.3% from the prior-year quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Abbott does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for ResMed is -0.62%.

349,HSIC,"ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after markets close on Jan 22. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Moreover, ResMed has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, ResMed is expected to gain from strong performance in the domestic and international front. In the last few quarters, the company’s revenues in the domestic front were driven by solid growth in devices and masks as well as continued double-digit software sales growth. Moreover, the sleep apnea patient volume continued to witness steady growth. We expect these trends to continue in the second quarter as well.Internationally, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism. The company believes this reimbursement grant will continue to drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company continues to invest and expand its presence in the high-growth markets of China, South Korea, India, Brazil and several countries in Eastern Europe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic revenues (including contributions from Brightree) of $373 million reflects an increase of 14.1% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues of $222 million indicates a rise of 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.We are also upbeat about ResMed’s solid performance in the Masks and Other Accessories business. The company is seeking new applications for significant unmet medical needs in this space. Thus, over the recent past, the company introduced the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20 and AirTouch full face masks in different geographies. The AirTouch UltraSoft memory foam cushion is a breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea.Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Masks and Other Accessories revenues of $218 million indicates a rise of 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, fiscal second-quarter total revenues are projected at $577 million, up 8.9% from the prior-year quarter.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. Quote Here are the other factors that might influence ResMed’s second-quarter results:Management is particularly upbeat about top-line contributions from launches made in the last fiscal and the last reported quarter. One of the latest products is the world's smallest continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — ResMed AirMini — which has been commercially launched in 15 countries across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Moreover, the company recently announced the connecting of AirMini to AirView, the world's largest remote patient monitoring platform.ResMed continues to progress steadily on the back of its three-pronged growth strategy. In this regard, the company is looking for growth in adjacent product and geographic markets, including homecare ventilation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other respiratory disorders, and the emerging markets of China, India and Brazil. ResMed continues to see portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) as an important addition to its menu of respiratory care products. In this regard, the company has re-launched the Activox POC in the last reported fiscal first-quarter with better quality and performance at the United States, Canada and Latin America Sales Conference. The company also expects solid top-line contributions from this launch.Moreover, during fiscal 2017, ResMed progressed with Brightree's latest offering Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for the home health and hospice market. We expect this to get reflected in ResMed’s top line in the second quarter as well. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brightree revenues of $38.5 million reflects an increase of 13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:ResMed does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for ResMed is -0.86%.

350,HSIC,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) recently announced the purchase of a 60% stake in veterinary product distributor — ABASE — under certain undisclosed financial terms. Per the company, the deal will drive earnings after 2018.Notably, Sao Paulo, Brazil-based ABASE is a family-owned distributor of veterinary health care products.At the beginning of 2017, Henry Schein had entered the Brazilian animal health market with a 51% investment in Tecnew, a privately-held distributor of animal health products. Through the latest acquisition, the company expects to boost its business in Brazil and diversify relationship with global suppliers.Recent Developments in Animal HealthHenry Schein has been consistently trying to expand its Global Animal Health business. The segment witnessed 11.7% rise in revenues in the last reported third quarter. In October 2017, the company completed the buyout of Merritt Veterinary Supplies. With this, Merritt became part of the veterinary business of Henry Schein. The company offers a comprehensive line of products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and equipment along with 4,500 veterinary clinics across the eastern United States, with a strong presence in the southeastern part of the nation.Henry Schein’s Animal Health also opened a new National Distribution Service Center in Columbus' Brookhollow neighborhood, expanding its presence in central Ohio.Market PotentialAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global animal health market is expected to reach a value of $58.4 billion by 2025. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is strategic.Share Price MovementOver the past three months, Henry Schein has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has lost 8.6% in contrast to the industry’s gain of 14.7%. We believe this latest development will help boost investors’ confidence on the stock and reverse the downtrend.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Amedisys, Inc.

351,HSIC,"Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) has had an unimpressive run on the bourses in the last three months, trading below the industry. Further, lackluster performance in the dental segment along with a downbeat guidance is a concern. The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The estimate revision trend for Patterson Companies has been dismal. For the current year, eight analysts moved south compared with no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings fell 9.2% to $2.09.What’s Not Right in the Dental Segment?Loss of Distribution RightsThe recent loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona (XRAY  -  Free Report) has forced the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to efficiently manage inventory. However, the system is creating short-term challenges. Undoubtedly, the termination of the contract presents new opportunities for Patterson Companies to expand distribution platform to a wider range of product offerings. However, the company also witnesses a heavy initial impact from the loss of this deal.Deteriorating SalesPatterson Companies’ decision to end exclusive distribution will affect results through fiscal 2018. In fact, the dental segment sales have been sluggish over the last couple of quarters. Management has provided a dull guidance for the coming quarters as well.In the last quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) declined 8.4% at cc year over year to approximately $553.6 million. The downside was caused by lower sales of CEREC and digital technology products. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018, adding to the company’s woes.Competition RifeCutthroat competition in the U.S. dental products distribution industry is a major dampener as well. Notably, Patterson Companies faces serious competition from at least 15 full-service distributors that include Henry Schein Dental, a unit of Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report), and numerous small and local distributors.Shares Lack LusterA rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, unfavorable price movements, a competitive dental products distribution industry and integration risks pose significant challenges. Patterson Companies’ price movement in the past three months has been disappointing. The company represented a negative return of almost 5.2%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rally of almost 4.7%. In fact, the current level is lower than the S&P 500 index’s return of 7.3% over the same time period. Key PickA top-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). PetMed has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has rallied roughly 76.8% in a year.

352,HSIC,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) recently completed the buyout of eVetPractice — a provider of cloud-based practice management solutions to veterinary clinics. Although the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, the company expects the deal to prove accretive to its earnings per share post 2018.Per the company, the eVetPractice will be a part of Henry Schein’s Veterinary Solutions portfolio which comprises AVImark and ImproMed in North America, as well as Vision, RxWorks and RoboVet globally. Notably, eVetPractice is a rapidly growing cloud solutions provider in the United States, with a customer base of around 900. We believe the latest takeover will widen Henry Schein’s customer base and portfolio.Developments in Technology & VASIn September, Henry Schein had announced the receipt of Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC-Health IT) 2015 Edition Health IT Module Certification from Drummond Group LLC for its practice management and electronic health record software — MicroMD.The company offers a wide range of practice management software systems covering dental, animal health and medical. It has a customer base of more than 95,000 practices, inclusive of MicroMD for physician practices.Continuing with the slew of developments, the company had earlier announced a partnership between Medical Systems and Simplifeye. The combined entity aimed at creating a mobile experience by integration of Simplifeye with Henry Schein’s MicroMD. Furthermore, this collaboration aims at allowing physicians to provide more customized patient experiences, simplify their practice workflows and keep concerned team members well connected when away from their workplaces.Performance of Technology and VASWe believe this latest development will boost sales in the company’s global Technology and Value-added Services (VAS) business. Interestingly, this segment saw a 4.1% increase in revenues in the last reported quarter. This included 3.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% rise related to foreign currency exchange. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% in the quarter under review.Market PotentialAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global veterinary software market is expected to reach a value of $368.7 million by 2019, at a CAGR of 5.6% during 2014 to 2019. Considering the substantial potential of the market, we believe the latest development is a strategic one.Per the company, the increasing trend toward cost control has the potential to drive the demand for technology solutions. Going by another report from MarketsandMarkets, the global healthcare IT market is projected to reach a value of $280.25 billion at a CAGR of 15.9% in the 2016-2021 period.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle along with rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the healthcare IT market. This market is dominated by a number of well-established players, the NextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc. (QSII  -  Free Report) being a prominent one.Share Price Performance

353,HSIC,"On Nov 21, we issued an updated research report on Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Henry Schein exited third-quarter 2017 on a mixed note with earnings missing and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We are disappointed with the company’s lowering of the high end of the 2017 EPS guidance. Meanwhile, the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein’s gross and operating margin was led by higher cost of sales and expenses. A tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure also weigh on the stock.Shares of the company have underperformed the broader industry over the past month. The stock has lost 20.8% against the 1.6% gain of the broader industry.On a positive note, we expect this trend to improve on balanced growth across all four operating segments of Henry Schein. We are also encouraged by the company’s efforts to grow internationally. Apart from North America and Europe, it has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in the emerging markets of China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland.Henry Schein, Inc. Price Henry Schein, Inc. Price | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteAlso, this leading distributor of health care products and services across the globe continues to ride high within its dental business on majorly accretive strategic mergers and integrations. One colossal merger in this field is Poland-based Dental Cremer in 2016.Also, Henry Schein might gain from several trends in end markets like customer demographics. The increasing number of lives covered, following healthcare reforms in the United States, is likely to boost the company. Additionally, the company gains traction from animal health business on the back of tailwinds in North America as well as overseas markets. The burgeoning demand for animal health products in the United States should further drive the company’s growth. Key StocksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

354,HSIC,"Investors in Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 17, 2017 $90.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Henry Schein shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Henry Schein is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Medical - Dental Supplies industry that ranks in the Top 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while eight have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 99 cents per share to 97 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Henry Schein right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

This included 3.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% rise related to foreign currency exchange. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% in the quarter under review.Margin Trend         Gross profit increased 6.1% to $836.1 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin declined 90 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 26.5% due to a 12% rise in cost of sales, higher than the revenue growth rate.  Despite a 7% rise in selling, general & administrative expenses of $622.5 million, adjusted operating income improved 3.6% year over year to $213.6 million. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps year over year to 6.8% in the reported quarter.Financial PositionHenry Schein exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $79.9 million, compared with $74.7 million at the end of second-quarter 2017. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $307.5 million, compared with $378.1 million in the year-ago period.During the quarter under review, the company bought back approximately 1.4 million shares for almost $125 million. At the close of the third quarter, the company had $425 million authorized for repurchase of common stock.2017 & 2018 EPS GuidanceHenry Schein updated its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance (excluding litigation settlement expenses and a fourth-quarter loss related with the company's divestiture of equity ownership in E4D Technologies). The company now expects adjusted EPS in the range of $3.59-$3.61, reflecting 8–9% growth from the 2016 adjusted EPS figure of $3.31. The previous adjusted EPS 2017 guidance range was $3.59-$3.65. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 adjusted EPS is $3.64, outside the guided range.The company also provided the guidance for 2018 EPS. Henry Schein expects reported EPS for 2018 in the band of $3.85-$3.96, reflecting an annualized growth rate of 7-10% compared with the midpoint of the company's 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range.Our TakeHenry Schein exited third-quarter 2017 on a mixed note. All four of the company’s operating segments recorded strong year-over-year growth. Henry Schein’s strong share gains in the North American and overseas markets along with solid revenues raise optimism.Despite the better-than-expected revenue performance, we are disappointed with the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein’s gross and operating margin due to higher cost of sales and expenses.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corp. (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report).

357,HSIC,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled for release on Nov 3, are expected to show lackluster performance by dental consumables and laboratories — one of the major revenue-generating components. While this could majorly impact third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at other segments should help the company post solid numbers.Last quarter, DENTSPLY’s earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter posted lackluster results in dental and healthcare consumables segment that comprises preventive, restorative, instruments, endodontic and laboratory dental products as well as consumable medical device products. Sales increased just 1.9% to $554.1 million in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for dental consumables and laboratories stands at $520 million for the third quarter. This reflects a decline of almost 6.5% from the last reported quarter. Notably, DENTSPLY has been grappling with issues pertaining to equipment inventory levels at certain distributor bases. Furthermore, unfavorable consumer trend is likely to mar sales at the segment. DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this release.View Upbeat: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DENTSPLY’s third-quarter earnings stands at 67 cents per share, signifying year-over-year growth of 1.1%. For revenues, the consensus estimate stands at $978.4 million, up 2.5% year over year. The company has been witnessing a rebound in Asia, particularly Japan, along with strong growth in Russia. However, the company lowered its outlook for the year. In fact, DENTSPLY’s results in the first half of the year have lagged expectations.Domestic Market Holds Promise: We are upbeat about the gradual recovery in the U.S. market. The emerging markets provide significant opportunities for the company as these areas are vastly untapped with low dental product penetration. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the region stands at $335 million, up 1.5% year over year. Apart from the United States, Europe has been a significant revenue contributor, with internal growth of 2.3% in the last quarter.Buoyed by the bullish trends, our quantitative model shows an earnings beat for DENTSPLY this quarter.

358,HSIC,"We are in the thick of the earnings season with more than 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization having already released their quarterly numbers. Meanwhile, in the MedTech space, uncertainty related to the Trump administration’s Obamacare repeal & replacement effort continues to make headlines. The latest uproar is related to the President’s newly-released executive order, designed to provide affordable quality healthcare to the nation.Let us now have a quick look at how the medical device space has fared so far in the reporting cycle.Q3 PerformanceVarious reports suggest that hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Ecolab (ECL  -  Free Report) expects the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents per share. In fact, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of the Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.The overall lack of visibility befuddles the favorable trend of the past few quarters in the broader Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the third-quarter expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 5.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate of second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.To note, there are some powerful long-term tailwinds in the medical space, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sector’s impressive performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task. Our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for you.

359,HSIC,"PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report) is expected to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the closing bell. In the last quarter, the company registered adjusted earnings of 67 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, adjusted revenues of approximately $547.1 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552.0 million.PerkinElmer’s decision to restructure its Discovery & Analytical Solutions or DAS and Diagnostics segment holds promise for the third quarter. Furthermore, the company’s divestiture of the Medical Imaging segment in the last quarter is expected to impact earnings this season.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.PerkinElmer, Inc. Price and Consensus  PerkinElmer, Inc. Price and Consensus | PerkinElmer, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderView Upbeat: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PerkinElmer’s third-quarter earnings stands at 73 cents per share, signifying year-over-year growth of 6.8%. For revenues, the consensus estimate stands at $552.4 million, up 8% year over year.For the third quarter of 2017, PerkinElmer projects revenues in the range of $550 million to $555 million, which represents organic revenue growth of approximately 5%. Third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of 71 cents to 73 cents.Solid Global Foothold: PerkinElmer has been developing biochemical and molecular testing menu to meet the needs of pharmaceutical companies and serve the markets of China and India. In the last quarter, the company won two newborn-screening tenders in Russia and Mexico. Added to this, strong demand from the China Laboratory business launched last year is expected to yield solid results in the quarter to be reported.PerkinElmer also acquired Goa, India-based Tulip Diagnostics Private Ltd for an undisclosed amount. Although Tulip was acquired in early January, we are bullish about the buyout as it will help PerkinElmer tap into the opportunities in the emerging market of diagnostics. The takeover is also likely to strengthen PerkinElmer’s foothold in the infectious disease testing space.Foreign Exchange Volatility: Increasing exposure to the international market increases the risk of foreign exchange volatility. Foreign exchange posed a headwind of approximately 1% to the top line in the last quarter. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can adversely impact the company’s international sales. Due to the sluggish European economy, revenues and earnings are likely to be affected adversely this season.Our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for PerkinElmer this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for PerkinElmer is -0.83%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PerkinElmer carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.INC Research Holdings, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.74% and a Zacks Rank #3.

360,HSIC,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 7, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 15.4%. Moreover, Myriad Genetics beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 6.2%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to last quarter, Myriad Genetics is expected to gain from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance led by solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $170 million reflects an increase of 3% from the year-ago quarter.We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA, Prolaris and EndoPredict revenues, all of which make up most of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio. Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. QuotePer the company, the GeneSight test represents significant opportunities. As GeneSight is in the initial stages of adoption and is placed in a highly under-penetrated preventive care market, the product has huge growth potential. Management expects consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GeneSight test of $26.1 million reflects an increase of 263.9% from the year-ago quarter and 2.4% sequentially.In March, the company  launched  the EndoPredict test in the United States for patients with early-stage breast cancer and since then has received encouraging response for it. In August, Myriad Genetics received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Anthem, Inc., one of the largest private insurers in the United States. Notably, full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90% of breast cancer patients.The company recently announced positive results from a clinical study evaluating EndoPredict which highlights its superiority over the first-generation Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting breast cancer recurrence in women determined to be at intermediate clinical risk by the Nottingham Prognostic Index. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GeneSight test of $2.3 million reflects an increase of 35.3% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Myriad Genetics’ first-quarter results:Management seemed upbeat about the prospects of the Prolaris test. In May, the company announced the receipt of a positive final Local Coverage Determination (LCD) to expand Medicare coverage of the Prolaris test by Palmetto GBA, a MAC.Again, in May, the company announced plans of showcasing data demonstrating the utility of the Prolaristest in efficiently predicting the 10-year risk of metastases in men treated for prostate cancer at the American Urological Association (AUA) 2017 Annual Meeting. These positive flow of news are expected to to boost the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolaris test revenues of $3.3 million reflects an increase of 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.Management estimates adjusted earnings per share of 19-21 cents on total revenue of $181-$183 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 . The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings of 21 cents and revenues of $182 million is within the company’s guided range.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and higher expenses owing to extensive pipeline of some testsmay impact the company’s margins.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Myriad Genetics is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Myriad Genetics has an Earnings ESP of +1.04%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Myriad Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Myriad Genetics’ Zacks Rank #2 and +1.04% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

361,HSIC,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 1, before market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. Baxter International has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average positive beat being 10.6%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to last quarter, Baxter International is expected to gain from strength in Hospital Products on solid sales in the U.S. Fluid Systems business as well as solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. Quote Within Hospital Products, in the third quarter, sales in Fluid Systems were up significantly on robust IV solution sales in the United States. We expect Fluid Systems to maintain the trend, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $634 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting 3.3% rise from the year-ago quarter.Global sales of Integrated Pharmacy Solutions (IPS), another sub segment within Hospital Products, increased by a formidable margin in the third quarter, partly on the back of increased sales for premixed injectable drugs. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IPS is pegged at $576 million, up 2.3% from the year ago reported number.Surgical Care (includes anesthesia and BioSurgery) sales also recorded year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter, on low double-digit growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by growing demand for inhaled anesthetics internationally as well as increased U.S. sales of BREVIBLOC — a fast-acting IV beta blocker. The fourth-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales stands at$576 million, up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Also, BioSurgery sales increased low-single digits globally in the last reported quarter. The company expects growth in this business to continue as a result of continuous efforts to enhance commercial effectiveness.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hospital Products net sales of $1.67 billion reflects an increase of 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, on Sep 27, 2017, Baxter announced the launch of comprehensive asset tracking solution DeviceVue. The solution will be used alongside the company’s proprietary pump system, Sigma Spectrum Infusion System. It will aid clinicians and biomedical engineers to quickly find unused pumps by viewing location and status data on PCs, iPads or iPhones. We are bullish on the development as it provides an edge to Sigma Spectrum when compared with other smart pumps in the market.Here are the other factors that might influence Baxter’s fourth-quarter results:Sales in Renal business grew significantly in the third quarter on the back of solid performance across all lines of the business. Taking the stellar third-quarter performance into consideration, we expect the Renal business to perform well in the yet-to-be-reported quarter as well.On Sep 26, 2017, Baxter announced the commercial launch of a new indication for the company’s oXiris set, which can now be used to remove excessive levels of cytokines, endotoxin and other inflammatory mediators from a patient’s blood. The launch is likely to drive the top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.As per the company’s earlier-provided guidance, sales in the fourth quarter are expected to increase 1% to 2%. Net sales in the quarter are expected to rise 2% at constant currency. The company expects Hurricane Maria to have a negative impact on fourth-quarter revenues of around $70 million. The company also expects adjusted earnings in the range of 56 cents to 59 cents per diluted share. This includes a 6-cent negative earnings impact from Hurricane Maria, which is mitigated by an increase in the sales projections for U.S. cyclophosphamide and a lower-than-expected tax rate for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.76 billion, while the same for earnings is at 58 cents, reflecting a 1.6% increase.However, pricing pressure continues to raise caution.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Baxter has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Baxter International is +1.50%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Baxter International carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 90 cents reflects a 20% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

362,HSIC,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results on Nov 8, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, the average beat being 4.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to last quarter, Hologic is expected to see a stellar performance by its Molecular Diagnostics business. In the United States, the company is expected to gain from increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to testing guidelines. Notably, Hologic recently received FDA approval to market the AptimaHerpes Simplex Virus 1 & 2 molecular assay on the Panther system. The company believes this approval will draw customers apart from broadening the Panther women health menu.Internationally, Molecular Diagnostics results were strong in the last-reported quarter, courtesy of benefits of a new leadership, healthy Panther placements and multiple product introductions, including viral load assays. Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the company’s receipt of European CE Mark for its new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for flu and respiratory testing in June. The company also received CE Mark for Aptima Combo 2 Assay for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the same month. These developments should boost Molecular Diagnostics revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $146 million reflects an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter and 1.4% sequentially.Here are the other factors that might influence Hologic’s fourth-quarter results:Hologic is hopeful about sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2017 on the back of gains from the GYN Surgical segment. Strong global sales of MyoSure have been driving the top line at this segment. Given the huge market potential of Myosure, we expect the company to maintain the bullish trend. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GYN Surgical revenues of $107 million reflects an increase of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MyoSure revenues of $51 million reflects an increase of 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company is also positioned to rake in significant benefits in the fourth quarter from the integration of Cynosure, a medical aesthetics systems and technologies company, which was acquired by Hologic in March 2017.  The. FDA recently granted an expanded clearance for Cynosure’s non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, to treat the submental area. This approval marked SculpSure’s sixth cleared body treatment area.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $785-$800 million, representing annualized growth of 8-10.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $793 million is within the projected range and reflects an increase of 9.1% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48-50 cents, showing an annualized decline of 7.2-3.4%. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of 49 cents reflects a decline of 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.On the flip side, Hologic’s blood screening divestiture is expected to impede the company’s growth momentum. We expect this to get reflected in the company’s financial performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Hologic also had to face challenges related to unfavorable foreign currency over the past few quarters. Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to concern.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hologic is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

363,HSIC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp.’s (ABC  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, scheduled for release on Nov 2, are expected to show steady growth in pharmaceutical distribution segment, a significant contributor to revenues. While this could majorly drive fourth-quarter earnings, let us take a look at the broader factors that are expected to influence the quarterly release.AmerisourceBergen’s earnings in the preceding quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, courtesy of strong growth in Consulting Services, MWI Animal Health and World Courier businesses. Revenues rose almost 4.9% to $38.7 billion in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment stands at $38.34 billion for the quarter under review. This reflects an improvement of almost 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) QuoteOther Factors to ConsiderMeanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AmerisourceBergen’s earnings stands at $1.32 per share, up 1.8% year over year. The company should benefit from continued solid organic revenue growth, MWI and PharMedium acquisition. The consensus estimate for net revenues is pegged at $40.1 billion, signifying growth of 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.On the flipside, although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs and lack of generic inflation, will affect the company’s bottom line.The temporary slowdown in the PharMEDium segment is expected to mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the fourth quarter. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive edge, it might affect the bottom line in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for AmerisourceBergen this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for AmerisourceBergen is -0.54%.

364,HSIC,"CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 3.7%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsCVS Health is optimistic about sustaining a solid year-over-year earnings trend in 2017 on the back of gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Pharmacy Services segment revenues of $33.1 billion reflects an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.However, there are several timing factors that have already affected the cadence of profit delivery last quarter. One such aspect was the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business. Per the company, the same is expected to continue through the rest of 2017.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer CVS Health, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the period when the risk-sharing corridor is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Hence, any change in any current estimates like utilization, significantly impacts the timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters.The timing of Medicare Part D profitability factor apart, the company expects benefits from enterprise streamlining initiatives to be much more in the back half of the year than the year to date figure. Keeping that in mind, at the last earnings call, the company had projected third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.47-$1.50, reflecting a decline of 2.5% to an increase of 1% year over year.Here are some other factors that might also influence CVS Health’s third-quarter results:The company is worried about its Retail/Long Term Care business, wherein revenues are expected to be down 3.25-5% in the third quarter from the year-ago period due to the restricted network changes. Notably, the decision to restrict CVS Health from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks have continued to negatively impact Pharmacy sales and script comps. Additionally, the company’s adjusted script comps are expected to be in the range of down 0.75% to up 0.25% and the total same-store sales to be down in the 4-5.75% band in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.However, it expects PBM revenues to grow 8.5%-9.75%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes and specialty pharmacy. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Retail Pharmacy segment net revenues of $19.3 billion reflects a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Consolidated net revenues have projected a 2.75-4.25% rise during the third quarter. Overall, the company estimates to deliver healthy PBM growth on a successful PBM selling season. Specialty business is expected to record strong growth and SilverScript’s business also hopes to retain its good performance.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

365,HSIC,"Cerner Corporation’s (CERN  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled for release on Oct 26, are expected to show steady growth in system sales — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Cerner’s last quarter earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Similar to the prior quarter, strong growth in licensed software and subscriptions are expected to be the main factors driving systems revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for systems sales stands at $337 million for the third quarter. This reflects an increase of almost 12% from the year-ago quarter. Growth across acute and ambulatory EHR and sales of Population Health and Revenue Cycle solutions and services hold promise for Cerner.Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus  Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus | Cerner Corporation Quote Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Other Factors at PlayView Upbeat: For the third quarter, Cerner forecasts revenues between $1.27 billion and $1.33 billion. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 61 cents to 63 cents per share. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $1.29 billion, signifying 9.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 62 cents per share, up 5.4% year over year. Solid participation in the EHR placement market has lent Cerner a competitive edge in the global space. Cerner offers an exposure to worldwide healthcare automation.Growth in Support, Maintenance & Services: In the last quarter, management at Cerner announced that the company expects growth in the band 3% to 4% at the segment for the rest of the year. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues stands at $933 million, up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% sequentially.Strategic Partnerships: Cerner follows a strategy of acquiring complementary businesses that allow the company to expand its solutions, device offerings and services, and grow its market and client base.In August, Cerner announced the formation of the Post-Acute Innovation Center with HealthSouth Corporation, the nation's largest provider of post-acute services. Furthermore, Cerner partnered with LifePoint Health, a large investor-owned health company that owns and operates more than 70 hospitals in the last quarter.Bookings Update: It is important to note that bookings in the last quarter were $1.636 billion (an all-time high), up 16% on a year-over-year basis.

A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and International markets are helping the company to rapidly expand its product portfolio.

Overall for fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase approximately 4.5-5.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BD Medical segment is at $2.105 billion for the fourth quarter, signifying sequential growth of 2.8%.

367,HSIC,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled for release on Oct 31, are expected to show steady growth in Global Energy — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Ecolab’s last quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Similar to the prior quarter, strong growth in the well-stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business are expected to be the main factors driving Global Energy revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Energy stands at $798 million for the third quarter. This reflects an increase of almost 4.9% from the year-ago quarter. Apart from the Energy segment, growth across Global Industrial and Global Institutional segments, hold promise for Ecolab. Ecolab Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ecolab Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ecolab Inc.

Sales are growing sequentially on the back of pricing, new business and improvement in the energy segment. However, margins are under modest pressure owing to raw materials and hedging comparisons. As a result, management at Ecolab expects to deliver a solid 2017 with excellent momentum entering full-year 2018.Coming to the estimate revision trend, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $3.55 billion for the third quarter, depicting 7.8% growth on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings stands at $1.36 per share, up 6.3% year over year.Ecolab’s earnings growth despite a challenging business environment raises investors’ confidence. Additionally, the company's large base of recurring revenues, industry-leading technologies and excellent field service are significant propellers.Global Industrial & Institutional Segment: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for global industrial unit stands at $1.25 billion for the third quarter, signifying sequential growth of 3% and year-over-year growth of 5.1%. Within the industrial segment, prospects in the Food & Beverage Processing Business (F&B) are likely to show positive results in the third quarter.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the global institutional stands at $1.25 billion, up 7.7% year over year.Fundamentals Strong: Ecolab is a leading provider of water, hygiene and energy technologies and services that protect people and vital resources. The company's programs and services help promote food safety, maintain clean environments, optimize water and energy use and improve operational efficiencies for customers in the food, energy, healthcare, industrial and hospitality markets in more than 170 countries.In fact, in September, Ecolab was selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (“DJSI”), the global indicator tracking the financial performance of leading sustainability-driven companies. Launched in 1999, DJSI is considered a benchmark in this area. The index is drawn up by Dow Jones in collaboration with investment management firm Strategic Asset Management (“SAM”).However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Ecolab this quarter.

368,HSIC,"Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), a global player in the healthcare services and products space, is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 6, before the closing bell.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The stock delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.25%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayStrong Outlook: Management at Cardinal Health is bullish about significant cash generation in the first quarter. Furthermore, the company’s Cordis business is expected to generate accretive returns in the quarter under review.We note that despite solid commercial momentum on a global basis, the Cordis segment generated sluggish returns in the last reported quarter. However, in the first quarter, Cardinal Health is expected to leverage on the Patient Recovery business in the Cordis profile.Meanwhile, Cardinal Health affirmed the fiscal 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations at $4.85-$5.10. The outlook represents growth of approximately 2-5% from the prior fiscal.Pricing Pressure in Generics Portfolio: Cardinal Health has been grappling with pricing deflation in the generics segment for long. Per management, reimbursement pressure is likely to affect the company’s customer base and also impede generic launches in the near term. Incremental expenses, specifically in the Pharma segment, might dent profits in the first quarter.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: Cardinal Health witnesses tough competition in each of its business segments. For example, its pharmaceutical supply chain business faces competition from several smaller medical-surgical distributors. Intensifying competition in the global markets is likely to mar Cardinal Health’s top line in the first quarter.Estimate Revision Trend: The company’s estimate revision trend lacks luster. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared with no upward revision in the last two months. Over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined almost 6.5% to $1.01 per share, adding to concerns.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cardinal Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Cardinal Health is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.01.

369,HSIC,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, after markets close on Oct 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.6% with average earnings beat of 9.3% in three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong performance in Product revenues as well as Service and other revenue segments. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues increased primarily onrising sequencing consumable revenues. Total Service and other revenues are demonstrating strong growth led by continued demand for NextSeq from NIPT customers and partners. We expect these factors to drive the yet-to-be reported quarter’s performance as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $579 million reflects an increase of 12.6% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $116 million indicates a rise of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, third-quarter 2017 total revenues are projected at $694 million, up 14.3% from the prior-year quarter. Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s third-quarter results:Illumina earlier announced that its FDA-approved next-generation sequencing (NGS) -- Extended RAS Panel has met the Current Colorectal Cancer Guidelines. This new kit fulfills the most up-to-date guidance for RAS testing to determine eligibility of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in metastatic colorectal cancer. Management expected the shipment of this kit to start in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, we expect this to drive the top line.In the second quarter, Illumina witnessed 12% growth in the Asia-Pacific region, propelled by 16% rise in China. Among the emerging markets, China currently offers the most favorable space for Illumina’s business growth. In recent times, management has noticed a considerable rise in demand from customers looking to set up NIPT operations in China. With China currently being the fourth largest developing nation (in terms of nominal GDP), we believe the progress in the country will open up channels for Illumina, thereby driving its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Also, encouraged by the solid second-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 12% from the earlier provided range of 10-12%. On the flip side, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Illumina does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Illumina is -0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 98 cents reflects a 1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% as the Most Accurate estimate is 91 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at 90 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Henry Schein’s Zacks Rank #3 and +1.23% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayHenry Schein’s second-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments – Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in both North America and overseas. We expect a similar trend in the third quarter as well.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations to witness at least low single-digit growth in North America’s dental consumable merchandise market in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues of $3.049 billion reflects an increase of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Beginning Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to some extent.Notably, during the second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighborhood. This has helped the company operate as a complete solution provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margins over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to the woes. Also, the entry of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States has intensified competition.Overall, Henry Schein expects 2017 EPS in the range of $7.17-$7.30, reflecting 8-10% growth from the 2016 EPS figure of $6.61.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

371,HSIC,"Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), a leading player in the medical technology space, is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the closing bell.In August, Stryker announced a voluntary recall of the Oral Care line-up, which was offered by the company’s Sage-Products unit. Added to the voluntary recall, the company had placed a temporary hold on certain cloth-based products. While this might mar third-quarter results, an expected improvement in revenues at the major revenue segments might help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Stryker delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 1.3%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues stands at $2.97 billion, up 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.50 per share, up 8.1% year over year.Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus  Stryker Corporation Price and Consensus | Stryker Corporation Quote Factors at PlayGuidance Takes a Hit: The recent product recall is likely to impact the company’s sales and operating income. In fact for the third quarter, Stryker estimates adjusted net earnings per diluted share at the low end of its previously issued $1.50-$1.55 band. The recall decision followed complaints of minor irritation and allergic reactions from consumers. However, management expects to reinitiate full supply capacity by the end of the year.Neurotechnology & Spine Segment: Stryker has been grappling with supply issues in the spine unit of Neurotechnology and spine segment for long. Of the major factors hurting the segment, challenging global economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates deserve a mention. Precisely, foreign exchange volatility will affect adjusted earnings per share by approximately 2 cents in the third quarter.Owing to softness in the spine unit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Neurotechnology & Spine segment decreased 2.3% sequentially to $1.31 billion.Lower Demand for Health Care Products: Stryker has been facing challenging global economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Western Europe of late. The ongoing political conundrum pertaining to the repealing of Obamacare has given rise to uncertainties in the Medical Products space.Added to this, lower reimbursements for medical products and services have been imposing a downward pressure on prices of the company’s products. Furthermore, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies might mar revenues in the third quarter.MedSurg Unit: Declining sales in the Medsurg Equipment segment is likely to impede revenue growth in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the segment stands at $1.31 billion, down 2.4% sequentially.However, solid prospects in Canada, Australia and China are likely to boost the company’s MedSurg Instrument unit. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment increased 1.8% sequentially and 5% on a year-over-year basis. It is important to note that, in the last reported quarter, MedSurg as a whole posted organic growth of 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Stryker is -0.58%.

372,HSIC,"McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), one of the largest healthcare service providers, is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 26.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.46 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81. Also, in the last four quarters, McKesson's earnings missed the same at an average of 0.46%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat on earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: McKesson has an Earnings ESP of +0.72% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.80, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.78. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of McKesson’s Zacks Rank #3 and ESP of +2.15% makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. Management expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in recent times despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. Also, McKesson projects earnings per share in the range of $11.80-$12.50 for fiscal 2018. Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to increase in mid-single digits year over year. Considering the company’s performance in the last quarter and promising guidance, we expect a similar trend in the yet-to-be reported quarter as well. Furthermore, McKesson is likely to benefit from the recent acquisition of CoverMyMeds LLC.In the international segment, management expects percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in 2018. Per management, international business is likely to be impacted by additional U.K. reimbursement cuts although the incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are significantly smaller than those in fiscal 2017.However, continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have an adverse impact on McKesson. Also, a competitive landscape adds to the woes.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:INC Research Holdings, Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +2.02% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

373,HSIC,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), also known as LabCorp, is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results, before market opens on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. It has an average earnings beat of 1.1% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLabCorp’s top-line performance continues to be affected by softness in its Covance Drug Development business, as was the case in the last reported quarter as well. The weak performance was led by sluggish early development and central lab businesses, which were affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016. Also, adverse foreign exchange rates affected the numbers to the tune of 140 basis points (bps) at this segment.Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the company’s expectations of an improvement in the Covance Drug Development arm starting the second half of 2017. This should get reflected in the third-quarter performance.Over the last two years, LabCorp has faced several reimbursement issues that have dented its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe reimbursement pressure will affect the company’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise   Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteNotably, the company are not positive about the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this will most likely have no impact on its third-quarter results.Unfavorable foreign exchange continues to be a pressing concern for the company. Previously, LabCorp had anticipated an approximate 40-bps negative currency impact on 2017 revenues. The company currently expects a 20-bps impact from adverse foreign exchange on net revenue at Covance Drug Development in 2017.LabCorp has been continuously grappling with the issue of rising operating expenses which has affected its margins in the last reported quarter. Also, the chances of a turnaround in the scenario any time soon are slim.Meanwhile, on a positive note, LabCorp is focusing on research and development in collaboration with academic institutions in order to gain traction in the growing lab testing market. In July 2017, LabCorp launched ADAMTS13 test to distinguish diseases characterized by life-threatening, acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Also, in May, company expanded its VistaSeq Hereditary Cancer portfolio through the addition of 10 new test panels with focus on the risk of specific hereditary cancer syndromes.LabCorp recently teamed up with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) to set up specimen collection service stations at various Walgreens stores across the United States. The company also expanded its reach by closing the acquisition of Mount Sinai Health System Clinical Outreach Laboratories in May 2017. LabCorp’s highly differentiated portfolio will be used by the existing customers of Mount Sinai. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.LabCorp’s companion diagnostics portfolio, which grew a robust 35% in the last couple of years, should maintain its momentum in 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

374,HSIC,"GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report), a specialty retailer of health and nutrition related products, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.5%. However, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter earnings average miss stands at 19.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported second-quarter 2017 revenues dropped 4.8% year over year. Apart from lower sales at the U.S. & Canada international and manufacturing/wholesale segments, the decline in revenues can be attributed to an overall drop in sales of protein, vitamins, weight management and food and drink categories. In absence of any catalyst to drive growth, we expect a similar trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Moreover, GNC Holdings has a number of competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, supermarket firms and big U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we expect the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which in turn, might hurt margins. GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. Quote Also, currency headwinds continue to be a growing concern for GNC Holdings. Management also expects the failure to comply with FTC regulations and changing consumer preferences to hamper business.However, on the bright side, the performance of One New GNC is improving gradually. Also, in the last reported quarter, PRO Access members doubled their visits, purchased double the products and spent significantly more in the second quarter. Banking on these factors, we expect the company to continue to gain in the yet-to-be-reported quarter as well. Meanwhile, new consumer enrolment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.Earnings Whispers   Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for GNC Holdings this quarter.

375,HSIC,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 24, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.7%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last reported quarter. Moreover, with the receipt of expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June 2017 is expected to further boost the top line at the THVT segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $496 million reflects an increase of 20.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $322 million shows an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter revenues are projected at $833.89 million.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteHere are the other factors that might influence Edwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter results:In the domestic market, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to continue with its strong performance based on strength in THVT and two other segments — Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care.The company witnessed strength in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy on the back of strong uptake of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system. Progressing in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, the company received FDA approval for INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in July 2017. On the other hand, growth in Critical Care group was led by double-digit growth in Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, especially in the United States.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the United States of $467 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Edwards Lifesciences earlier raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously provided range of $3.2-$3.4 billion.Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents to 90 cents for the third quarter.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to challenge the company.We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management expects the third quarter to be the seasonally lowest quarter, which adds to the concerns.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Edwards Lifesciencesdoes not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP forEdwards Lifesciences is -1.83%.

376,HSIC,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.23%. The trailing four-quarter average beat is pegged at 0.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams globally. The company while gaining share in a number of cardiovascular segments and DES (Drug Eluting Stent). continues to build momentum globally.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote However, ahead of earnings release, we believe the quarter’s IC business to be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. Notably, last February, the company recalled one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe due to device malfunctions. The company also delayed submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device.The above product line has little hope to return to the European and other markets before the fourth quarter. This might lead to a major setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within IC in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.While we believe the downbeat IC business to earn some boost from the company’s recent $435-million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time.Accordingly, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter IC revenues is currently pegged at $580 million, lower than the sequentially last quarter’s reported number of $603 million.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is expected to demonstrate a consistent performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also estimated to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $403 million, significantly higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $367 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $266 million remains ahead of the year-ago reported tally of $248 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing of late, remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from international markets, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. In 2017, Boston Scientific expects an unfavorable foreign exchange challenge to the tune of $85 million on revenues and 700 bps or 8 cents per share on earnings.Overall, Boston Scientific’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 29-31 cents per share on revenues of $2.18-$2.21 billion.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Boston Scientific does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

377,HSIC,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.04 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents. However, adjusted earnings declined from $1.22 in the year-ago period.Factors at PlayWe are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.15-$1.23. Revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.The company recently launched its FDA-approved product Halcyon, to strengthen foothold in the oncology business. Varian Medical also signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam. We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally, where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening offices in Africa and the Middle East, which depicts that it is aware of opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian Medical’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

378,HSIC,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 25, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.5%, taking the four-quarter average to 15.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe are encouraged by the company’s guidance for third-quarter 2017 and full-year 2017. For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents. Also, for full-year 2017, the company projects earnings in the band of $2.34 to $2.40 per share (from continuing operations, before special items), up from full-year 2016 earnings of $1.95. Of late, Baxter International has accelerated pace of acquisitions and strategic collaborations to enhance its product portfolio, thereby opening up significant long-term opportunities. Also, several recent FDA approvals are likely to drive growth in the yet-to-be-reported third quarter of 2017.The company’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, Baxter International witnessed two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the third quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact top line by low-single digits. Also, the foray of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States intensifies competition for the company.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Baxter International is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 59 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Baxter International carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Baxter International Inc.

379,HSIC,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 25.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.53%. It is worth noting that Walgreens has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.63%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWalgreens Boots' Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market in the last reported quarter. Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, the Retail Pharmacy USA division saw the highest comparable prescription growth in more than seven years.Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts and volume increase from previously announced strategic pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this growth momentum to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteBased on a promising performance in the preceding quarter, Walgreens Boots raised the low end of its guidance for fiscal 2017 by 8 cents and currently expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $4.98 to $5.08. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.22 reflects a 14% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $30.09 billion reflects a 5.1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.However, the sales performance of the Retail Pharmacy international division continued to disappoint. The reduction in government pharmacy funding in the U.K. has been affecting performance. In absence of any near-term catalyst, we expect the scenario to persist in the upcoming quarter as well.We also note that slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots' margins. Of late, increased reimbursement pressures as well as generic drug cost inflation have been denting margins. In the third quarter of 2017, Walgreens Boots' gross margin contracted on account of reimbursement pressure and price inflation of branded drugs.Management continues to witness lower profitability in Boots UK comparable pharmacy's gross profit due to lower margin products. Although the company is working to boost efficiency and provide high-quality, cost-effective pharmacy services, the near-term outlook remains bleak.Meanwhile, market growth is expected to be strong in certain emerging markets backed by the timing of price increase. Also, in order to expand its footprint in Asia, the company launched its first Boots franchise store in South Korea in April 2017. This development is expected to boost the top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.In September 2017, Walgreens Boots announced the receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval for the purchase of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total value of $4.375 billion. Post the new transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be entirely realized within four years of its initial completion. Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Bootsdoes not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP forWalgreens Boots is -0.44%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.
