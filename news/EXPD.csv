12,EXPD,"A new report from RBC Capital Markets asks the ever more pressing question about Amazon.com (AMZN) and its deliveries ambitions: Does the transportation sector have a problem?The short answer is no -- at least not yet, according to RBC analyst John Barnes.The crux of the issue for the e-commerce leader is that its shipping costs soared 32% to $11.5 billion in 2015, while sales rose about 20%. That, says Barnes, suggests that Amazon might have trouble ahead if it continues on course. As a result, Amazon has been taking more of the shipping task into its own hands.RBC emphasizes, though, that Amazon isn't anywhere near able to separate itself from shipping partners such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX). But the company will incrementally begin to do so, the report says, at least in certain areas.In prior years -- though not in 2015 -- both UPS and FedEx have stumbled during the critical holiday season. Packages not being delivered on time, Barnes says, is like Amazon being closed on random days without warning.Amazon's massive distribution network is as complex as it is large. It includes a growing trucking operation and the recently disclosed air transport and ocean shipping components.Ocean shipping is where Barnes suspects the company will attack first. ""We believe Amazon will take over large swaths of its ocean freight supply chain, as the move can lower its own shipping costs, drive third-party sellers to the platform and eventually turn into a profit center,"" Barnes wrote in the report, released late Monday.As IBD has reported, industry experts estimate that the ocean shipping business has the potential to be worth millions in free cash flow for Amazon, mostly from selling capacity to third parties. Analysts says that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos might not go after the free cash flow but instead drive the value back to consumers in some fashion, such as still-lower prices. But the ocean shipping industry is vast, and Barnes estimates that the Seattle-based company would grab only between $200 million and $400 million in business. It could, though, affect shippers such as Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD) as well as UPS and FedEx.The ocean shipping grab isn't without precedent, either. Wal-Mart (WMT) has been taking possession of suppliers' goods in China and doing its own shipping for years.Amazon's growing air network is one area where the company will be content to work with third parties, Barnes said. Amazon's recently announced deal with Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) to lease 20 767 jets highlights this point. As part of the deal, Amazon will be able to purchase about 20% of ATSG's common shares over a five-year period.Meanwhile, Barnes says that UPS and FedEx are both fighting Amazon's long-term onslaught. UPS now provides 30% of Amazon's parcel needs, netting $2.2 billion in revenue, and FedEx hauls in $1.5 billion, or about 20%. Those figures translate to about 8% and 10% of ground revenue, respectively, for the shipping companies.

143,EXPD,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

170,EXPD,"Per a Bloomberg report, Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY  -  Free Report) will encounter its first-ever pilot strike next week in the home market of Ireland over its alleged failure to meet demands regarding new working practices.The Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association (IALPA) representing Ryanair pilots stated that a polling by the carrier’s cockpit crew members resulted in a 94 to 1 vote in favor of industrial action including strikes. The walkouts are scheduled to be staged on Jul 12. The strike is expected to carry on for 24 hours and the IALPA will notify the airline regarding additional walkouts. However, the union is open to discussions to resolve the issue.The carrier was able to avert similar strikes last December, acknowledging trade unions for the very first time in its 32 years in the industry. However, the airline has been unable to reach a definitive agreement in some countries.With Ireland accounting for only 7% of Ryanair flights, majority of its customers is expected to be unaffected by this strike. However, the timing of the strike cannot be ignored. The turmoil comes at a time when the airline’s summer travel is already pressurized with last month’s cancellation of 1,100 flights due to air traffic control strikes, among other factors. Moreover, traditional holidays in Northern Ireland start from Jul 12 onward. Thus, the strike is likely to adversely impact travelers holidaying to Dublin during the time.Ryanair Holdings PLC Price  Ryanair Holdings PLC Price | Ryanair Holdings PLC QuoteThe union has also warned of a ripple effect arising from the strike at Ireland, which could affect flights elsewhere.Earlier, Ryanair successfully signed agreements with the cabin crew in Britain and Italy. However, some of them will come together in Dublin on Jul 11 in their first pan-European summit to negotiate contract terms.In a similar vein, German pilots are involved in a dispute with the airline over remuneration and work environment related problems.

171,EXPD,"On Jul 3, 2018, we initiated coverage on Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (KNX  -  Free Report).The company aims at growing through mergers and acquisitions. To this end, it acquired Abilene Motor Express this March. The buyout is a huge positive and is expected to supplement the business with 400 trucks and several drivers. Moreover, annual revenues are anticipated to get a boost of approximately $100 million.Solid demand for freight and volume growth has been aiding the company. Notably, strong freight demand is enabling the carrier to charge higher prices for its cargo. In fact, the upbeat freight scenario drove the company’s first-quarter 2018 results. Earnings came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also soared more than 100% year over year.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through dividend payments are also impressive.  As of Mar 31, 2018, it paid $31.3 million to stakeholders via dividends.Knight-Swift’s measures to control debt are encouraging as well. During the first quarter, the company was able to reduce debt by $107 million, sequentially, despite the credit funding of Abilene acquisition. Also, that the company is not a highly leveraged entity is evident from its debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio of 10.6%. The figure lies below the industry’s 12.5% tally.Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. Price and Consensus  Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. Price and Consensus | Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. QuoteThe favorable scenario revolving around the stock is clear from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 0.9% upward in the last 60 days.However, the company’s acute driver shortage and the subsequent constraint on truck count raise concerns.  During the first quarter, truck count declined by 385 compared with the number registered in fourth-quarter 2017. Rising fuel prices are another headwind for the company as exorbitant fuel costs might affect its bottom-line growth.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksKnight-Swift carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

178,EXPD,"Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company performed impressively posting better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The bottom line increased 12% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues. The top line also increased 15% from the year-ago figure. Growth was witnessed across all major divisions of the company.Let’s see, how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayHigh operating expenses are likely to hurt Expeditors’ bottom line in the fourth quarter. In terms of enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA ratio, the stock appears overvalued compared with the market at large. The company has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.5, ahead of the S&P 500 index's 10.7.However, volume growth across the company’s primary divisions might buoy its earnings results in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is anticipated to witness substantial growth across all its segments, boosting the quarterly top line in turn.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are also encouraging. An update on this is expected on fourth-quarter conference call. Expeditors might hike its dividend payout, particularly with the advent of the new tax law, which should aid the company significantly.Its sound balance sheet is a further positive. The company’s asset-light business model allows it to maintain a debt-free, stable financial position.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Expeditors is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Expeditors has an Earnings ESP of -2.62%, which acts as a spoiler as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

179,EXPD,"Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 6 before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 4.4%. Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings history, outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.8%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this earnings.Factors at PlaySpirit Airlines’ bottom line in the fourth quarter is likely to be hurt by high costs just as the previous quarter. Fuel costs are anticipated to be substantially higher than the year-ago figure. Economic fuel cost per gallon is estimated at $1.97 in the to-be-reported period.The company has also been struggling with capacity overexpansion woes, which might further hamper results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Capacity is projected to rise approximately 17.6% in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company’s total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) for the period is disappointing. TRASM is expected to be down approximately 2% in the quarter.However, the company’s fleet modernization efforts are impressive. Also, it has been making constant efforts to expand its operations. The carrier’s efforts to reward shareholders via dividends and share buybacks are a further positive. Updates on the above issues are expected on fourth-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

182,EXPD,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of f $1.45 that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 per share. The bottom line also inched up 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. However, results were hurt by the hurricanes.Revenues improved 7% to $15,978 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,605.5 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Things seem to be looking up for the company ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings release as well. The bullishness can be gauged from the fact that the UPS stock has outperformed its industry over the last month.  Shares of the company have gained 11.4% compared with the industry’s 9.9% rally in the period. Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsE-commerce growth is likely to aid the company’s results in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Revenues from the company’s U.S. Domestic Package unit are also likely to benefit from increased package volumes on the back of e-commerce growth. Ground products are likely to drive growth in the segment. In fact, UPS like its rival FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) had a highly successful holiday season buoyed by strong e-commerce growth, per a Reuters report. To meet the surge in demand during the holiday season, UPS hired around 95,000 seasonal workers.At the U.S. domestic package division, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $11,578 million, higher than $9,649 million reported in the previous quarter. The projection justifies our bullish stance on the segment.Furthermore, the company’s international package division is to perform well in the fourth quarter on the back of robust growth in export volumes. At this segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,607 million, lower than the $3,364 million in the third quarter of 2017.However, we expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for some time and the fourth quarter is likely to be no different. Moreover, UPS is working hard to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might drag down fourth-quarter earnings.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that UPS is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks Rank: UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks ESP: UPS has Earnings ESP of +0.10%.

184,EXPD,"Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) slipped to a 52-week low of $37.06 during the trading session on Jun 28 before retracing a bit to close at $38.20. The stock has lost 24.1% in a year’s time, wider than the industry’s 17.7% decline. Reasons Behind the Stock’s PlungeEarlier this month, a computer failure at American Airlines’ regional carrier PSA Airlines adversely impacted its crew scheduling system. The carrier’s operations went haywire as a result of this disruption and it had to call off more than 2, 500 flights.High costs are also a persistent problem at the carrier. In the first quarter of 2018, average fuel price per gallon increased 23.6% year over year to $2.10. Fuel prices are anticipated to be even higher (between $2.18 and $2.23) in the second quarter. This downside could further pressurize the company’s bottom line in the upcoming quarter. Moreover, in April, the company trimmed its current-year adjusted earnings per share guidance due to the same reason. It now expects the metric between $5.00 and $6.00 (previous guidance had hinted at earnings between $5.50 and $6.50).Apart from fuel costs, expenses pertaining to labor are expected to weigh on the bottom line in the current quarter. Consolidated cost per available seat miles (excluding special items and fuel) is also likely to rise 3.5% in the ongoing quarter.The company’s high debt levels also raise concerns. This is indicated by its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 85.2 (expressed as a percentage), which compares unfavorably with the industry average of 43.3 and the S&P 500 index’s measure of 43.1.Downward Estimate RevisionsDue to the above-mentioned headwinds, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-quarter earnings has been moved 4.5% south in the last 60 days. Also, the current-year bottom line has been revised 8.3% downward over the same time frame.The company’s unimpressive Momentum Score of D further highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmerican Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

187,EXPD,"Shares of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ  -  Free Report) lost 11.83% on Jun 26 to close the session at $16.84 per share. The decline can be attributed to a Bloomberg report, which stated that Morgan Stanley analysts have painted a grim picture for the car rental industry in the United States. In fact, the damage was not limited to Hertz Global. Shares of another major player in the rental car industry — Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) — also declined 9.65% to $34.93 on Jun 26. Per Morgan Stanley, rental-car companies will consistently suffer from pricing pressure apart from intense competition from the likes of Uber Technologies. Moreover, the the firm assessed that companies like Hertz are likely to struggle to increase prices by the requisite amount for offsetting the depreciation expenses associated with their fleets.Lackluster Price PerformanceWe note that the Hertz Global stock has performed disappointingly even before the bleak outlook pertaining to used-car pricing went public. So far this year, the stock has declined 24.1% against the industry’s 2.2% increase. Headwinds like pricing pressure, intense competition, high costs due to significant investments by Hertz Global in its turnaround plan and high debt levels have contributed to investors’ pessimism surrounding the stock.In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year loss, which has widened significantly over the last 60 days. Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate Hertz Global’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider better-ranked stocks like Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

189,EXPD,"Now that trade tension between the United States and China have taken the Wall Street in its grip, exposure to quality picks has become necessary.  There are various ratios that can help you find great stocks. Return on equity is one of them.The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit-churner and a profit-burner. It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity.To shortlist these gems, one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level. Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of 15 stocks that made it through the screen:Marine Products Corporation (MPX  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #2 company is the third-largest distributor of sterndrive powerboats in the United States.

190,EXPD,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended May 31, 2018), driven by e-commerce growth and a buoyant U.S. economy.The company’s earnings (excluding $1.76 from non-recurring items) of $5.91 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.72. Furthermore, the bottom line soared substantially on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Quarterly revenues increased 10.1% year over year to $17,314 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17,186 million. Growth was witnessed across all major divisions of the company.Operating income (on an adjusted basis) climbed 14.9% year over year to $2 billion in the reported quarter. Also, operating margin expanded to 11.5% from 11.1% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.FedEx Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  FedEx Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FedEx Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceQuarterly revenues at FedEx Express (including TNT Express) improved 9% to $9.60 billion on the back of better yields across the global portfolio of package and freight services besides higher freight pounds.Operating income (adjusted, excluding TNT Express integration expenses) came in at $1.10 billion, up 13% year over year while operating margin increased to 11.5% year over year from 11% in the year-ago quarter.FedEx Ground revenues increased 12% year over year to $4.80 billion in the period under consideration. A 6% rise in average daily package volume and higher base rates aided this segmental performance. Operating income came in at $832 million, up 18% while operating margin inched up 90 basis points (bps) to 17.3%.FedEx Freight revenues jumped 16% year over year to $1.86 billion. Segmental revenues were benefited by 8% increase, each in revenue per shipment as well as average daily shipment. Also, the segment’s operating income surged 35% to $175 million. Plus, the operating margin expanded 130 bps to 9.4%.Top & Bottom-Line Performance in Fiscal 2018In fiscal 2018, the company reported earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $15.31 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.13. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year figure, courtesy of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Notably, the company received a benefit of $1.6 billion from the new tax law. Revenues rose 8.6% to $65.5 billion, outpacing the consensus mark of $65.4 billion.During fiscal 2018, the company bought back 4.3 million shares for approximately $1 billion.Bullish Fiscal 2019 OutlookThe company anticipates earnings per share (excluding pension adjustments  and TNT Express integration expenses) of $17-$17.60 in fiscal 2019. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the same stands at $17.18. Additionally, the company projects approximately 9% increase in revenues while operating margin (excluding TNT Express integration expenses) is anticipated at around 8.5% (the recast fiscal 2018 operating margin is 7.8% excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items). Further, the company expects effective tax rate of around 25% while capital expenses are estimated to be $5.6 billion, lower than $5.7 billion incurred in fiscal 2018.FedEx’s fiscal 2019 results are likely to benefit from higher revenues as well as synergies drawn from the progress in TNT Express and FedEx Express integration. The company continues to focus on improving operating income by $1.2 to $1.5 billion at the FedEx Express segment in fiscal 2020 compared with that in fiscal 2017.However, the mounting fears pertaining to a trade war are concerning and may hamper the free flow of goods between countries.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksFedEx holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

191,EXPD,"Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic results for May. Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 1.84 billion, up 16.1% from the year-ago figure.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 13.4% to 2.19 billion. As the escalation in traffic outpaced capacity growth, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) expanded 200 basis points (bps) to 84.4% in the month.For the first five months of 2018, Copa Holdings generated RPMs of 8.78 billion (up 11.8% year over year) and ASMs of 10.57 billion (up 10.1%).

Quote Notably, the company has been increasingly benefitting from solid demand for air travel, backed by an improved Latin American economy. The encouraging traffic report can also be attributed to this reason.A positive scenario is all the more evident from the company’s robust first-quarter results reported last month. Total revenues rose 15.9% year over year, mainly owing to a 16.3% improvement in passenger revenues. The company's performance with respect to unit revenues is laudable as well.

193,EXPD,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) declined 6.2% to $241.77 post the earnings release on Jun 19, despite reporting better-than-expected revenues and earnings per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Reasons Behind the Stock’s PlungeThe escalating fears of a trade war hampering the free flow of goods between countries are the main reasons behind the stock’s dismal performance.  In fact, on the fourth quarter conference call, FedEx’s CEO Fredrick Smith expressed his concerns on the same.The fact that FedEx has a significant presence in China has given rise to worries over substantial revenue loss due to the weakening of trade following the tariffs. We note that FedEx opened a hub in Shanghai in January 2018 to strengthen its foothold in China.Last week, the White House announced plans to impose 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of imports. President Donald Trump is expected to start taxing products worth $34 billion as early as Jul 6 while he will levy tariff on the additional goods of $16 billion later. Beijing said it will counter the move, imposing tariffs on U.S. soybeans and other farm products.However, Trump will attack the Chinese retaliation by imposing tariff on yet another $200-billion worth of Chinese goods. Also, it will levy tax on further $200 billion of Chinese products in case China still refuses to withdraw.These mounting trade tensions certainly do not bode well for FedEx and might further impact the stock.FedEx Corporation Price  FedEx Corporation Price | FedEx Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksFedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

194,EXPD,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) received encouraging news on the labor front when the company inked a tentative deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — a labor union in the United States and Canada. Notably, this provisional agreement with the teamsters union pertains to the wages and other benefits of multiple employees (mostly package handlers and drivers) in Louisville.Replacing the current four-year wage progression scheme for part time workers, the new agreement calls for increases in their starting pay rate for each year of the tenure of the contract ($13.00 per hour on Aug1, 2018 to $15.50 on Aug1, 2022). In fact, all part-time employees joining UPS after Aug 1 will get the new starting rates. The deal also aims at providing increased pension benefits to its part-time as well as full-time employees.Moreover, the agreement calls for a new provision of full-time combination drivers in a bid to address concerns like excessive forced overtime and deliveries on weekends. Their pay would start at $20.50, with a maximum of $34.79 on Aug. 1, 2022. The provision also increases full-time opportunities for part-time workers.However, there is a long way to go before the deal becomes effective. We note that tentative agreements do not necessarily mean that the deal will be operational. The provisional deal inked by UPS will be reviewed and subsequently voted upon by union members, probably next month. The deal will be effective only if the voting result is favorable. In that case, it will be effective till Jul 31, 2023.With so much to look forward to on the labor front, investors will keenly await further updates on this burning issue.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

195,EXPD,"On Jun 20, we initiated coverage on Trinity Industries, Inc. (TRN  -  Free Report).The company has been benefitting from impressive growth of North America’s rail traffic volume. In fact, the North American rail traffic volume was strong during the first quarter of 2018 despite bad weather conditions and service related challenges affecting the rail system’s fluidity.Notably, more than 25,000 railcars, which were idle previously, became operational during the period. The resumption of service boosted the North American railcar active fleet. Moreover, demand for rail cars is likely to rise on the back of industrial production gathering steam and consistent business investments.Growth of the company’s rail lease fleet is encouraging as well. Trinity’s owned and managed fleet increased 13% year over year to approximately 119,000 railcars at the end of the first quarter of 2018.Trinity Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus  Trinity Industries, Inc. Price and Consensus | Trinity Industries, Inc. Quote The company’s shareholder-friendly measures are also impressive. Last December, the company’s board authorized a $500-million worth new share repurchase program. During the first quarter, the company repurchased 1.52 million shares for $50 million. It still has $450 million shares left under its current authorization to be bought back through December 2019. Moreover, the company has paid dividends for 217 consecutive quarters. Last May, the company hiked its payout by 18%.The new tax law is also a big boon to the company. Trinity’s earnings in the first quarter got a boost from reduced effective tax rate of 26.2% compared with 28.7% during the first quarter of 2017. The same is anticipated to buoy the company’s full-year earnings, courtesy of its projection of 24% full-year effective tax rate compared with 36.2%, last year.However, the company’s top line in the second quarter might be hurt by lower railcar lease rates. Even though lease rates are believed to be increasing from the recent drop, it still remains below the expiring leases.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksTrinity holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector include GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

196,EXPD,"On Jun 20, we initiated coverage on SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), which operates as a regional airline in the United States through its subsidiaries — SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Airlines. Apart from the two scheduled passenger airline operations, SkyWest is the holding company of an aircraft leasing entity.Upbeat Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, SkyWest has performed exceedingly well, handily outperforming its industry. While shares of the company have surged 57.3%, the industry shed 10.9% of its value. Reasons Behind the Impressive Price PerformanceWe are impressed by SkyWest’s efforts to modernize its fleet and streamline operations. The company aims to reduce the 50-seat jets in its fleet and add new E175 aircraft. In line with its fleet transition efforts, SkyWest has witnessed a 4.5% year-over-year decline in block hours (a measure of aircraft utilization) in the first five months of 2018. Also, the carrier has added 19 new E175 planes to its fleet and removed 71 unproductive/less-profitable aircraft from its fleet since the first quarter of 2017.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and buybacks are also commendable. To this end, SkyWest increased its quarterly dividend payment by 25% to 10 cents per share (40 cents annualized) in February 2018. In terms of buybacks, the carrier repurchased shares worth $10 million (under the $100 million buyback program authorized in 2017) in the first quarter of 2018.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts this year.In fact, we believe the new tax law is an added positive for US-based transportation companies like SkyWest. In the first quarter of 2018, effective tax rate reduced to 19% from 34% a year ago. Even though tax rate is expected to be a bit higher in the remaining quarters of 2018, the projected effective tax rate in the 24-25% range is still much lower than the 2017 actual figure. The significant cut in corporate tax rate is anticipated to boost cash flow, which in turn, might aid their bottom-line growth.With the U.S. economy improving and consumer confidence remaining strong, more Americans are taking vacations. Also, a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have added an incentive for consumers to opt for air travel. This bodes well for US-based carriers like SkyWest. Given this buoyant scenario, the ongoing summer season should see SkyWest garnering significant passenger revenues, which is a boon for the carrier.Estimate Revisions & Style ScoreUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospects. SkyWest scores impressively on this front as well. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings moved north 5.2%, reflecting positive sentiment surrounding the stock.Additionally, the stock has an attractive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The carrier’s bullish Zacks Rank also supports our view.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

197,EXPD,"Shares of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ  -  Free Report) have lost 17.4% so far this year against its industry's 5.7% upside. Reasons Behind the Lackluster Price PerformanceIn May, Hertz Global reported wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter of 2018. Quarterly loss also widened on a year-over-year basis due to high costs. Results were hurt by the slow progress of Hertz Global Holdings’ growth-oriented turnaround plan. Moreover, pricing pressure remains a major headwind due to low used car prices.As the company is investing heavily in its turnaround plan, the bottom-line performance seems to be affected significantly. In the first quarter of 2018, total expenses were 111% of sales compared with 107% in 2017. Hertz Global expects U.S. RAC direct vehicle and operating (DOE) and SG&A expenses (as a % of revenues) to be higher in 2018 compared with the 2017 levels. Due to this elevated level of investment spending, earnings are expected to remain under pressure in the remainder of 2018.Additionally, the company’s significant debt burden coupled with dwindling cash flows is a cause for concern. The presence of private players like Uber and Lyft is a major threat as far as the need for car rental is concerned. Structural issues with the car rental model are also worrisome. Furthermore, intense competition from players like Uber in addition to other car-sharing and ride-hailing services are hurting the company’s top-line growth prospects.Other Unfavorable ReadingsOver the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year loss has widened significantly, reflecting negative sentiment surrounding the stock.Additionally, the company’s Momentum Score of F highlights its short-term unattractiveness. Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate Hertz Global’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report).  While GATX and SkyWest carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

198,EXPD,"Shares of Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.  (EXPD  -  Free Report) have rallied 18.6% so far this year, handily outperforming the industry’s 7.6% rise.YTD Price Performance  Reasons Behind the RallyExpeditors is benefiting from solid yield growth as freight markets remain promising. In fact, the improving freight demand scenario bodes well for the company. Impressive volume growth in the ocean and airfreight divisions is encouraging as well. Expeditors' debt-free balance sheet also raises optimism.Lower tax rates, following introduction of the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), are boosting bottom-line growth and should continue to do so moving ahead. Moreover, the company’s initiatives to reward are commendable. To this end, in May 2018, Expeditors raised its semi-annual cash dividend by 7.1% to 45 cents per share (annualized 90 cents per share).In the wake of the new tax law, we expect a further uptick in such investor-friendly activities. Huge savings from the slashed tax rate has boosted Expeditors’ cash flow. The company’s ability to generate more free cash flow is favorable as far as further dividend hikes are concerned.We note that the the new tax law is a blessing for all transportation companies . Apart from Expeditors, transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) and Triton International Limited (TRTN  -  Free Report) also hiked their respective dividend payouts this year.Estimate RevisionsUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospect. Expeditors scores impressively on this front too. Over the last 60 days, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and year earnings being revised 13.3% and 8.7% upward, respectively.

202,EXPD,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10.7% over the past month. ODFL hit a new 52-week high of $161.04 in the previous session. Old Dominion Freight Line has gained 22.1% since the start of the year compared to the 1.1% move for the Transportation sector and the 9.4% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 26, 2018, Old Dominion Freight Line reported EPS of $1.33 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.3 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.15%.For the current fiscal year, Old Dominion Freight Line is expected to post earnings of $6.42 per share on $3.94 billion in revenues. This represents a 47.25% change in EPS on a 17.31% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.23 per share on $4.28 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12.69% and 8.63%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile ODFL has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Old Dominion Freight Line has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 25X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.4X versus its peer group's average of 10.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.07. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. Price and Consensus  Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. Price and Consensus | Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Old Dominion Freight Line currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Old Dominion Freight Line fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though ODFL shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Old Dominion Freight Line Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Old Dominion Freight Line have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Saia (SAIA  -  Free Report), Herc Holdings (HRI  -  Free Report), and Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ODFL, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

203,EXPD,"Spirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. Also, the company has an impressive earnings history of surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 4.4%.However, due to recent disruptions caused by the natural calamities, shares of the company have lost 29.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 0.5% decline over the same period.  Let’s see how things shape up for this earnings.Factors at PlayHurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria have greatly impacted Spirit. The storms forced the airline to cancel more than 1,650 flights in the third quarter. The company anticipates natural calamities and the pilot dispute to affect revenues in third quarter to the tune of $40 million and operating margin to the tune of approximately 450 basis points.The company estimates third-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon to be $1.75, much higher than the $1.66 reported in the previous quarter.The company anticipates roughly 6.5% year-over-year decline in TRASM (total revenue per available seat mile) in its third quarter. The carrier expects total available seat miles in third quarter to rise 18% year over year.The carrier expects adjusted cost per available seat miles in the third quarter between flat to down 1% due to fewer available seat miles and costs incurred in the process of recovery from the natural calamities.However, the carrier’s expansion and fleet modernization initiatives raise optimism. The company’s efforts to reward stockholders through share buybacks are also impressive. Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Spirit Airlines has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents per share.

Also, the company has an impressive earnings history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.7%.Let’s see what awaits the company in the third quarter.Factors at PlayThe company expects the Hurricane Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.Additionally, the company expects its automotive unit to suffer in the third quarter. Sluggish auto production is likely to hamper results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for automotive revenues stands at $490 million, lower than $513 million reported in the previous quarter.Units like agricultural products and chemicals are also expected to register below-par volumes in the quarter to be reported.  For agricultural products, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $917 million. While for chemicals, the metric stands at $892 million, slightly lower than the $898 million reported in second-quarter 2017.Shares of the company have underperformed its industry in a month due to the aforementioned headwinds. The stock has lost 2.4% of its value versus the industry’s 0.3% gain during the period.However, the improved coal scenario is likely to aid the company’s third-quarter results. The industrial products unit is expected to perform well in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for industrial products revenues stands at $988 million.In addition, the company’s cost-cutting efforts to increase efficiencies are impressive. In a bid to raise efficiency for utilization of its resources in a better manner, Union Pacific announced that it intends to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

205,EXPD,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings numbers on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%. The company’s earnings of $2.94 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Also, earnings declined 20.11% from the year-ago figure due to higher costs. Quarterly revenues, however, increased 16.2% year over year to $400.6 million, edging past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $399.8 million. Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company’s third-quarter results are likely to be hampered by elevated costs. Similar to the previous quarter, high labor costs are expected to limit bottom-line growth in the third quarter as well. Cost per available seat mile excluding fuel (CASM-ex fuel) is expected to grow between 16.7% and 17.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 7.01 cents. High fuel costs are another cause for the company’s concern.Also, decline in load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is worrisome. The metric fell in three consecutive months namely, July, August and September due to capacity overexpansion. The fact that Allegiant is a highly leveraged company, further adds to its woes.Driven by headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the last three months. The stock has declined 3.1% against the industry’s 0.9% gain during the period.The company expects total revenues per scheduled ASM (TRASM) for the third quarter in the range of 0.3-0.7% (previous guidance: -0.5-1.5%). Also, Fixed fee revenues and other revenues are predicted to be in the band of $22-$22.5 million (earlier view: $17-$19 million range).The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments are impressive.

206,EXPD,"Trinity Industries Inc. (TRN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after market closes.In the preceding quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.5%.  Also, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayWe expect Trinity Industries to continue struggling on the top-line front in the to-be-reported quarter, just like the previous one. Markedly, sluggish market conditions as well as weak demand for railcars are expected to weigh on the results. High costs and adverse foreign currency movement may add to the woe.In fact, the Rail Group segment which recorded disastrous results in the second quarter, is expected to continue its poor run in the third quarter as well. Additionally, the Inland Barge Group might come up with a below-par performance mainly due to lower barge deliveries and changes in product mix.Also, the Energy Equipment Group might perform poorly in the quarter under review owing to lower delivery volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter segmental operating profit is $22.6 million, lower than the $24.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders are encouraging. Of late, the stock has been boosted by the favorable ruling by a federal appeals court as well. Evidently, the court overturned a $663.4-million judgment against Trinity Industries, which had been accused of misleading the government by selling defective guardrails. We expect a detailed commentary on the issue on the conference call.Nevertheless, our quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this time. This is because Trinity Industries doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP:  Trinity Industries has an Earnings ESP of -0.62%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Trinity Industries’ Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) while going into an earnings announcement.Trinity Industries, Inc.

207,EXPD,"The third-quarter earnings season is in its tail end with majority of the companies having already unveiled their quarterly financial numbers. The picture that has emanated so far is a healthy one and this earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note, displaying substantial growth.The already reassuring picture is expected to get rosier by the end of this week. During the course, 826 companies including the 49 S&P 500 players are expected to report their financial figures. Consequently, we will have reports from the 455 S&P 500 players as 406 companies in the highly-sought after space had already posted results as of Nov 3.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the top and bottom lines for the 406 S&P 500 companies expanded 6.3% and 7.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, approximately 66.7% and 73.9% of the S&P 500 members have outperformed on the revenues and earnings front. This progress in the quarterly performance can be attributed to a turnaround in the economy and improved job market scenario, among other factors.In fact, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are projected to end the third quarter with their top and bottom lines expanding 5.6% and 6.5%, respectively. Also, nine of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis.Turbulent Q3 for TransportsThe widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14%, due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes.Evidently, the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) in the third quarter has contracted a respective 7.6% and 28.6%, on a year-over-year basis. Thus, substantiating the fact that the transportation sector has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico). For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines leading to rapid increase in freight costs. Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs has hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of the quarter.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await third-quarter reports from sector participants like Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD  -  Free Report) and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW  -  Free Report) that are scheduled for Nov 7.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Expeditors International of Washington provides logistic services globally. The company is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight.Higher operating expenses are likely to hit this transportation company’s bottom line in the quarter. In fact, increased volumes might lead to higher operating expenses at all the three primary divisions — Airfreight services, Ocean freight and ocean services, and Customs brokerage and other services — of the company. Personnel expenses are also expected to be high, owing to higher headcount.However, the top line is anticipated to improve in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Despite the prevalent imbalance between demand and supply in the Airfreight market, volume growth is likely to drive revenues at this flagship division. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Airfreight services segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $692 million, higher than the $672 million reported in the previous quarter.Total revenues from the Ocean freight and ocean services unit are also expected to increase, backed by volume growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $547 million, higher than the $529 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Customs brokerage and other services segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $476 million, higher than the $472 million reported in the last quarter.Yet, the chances of this transportation company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are less, even though it carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Fuel cost is projected to be $1.76 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting an approximate 12% jump over the year-ago figure.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus estimate for third-quarter has been revised downward 15.6% over the last 90 days.Also in May, the pilots of Alaska Air Group’s subsidiary, Horizon Air, had approved an amendment to the existing eight-year pay-related contract. This, in turn has spiked the labor costs, shooting up pilots’ compensation following the amendment. This is likely to put further pressure on the company’s bottom line in the third quarter.Even though the Virgin America deal — the company acquired Virgin America in December 2016 — looks positive, we note that this transaction like any other merger, has integration risks attached to it. Similar to the previous quarter, merger-related costs are predicted to hurt Alaska Air’s bottom line in the third quarter as well.Due to the above-mentioned headwinds, shares of the company have lost 10.7% of its value in the last three months against the industry’s 0.3% gain, over the same period.  However, the company’s expansion initiatives are impressive. In August, the company announced a customer-friendly deal with Singapore Airlines. Accordingly, the two will form a codeshare agreement to allow sharing of flights, i.e., a passenger can avail any flight operated by either company covered under the contract, irrespective of the flight number. Also, from Sep 27 onward, members of Alaska Mileage Plan and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer loyalty programs have begun earning miles on the flight.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

210,EXPD,"JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.3%. It also has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.3%.However, things do not seem very favorable for the company this quarter.Shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has lost around 13% compared with the industry’s 1.7% decline.  Let’s divulge into the factors rendering such a dismal outlook.Factors at PlayJetBlue’s operations were disrupted by the devastating effects of consecutive natural calamities. The carrier expects its top line to be hurt to the tune of $44 million in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, operating income is likely to be adversely impacted in the range of $30-$35 million. The bottom line too in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is expected to be hurt between 6 cents and 7 cents.Notably, capacity is projected to expand approximately 3.7% in the third quarter. Due to weather-related setbacks, average seat miles (ASMs) have been trimmed to the tune of approximately 2.7 percentage points.The destructive hurricanes have increased projection for unit costs, excluding fuel, to the tune of roughly 2.75 percentage points. The metric is expected to grow between 2.75% and 3.25% for the quarter. Fuel cost per gallon is projected to be $1.71.However, revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) is estimated to inch up almost 0.9% in the quarter under review (the metric has been positively impacted to the tune of approximately 0.3 percentage points, thanks to the hurricanes).Additionally, the carrier’s cost-control efforts are impressive. The company is looking to reduce its debt levels. Its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio currently stands at 26.4. This compares favorably with its industry’s figure, which exceeds 100, as well as the S&P 500 index’s reading of 84.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that JetBlue is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

211,EXPD,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20, before the market opens.The company beat on earnings and revenues in the last quarter with earnings of $1.33 per share exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. The bottom line expanded 9% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $656.4 million improved 15.5% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $620.6 million. However, back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) havedisrupted railroad operations. Shares of Kansas City Southern have slipped 0.1% over the last three months in contrast to the industry’s 0.8% increase during the period.Let’s see, how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayRise in fuel costs due to natural calamities is likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter.Discouraging performance of the intermodal segment might also hamper results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter intermodal revenues is pegged at $94 million.Kansas City Southern’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Not only has the company’s 11.4% ROE been gradually decreased over the last year, it compares unfavorably with its industry’s ROE of 20.7.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the soon-to-be-reported quarter’s earnings being revised 2.9% downward over the last 30 days, evidently reflecting a negative sentiment surrounding the stock.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks are impressive. To this end, in August, Kansas City Southern’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program worth $800 million.  Improvement pertaining to carloads are expected to buoy the top line.

212,EXPD,"Hawaiian Holdings Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 earnings numbers on Oct 19, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Also, it has an impressive earnings history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average of 7%.However, hurt by the recent hurricanes, airline stocks are lying low. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings have lost 19.4% of its value over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 2.4% decline.  Let’s see how things shape up for this earnings.Factors at PlayUnit costs, excluding fuel, are projected to rise significantly in the third quarter primarily due to higher labor costs. This is likely to hurt the company’s bottom line. Also, rising fuel costs have caused the carrier to recently project third-quarter economic fuel cost per gallon between $1.65 and $1.75 (previous guidance had estimated the metric between $1.55 and $1.65). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter operating cost per available seat mile (CASM Ex-fuel) stands at $8.86, while average fuel price per gallon is estimated at $1.62.There is also negativity surrounding the stock, evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the soon-to-be-reported quarter earnings being revised 3.1% downward over the last 60 days.However, the carrier’s performance with respect to unit revenues is encouraging. The metric is expected to register substantial year-over-year growth in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 12.85 cents, much higher than the 12.53 cents reported in the second quarter of 2017 .Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hawaiian Holdings is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

215,EXPD,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is faced with a new trouble related to the April 17 flight 1380 incident. Per media reports, a group of eight passengers aboard the Southwest flight in April has filed a lawsuit against the carrier in the Supreme Court of New York.The tragic incident in April forced the carrier to make an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure causing a fan blade to detach. Consequently, one of the passengers died while seven others were injured.Following the fatal event, Southwest has been put under rigorous scrutiny and the federal regulators are still investigating the events which induced the engine explosion.The lawsuit filed on Wednesday has accused the carrier of negligence in providing proper care to its passengers to the point of even risking their lives. The lawsuit claims that Southwest has not made sufficient efforts to repair damaged aircraft and/or replace the unsafe ones for a safer travel.The defendants in the case are Southwest and the Boeing 737 plane (involved in the fatal accident) manufacturer, The Boeing Company. Companies involved in manufacturing the engine are also defending the charge.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) inspector general said that it is opening a review of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) oversight of Southwest and is auditing the process. The FAA claims that its oversight system is effectively designed to allow earlier identification of potential risks so that the same does not result in serious issues and ensures that necessary actions are taken.The series of events following the tragic incident undoubtedly places Southwest in a tight spot and raises questions regarding its safety measures. This recent event will aggravate the carrier’s already low demand and worsen its ongoing troubles.

216,EXPD,"On Jun 13, 2018, we issued an updated research report on Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report). The stock has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months.Reasons Behind the DowngradeDelta has been grappling with troubles for quite some time now. The winter storm, Grayson, in January 2018 and the back-to-back hurricanes in 2017, wreaked havoc for the carrier, forcing it to cancel multiple flights. This hurt the carrier’s top line significantly. In fact, the company’s first-quarter 2018 results were also hampered due to these natural calamities. Notably, Delta’s bottom line also contracted 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. High fuel costs have also added to the downturn.The fuel cost burden is still a major headwind for the company as oil prices have been trending up lately with almost 10% increase so far this year. Rising fuel prices are anticipated to affect the company’s bottom-line growth in the second quarter of 2018. As a matter of fact, the carrier recently raised its second-quarter view on fuel costs per gallon. The metric is now projected between $2.20 and $2.25. Previously, the estimate was in the $2.07-$2.12 range.Apart from fuel prices, high labor costs are expected to hit the company’s bottom line in the current quarter. Notably, non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year, up from the prior forecast of a climb in the 1-3% range.Further, due to cost concerns, the company slashed its earnings per share guidance for the second quarter. The metric is now anticipated in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the former prediction between $1.80 and $2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings stands at $1.77. Moreover, pretax margin is now projected between 13% and 14% in the concerned quarter. Earlier outlook was in the band of 14-16%.Further adding to the company’s woes are its fears of capacity overexpansion. This is because load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) at the carrier contracted 40 basis points in May as capacity expansion of 3.5% exceeded traffic growth (of 2.9%. This key metric also declined 20 basis points in April. Moreover, load factor decreased 10 basis points on a year-to -date basis. This drop in load factor is worrisome and does not bode well for the stock.Shares of Delta have declined 3% in the last three months due to these downsides. Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc.

219,EXPD,"The month of June has commenced on a bullish note as the three major stock indices in Wall Street rose on Monday.Nasdaq composite closed at a record high since Mar 12, primarily due to a rally in technology stocks like Apple, Microsoft and Twitter.Apple hit an all-time high and is now very close to reaching the coveted trillionaire market cap milestone. The company unveiled its latest operation system iOS 12 at Worldwide Developers Conference on Jun 4.Moreover, Microsoft agreed to pay $7.5 billion for the “social coding” platform GitHub. The deal is expected to strengthen its cloud platform Azure’s competitive position against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).Investor optimism following impressive U.S. jobs data for May somehow negates growing trade war fears. This drove gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&P 500 indices. The Russell 2000 also closed at a fresh all-time high.Economic Expansion, Consumer Confidence to Drive GrowthThe stock market is anticipated to continue its bullish run driven by an improving macro-economic scenario despite escalating tensions related to trade war.Notably, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index for the United States increased in April, which supports continuing economic growth, particularly in the second half of 2018.Moreover, per the Conference Board data, the U.S. consumer confidence in the economy recovered in May following a decline in April. It also remained near its 18-year high level after it reached the mark in February.Further, continuing momentum at the Technology sector is a key catalyst. President Trump’s corporate tax cuts and repatriation policy have aided these companies to aggressively buyback shares and pursue strategic acquisitions.Making The Right ChoiceWe believe the recent stock market upsurge presents an ideal buying opportunity. To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further, we have opted one tried and tested technique — picking stocks near their 52-week highs.The 52-week investment strategy loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing. The basic idea is “buy high and sell higher”, since once a trend is established it is likely to continue.The surge can be driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales, robust cash flow and bullish earnings prospects.  Major developments may also send stocks soaring.However, stocks that are trading near their 52-week highs carry the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued.It is here that the Zacks Style Score System can come in handy. We use the Zacks Momentum Style Score to pick stocks that are currently at the 52-week or near that range. The style score indicates the best time to buy a stock and take advantage of its momentum with a highest probability of success.Back-tested results show that stocks with Momentum Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Our PicksHere, we pick five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1.

220,EXPD,"Shares of Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $109.04 during the trading session on Jun 1 before retracing a bit to close at $109.26. The stock has declined 18.5% so far this year, performing even worse than the industry’s 12.9% decrease.  Let’s delve into the factors causing this downtrend.Temporary Pause on Venezuela OperationsBack in April this year, the Venezuela government temporarily suspended Copa Holdings’ flights for 90 days.  The move came in after Panama tagged the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and 50 other Venezuelan nationals as “high-risk profiles” for crimes related to funding terrorism and money laundering.In the wake of this issue, Copa Holdings had to cancel approximately 360 flights pertaining to its Venezuela operations in the first quarter of 2018. Though the dispute has been resolved now with the governments of Venezuela and Panama reaching a consensus to reestablish their bilateral diplomatic and commercial ties with immediate effect, the lingering effects of the conflict however, are likely to persist for a while. In fact, the company apprehends a negative impact to the tune of $15 million in the second quarter due to this adversity. Further, it anticipates full-year operating margin in the low end of its previously guided range of 17-19%.Fuel CostsRising fuel costs are another major headwind for the company. Like the first quarter, the metric is expected to limit bottom-line growth in the second one as well. In the first quarter of 2018, average fuel price per gallon increased 17.6% year over year to $2.16. Fuel prices are anticipated to be even higher ($2.25 per gallon) in the current quarter.Threat From Low-Cost CarriersGrowth of low-cost carriers could intensify competition for Copa Holdings. Notably, this February, Volaris Costa Rica, a subsidiary of the Mexican carrier Volaris, announced new routes from El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala to Los Angeles, New York and Washington, respectively. Such expansion efforts from low-fare airlines in Copa Holdings’ region might pose a challenge to its growth.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCopa Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and SkyWest, Inc.

221,EXPD,"Azul S.A. (AZUL  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic numbers for May. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), increased 14% to 1.84 billion mainly owing to a 71.4% rise on the international front. Meanwhile, domestic traffic was up only 1.5%.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) expanded 13.5% to 2.29 billion, primarily owing to 71.5% growth in international capacity. On the domestic front, capacity increased 2.6%.Consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) at this Brazilian carrier was up 0.3 percentage points to 80.1% in May as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion. Domestically, load factor decreased to 77.1% from 78% a year ago. This downturn can be attributed to capacity growth outpacing the increase in traffic for the month. Weakness on the domestic front was due to the truck drivers’ strike in Brazil.  Consequently, many reservations were cancelled resulting in below-par traffic. Load factor was almost flat at 89.5% on the international front.AZUL SA Price  AZUL SA Price | AZUL SA QuoteWe note that the truckers of Brazil started a strike on May 21, protesting against high diesel prices. The situation began to ease on May 27, following an agreement between representatives of the trucking industry and the government.

223,EXPD,"Capacity-related woes have been hurting Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) for quite some time. In fact, it is one of the factors behind the 3.4% decline in the company’s stock price so far this year. The company’s May traffic report was no exception and showed substantial year-over-year rise in capacity.Detailed ReportTraffic for the total system that includes scheduled service and fixed fee contract — measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) — increased 10.9% on a year-over-year basis to 1.06 billion. System capacity, calculated in available seat miles (ASMs), expanded 10.7% to 1.23 billion in the same month.With traffic growth marginally outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) registered a mere 20 basis points year-over-year increase to 82%. This Las Vegas-based carrier transported 1.14 billion passengers in May, reflecting an improvement of 11.8% on a year-over-year basis.Although traffic increased on a year-over-year basis in May, the rise in the metric compared unfavorably to the comparable reading a month ago, when traffic was up 12%.  Capacity expansion was more in this month compared with 9% in April, giving rise to capacity-overexpansion related fears. The reading for May load factor too compared unfavorably to 83.2% in April.Other HeadwindsApart from capacity-related woes, the stock is still suffering from CBS News' report, 60 Minutes, alleging that it was facing a number of safety-related issues. The damaging television program was aired on Apr 15. The allegations are being investigated.Also, escalating fuel costs are hurting the company’s bottom-line performance. In the first quarter, fuel costs increased in excess of 20% year over year to $2.18 per gallon. The metric has risen further subsequently. While the reading was $2.28 per gallon in April, it increased even higher to $2.44 per gallon in May.With oil prices on an uptrend, it will not be surprising if Allegiant Travel revises its current-year fuel price guidance of $2.20 per barrel upward in the near future.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAllegiant Travel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Additionally, passenger count grew 5.3% to 14.43 billion.In the first five months of 2018, Southwest Airlines witnessed a 3% rise in RPMs to 53.35 billion. Also, ASMs inched up 2.5% to 64.78 billion. As a result, the load factor increased 50 bps to 82.4%. Moreover, passenger count climbed 4.8% to 65.76 billion on a year-to-date basis.Southwest Airlines Co. Price  Southwest Airlines Co. Price | Southwest Airlines Co. Quote With the entire airline industry embroiled in trouble pertaining to high fuel costs, the company recently trimmed its 2018 capacity view for the above reason. The company now projects capacity in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range. Additionally, the company now anticipates second-quarter 2018 available seat mile (ASM) or capacity to ascend approximately 3.5%. Earlier, the company had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric.Further adding to the woes, Southwest Airlines’ demand is still low due to the fatal Flight 1380 incident in April. Hence, the company now expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline around 3% year over year (earlier guidance saw a fall in the 1-3% range). The company cited soft bookings following insufficient marketing initiatives post the unfortunate incident as the reason behind the downside.The fuel cost headwind being a common problem plaguing all airlines, other carriers too seem to follow suit. Most recently, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) lifted its view for fuel costs. It now estimates the same between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon.

227,EXPD,"On May 30, we initiated coverage on Air Lease Corporation (AL  -  Free Report).The fortunes of Air Lease are directly related to the airline industry. Per International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast, the industry is set on a growth path with net profit projected to rise to $38.4 billion in 2018. Moreover, with the overall economy remaining buoyant, passenger traffic has been soaring. Notably, IATA reported 9.5% year-over-year increase in passenger traffic for March. All these upsides are likely to positively impact demand for the company’s aircraft.The new tax law has been a boon to the company ever since its implementation last December. The company’s bottom line in the first quarter improved significantly year over year on account of the reduced corporate tax rate. Effective tax rate in the period under review was 21.7% compared with 36.6% in the first quarter of 2017.Moreover, the company’s efforts to expand its fleet are encouraging. Notably, it ended 2017 with 244 owned aircraft and 50 managed aircraft in its portfolio.We are also impressed by the company’s endeavors to reward its shareholders. In fact, Air Lease has an impressive dividend payment history. Notably, in November 2017, its board raised the quarterly cash dividend by 33% from 7.5 cents per share to 10 cents.Owing to these tailwinds, shares of the company have rallied 15.8% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 13.6% increase.  However, the company has been fighting global supply chain and production constraints due to engine issues causing delays in timely delivery of aircraft. For example, the company suffered two Airbus deferrals in the first quarter of 2018, now expected to be delivered in the second quarter.With a spike in fuel prices, the company remains cautious as it might adversely impact its customer base. It is to be noted that fuel prices have been on an uptrend lately and are hovering around $68 a barrel. The same has escalated more than 10% so far this year. Rise in interest rates and labor prices also have a negative impact on the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAir Lease carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

228,EXPD,"It is a well-known fact that expenses associated with oil are considered to be one of the major input costs for any transportation company. Therefore, the recent upsurge in fuel costs does not augur well for stocks in the space.So far this year, oil prices have increased roughly 10% and are currently trading at around $66 a barrel. Various reasons like the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East contributed to the rise in oil price. In fact, this marks a phenomenal turnaround for the commodity, which was trading at around $30 a barrel in 2016. Transports Feeling the PinchWith fuel costs on the rise, it is natural that transportation stocks would be hit hard. This is because an upsurge in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of transports, thus limiting bottom-line growth.In fact, the first-quarter earnings season witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs. Notably, oil prices were up approximately 8% in the January-March period. This uptrend continued in the April-June period as well.Highlighting its struggles, the Zacks Transportation Sector is currently ranked 14th among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors.The unfavorable rank places the sector in the bottom 13% of the Zacks sectors.Turbulence Likely to Continue in Q2 The fact that high fuel costs will restrict bottom-line growth of transports in the second quarter can be made out from our latest Earnings Preview. Even though, the top and bottom line of S&P 500 companies in the Transportation sector are projected to grow year over year to the tune of 7.6% and 12.3%, respectively, the figures compare unfavorably to the readings in the first quarter. Revenues and earnings had displayed growth of 9% and 21.3% for transports in the January-March period.Key transportation players like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) expect second-quarter results to be affected by high fuel costs. Currently, Delta envisions second-quarter fuel costs per gallon between $2.20 and $2.25 compared with $2.07 and $2.12 projected earlier. This airline behemoth has also slashed its earnings per share guidance for the soon-to-be reported quarter due to the cost headwind. The bottom line is now anticipated in the range of $1.65-$1.75, lower than the prior estimate between $1.80 and $2.Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are expected to weigh on transportation stocks’ bottom-line performancein the second quarter.Sector Lags on the Price FrontThe turbulence in the space can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation Sector has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the sector has shed 1% of its value, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has increased 3.9%. YTD Price Performance                 Adding Shareholder Value — The Road AheadIn view of the turbulence plaguing transports, we believe that it would be prudent for investors interested in the space to invest in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature and can also generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Moreover, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which came into force late last year, is a boon for transports as far as shareholder-friendly activities like dividend payments are concerned. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate, under the new law, has boosted cash flow as well as earnings of transportation stocks.Due to the significant reduction in tax bills, more cash remains in the hands of these companies to fund capital expenditures, buybacks and dividends among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceGiven the backdrop, targeting dividend-paying transportation stocks and combining them with a favorable Zacks Rank is a judicious way to increase the chances of beating the market besides ensuring a steady stream of cash heading to your portfolio.In this regard, we have zeroed in on four transportation stocks, which have raised their dividend payouts this year. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Year to date, these stocks have also outperformed the sector on the price front.Key PicksFedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) offers customers a one-stop source for global shipping, logistics and supply chain solutions. This Zacks Rank #2 company has a market capitalization of $70.43 billion.In June 2018, FedEx’s board of directors cleared a 30% hike in its quarterly dividend to 65 cents a share (or $2.60 annually) from 50 cents (or $2 annually). The new dividend will be paid on Jul 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of Jun 25. The stock has gained 5.6% on a year-to-date basis.The raised dividend highlights FedEx’s commitment toward creating value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition and bright prospects going ahead.

230,EXPD,"Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.’s (HA  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, reported traffic figures for May. Traffic (measured in Revenue Passenger Miles or RPMs) increased 5.6% to around 1.45 billion.Available Seat Miles (ASMs) also climbed 6.5% to 1.68 billion in the month. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 85.9% as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion.In the first five months of the year, Hawaiian Airlines witnessed a 6.2% rise in RPMs to 6.86 billion. Also, ASMs rose 5.5% to 8.04 billion. As a result, load factor inched up 50 bps to 85.3%. Additionally, passenger count rose 6.3% to 4.86 billion.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price  Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price | Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. QuoteSimultaneously, the company revised guidance for some of its metrics pertaining to the second quarter of 2018. It has also updated its fuel costs view for the full year.Bearish Q2 OutlookFor the second quarter, the carrier anticipates operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the range of down 0.5% to up 1.5% (change on a year-over-year basis). Earlier guidance had called for a rise of 0-3% in the metric. This lowered outlook is due to softness in bookings on account of an increase in volcanic activity on the Big Island region.Non-fuel unit costs are now expected to increase between 5% and 7% (previous view was a rise in the 4-7% range). This downside has been driven by an unscheduled maintenance event of one of its A330-200 aircraft as well as a one-time expense related to the purchase of Boeing 787-9 aircraft.Not surprisingly, the company has also raised its outlook for gallons of jet fuel consumed and economic fuel cost per gallon in the quarter. With oil prices trending up lately, the carrier now estimates a rise of 6-7% in the gallons of jet fuel consumed (prior forecast had called for an increase of 5-7%). While economic fuel cost per gallon is projected between $2.05 and $2.10. Past forecast was in the $2-$2.10 band.Dismal 2018 Fuel Cost ViewThe company has raised its outlook for fuel costs per gallon in 2018. It now predicts the metric in the $2.05-$2.15 range, higher than the earlier projection of $1.97-$2.07. However, its anticipation for non-fuel unit costs in the current year remains unaltered. It continues to expect the metric to be up 0.5-3.5% in 2018.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

231,EXPD,"In a shareholder-friendly move, FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) announced a hike in its dividend payout. This, in turn, reflects the company’s intention to utilize free cash for enhancing shareholders’ returns.Notably, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 30% to 65 cents a share (or $2.60 annually) from 50 cents (or $2 annually). The new dividend, which has been approved by the company’s board of directors, will be paid on Jul 9, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Jun 25. The dividend yield based on the new payout and the Jul 11 closing market price is approximately 0.99%.Apart from highlighting FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders, this hiked dividend underscores its strong financial condition and bright prospects. Also, a look at the past records reveals this Memphis, TN-based company’s stable dividend payment history.We remind investors that FedEx’s rival, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report), had also raised its quarterly dividend by approximately 10% in February 2018. Following the hike, the company's quarterly dividend payout stands at 91 cents per share ($3.64 on an annualized basis).As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Shareholder-Friendly Announcement Precedes Q4 ReleaseThe timing of the dividend hike announcement at FedEx is very appropriate and comes as the company is gearing up to unveil its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 19.We expect the company to deliver solid results in the fiscal fourth quarter driven by e-commerce growth. Also, FedEx’s Ground unit is expected to perform well backed by volume expansion and higher base rates. While releasing its fiscal third-quarter results in March, the company stated that it expects adjusted operating margin (minus TNT Express integration expenses) between 17% and 17.5% at its Ground unit.Our quantitative model too shows that FedEx is likely to beat earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise..Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.71 per share by 2 cents.

232,EXPD,"Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7.Last quarter, the company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of 60 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line declined 4.76% on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs.Revenues of $1,672 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,633 million. In fact, the top line improved 13% from the year-ago figure.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayHigher operating expenses are likely to hit the company’s bottom line in the third quarter. In fact, increased volumes might lead to higher operating expenses at all three of primary divisions — Airfreight services, Ocean freight and ocean services and Customs brokerage and other services — of the company.Personnel expenses are also likely to be high owing to higher headcount. As the company derives a significant chunk of its revenues from outside the United States, it is exposed to foreign exchange related risks. Consequently, adverse foreign currency movements are liable to hurt results as well.However, the top line is anticipated to improve in the quarter. Despite the prevalent imbalance between demand and supply in the Airfreight market, volume growth is likely to drive revenues at this flagship division. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Airfreight services segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $692 million, higher than the $672 million reported in the previous quarter.Total revenues from the Ocean freight and ocean services unit is also expected to increase due to volume growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $547 million, higher than the $529 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Customs brokerage and other services segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $476 million, higher than the $472 million reported in the last quarter.Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. QuoteWhat Does Our Model SayOur proven model does not show that Expeditors will beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Expeditors carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Expeditors has an Earnings ESP of -0.28%, which acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive.Conversely, we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider the following companies, as they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Triton International (TRTN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.04%. The Zacks #3 Ranked company is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings numbers on Nov 8.LATAM Airlines (LTM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +15.94% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company will report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 15.Diana Shipping (DSX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.22% and a Zacks Rank #3.

233,EXPD,"Shares of FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) have surged 31.9% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 21.1% increase. Reasons Behind the Price RiseStrong growth of e-commerce is a huge positive for FedEx. To this end, the company acquired P2P for £92 million in March, thereby strengthening its e-commerce portfolio.The company’s impressive performance during the holiday season is another uptick. This was attributable to expanded package volumes. Notably, the company hired more than 50,000 seasonal workers to meet the swelling demand.The new tax law, which reduces the corporate tax rate significantly, has been aiding FedEx for a while now. Moreover, the lowered tax rate was the primary reason for the company’s lifted projection for fiscal 2018 earnings. The company anticipates earnings per share (excluding TNT Express integration expenses and certain other items) in the range of $15-$15.40, higher than the previous forecast of $12.70-$13.30 in the period. Other factors responsible for this upside were foreign tax benefits from international corporate structure and a better operating performance.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are also encouraging. In June 2017, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 25% to 50 cents a share (or $2 annually) from 40 cents (or $1.60 annually). We believe that this dividend hike not only highlights FedEx’s commitment to create value for shareholders but also stresses the company’s strong financial position and confidence in its business prospects.In the wake of the new tax law, we expect a drive in such investor-friendly activities. Huge savings from the slashed tax rate will also likely boost cash flow. Thus, the company will have more cash in hand to fund these moves.The company’s decreased capital expenditure for fiscal 2018 will further contribute to the positive scenario. This is because lesser capital expenses lead to more free cash flow (difference between operating cash flow and capital expenses). Notably, capital expenses are projected at $5.8 billion in fiscal 2018, down $100 million from the earlier guidance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFedEx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report). While Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SkyWest and GATX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

236,EXPD,"C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after the market closes.In the second quarter of 2017, this transportation company’s earnings per share of 78 cents fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. Also, the bottom line decreased 22% year over year due to higher costs and lacklustre performance of the truckload division.Total revenue improved 12.4% year over year to $3,710 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,590 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderWe expect C.H. Robinson’s third-quarter results to be hurt by increased costs. Moreover, the company is looking to drive growth through acquisitions. Though positive on the strategy, we note that costs associated with the acquisitions weigh on the bottom line.In the soon-to-be reported quarter, C.H. Robinson acquired Milgram & Company, in a bid to expand its global network. Costs associated with the integration process are likely to hurt the bottom line.The transportation unit (comprising truckload, intermodal, less-than-truckload, ocean, air, customs and other logistics services) of the company is likely to disappoint primarily due to weaknesses in the truckload and intermodal sub-groups.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from the truckload sub-group is pegged at $286 million, much lower than the $309 million reported in the third quarter of 2016. The same from the intermodal sub-group is pegged at $7.5 million, lower than the $7.8 million reported a year ago. The presence of alternative lower cost trucks is likely to hurt intermodal opportunities.The sourcing unit is, however, expected perform impressively in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from this division is pegged at $31.31 million, higher than the $29.82 million reported a year ago. We are impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buy backs. An update on the issue is expected on the third-quarter conference call.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not show that C.H. Robinson will beat earnings in third-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

238,EXPD,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report), the parent company of Allegiant Air, has taken a significant step toward fulfilling its objective of transitioning to an all-Airbus fleet by year-end. To this end, the low-cost carrier recently took delivery of its first US-produced Airbus A320 plane. The aircraft was delivered from the Airbus' U.S. production facility located in Mobile, AL.We note that Allegiant is scheduled to purchase 13 new A320 aircraft directly from Airbus. This newest addition to Allegiant’s fleet marks the 11th such aircraft to be added to Allegiant's fleet this year. Currently, the company has 99 Airbus aircraft (in service or committed for future delivery).Allegiant’s efforts to transition into a single-fleet type are commendable. This is because the company aims to increase efficiencies and improve the flying experience of passengers. The new planes are equipped with all-modern facilities, have additional seating capacity and are fuel-efficient. In line with its fleet-modernization efforts, this Las Vegas-based carrier is not only adding new and more efficient planes but retiring old ones.Allegiant also hit the headlines when it reached a tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), which represents its flight dispatchers. The tentative agreement follows extensive negotiations, which commenced in 2017.Notably, this provisional agreement with IBT pertains to the wages and other benefits of 34 flight dispatchers of the carrier, who fall under the umbrella of the union. However, the tentative deal will have to be ratified (via votes) by the dispatchers before the first collective bargaining agreement between the partiesbecomes operational. Results of the voting procedure should be available by Jul 31, 2018. After becoming operational, the deal will run for five years.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAllegiant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

239,EXPD,"Shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) have gained 32.1% in a year’s time, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry’s rally of 23.1%.Reasons Behind the Impressive Price PerformanceThis railroad operator has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate.We note that a history of positive earnings surprise generally works as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass the estimates. So, investors take it in their consideration while betting on the stock, with an expectation that the company will do the same trick to outpace the estimates in the upcoming release.The most recent earnings beat came last month when this Norfolk, VA- based company reported first-quarter 2018 results. The earnings outperformance apart, it also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues. Both the metrics also improved on a year-over- year basis. Furthermore, its intermodal unit performed very well in the quarter. Intermodal revenues and volumes increased 19% and 7%, respectively.Also,Norfolk Southern’s cost-control efforts are impressive. To this end, the company’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) improved 70 basis points in the first quarter. The company aims to achieve an operating ratio below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.In fact, the lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available with the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.Earlier in 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an 18% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) driven by the new tax law. Norfolk Southern shelled out $205 million as dividends in the first quarter of 2018. Of late, the company also raised its current-year buyback target to $1.5 billion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We believe the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like Norfolk Southern. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also hiked dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

240,EXPD,"Shares of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $129.74 on May 21, before retracing a bit to close the session at $128.10. Notably, the company has performed impressively in a year’s time. While the stock has surged 52%, the industry rallied 43.1%.Lets delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the impressive price performance.J.B. Hunt is gaining momentum backed by impressive performance of its primary division — Intermodal. Notably, this segment contributed 55% to the company’s first-quarter 2018 revenues of $1,948.2 million. Also, segmental revenues increased 14% in the quarter.Load volumes in Intermodal segment were up 6%. Revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenues, rose 4% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income improved 20% year over year backed by volume growth and customer rate increases among other factors. For 2018, revenues from the segment are projected to increase between 7.5% and 11%.Apart from Intermodal, J.B. Hunt’s other key divisions — Dedicated Contract Services and Integrated Capacity Solutions — are also performing well. In fact, we expect these segments to continue the trend in the coming quarters as well. Based on this optimism, J.B. Hunt anticipates its top line to increase between 11% and 15% in 2018.Moreover, the new tax law is a boon for transportation companies like J.B. Hunt. Effective tax rate at J.B. Hunt is projected to come down to approximately 26% in 2018 from 37.9% in 2017. The significant cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn, will lead to bottom-line growth.We are impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In January 2018, J.B. Hunt raised its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share, mirroring an increase of 4.3% over the previous payout. In terms of buybacks, the company had roughly $521 million remaining under its total share buyback authorizations as of Mar 31, 2018. Also, J.B. Hunt's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 25.9% compares favorably with ROE of 16.3% for its industry and 16% for the S&P 500 index. This implies that the company is efficiently using shareholder funds.We expect an uptick in such investor-friendly activities, courtesy of the new tax law. As a result of the huge savings generated from the reduced corporate tax rate more cash are likely to be left in hand for the company to fund such activities.Zacks Rank & Key PicksJ.B. Huntcarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

241,EXPD,"Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the third quarter of 2017, reporting better-than-expected earnings per share and lower-than-expected revenues.Markedly, this travel company’s third-quarter earnings per share came in at $1.39 per share, 2 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line, however, contracted 49.5% on a year-over-year basis, due to high costs. Hurricane Irma also hurt results as the company had to cancel multiple flights due to the calamity.Quarterly revenues increased 4.6% year over year to $348.8 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $350.1 million. Evidently, network growth led to a year-over-year increase in revenues. During September, Allegiant paid $11 million to shareholders through dividends. Currently, the company has a share repurchase authorization of up to $100 million.Air traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) in the reported quarter rose 1% for the total system and capacity (measured in available seat miles), which expanded 3.2% year over year. Nonetheless, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was 83%, down 170 basis points, as capacity expansion outweighed travel growth.Cost per available seat miles (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 16.7% in the reported quarter driven by the new pilot agreement, transition costs among other factors. Total scheduled service revenue per available seat miles (TRASM) improved 0.7% to 10.61 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10.65 cents.Allegiant Travel Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Allegiant Travel Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Allegiant Travel Company Quote GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of 2017, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company expects CASM (excluding fuel) to increase between 7% and 9%. In fact, Allegiant anticipates an increase in CASM to be primarily driven by the implementation of the new pilot agreement among other factors. The metric is still expected to rise in the band of 11% to 12% for full-year 2017.TRASM for the fourth quarter is anticipated to decline between 0.5% and 3%. Hurricane Irma and the Las Vegas mass shooting are expected to hurt the metric. With the company having significant exposure to Florida and Las Vegas, it is natural that bookings for the fourth quarter have been hurt.Furthermore, Irma and the Las Vegas mass shooting are expected to hurt fourth-quarter TRASM between 3 and 3.5 percentage points.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Upcoming ReleasesInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector are keenly waiting for third-quarter earnings reports from key players like GOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report), Copa Holdings, S.A.

Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) also expanded 7.6% to 5.06 billion on a year-over-year basis.Load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers improved 110 basis points (bps) to 85.8% in the month as traffic growth outpaced capacity expansion.The Long Island City, NY-based low-cost carrier registered a completion factor (system wide) of 98.8% in the month with 71% flights on schedule.JetBlue Airways Corporation Price  JetBlue Airways Corporation Price | JetBlue Airways Corporation QuoteIn the first five months of 2018, the carrier posted a 5.4% rise in RPMs while ASMs grew 4.6%, both on a year-over-year basis.

243,EXPD,"Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $194.74 during the trading session on Jun 11, before retracing a bit to close at $193.79. Notably, the stock has performed impressively in a year with a 23.8% gain, outperforming the industry’s rally of 20.4%. Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeMost recently, the company reached a tentative four-year agreement with its labor union Teamsters, thus putting an end to the labor strike, which posed a threat to the freight traffic in Canada. Following the deal, shares of the company were positively impacted. The stock should be boosted further post ratification of the deal.The ongoing freight upswing has also been benefitting the company. Notably, last reported quarter, both earnings and revenues improved substantially from the year-ago figures. Freight revenues accounting for the bulk (97.8%) of the top line rose 4% year over year. This bullish scenario is anticipated to aid results in the current quarter as well.The company’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are another positive. Over the last couple of years, the company increased its annual dividend by more than 20%. In fact, last month, the company raised its quarterly dividend per share by 15.5% to C$0.65 per share. Canadian Pacific is also active on the buyback front.

245,EXPD,"Are U.S. stock markets finally stabilizing after being plagued by extreme volatility in the last three months? The answer seems to be in the affirmative. Two major indexes – S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite - are trending upwards for four consecutive trading days. Barring minor fluctuations on Tuesday, the Dow 30 index has also been largely trading in the green for trailing four days.Robust labor market data for May, easing of trade war fears, tech stock boom and hike in the U.S. government bond yields resulting in gain for the banking sector are the primary reasons behind this encouraging performance of stocks. These positives are likely to remain constant in the near-term and consequently investment in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move.Indexes Moving NorthOn Jun 6, the Dow 30 closed at 25,146.39, after gaining 346.41 points or 1.4%. This was blue-chip index’s highest level of closing since Mar 12. Likewise, the benchmark S&P 500 closed at 2,772.35, up 0.9% reflecting its highest level of closing since Mar 12.The teach-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at 7,689.24, up 0.7%. The index also recorded its third consecutive all-time closing high after hitting a fresh record high for the first time in almost three months on Jun 4.Robust Labor Market DataOn Jun 1, The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000. The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened. However, most economists think job additions will continue and that the unemployment rate will decline further. (Read more: Unemployment Falls to 18-Year Low: 6 Winning Picks)Trade War Fear EasesAccording to a report by ABC News, on Jun 4, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin urged President Donald Trump to exempt Canada from metal tariffs during a trade meeting. The U.S. government has imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum on Canadian imports since Jun 1.  Meanwhile, China has offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of U.S. farm and energy products if the United States refrains from imposing further tariffs on the country. Moreover, President Trump is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un on Jun 12 in Singapore to reach an amicable solution about North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.Bank Stocks Gain on Higher Bond YieldsOn Jun 6, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Note rose 5.9 basis points to 2.975%, its highest since May 24. The hike in U.S. government bond yield is a result of strong sell off of Eurozone bonds following a senior European Central Bank (ECB) official’s remark that the ECB remained on track to debate next week the timetable for ending its monthly bond purchase scheme.Hike in bond yield was also supported by the market sentiment that the Fed will raise interest rate as labor market is tightening and wage growth will result in inflation. In May, wages increased by 2.7% year over year after remaining unchanged at 2.6% for three consecutive months. The slow increase in wage gains is also serving to cool inflationary fears.The major gainer of a rate hike is the banking sector. Yesterday, the stock price of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and The Goldman Sachs Group increased 3.2%, 2.2%, 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively.Our Top PicksA healthy labor market, gradual fading out of trade conflict and an impending rate hike along with a strong U.S. economy will help stock market bull-run to continue. At this stage, investment in stocks with strong earnings momentum will be lucrative. Our selection is backed by a good Zacks Momentum Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

246,EXPD,"Shares of Triton International Limited (TRTN  -  Free Report) have gained 17.4% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 14.5% rally.Reasons Behind the UptickTriton International’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividend payments are encouraging. Evidently, in May 2018, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 15% to 52 cents per share (annualized $2.08). In the first quarter of 2018, it paid approximately $36 million in dividends, reflecting an increase of 8.5% year over year. Also, the company’s strong cash flow generation is commendable.Furthermore, Triton International’s initiatives to grow its fleet appear promising. The new tax law is an added positive for the company. In fact, reduction in effective tax rate due to the new law led to bottom-line growth in the first quarter.We believe the new tax law is a blessing not only for Triton International, but all Transportation companies. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.Notably, a majority of Triton International’s revenues is derived from its equipment leasing unit. Most of its leasing revenues are generated from international containers. To this end, the metric increased a respective 13.8% and 20.3% in the Asian and European markets in the first quarter.We are also impressed by the company's efforts to grow its fleet (CAGR of 8.2% over the 2005-2017 period). Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings moved north to the tune of 7.1% over the last 60 days, reflecting positive sentiment surrounding the stock.Bullish OutlookThe company’s outlook for the rest of 2018 is impressive. It expects gradual increase in adjusted net income for the current year. Meanwhile, demand for the company’s containers is anticipated to remain high, thus boosting growth. Favorable market conditions should also drive results in the remaining quarters of 2018.At its Investor Day on May 31, the company stated that it expects the bottom line to grow moderately in the remainder of the year. Asset growth for 2018 is projected between 7% and 10%. Cash flow before capex is expected to exceed 80% of leasing revenues.Other Favorable ReadingsTriton International's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 12.3% compares favorably with ROE of 8.8% for its industry. This reflects the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders’ funds. Also, Triton International is attractively valued.Going by the EV by EBITDA ratio, the stock doesn’t look expensive at this point.  The measure for the stock is 8.6, which is favorable compared with the S&P 500's 11.4. The stock’s favorable positioning compared to the broader market certainly signals more upside.Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of A, which highlights its attractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Undoubtedly, the above positives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

247,EXPD,"On May 29, we initiated coverage on Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA  -  Free Report). The company is benefiting from the robust demand for air travel, courtesy of the improving Latin American economy. However, headwinds like high fuel costs and multiple flight cancellations due to the recent Venezuelan crisis have ensured a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for this airline company. Copa Holdings, through its main subsidiaries — Copa Airlines and Copa Colombia —   offers airline passenger and cargo services.The Bullish CaseWe are impressed with the company’s efforts to reward shareholders. In February 2018, Copa Holdings increased its quarterly dividend payment by 16% to 87 cents per share ($3.48 annualized). Also, it took initiatives to modernize its fleet, which is commendable. It exited the first quarter of 2018 with 81 Boeing 737s and 19 Embraer-190s in its fleet. Moving ahead, Copa Holdings aims to increase its fleet size. The carrier’s efforts to expand its operations are encouraging as well.Furthermore, Copa Holdings is being aided by impressive demand for air travel backed by an improving Latin American economy. For example, in the first quarter of 2018, total revenues improved 15.9% year over year, mainly owing to the 16.3% improvement in passenger revenues. The company's performance with respect to unit revenues is also noteworthy.Moreover, Copa Holdings’ financial flexibility and strong balance sheet are real assets amid economic instability. Leverage is low with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 28.7% as of Mar 31, 2018. In addition, the carrier, which is based in Panama City, Panama, has an impressive record with respect to punctuality.The Bearish CaseCopa Holdings’ bottom-line growth is being restricted by high fuel costs. In the first quarter, average fuel price per gallon rose 17.6% year over year to $2.16 per gallon. We note that oil prices have increased more than 11% so far this year.For the second quarter, fuel prices at Copa Holdings are projected to be even higher ($2.25 per gallon), which might weigh on earnings growth. This apart, expenses pertaining to labor are expected to put pressure on the bottom line in the same period.Additionally, the company expects a negative impact to the tune of $15 million in the second quarter due to the political row involving Panama and Venezuela. In fact, Copa Holdings had to cancel approximately 360 flights pertaining to its Venezuela operations in the first quarter of 2018 due to the dispute.However, the strife has been resolved with the Venezuelan and Panamanian governments announcing their decision to re-establish diplomatic and commercial relations on Apr 26, effective immediately. However, re-occurrence of such disputes might hurt the stock severely.Copa Holdings’ April traffic was also disappointing. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) declined 10 basis points to 81.9% on a year-over-year basis due to capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth. For 2018, capacity is expected to grow by approximately 9% year over year. This has given rise to fears that capacity-related woes, which had hurt the entire airline space in the recent past, might resurface.Due to the above headwinds, shares of Copa Holdings have shed 17% of their value so far this year, underperforming its industry’s decline of 13%.Stocks That Warrant a LookWhile we expect Copa Holdings to perform in line with its peers and industry levels over the next one to three months and advice investors to wait for a better entry point before accumulating shares, one can look at SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) as good investment options for investors interested in the transportation space.While Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SkyWest and GATX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Shares of Expeditors, SkyWest and GATX have rallied more than 16%, 8% and 18%, respectively on a year-to-date basis.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

248,EXPD,"United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) has been benefiting immensely from the new tax law. This is quite evident from the company’s bottom-line growth owing to significant reduction in corporate tax rate. In first-quarter 2018, the bottom line soared 17.4% for the same reason. Results were also aided by strong performances by the International, and the Supply Chain and Freight segments. In fact, the effective tax rate in the quarter was just a little over 19% compared with 31.8% in the prior-year quarter. Effective tax rate is projected between 23% and 24% for the remaining quarters of 2018.The reduced corporate tax rate also boosts cash flow. In the first quarter, free cash flow totaled approximately $2.6 billion. Notably, with increased cash flow companies have more cash available to fund share repurchases among other things. In February, UPS raised its quarterly cash dividend by 10%. Furthermore, it paid approximately $840 million as dividend to shareholders in the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 10% year over year. Simultaneously, the company bought back 2.2 million shares for more than $250 million.For 2018, free cash flow is projected between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. Given this bullish view we expect an uptrend in these shareholder-friendly activities.UPS’ efforts to expand globally also raise optimism in the stock. In line with this objective, the company acquired Sandler & Travis Trade Advisory Services (STTAS) in December 2017. This buyout enables UPS to provide customers with enhanced solutions to maximize their trade investments. Furthermore, UPS' decision, taken in February 2018, to broaden the reach of its UPS WorldWide Express service is customer-friendly. Following the expansion, the service can be availed in 124 countries and territories across the globe. The measure aims to facilitate the delivery of urgent shipments in markets offering high-growth potential. Furthermore, the rapid growth of e-commerce is a boon for UPS. Toward this end, last September, the company joined forces with SF Holding keeping in view that the Chinese e-commerce market is highly lucrative, offering significant commercial potential.United Parcel Service, Inc. Price and Consensus  United Parcel Service, Inc. Price and Consensus | United Parcel Service, Inc. QuoteUPS has a commendable VGM Score of A as well. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.In light of these positives, we believe investors should hold onto UPS for now.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

249,EXPD,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) issued a revised guidance for the second quarter of 2018 at the Deutsche Bank 2018 Global Industrials and Materials Summit held yesterday.Strong demand for air travel is anticipated to aid the carrier’s second-quarter results. However, rising fuel prices are pushing up costs and are expected to affect bottom-line growth.The company now expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase between 4% and 5% year over year in the second quarter. Past outlook had called for a rise of 3-5% in the metric. This upside has been driven by impressive revenues and solid demand across all entities in leisure and business segments.With fuel prices trending upward lately (up 12% since the beginning of the second quarter), the company has raised its view pertaining to the same. It now expects the metric between $2.20 and $2.25 per gallon. Previously, the estimate came in between $2.07 and $2.12. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to rise approximately 3% year over year, up from the prior forecast of a climb in the 1-3% range. However, this view is less than the 3.9% ascent during the first quarter of 2018.Pretax margin is now projected between 13% and 14%. Earlier prediction was in the band of 14-16%. Due to the cost headwind, the company slashed its earnings per share guidance for the concerned quarter. The metric is now likely to be in the range of $1.65-$1.75, much lower than the former estimate between $1.80 and $2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings stands at $1.89.The company stated that it takes approximately 6-12 months to recover from rising fuel prices through higher revenues. As a result of trimming its earnings per share guidance, shares of Delta fell significantly during the course of the trading session on Jun 6. However, the stock rebounded to a great extent, closing the trading session at $54.17, down 0.9% over Jun 5’s closing price. The projection for system capacity in the second quarter remains unchanged at 3-4% expansion.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price | Delta Air Lines, Inc. Quote Delta continues to anticipate non-fuel unit costs, higher by 0-2% for the full year, way below the 5.9% increase in 2017. Additionally, the company hopes to return 70% of free cash flow to its shareholders this year. While in the longer-term, it aims to return 20-25% of free cash flow through dividends.Escalating oil prices being a major headwind of the entire airline industry, other carriers might follow Delta and Southwest Airlines Co.’s (LUV  -  Free Report) footsteps in trimming their respective outlooks. We remind investors that a few days back, Southwest Airlines also lowered its capacity view due to the same reason. The low-cost carrier cited high oil prices among other factors behind its capacity outlook cut for 2018. It now expects capacity in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDelta carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report).

We remind investors that last month, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) reached a tentative agreement with its labor union Teamsters, after the workers went on a strike and rejected the company’s latest contract offer. The company was accused of bullying its employees, making them toil for long hours.With companies striking multiple labor deals, bottom line of the companies could be pressurized.

251,EXPD,"Shares of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (CHRW  -  Free Report) have surged 32% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 8.7% increase.Reasons Behind the Price RiseC.H. Robinson has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. The average earnings beat is 2.2%.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders are also encouraging. In December 2017, C.H. Robinson’s board of directors approved a 2.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 46 cents per share (or $1.84 annually). During the first quarter of 2018, it returned $134.7 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.Moreover, C.H. Robinson recently boosted its buyback program. The company’s board has added another 15 million shares to the existing share repurchase authorization of 1.2 million shares, approved in 2013.Increased freight demand and lower tax rates are encouraging too. The improvement in operating cash flow is an added a positive. We are impressed by the company's grow-by-acquisition policy as well. To this end, the company acquired Milgram & Company for around $62 million CAD (approximately $50 million USD), which in turn, expanded C.H. Robinson’s global presence.

252,EXPD,"Shares of Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) have declined 10.8% in the past six months, performing even worse than the industry’s 6.8% decrease. Reasons Behind the DownfallHigh fuel costs are a persistent problem with airlines, and Spirit Airlines is no exception. As fuel costs constitute a major portion of airline expenses, rise in the same has potential to limit bottom-line growth. Notably, fuel costs rose 21.5% in the first quarter of 2018 and were primarily responsible for the bottom line’s contraction.Moreover, oil prices have been on an uptrend of late and are trading above the $66 a barrel mark. This adversity is likely to hurt the bottom line in the second quarter as well. Fuel costs in the current quarter are projected at $2.23 per gallon, much higher than $1.66 reported in the year-ago period.Capacity overexpansion is another problem at the carrier. Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined 60 basis points to 81% in the first quarter as traffic rise (21.4%) was outpaced by capacity growth (22.3%).The decline in unit revenues also raises a concern. Total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM-a key measure of unit revenues) dipped 2.4% in the first quarter as a result of 1.7% slip in operating yields and a 4.1% increase in average stage length. The company’s guidance for TRASM in the second quarter is also disappointing. It expects the metric to decline in the 6.5-7.5% range.The air of negativity revolving around the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 11.8% downward in the last 60 days. Also, the consensus mark for full-year earnings has been moved 3.8% southward over the same time period.The company’s unimpressive Momentum Score of F further highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSpirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

One such tragic event caused the death of a passenger’s pet. However, despite a pessimistic cloud revolving around its customer service for a while now, United Continental has its share of pluses.Let’s look into the positives:Robust growth of passenger revenues owing to strong demand for air travel has been aiding United Continental for some time. The company’s top line in the second quarter is expected to benefit from the same.Unit revenues have also been increasing of late. Notably, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) rose 2.7% year over year in the first quarter. Moreover, the company is likely to perform well on the unit revenue front in the second quarter as well. Passenger unit revenues are projected to increase 1-3% year over year in the current quarter.In fact, strong first-quarter results have led the company to issue an upbeat adjusted earnings guidance for the full year. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the band of $7-$8.50 for 2018, up from its previous forecast in the range of $6.50-$8.50.Further, the company’s persistent capacity-related woes have been put to rest for a while. This is because the carrier has trimmed its capacity view for 2018. It now predicts the metric to grow between 4.5% and 5.5%. Earlier outlook was an expansion in the 4-6% range.United Continental’s initiatives to expand operations worldwide are a further positive. To this end, the carrier recently announced several new routes from its East Coast hubs at New York/Newark and Washington-Dulles. The carrier also strengthened its relationship with Air New Zealand. Under this new deal, flights connecting Chicago with Auckland will be operational from Nov 30, 2018 onward.Moreover, United Continental announced that its flights connecting San Francisco with Auckland, currently a seasonal service, will be operational throughout the year (thrice a week) effective April 2019.The bullish sentiment surrounding the stock is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings being moved 6.3% north in the last 60 days.

255,EXPD,"Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before he market opens.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 0.65%. However, its impressive earnings record reflects outpacing of the Zacks Consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.30%.The scenario pertaining to this quarter looks encouraging for the company. The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings being revised 1.2% upward over the last 30 days, reflecting optimism surrounding the stock.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors likely to influence the company’s impending results:Higher freight revenues are expected to boost Union Pacific's first-quarter results. The metric is likely to increase on the back of overall volume growth among other factors. The company expects expansion of volumes in the first quarter in the low single-digit range.Additionally, with increasing growth of intermodal of late, the segment is likely to perform well in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for intermodal revenues is pegged at $983 million, above $908 million reported a year ago.The company’s cost-cutting efforts are a further positive which is likely to improve the quarterly operating ratio and aid in bottom-line growth in turn.The new tax law is another positive and will drive the bottom line in the quarter. The huge tax savings from the reduced corporate tax rate owing to the new tax law, has led the company to undertake a series of shareholder-friendly moves. Notably, in February, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 73 cents per share. Such investor-oriented activities indicate the company’s financial prosperity.However, the company’s automotive unit has been suffering a sluggish vehicle production in the United States for quite some time and the first-quarter is unlikely to be any different.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter automotive revenues stands at $484 million, lower than $504 million reported a year ago.Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Union Pacific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Union Pacific Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Union Pacific is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it comprises the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.04%.

256,EXPD,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.32%. Moreover, its impressive earnings history shows outperformance of the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.05%.However, things are not looking up for the carrier in the first quarter due to multiple headwinds.Let’s delve deeper into the factors likely to influence the stock’s quarterly performance.Factors at PlaySouthwest Airlines’ unit revenues are likely to be hurt due to pricing pressure and lower-than-expected demand for air travel resulting from the timing of the spring break. Notably, the carrier anticipates revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to be flat with the year-ago figure of 13.23 cents. Lower unit revenues might in turn limit top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger unit revenues is pegged at 12.23 cents, lower than 12.50 cents reported in the previous quarter.Additionally, high costs are also anticipated to affect the carrier’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. The airline estimates operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and oil expense plus profit-sharing expense to rise 0-1%. Additionally, fuel costs are assumed at approximately $2.10 per gallon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel costs also stands at $2.10 per gallon, above $1.96 reported a year ago.Weather-related disruptions have also hampered the carrier’s operations since the beginning of the first quarter. The storms in January and March led to multiple flight cancellations by the airline, possibly inducing a massive adverse impact on the company’s top line.However, the new tax law is a huge positive for the company. The enormous tax savings are likely to boost earnings in the quarter.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of -2.04% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 73 cents per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

257,EXPD,"Shares of Spirit Airlines, Inc. (SAVE  -  Free Report) declined 5.9% on Apr 26 to close the trading session at $35.40. In fact, the stock was down despite this low-cost carrier posting better-than-expected earnings per share yesterday. Spirit’s first-quarter earnings per share came in at 44 cents (excluding $1.10 from non-recurring items), a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Why This Contrasting Scenario Despite an earnings beat in the first quarter, investors were visibly displeased due to a year-over-year decline in the metric. High fuel costs were primarily responsible for the bottom-line contraction. Average economic fuel cost per gallon surged 21.5% to $2.15 in the reported quarter.The upsurge in fuel costs was chiefly responsible for a 39.8% increase in total operating expenses. This apart, expenses on salaries, wages and other benefits surged 22%. Unit costs (excluding fuel and special items) decreased 5%. However, the decline was more than the anticipated figure of 3% due to the new contract with its pilots.This Miramar, FL-based carrier’s struggles on the top-line front also disappointed investors. The carrier recorded revenues of $704.1 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $705 million. The top line, however, grew substantially year over year owing to healthy passenger revenues.Notably, the most disturbing aspect of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier’s first-quarter top-line performance was the 2.4% decline in total revenue per available seat miles (a key measure of unit revenue). This key metric was hurt by the 1.7% decrease in operating yields and a 4.1% increase in average stage length.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) decline of 60 basis points to 81% was another negative aspect of the earnings report. The metric was down as traffic growth (21.4%) was outpaced by capacity expansion (22.3%) during the reported quarter.Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Spirit Airlines, Inc. QuoteDisappointing OutlookApart from the below-par earnings report, Spirit Airlines’ second-quarter 2018 guidance also disappointed investors and contributed to the stock price decline. The company envisions capacity (available seat miles) to expand 29% year over year in the quarter. TRASM is expected to decline in the range of 6.5-7.5%.Fuel costs are anticipated to increase further to $2.23 per gallon in the second quarter. Adjusted unit costs ex-fuel is estimated to be down 7.5-8.5%. For 2018, the carrier expects capacity to rise 22.5%. Adjusted CASM ex-fuel is predicted to be down 3-4% in the year.Upcoming ReleasesInvestors interested in the broader Zacks Transportation industry are keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings reports from key players like C.H.

258,EXPD,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) has rallied 15.4% so far this year, significantly outperforming the industry’s increase of 6.2%. Reasons Behind the Price IncreaseThe new tax law has been aiding the company immensely since its implementation in December 2017. In first-quarter 2018, the bottom line was up 52.9% owing to the reduced tax rate as well as lower costs. Moreover, CSX’s effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.8%, much less than 37.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. The momentum is expected to continue in the current year as well.Apart from bottom-line growth, huge savings from the tax cut will lead to an increase in free cash flow. As a result, the company will have more cash in hand to fund share repurchases and dividends among other things.Furthermore, it has an impressive track record of dividends and share buybacks. In February 2018, CSX announced a 10% dividend hike. Simultaneously, the company increased the existing share repurchase program to $5 billion.The company’s Precision Scheduled Railroading model, adopted last year also seems to be paying off. The model, which reduces costs, enhances services and optimally uses assets of the company, generated efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017.At the 2018 investor conference held in March, the company stated that the new model will lead to top-line growth backed by volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and the intermodal segments. Moreover, scheduled railroading is anticipated to provide greater agility to coal markets, which in turn, will drive growth.In fact, by 2020, CSX expects to achieve an operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) of 60% and outpace the industry. Traces of the company’s progress are evident from its first-quarter performance, wherein it reported an operating ratio of 63.7% compared with 73.2% in the prior-year quarter.These tailwinds place the company on a solid path for long-term growth. It has a long-term growth rate of 13.3%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCSX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and GATX Corp. (GATX  -  Free Report).

259,EXPD,"Driehaus strategy is an investment approach developed by Richard Herman Driehaus using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. This strategy can be used by investors with high-risk appetite by investing mainly in momentum stocks. The success of this investment approach helped Driehaus secure a name in Barron’s All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10- year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.A Look at Driehaus’ StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus’ strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.“I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,” Driehaus had said in an interview.Screening ParametersThe percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

260,EXPD,"Shares of Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $144.45 during the trading session on May 18 before retracing a bit to close at $143.80. Notably, the stock has performed impressively in the past year with a surge of 33.4%, comfortably outperforming the industry’s 23.3% rally. Catalysts for the UpsurgeUnion Pacific’s initiatives to promote safety and enhance productivity are encouraging. Per data released by the Federal Railroad Administration, the company emerged as the safest railroad in the country for the third consecutive year. It made a significant progress during 2017 toward implementing positive train control (PTC), an advanced system for prevention of collisions and derailments. The PTC also has several other safety features. It intends to spend a further $180 million on PTC in the current year.The company also performed impressively in the first quarter of 2018 reporting better-than-expected results. Moreover, the top and the bottom line expanded 6.7% and 27.3%, respectively. Results were aided by higher freight revenues, lower tax rate as well as volume growth.The company’s cost-control efforts are impressive as well. Union Pacific expects operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) to improve in 2018 and targets the same to be 55% for the long term.The company’s shareholder-friendly measures are a further positive. In February, the company’s board cleared a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share). Moreover, this was the company’s second dividend raise in three months.  Last November, the company had announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents.We expect a spurt in such investor-oriented activities, courtesy of the new tax law. The huge savings generated from the reduced corporate tax rate will further boost free cash flow. Thus, more cash will be left in hand for the company to fund these investor-friendly moves.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUnion Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

261,EXPD,"Shares of JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) have declined 14.8% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decrease of 13.1%. Let’s delve into the factors causing this downside.The rise in fuel costs has been plaguing the entire airline industry of late and JetBlue has not been spared the blow either. Notably, the metric rose 23% in the first quarter at JetBlue. With fuel costs persistently on an uptrend of late due to various reasons like geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the company’s second-quarter results are also anticipated to be hurt for the same reason. In fact, fuel cost is projected to be $2.23 per gallon in the second quarter of 2018, much higher than $1.61 a year ago. Apart from fuel costs, high labor costs will affect the company’s results in the second quarter. JetBlue recently reached an agreement in principle with its pilots after a long-standing negotiation for a fair deal. The contract is yet to be ratified. The company currently expects non-fuel unit costs between 2% and 4% in the period under consideration. The estimate is likely to be raised following ratification of the new contract.Further, the company’s forecast for unit revenues in the second quarter is worrisome. It predicts revenues per available seat mile (RASM) in the range of a decline of 3% to flat year over year. This downside is due to adverse effects pertaining to holiday placement, completion factor as well as co-brand incentive payments.Additionally, natural calamities weighed on airlines significantly in the recent past. The back-to-back weather-related disasters have disrupted operations and caused a huge revenue loss for the company. This year, JetBlue had to cancel multiple flights due to the winter storm Grayson in January and the successive nor’easters in March.No wonder, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been revised 22.2% downward in the last 60 days. For the full-year too, the consensus mark has been moved 6.2% south over the same time frame. The company’s unimpressive Momentum Score of F further highlights its short-term unattractiveness.Zacks Rank & Key PicksJetBlue carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

262,EXPD,"American Airlines Group Inc.’s (AAL  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings (excluding 14 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.42 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Quarterly earnings declined significantly on a year-over-year basis due to high costs. Results were also hurt by the recent hurricanes.Revenues of $10,878 million were 2.7% above the year-ago figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $10,882.9 million. Strong demand for air travel coupled with improving yields drove the top line in the quarter under review.Total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenue) improved 1.1% to 14.89 cents in the reported quarter. In fact, this quarter marked the fourth successive one in which the metric grew on a year-over-year basis, since the fourth quarter of 2014.Consolidated yield improved 1.6%. Passenger revenue per available seat miles improved 0.9%. While traffic (measured by revenue passenger miles) was up 0.9%, capacity (measured by average seat miles) was up 1.6%. In fact, consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) decreased to 82.8% from 83.3% a year-ago as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion.Total operating expenses climbed 5.3% year over year to $9.6 billion primarily backed by rise in fuel costs. Expenses pertaining to salaries and benefits were up 8%. Consolidated operating costs per available seat miles (CASM: excluding special items) increased 4.5%.During the third quarter, the company had to cancel more than 8,000 flights due to the hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria). Consequently, its pre-tax earnings was hurt by approximately $75 million in the quarter.In the third quarter of 2017, the company returned $411 million billion to its shareholders through the payment of $49 million in dividends and buyback of shares worth $362 million. Furthermore, the carrier also declared a dividend of 10 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on Nov 27, to the shareholders on Nov 13. Notably, the carrier has returned more than $11.1 billion to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends since mid-2014. We are impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through stock repurchases and dividend payments.Meanwhile, it remains focused on introducing new aircraft and retiring old ones from its fleet. In fact, keeping in with its aim to modernize its fleet, the carrier invested in excess of $900 million during the reported quarter in 13 new planes and three regional ones.American Airlines Group, Inc.

263,EXPD,"United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.58 surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 per share. The top-line also increased 11% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues.Revenues improved 7.7% to $15,750 million from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,477.3 million. The upside was driven by growth across all the key segments of the company.Factors Likely to Influence This Quarter We expect the company’s bottom line to be hurt by escalated costs in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, high package delivery costs have been hurting UPS for some time and the third quarter is likely to be no different. Moreover, UPS is working hard to expand its presence. Though positive on such efforts, we believe that expansion related expenses might also drag down third-quarter earnings.Additionally, foreign currency-related headwinds are expected to hurt the quarter’s results as well. The third-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues — international package — is pegged at $3,076 million, lower than the $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Moreover, unfavorable product mix and weakness in industrial production might dampen the company’s performance.We are, however, impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders consistently through buybacks and dividends. An update on the subject will be awaited on the conference call. Also, UPS is leaving no stone unturned to perform well in the upcoming holiday season like its rival FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report). The company expects to benefit from growth in ecommerce. We expect a detailed commentary on the issue on the third-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UPS will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks Rank: UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: UPS has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, which acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive.

264,EXPD,"Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A.(GOL  -  Free Report) reported modest air traffic figures for May. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), nudged up 0.7% to 2.75 billion owing to a 2.6% increase on the domestic front. However, international traffic declined 16.5%.On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat kilometers/ASKs) inched up 0.4% to 3.58 billion, primarily backed by 1.5% growth in domestic capacity. On the international front, capacity declined 9.2%.Consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) at this Sao Paulo, Brazil-based carrier increased modestly to 76.8% in May as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion. Domestically, load factor increased marginally but fell 5.9% percentage points to 68% internationally. This downturn can be attributed to decline in traffic, which was more than capacity contraction.Weakness on the international front seems to have displeased investors. This is evident from the fact that the stock fell more than 5% on Jun 6 despite an improvement in overall traffic and load factor. It seems that the rise in oil prices has hampered international travel leading to the bleak scenario. Additionally, strikes and political uncertainty in Brazil might have discouraged travel to the nation, leading to a drastic fall in international load factor.We remind investors that the truckers of Brazil started a strike on May 21, protesting against high diesel prices.

265,EXPD,"The Q1 earnings season is unwinding fast with 154 S&P 500 companies (representing 37.9% of the total market capitalization of the coveted index) having reported results as of Apr 25.  In fact, the picture that has evolved thus far is an extremely rosy one.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies have increased 25.4% year over year. Also, revenues for the same improved 10.3% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, 80.5% of these companies have outpaced earnings estimates and 72.1% surpassed top-line expectations.What is even more encouraging is that this bull run is likely to continue for the rest of the Q1 reporting cycle. According to the above report, this earnings season seems to be well on track to register the highest level of year-over-year earnings growth in the last seven years. It also predicted that overall earnings for all the S&P 500 are expected to be up 20% on 8% growth in revenues. This bullish projection can be attributed to a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.Given the prevalent healthy scenario, it is quite natural that most sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end Q1 with earnings growth year over year. Moreover, most of those 15 sectors are projected to end Q1 with double-digit earnings growth.One of these high-flying sectors is Transportation. Majority of the sector participants (57.1%) have already reported financial numbers. The performances of the S&P 500 transportation companies so far, indicate a 23.7% increase in total earnings year over year, with 75% outperforming on the bottom-line front. The members of this highly diversified sector are projected to end Q1 with earnings growth of 19.9%, much higher than the 3.5% in the final quarter of 2017.Factors Responsible for Transports Flying High It is a well-documented fact that stocks in the Transportation space had a rough time last year due to factors like hurricanes and public-relation related fiascos. Even though, headwinds like foul weather and high costs have hurt transports in Q1, sector participants managed to overcome the obstacles and perform well this earnings season.Notably, factors like the new tax law, improved unit revenue scenario, thriving domestic economy and strong performance of the intermodal division have helped this key sector to perform well in Q1 reporting cycle.Transports’ Bull Run Likely to ContinueWith the Transportation sector very much in favor, it is likely that quite a few companies in this space that have not yet disclosed their quarterly numbers will report better-than-expected results in Q1. Given this backdrop, it seems to be a prudent idea to add such stocks to one’s portfolio now.How to Make the Right Choice?With multiple companies present in the Transportation space, the task of selecting the right stocks is by no means an easy one. The process is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack unless one is aware of an appropriate method to make the right choice.One way to narrow down the list of choices is by looking at stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

270,EXPD,"In the latest signal that the U.S. economy is starting to pick up the pace, the services sector grew at a faster clip in May. This marked the 100th successive month of expansion for service-oriented companies, which employ the majority of the United States’ working population.Respondents of the survey conducted by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) did express concern about trade-related issues. But the overall sentiment about the economy remained upbeat. This is why it is a good time to invest in stocks from the services sector.Index Expands at Faster Clip in MayThe ISM services index increased from 56.8% in April to 58.6% in May. At this point, the index is nearing a 13-year high. More significantly, while any figure above 50% indicates expansion, a reading above 55% is outstanding.The Business Activity Index increased from 59.1% to 61.3%, marking the 106th straight month of gains. Additionally, the New Orders Index increased from 60% to 60.5%. The Employment Index increased from 53.6% to 54.1%.The report also revealed that 14 non-manufacturing industries have experienced expansion in a month. The survey’s results were nearly identical to the one released by IHS Markit. In fact, the IHS Markit U.S. Services Business Activity Index hit a three-year high in May.Upbeat Sentiment Outweighs Trade ConcernsAccording to the ISM’s Anthony Nieves, respondents remained concerned about trade tensions. There are fears that a breakdown in trade agreements like the NAFTA and tariffs on aluminum and steel could raise costs on the supply side. This in turn could impede growth for the economy at large.However, most respondents continue to remain positive about business conditions. The outlook for the economy at large remained encouraging. Recently released economic reports seem to bear out this fact. For instance, May’s jobs report reflects the continuing strength in the labor market with unemployment falling to an 18-year low. Our ChoicesA substantial expansion in the services sector is indicative of its continuing attractiveness as an investment option. Additionally, encouraging economic data, like the recent jobs report, bears out the optimism expressed by respondents in the ISM survey.This is why it makes good sense to add stocks from this sector to your portfolio. However, it is crucial to pick winning stocks in order to reap maximum gains. This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

271,EXPD,"Shares of CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $65.93 on May 30, before retracing a bit to close the session at $65.64. The day’s closing price reflected an improvement of 2.6% over May 29’s close.We note that this S&P 500 member’s impressive performance was not limited to May 30. Notably, the company has performed impressively in a year, gaining 20.3% compared with the S&P 500 Index’s 11.9% rally. Let's delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the impressive price performance.CSX is benefiting from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, which was implemented by the company’s former CEO — E. Hunter Harrison — who expired in December 2017. The system, designed to improve its operational efficiency, is being backed by CSX’s current CEO Jim Foote. The implementation of the above system resulted in CSX generating efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017. Strong performance of its intermodal segment is also a positive for the stock.Furthermore, improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) was in tune with the company’s cost control efforts. To this end, the company’s adjusted operating ratio improved 570 basis points in the first quarter. CSX expects to achieve an operating ratio of 60% by 2020.In fact, the lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available with the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks. In February 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced a 10% dividend hike to 22 cents per share.CSX, which bought back shares worth more than $2 billion in 2017, increased the existing share repurchase program to $5 billion. The $5-billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We believe the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like CSX. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.Other Favorable MeasuresCSX’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Not only has the company’s ROE of 18% gradually increased in a year’s time, it also compares favorably with the ROE of 16.6% for the S&P 500 Index.The company’s Momentum Score of A further highlights its short-term attractiveness. Moreover, CSX’s expected earnings per share growth rate (three to five years) of 13.3% compares favorably with its industry’s 10.6% reading.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

272,EXPD,"Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings and better-than-expected revenues. The bottom line plunged massively on high costs while the top line showed substantial improvement on higher passenger revenues.Let’s see how things shape up for this earnings season.Factors at PlayPersistent high labor and fuel costs are likely to hurt the carrier’s bottom line in the first quarter. Notably, the carrier expects cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel and special items to rise approximately 5% in the quarter. While economic fuel cost per gallon is anticipated to grow 19.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter CASM excluding fuel is pegged at 9 cents, above 8 cents, reported a year ago. While the consensus mark for economic fuel cost per gallon stands at $1.97, higher than $1.78 in the first quarter of 2017.The issue of capacity overexpansion has been ailing the company for quite some time now and might hamper its first-quarter results as well. Notably, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined during the January-March period. The metric contracted 50 basis points, 80 basis points and 230 basis points in March, February and January, respectively. Load factor fell in each of these months due to traffic rise outpacing capacity growth.Expanding capacity implies increase in costs and cheap air tickets. Low air fares reduce unit revenues of carriers, thus affecting the top line. Capacity is anticipated to expand around 8% in the to-be-reported quarter.The carrier has been struggling on the unit revenue front, which might further affect results in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter passenger unit revenues-mainline stands at 9 cents, lower than the previous quarter’s 10 cents.However, the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are impressive. During the first quarter, it announced a dividend hike of 7% to 32 cents per share, higher than the previous count of 30 cents.Earnings WhispersPer the Zacks proven model, a company needs the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Alaska Air has an Earnings ESP of -15.04% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 17 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 15 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alaska Air carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

273,EXPD,"The diversified transportation sector, which includes airline operators, railroads, truckers and shippers to name a few, gained foothold in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year. As the U.S. economy continues to grow, demand for carriage is also increasing and this momentum is anticipated to sustain in 2018.Consequently, companies offering equipment financing and leasing, logistics and supply chain management services to transporters have also rebounded in 2018. At this stage, investment in transportation services stocks with favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move.Tax Overhaul: A Major BoostThe two pro-growth agendas of President Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Transportation sector. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%, its historic low in 78 years. A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland. Consequently, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate borne by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow.Robust Demand for FreightA thriving and improving economy supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects, sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent.Economic growth and demand for freight are positively correlated. Healthy growth in manufacturing, construction, mining and automobile production will increase demand for more freight.Moreover, the Trump administration intends to spend a whopping $1.5 trillion on several infrastructure projects like constructing new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across the country over a period of 10 years. This project will generate significant demand for manufacturing sector, which in turn will raise demand for freight, benefiting the transportation sector.  Zacks FavorsTransportation-Services IndustryThe Transportation Services industry is currently in a strong position from the Zacks Industry Rank perspective. The industry is currently in the top 38% (97 out of 256) of the Zacks categorized industries, suggesting it is well-positioned. Historically, the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our Top PicksTransportation sector is the lifeblood of the economy as it moves freights across the country and offshore. Favorable economic condition along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the Trump administration bode well for the sector.

274,EXPD,"Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) have lost 7.1% in the past six months, underperforming its industry’s decline of 2.9%. Reasons Behind the Price PlungeThis European carrier has been suffering from the dispute with its pilots for quite some time.  Recently, the Spanish pilots' union had called off talks with the carrier. Also, the union might file a lawsuit against the company going forward.In 2017, the European Employee Representative Council — formed by pilots of the Irish carrier — had demanded the resignation of Ryanair CEO, Michael O‘Leary. Per the unofficial pan-European body, O‘Leary had failed to tackle the issue effectively, resulting in many pilots quitting the company. Ryanair, however, dismissed this demand. This Irish low-cost carrierhad to cancel 2,000 flights due to shortage of pilots. Also, Ryanair’s pilots had resorted to a four-hour strike last year in protest.Apart from the dispute with pilots, the lack of clarity regarding Brexit represents a further challenge for the company. Fares are expected to remain under pressure due to the uncertain scenario.Moreover, rising fuel costs are anticipated to limit bottom-line growth. Ryanair expects its fuel bill to rise by more than €300m in fiscal 2019 (ending Mar 31, 2019). This significant increase is expected to be a major drag on the company’s earnings.Other MetricsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings moved south 1.2% and 7.1%, respectively, in the last 30 days. This reflects investor’s pessimism surrounding the stock.  Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of D, which highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

275,EXPD,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) reported traffic figures for May 2018. Consolidated traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 19.69 billion, up 2.9% year over year.Consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) climbed 3.5% to 22.83 billion on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers contracted 40 basis points to 86.3% due to capacity expansion exceeding traffic growth.Additionally, the carrier recorded an on-time performance (mainline) of 85% and a completion factor (mainline) of 99.9%. Approximately, 16.8 million passengers boarded Delta in the month.In the first five months of 2018, Delta generated consolidated RPMs of 87.23 billion (up 3% year over year) and ASMs of 103.74 billion (up 3.1% year over year). Load factor in the period was 84.1% compared with 84.2% at the end of May 2017.Last month, the company made headlines with its CEO Ed Bastian announcing his intention to resume flight services to those destinations where the likes of Etihad Airways, Etihad and Emirates had earlier held an advantageous position. His comment followed after the United States and UAE inked a deal to resolve a long-standing feud between the two countries over government subsidies.Keeping with its CEO’s words, this Atlanta-based carrier announced that it will resume  non-stop flight operations to Mumbai, India next year onward. In fact, to facilitate air travel on this particular route, Delta aims at expanding its codeshare relationship with the Mumbai-based Jet Airways.

276,EXPD,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has revised its guidance for second-quarter 2018 unit revenues and capacity as well as full-year capacity.For the current quarter, the company expects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to decline around 3% year over year (the earlier guidance had called for a decline in the 1-3% range). This downside was primarily due to soft bookings following insufficient marketing initiatives post the Flight 1380 incident in April.Additionally, the company now anticipates second-quarter available seat mile (ASM) or capacity to increase approximately 3.5%. Earlier, the company had called for 3.5-4% growth in the metric.Further, high oil prices and slackness in revenue trends have forced Southwest to trim its capacity outlook for 2018. The company now projects ASM in the low 4% range compared with its prior forecast in the low 5% range. Also, for the latter half of the year, ASM is anticipated to expand approximately 6% year over year, lower than its past view of a rise in the low 7% range.This was perhaps much anticipated given the gloomy picture of airlines due to the recent trend of rising oil prices. In fact, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently lowered its forecast for airline profitability in 2018. The research firm predicts the industry’s global net profit to be $33.8 billion, much lower than the 2018 profitability expectation of $38.4 billion, unveiled by the organization last December. The profitability forecast for the current year also compares unfavorably with what the airlines achieved in 2017 ($38 billion).  Price PerformanceThe plight of airlines, thanks to the oil price surge, can be gauged from the Zacks Airline industry shedding 12.9% of its value, way below the S&P 500 index’s growth of 2.3%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksSouthwest carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

277,EXPD,"On May 31, we initiated coverage on Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (ODFL  -  Free Report). The trucking company primarily offers less-than-truckload (LTL) services on a regional, inter-regional and national basis.Upbeat Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, Old Dominion has performed well, handily outperforming its industry. While shares of the company have surged 76.2%, the industry rallied 41.9%. LTL Unit – A Key CatalystSolid growth at the company’s LTL unit led to its impressive price performance. In fact, LTL service revenues account for bulk of Old Dominion’s top line. Revenues at this segment are being aided by growth in LTL tons and yield.We expect the company’s LTL segment to perform well in the coming quarters as well, thereby driving growth at Old Dominion. Notably, LTL tons per day and LTL revenue per hundredweight improved 15.8% and 6.4%, respectively, in April 2018. With the domestic economy on solid footing, LTL revenues should continue increasing.The fact that this Thomasville, NC-based company is on a growth path is evident from its expected earnings per share growth rate (three to five years) that stands at an impressive 23.3%, which compares favorably with its industry’s 18.4% reading.Other PositivesThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are impressive. In February 2018, Old Dominion’s board of directors approved a 30% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 13 cents per share (or 52 cents annually). The company’s board also cleared a new buyback program recently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co.

The significant cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn, mighty aid the bottom line.Moreover, the provision allowing capital expenditures to be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred is also favorable for stocks like Old Dominion. This is because such companies invest significantly toward capital expenditures. Effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 reduced to 25.2% from 38.6% a year ago. The same is projected around 26.2% for the remaining quarters of 2018.The company’s Momentum Score of B further highlights its short-term attractiveness. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

278,EXPD,"Per Bloomberg, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) has reached a tentative agreement with its labor union Teamsters, thus putting an end to the labor strike that began on Tuesday.Following this announcement, shares of the company rose 2.9% at the close of business on Mar 30.On the night of May 29, more than 3,000 locomotive engineers and conductors at Canadian Pacific, represented by Teamsters, went on a strike. The stop-work ensued after union’s rejection of the company’s latest contract offer.The workers’ collective agreement expired in 2017 and was demanding more predictable schedules to counter crew fatigue among other things.In fact, the company has been accused of bullying workers and making them slog for long hours. However, Canadian Pacific remained mum on these allegations.The labor strife came at a time when the Canadian economy was already grappling with freight service disruptions. The conflict if prolonged would have posed a threat to the country’s mining sector, thereby hampering freight revenues. This is because mining comprises more than 50% of annual freight revenues for Canada’s railroads.However, the new four-year deal puts to rest all of this and allows the company to take advantage of the upbeat freight scenario.Terms of the agreement were not disclosed and operations at Canadian Pacific are anticipated to resume today.Earlier on Tuesday, Canadian Pacific reached a three-year agreement with a comparatively smaller union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price | Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksCanadian Pacific has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

279,EXPD,"The transportation sector is widely diversified in nature comprising of airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing stocks, logistics companies, among others. So far this year, the sector has been experiencing a tough time courtesy multiple headwinds like back to back hurricanes, terror attacks and driver shortages, to name a few.Turbulence Awaits Transports in Q3?The Q3 earnings season has seen releases from 52 S&P 500 participants as of Oct 18. In fact, the latest Earnings Trends predicts that the entire S&P 500 space will end the quarter with earnings per share and revenues improving 3% and 4.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.However, this overall bright picture is not shared by the transportation sector. Per the report, the bottom line for this key sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) is expected to decline 15.2% in Q3 due to high costs, on a year-over-year basis. Markedly, the same had increased 9.4% in Q2.Disappointing Price PerformanceThe turbulence in the space can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Transportation sector has underperformed the S&P 500 Index on a year-to-date basis. The sector has gained 8.3%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 14.4%.Why this Slide?The recent natural calamities (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico) have hurt the sector participants, significantly. For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues. In fact, the negative impact of the hurricanes is also well reflected in the key transportation earnings reports available thus far. Evidently, United Continental Holdings had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter and consequently its third-quarter pretax income reduced to the tune of approximately $185 million.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines, leading to rapid increase in freight costs. In this regard, Union Pacific Corporation, which will reveal its results on Oct 26, expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs have hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of Q3.Increase in Fuel CostsThe rise in fuel costs does not augur well for transports. This is because costs associated with oil are considered to be one of the major input for any transportation company.Of late, fuel costs are on the rise with oil prices crossing the $50 a barrel threshold. This upsurge can be attributed to the improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks. Harvey also contributed to the same owing to gasoline shortages caused by the storm.Some Tailwinds RemainDespite the challenges, there are some positives for the sector participants. For example, improvement in the coal scenario has turned out to be a huge blessing for railroads as it is a key revenue generating commodity for them.The election of Donald Trump as the President of United States last year also worked wonders for the coal industry.  This is because Trump is in favor of reviving the industry by relaxing regulations detrimental to its prospects.Moreover, the busy Labor Day travel period (Aug 30-Sep 5) for U.S. airlines this year substantiates the strong demand for air travel, which in turn bodes well for airlines.Additionally, the upcoming holiday season is expected to be another factor aiding the turnaround efforts of the transportation sector. Travel plans this season are likely to surge owing to a number of bullish factors like solid job growth, rising wages and increased consumer spending.The advent of the holiday season also implies that package delivery companies like FedEx Corporation and United Parcel Service have their hands full. Markedly, they are leaving no stone unturned to meet surge in demand.A successful holiday season for the abovementioned companies are likely to boost their stock prices as well. This, in turn, is a positive for the entire transportation sector.How to Pick Likely Q3 Winners?Despite the overall gloomy scenario, the aforesaid factors clearly suggest that all is not lost for transports. There exist few hidden gems in the space that investors can unearth as they have the potential to generate handsome returns.However, given the vastness of the transportation space and the current issues, it is by no means an easy task to identify the attractive picks. This is where our proprietary model comes to the rescue.According to our model, stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP are likely to outperform.

(SAVE  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before he market opens.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.82%. Moreover, it has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 3.5%.Let’s see, how things shape up for this earnings season.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Spirit Airlines is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it comprises the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Spirit Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +2.46% as the Most Accurate estimate of 44 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Spirit Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which further increases the predictive power of ESP. Notably, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates. Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Spirit Airlines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Spirit Airlines, Inc. Quote What is Driving This Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Lower non-fuel unit costs owing to better operational performance are expected to boost the bottom line in the first quarter. Notably, the company anticipates non-fuel unit costs to decline approximately 5% in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Additionally, the new tax law is a huge positive and is anticipated to boost profitability in the quarter. The enormous savings from the reduced corporate tax rate is likely to aid in earnings growth.However, high fuel costs might hurt the impending results. Fuel cost (economic) is projected at $2.15 per gallon in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, much higher than $1.97, reported in the final quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter average fuel cost per gallon stands at $2.17.Moreover, disappointing unit revenues might limit top-line growth in the quarter. The company expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to decline approximately 2.4% in the to-be-reported quarterly performance. Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc.

281,EXPD,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the market opens.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.3%. Moreover, an encouraging earnings history shows the stock having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.2%.However, the scenario pertaining to this to-be-reported quarter does not appear too bright and this can further be gauged from the stock’s southbound estimate revision. The consensus mark for earnings has been revised 2.7% downward in the last 30 days.Factors at PlaySluggish coal and automotive revenues are expected to hurt the top line in the first quarter. Notably, at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials conference, the company stated that automotive and coal volumes declined 7% and 6%, respectively, as of Mar 10. Automotive weakness is thus anticipated to hurt the broader merchandise segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter coal revenues is pegged at $401 million, lower than $426 million reported in the previous quarter. The consensus mark for automotive in the quarter to be reported stands at $236 million, also falling below the past quarter’s $242 million.Additionally, the company’s high-debt levels raise concerns. Apart from a rise in the immediate finance costs, the high leverage ratio will require significant cash flows for repayments.However, higher volumes are expected to aid results. We expect the intermodal unit to perform impressively in the first quarter of 2018.The company’s cost-cutting efforts are also projected to generate significant cost savings, thereby boosting the bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The company’s initiatives to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are also encouraging. In January, the company raised its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88) from 61 cents (annualized $2.44).Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Norfolk Southern is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

282,EXPD,"Ryder System, Inc. (R  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.48%. Moreover, it boasts an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 2.43%.However, things do not seem bright for the company this quarter. The stock has also seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate being revised 9.3% downward in the last 60 days.Factors at PlayWeak market conditions are a challenge for Ryder’s used vehicle sales. This is further expected to hamper results in the first quarter. Notably, the company projects adjusted earnings per share in the band of 83-90 cents, falling way below $1.37, reported in the fourth quarter of 2017.Ryder is likely to spend heavily on capital expenditure in the current year due to higher growth and replacements costs in lease as well as rental. The increased capital expenses are likely to burden the bottom line in 2018, effects of which might surface in the quarter to be reported.Additionally, the company’s high debt-to-equity ratio (expressed as percentage) is anticipated to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter. The metric lies well above the industry’s average as well as the S&P 500 index’s figure. The new tax law is, however, a positive for Ryder and might aid first-quarter results. Buoyed by the new law, Ryder hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 6 cents to 52 cents per share in February.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ryder is likely to beat estimates in the soon to-be-reported quarter.

283,EXPD,"Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 earnings numbers on Apr 24, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company reported in-line earnings and lower-than-expected revenues. Moreover, the bottom line declined 14.1% due to high costs while the top line increased 8.5% on a year-over-year basis.Let’s see, how things shape up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Hawaiian Holdings is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Hawaiian Holdings has an Earnings ESP of +1.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 83 cents per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 when combined with a positive ESP have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. Quote Factors Likely at PlayThe carrier’s strong demand for air travel is anticipated to boost passenger revenues in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger revenues stands at $613 million, above $538 million reported in the prior-year quarter.The company’s performance with respect to unit revenues is expected to aid the top line in the quarter to be reported. It projects operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to increase in the band of 3-5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RASM is pegged at 13.95 cents, higher than 13.58 cents a year ago.Additionally, the consensus mark for passenger unit revenues in the quarter stands at 12.96 cents, above 11.89 cents reported in the year-earlier period.However, unit costs excluding fuel are projected to rise significantly in the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher labor costs. This is likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in turn. Cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel is anticipated to rise between 4% and 6% in the first quarter. The consensus estimate for unit costs is pegged at 9.79 cents, slightly higher than the year-ago figure of 9.64 cents.High fuel costs are also expected to weigh on the bottom line. Further, fuel cost per gallon (economic) is estimated in the band of $1.90-$2 for the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fuel price per gallon stands at $2, much above $1.68 reported a year ago.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also check out other stocks worth considering like American Airlines Group Inc.

284,EXPD,"Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) has rewarded shareholders with 28% dividend hike and a new share repurchase authorization worth $2 billion on the back of impressive results and a strong cash flow, arising from huge savings on account of the U.S. tax reform. The move indicates the company’s sound financial position and favorable prospects.Following this announcement, shares of the company rose 2.5% to $53.01 at the close of business on May 16.The quarterly dividend of 16 cents per share (or 64 cents annually) will be paid on Jun 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 6. The amount has been hiked from the current 12.5 cents, marking the company’s 167th consecutive quarterly dividend.Additionally, the board has announced a new share buyback program of $2 billion in aggregate, set to begin on completion of the existing $2-billion share repurchase authorized in May 2017. Under the existing program, the company has repurchased 19.8 million shares and has $350 million still remaining to be bought back.The recently approved share buyback will be executed per the prevailing laws and is liable to be discontinued at any point of time.Southwest Airlines Co. Price  Southwest Airlines Co. Price | Southwest Airlines Co. QuoteThe company’s shareholder-friendly approach comes in at a time when it is embroiled in a lot of trouble. The successive mid-air flight snags in a month’s time has been hampering the company’s reputation. No wonder that demand for the carrier has declined. The airlines’ April traffic results bear testimony to this dismal situation. Traffic in the month slipped 0.3% on low demand following the fatal engine failure.Moreover, during first-quarter 2018 results, the company provided a bleak outlook for unit revenues in the second quarter citing weak bookings after the fatal Apr 17 incident. It expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to decline between 1% and 3% in the quarter.On Apr 30, the company had announced another $500-million accelerated share repurchase program, possibly to counter this adversity.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSouthwest carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

285,EXPD,"Shares of GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $75.35 during the trading session on May 16, before retracing a bit to close at $74.31 per share. The closing price represents an improvement of 1.79% from May 15.In a year’s time, GATX has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has rallied 29.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.5%. Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeLast month, this Chicago, IL-based company reported better-than-expected earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018. The bottom-line figure also improved 37.5% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by the Rail North America segment’s robust performance owing to higher gains on asset disposition in the quarter under review. GATX's Rail International unit also performed well, driven by a rise in railcars on lease. Moreover, the company’s efforts to modernize its fleet are encouraging.The company’s efforts to reward its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments are added positives. Notably, GATX has been paying regular dividends continuously since 1919. In the 2007-2017 time frame, the company has returned approximately $1.7 billion to its shareholders through dividends and buybacks.In January 2018, GATX raised the quarterly dividend by 5% to 44 cents per share. In the first quarter of 2018, it bought back approximately 366,000 shares for $25 million.In fact, the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like GATX. The huge savings, induced by the new law, might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also hiked dividend payouts in May owing to the new tax law.Impressive Earnings Surprise HistoryGATX has a solid earnings surprise history. A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate.In the first quarter of 2018, GATX surpassed earnings estimates for the third time in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 27.5%.We note that a history of positive earnings surprise generally works as a catalyst in driving a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass the estimates. So, investors take it in their consideration while betting on the stock with an expectation that the company will do the same trick to outpace the estimates in the upcoming release.Earnings Estimate Revisions on an UptrendUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism on a stock’s prospect. GATX scores impressively on this front too.

286,EXPD,"Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report) have declined 20.2% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decrease of 12.5%. Reasons Behind the PlungeSouthwest Airlines has been grappling with numerous challenges right from the onset of 2018. It all started with the winter storm Grayson in January, causing multiple flight cancellations and hurting the company’s top line. The destruction continued unabated with successive nor’easters striking in March, further dampening the situation. The storms resulted in huge revenue loss for the company.The adverse effects were partly witnessed in first-quarter results wherein the low-cost carrier reported lower-than-expected revenues. Also, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) slid in the period.Also, a tragic incident of April resulted in large-scale dissatisfaction among the customers as the carrier made an emergency landing at the Philadelphia International Airport due to an engine failure. Consequently, one of the passengers died while seven others were injured.Southwest Airlines has been struggling with low bookings ever since this fatal incident. In fact, the carrier provided a bearish view on unit revenues for the second quarter due to the same reason. It expects revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) to decline between 1% and 3%. Also, last month’s traffic results were affected by the incident. Traffic slipped 0.3% while capacity expanded 1.5%. As traffic contracted and capacity increased, load factor deteriorated 150 basis points.What's worse is that the impact from the incident is likely to linger for quite some time and recovery of the lost revenues might be a slow process.Similar incidents have happened this May too. Earlier in the month, the carrier made an abrupt landing when one of its window panes broke.  Adding to its woes, another Southwest Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing a few days ago due to pressurization issue, causing massive panic among its passengers.The successive flight horrors will possibly add to the airline’s already low demand, thereby denting profitability and revenues.Another issue having engulfed the entire airline industry of late is the rising fuel costs. The high fuel costs are anticipated to hurt Southwest Airlines' bottom line in the second quarter. Notably, economic fuel costs are projected at $2.20 per gallon, much higher than the year-ago figure.Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

287,EXPD,"Copa Holdings, S.A.’s (CPA  -  Free Report) increase in air traffic for April can be attributed to solid demand for air travel, courtesy of the improving Latin American economy.About the Report Traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), came in at 1.71 billion up 11.9% from the year-ago figure. On a year-over-year basis, consolidated capacity (or available seat miles/ASMs) improved 12.1% to 2.09 billion.  With capacity expansion outweighing traffic growth, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) declined in the month. The reduction in this key metric was to the tune of 10 basis points (bps) to 81.9%. However, on a year-to-date basis, load factor improved 110 bps to 82.7% as capacity expansion (9.3%) was outpaced by 10.8% traffic growth.We remind investors that strong demand for air travel had contributed to fellow Latin American carrier, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A.’s (GOL  -  Free Report), April traffic figures as well.Robust Demand Behind Copa Holdings' Impressive Q1Impressive demand for air travel also aided this leading Latin American carrier’s first-quarter 2018 results, revealed last week. Copa Holdings’ earnings per share of $3.22 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78. The bottom-line figure surged 32.5% on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly revenues too increased 15.9% year over year to $715 million and outpaced the consensus mark of $692 million.The year-over-year improvement in the top line was primarily owing to 16.3% growth in passenger revenues. While passenger unit revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) climbed 7.2%, yield per passenger mile improved 5.3%. Passenger traffic (on a consolidated basis) rose 10.4% and capacity was up 8.4% in first-quarter 2018. Load factor expanded 150 basis points to 83% as traffic growth outweighed capacity increase.Additionally, unit revenue per available seat mile (RASM) improved 7.2%. This apart, operating cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, increased 1.1% in the reported quarter. The metric, including fuel costs, was up 5.6%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCopa Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

288,EXPD,"Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.’s (EXPD  -  Free Report) impressive first-quarter 2018 results and the subsequent dividend hike seem to have favored its stock. Evidently, the company scaled to a 52-week high of $73.04 on May 11, before retracing a bit to close the session at $72.35.Also, shares of the company have rallied 22.7% in the last six months, comfortably outperforming its industry’s gain of 11.5%. Catalysts Behind the UpsurgeLast week, Expeditors reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. The highlight of the report was a 20% year-over-year increase in revenues. Growth was witnessed across all major divisions of the company.Volumes of both Airfreight tonnage and ocean container were up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Gross profit increased 21% year over year to $635.84 million in the first quarter of 2018. The earnings report impacted the stock positively. As a result, shares of Expeditors have gained 4% since the earnings release on May 8.This apart, the stock’s outperformance was backed by the 7.1% hike in semi-annual cash dividend announced a day after the earnings release. Following the raise, the dividend increased to 45 cents per share (annualized 90 cents per share), of which, the first instalment will be payable Jun 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 1.Furthermore, this Seattle, WA-based company has been a beneficiary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. As a result of the tax reform, the company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter was 31.3% compared with 37.3% in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the hike in the dividend payout is a result of the savings induced by the new tax law.A Broker FavoriteWe note that earnings estimates for Expeditors have exhibited a healthy uptrend. Over the last seven days, the stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings being revised 8.8% upward. Likewise, the same for current-year earnings has witnessed an upward revision to the tune of 4.9% in the same time period.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Other Positive MetricsExpeditors’trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Not only has the company’s ROE of 24.8% displayed an upward trend over the past year, it compares favorably with ROE of 17.8% for its industry and 16.6% for the S&P 500 index. This reflects the fact that the company is efficient in using shareholders’ funds.Taking into account the above-mentioned tailwinds and the favorable readings, we believe that the current price represents an attractive entry point for investors. The carrier’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) also supports our view.

289,EXPD,"The first-quarter earnings season is well into its latter half with more than 81% of the S&P 500 members having unveiled their quarterly results already. The picture that has emerged so far is quite encouraging and the Q1 earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note, displaying substantial growth.According to our latest Earnings Preview, total earnings and revenues for companies in the S&P 500 space are projected to expand 23.2% and 8.7%, on a year-over-year basis. Both figures compare favorably with the readings in Q4, when bottom line expanded 13.4% and revenues grew 8.1%. The bullish Q1 projection can be attributed to factors like the corporate tax overhaul apart from an improving economy and a much-improved job market.Given the prevalent healthy scenario, it is quite natural that the sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, all the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end Q1 with year-over-year earnings growth. Moreover, 13 are anticipated to display double-digit earnings growth.One of the13 sectors is Transportation. Majority of the sector participants, including all S&P 500 members, have already reported financial numbers. Despite high fuel costs, the sector has seen key players like Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) reporting better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues.Outperformers Still Left in the BankWith most transportation players having already unveiled their Q1 numbers, only a handful reports from the space are still to come. Most of those companies belong to the shipping space. In fact, the scenario surrounding shippers is quite positive in view of the surge in the Baltic Dry Index (a gauge of the shipping costs of raw materials such as iron ore, coal and grain) recently.How to Pick the Winners?Given the bullish sentiment surrounding shipping stocks, it would not be a bad idea to add companies from the space, which have the potential of reporting better-than-expected earnings in Q1, to one’s portfolio. An earnings beat more often than not boosts investor confidence in the stocks, which translates into rapid price appreciation.However, given the high degree of diversity in the shipping space, the task is by no means easy. In fact, it is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology -- Earnings ESP -- makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.
