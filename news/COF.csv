11,COF,"The Federal Reserve late Thursday released annual stress-test guidelines that will test more big banks and pit the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) against a tougher economic obstacle course than last year.X But the new rules shouldn't affect the thing that Wall Street tends to care most about when the exam results come out in June; the buyback and dividend payouts that the banks typically announce after they pass the tests, an analyst said.The GOP's new tax legislation should be ""a beneficial offset"" in the Fed's annual evaluation of banks' abilities to lend to households and businesses if the economy implodes, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.The banks' pre-provision net revenue — or revenue before factoring for the money set aside to cover losses — should also ""start at a higher point,"" he added.""In the end, our current expectations for capital return are not changing despite more severe stress scenarios,"" Kleinhanzl wrote.Each year, the Fed's stress tests lays out three economic scenarios, each with different degrees of severity, that the banks have to prove they have the capital cushion to navigate.The harshest scenario this year, what the Fed calls the ""severely adverse"" scenario, envisions a severe global recession, with U.S. unemployment rate rising by nearly 6 percentage points to 10% by the third quarter of next year. That rise is a bit more than the roughly 5.25 percentage-point increase, still to 10%, in last year's scenario.And by that time, under this year's scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak, compared to 6.5% last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's tests outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Housing and commercial real estate prices would also slide. ""Severe recessions"" would trample the eurozone, the U.K. and Japan.Also, the severe test would include ""a global aversion to long-term fixed-income assets."" As a result, the Fed said, long-term rates would not fall and yield curves would steepen.The Fed said it's dialed up the bleakness in this year's tests because it wanted a ""test of the resilience of large firms when current economic conditions are especially strong.""JPMorgan shares were down 2.2% in the stock market today. Bank of America was off 1.7%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) fell 4.5% and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost 3.4%. Citigroup (C) eased 2.75% and Wells Fargo (WFC) lost 2.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The annual grading of the banks' resilience in a crisis features two parts. First, the Dodd-Frank Act stress test shows how banks' capital would hold up under the different economic scenarios. The second, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), evaluates the banks' capital planning procedures and capital adequacy, and looks at their plans for rewarding investors with dividends and buybacks.The banks have until April 5 to submit their capital plans to the Fed. Results will be announced by June 30.Last year, all 34 banks subject to the tests passed. And the banks have gotten used to the grading process. A flood of press releases from the banks, announcing dividends and buybacks, tends to follow once they pass the second and final round of the tests.This year, 38 banks total will be tested. The Fed for the first time will also test five foreign companies with U.S. operations.The Trump administration's tax reform has mangled the buyback plans of some of the companies subject to the tests this year. American Express (AXP) said it would suspend its buyback plans for the first half of the year due to a one-time hit to profits caused by the legislation.Capital One Financial (COF) also said it would cut its buyback offering nearly in half due to a similar charge.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Beat; Wells Fargo MixedGoldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Trading Lags Peers

That was down from a 3.2% gain in the third quarter and below economist consensus views for a 2.9% advance. Consumer spending surged 3.8%, a big jump above the third quarter's 2.2% estimate, and beating forecasts for a 3.6% gain.December durable goods orders were better than expected, up 2.9%, nearly doubling November's 1.7% increase and clobbering expectations for a 0.6% rise. Transportation was the primary factor in the beat — minus transport goods, orders rose 0.6% for the month, well above November's 0.3% rise and in line with expectations.Intel powered ahead almost 7% — leading the Dow and the Nasdaq 100 — on the heels of its fourth-quarter report, a clean beat that included a dividend increase and an upgraded outlook. The stock has been struggling since news of security lapses affected nearly all of its products made over the past five years.

The stock has been fighting to hold support at its 10-week moving average.Leading chip developer Maxim Integrated jumped almost 2% after a late-Thursday report showing in line earnings and revenue for its fiscal second quarter, but third quarter guidance that topped consensus views.

14,COF,"Capital One Financial (COF) on Tuesday said it nearly halved its share buyback program due a $1.9 billion charge it expects to book from the GOP's tax-cut bill signed into law this month.X The credit-card and loan giant said it had slashed share repurchases to a maximum of $1 billion for the yearlong period that ends on June 30 of next year. In June, Capital One said it had OK'd up to $1.85 billion in share buybacks over that time. It expects to maintain its quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share.The announcement makes the company the latest financial giant to forecast a short-term hit to profit due to the tax cuts, which will lower the value of banks' so-called deferred tax assets.Those assets can accrue when a company takes a loss, and are used to ease a company's tax burden. Some banks took big losses during the financial crisis and recession, and racked up those assets when taxes were higher.Bank of America (BAC) this month said it expects the tax cuts to result in a $3 billion hit to profits in the fourth quarter. Earlier this month, before tax reform was passed, Citigroup (C) also said it expected to take a $20 billion hit to earnings due to the write-down of deferred tax assets that would come from the tax cut bill.Still, the tax reform is expected to benefit banks longer-term, and shares of other large companies have rallied in recent months on expectations that cutting the corporate tax rate to 21% will result in dividend hikes, stock repurchases and acquisition deals that offer shareholders hefty premiums.Capital One was down 0.6% at 99.92 on the stock market today, but still above buying territory. Citigroup fell 0.9%, Bank of America dipped 0.3%, JPMorgan (JPM) lost 0.4%, and Wells Fargo (WFC), which is seen as the biggest beneficiary of the corporate tax cuts, eased 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Capital One said the $1.9 billion charge, taken against the company's profits, came largely due to a write-down of its deferred tax assets that the company will book due to the tax cuts, which will lower the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. A one-time tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings also weighed on the company.The plan to cut its buyback came in a regulatory filing, in which the company said it had resubmitted its capital plan to the Fed to address weaknesses in its capital planning process.Citigroup hasn't said if it's plans to return capital to shareholders will be affected, but Bank of America this month said it actually would buy back an extra $5 billion in stock by June 30 of next year. It said earlier that it would repurchase $12 billion.RELATED:Banks And Financial Stock NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors.

Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%.

But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 42 cents on sales of $37.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ford is buying mobility startups Autonomic and TransLoc.

TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines. Fiscal Q1 earnings per share jumped 95% at TD Ameritrade as revenue expanded 46% to $1.26 billion. It sees full-year earnings of  $2.55-$3.05 excluding items, vs. expectations for $2.69.

16,COF,"Robinhood trained its sights at crypto trading app Coinbase as well as the likes of TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) Thursday with the move to let investors buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum for no extra fee.X But Bitcoin and crypto-related stocks retreated broadly on the news that some of the largest banks are cracking down on credit-card purchases of these volatile virtual assets, as well as signs that the Securities and Exchange Commission may seek to regulate sales of new digital tokens, known as initial coin offerings or ICOs.Here is the latest on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news and trends:Robinhood, the millennial- and smartphone-friendly app for trading stocks, will allow customers in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire to trade cryptocurrencies for no commission fee starting in February.The zero fee compares with reported 0.5% to 4% fees on Coinbase, a popular crypto-focused trading app.But Robinhood is already offering certain crypto services to all customers. Starting today, its customers can monitor market data and create custom price alerts for 16 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple.Announcing Robinhood Crypto, the company said it will allow users to invest commission-free in cryptocurrencies alongside stocks and ETFs, billing itself the first major online brokerage to support cryptocurrency trading.""We believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to fundamentally reorganize the way money works from the ground up, putting power previously held by financial institutions directly in the hands of the people,"" the company said.The ability to trade Bitcoin on the Robinhood platform will take place in stages across U.S. states. The later debut of trading is ""to add a level of predictability to the market and not catch the market by surprise, like others have done,"" it added.Robinhood has more than 3 million users and has seen more than $100 billion in transactions on its platform.Brokers such as Interactive Brokers (IBKR), TD Ameritrade and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) allow clients to trade Bitcoin futures, but not the digital currencies themselves. Other brokers such as Ally Financial (ALLY) and Schwab have considered a move to enable Bitcoin futures trading or are watching the space.More than 100,000 people lined up for early access within hours of the unveiling of the Robinhood Crypto website.Bitcoin traded 1.1% lower at $11,277.95 on Coindesk Thursday, off intraday lows. Ethereum was up 1.7% at $1,075.51, and Bitcoin Cash rose 1.6% to $1,663.11.Among Bitcoin-related equities, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) closed down 6.9% on the stock market today, Long Blockchain (LBCC) gave up 7.2%, Overstock.com (OSTK) fell 6.5%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) dipped 0.3%, while Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: It is crucial for investors to understand the difference between cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the blockchain software programs that enable them. It is also important to get a feel for just how speculative digital moneys like Bitcoin are right now before investing directly in the currencies or through related exchange traded funds or stocks.The broad crypto decline came as The Wall Street Journal reported that banks such as Capital One Financial (COF) have begun restricting customers' purchases of Bitcoin through its credit cards ""due to the limited mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss and volatility.""Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), which allow Bitcoin trades with their credit cards, are said to be reviewing their policies.Meanwhile, Wall Street's watchdog has said it wants to bring ICOs under its authority.""The SEC is devoting a significant portion of its resources to the ICO market,"" commission Chairman Jay Clayton, and J.

17,COF,"American Express (AXP) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter results that topped views, but the credit-card giant said it would suspend its share buybacks for the first half of this year due to a big, one-time hit it took to profits due to the GOP's new tax legislation.The plans to halt those repurchases, which have helped boost AmEx's per-share profits, come as other big financial companies weather the short-term storm the tax bill has dumped on their profits, even though analysts and investors anticipate longer-term benefits from the law and an improving economy. Rival credit-card company Capital One Financial (COF) last month said it would chop its buyback program nearly in half due to a charge similar to the one absorbed by AmEx.""The upfront charge triggered by the Tax Act reduced our capital ratios and, as a result, while we will be continuing our quarterly dividends at the current level, we plan to suspend our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital,"" American Express said in a statement on Thursday.AmEx said that the $2.6 billion charge was based on its ""current estimate"" of taxes on foreign earnings and the reduced value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, whose value will get cut along with the cut in the corporate tax rate to 21%. Companies can take on those assets in the event of a loss and use them to ease their tax burden.Earlier this month, American Express said its Q4 earnings would be reduced by around $2.4 billion due to the temporary disarray caused by the tax bill.""The new law makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and it will take time to interpret the changes,"" the company said in a regulatory filing on Jan. 3, and it forecast ""significant impacts"" to ""future periods"" beyond 2017. American Express also said its full-year EPS would come up short of its forecast for $5.80-$5.90.American Express on Thursday said it expected an effective U.S. tax rate of roughly 22% this year, before discrete items. And the company forecast earnings per share this year of $6.90-$7.30, above Zacks estimates for $6.83.For the fourth quarter, the company reported EPS of $1.58, above views for $1.54, as revenue rose 10% to $8.839 billion, topping estimates for $8.72 billion.Shares fell 2.6% to 97.40 after-hours in the stock market today after closing down 0.9%. Shares hit a record 102.38 on Tuesday. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), which both report earnings on Feb. 1, closed up 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. American Express and Visa are both Dow industrial components.As with other businesses, AmEx on Thursday said it believed the tax reform would be good for it and the U.S. economy. The company said it expected to invest as much as $200 million more this year than initially planned for ""customer-facing growth initiatives.""Nomura-Instinet analyst Bill Carcache this month wrote that AmEx's one-time charge could dent a key capital ratio for the company, temporarily threatening the share buyback program that has boosted its earnings. He wrote that a suspension of the buybacks in the first half of this year ""appears likely,"" but that it could replenish the capital within a couple of quarters if it did so.What's more, Zacks analysts say, AmEx's rewards expenses rose through much of last year, due in part to efforts to make its platinum cards more attractive and push its co-branded card with Delta Air Lines (DAL).Still, Zacks was looking for AmEx's sales to rebound from the loss in 2016 of Costco Wholesale (COST), one of its largest card customers. And the firm cites the company's attempts to cut costs and prospects abroad.The earnings from the credit-card companies will follow results from the nation's largest banks, some of which issue credit cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. The banks' results can sometimes offer a look at what might be in store for the credit-card companies.Mizuho payments analyst Thomas McCrohan said results from JPMorgan (JPM), which showed a pickup in credit card sales volumes, had ""positive implications"" for Visa.In a separate note, he also said that Citigroup's results could be viewed as ""in line to slightly positive for Mastercard given it is Citigroup's primary card network.""He added that ""these results also have implications for Visa since Citigroup is the issuing bank for the Costco (COST) portfolio, which Visa recently won.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Goldman Sachs Weighs In On Cryptocurrencies As Trading Lags PeersInvestment Pros Like These U.S. Stocks In 2018Breakout Watch: This 2015 IPO Is Testing A New Buy Zone

18,COF,"Morgan Stanley (MS) said it will take a roughly $1.25 billion hit to earnings in the fourth quarter, becoming the latest bank to detail how profit will be hurt in the near term by the U.S. tax overhaul driven by President Donald Trump.X The drag on net income consists of a charge of about $1.4 billion, primarily from writing down its U.S. deferred tax assets, the company said in a filing Friday. That's being offset by a gain of about $160 million related to a multiyear tax examination. The estimated tax provision is based on assumptions made by the firm and may change as it receives additional clarification, it said.Trump last month signed into law Congressional Republicans' tax overhaul, his first major legislative victory. The move slashes the corporate-tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, a cut that could benefit some banks. The plan also offers some temporary breaks for other types of businesses and individuals.While banks will benefit from the lower rate, the new law requires charges in the near-term as foreign earnings face taxation and the value of deferred tax assets declines. Goldman Sachs (GS) revealed last week that its earnings would be crimped by about $5 billion, mostly from the repatriation tax, while Bank of America (BAC) announced a $3 billion charge.Citigroup (C) has said it expects a hit of as much as $20 billion, mostly from writing down its DTAs. That was under an earlier version of the plan. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Capital One Financial (COF) have warned that tax changes could hit their earnings.

The company had announced late Thursday that a treatment of Revlimid plus rituximab for a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma had failed in a phase 3 trial. Celgene shares have been attempting to reclaim support at their 10-week moving average, after a steep four-week sell-off in October.Shake Shack (SHAK) dropped 3% in early action.

20,COF,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

21,COF,"The Supreme Court next year will hear arguments for a case in which 11 states accused American Express (AXP) of harming competition by barring businesses from encouraging customers to buy things with rival credit cards that charge merchants lower fees.XThe court's decision comes ahead of the card issuer's third-quarter earnings, which are set for Wednesday. The matter could be a subject for discussion during the company's earnings call.Shares of AmEx finished 1% lower at 91.96 in the stock market today but remain extended above their buy zone. Visa (V) dipped 0.3% and Mastercard (MA) lost 0.8%, while Discover Financial Services (DFS) rose 2.3% and Capital One Financial (COF) added 1.8%.The hearing would take place several years after the U.S. and a coalition of states first sued American Express, Visa and Mastercard over those actions.In 2010, the states and the government alleged in a lawsuit that the credit-card companies' ""anti-steering"" rules restricted trade. Those anti-steering rules prevent merchants from pushing customers toward using lower-fee cards when the businesses agreed to take the bigger cards.Visa and Mastercard agreed to end their anti-steering arrangements. AmEx, at that time, didn't.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.A district court later found the anti-steering rules hurt competition.  An appeals court last year overturned that ruling.Meanwhile, AmEx reports quarterly results on Wednesday, and Wall Street expects EPS to jump 19% to $1.48 on revenue of $8.32 billion, up 7%.The results come as the card industry tries to entice wealthier, younger consumers with premium cards such as American Express Platinum.RELATED:American Express Earns Relative Strength Rating Upgrade; Hits Key BenchmarkShopping Around For A Luxury Credit Card?

24,COF,"Heat continues to mount on credit reporting agency Equifax (EFX), which last week disclosed a massive breach in which hackers stole the personal identification information of as many as 143 million consumers.XOn Thursday, an open-source software organization said that it had publicly posted a patch for the vulnerability that hackers used to access Equifax data about two months before the hack, but that apparently Equifax did not install the patch before the breach took place, if it ever did.Separately on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating the data breach. In addition, several congressional bills were filed that would hold Equifax and other data brokers accountable for such errors. And on Friday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she and other senators will introduce a bill to require credit bureaus to let consumers freeze their credit for free, according to Reuters news service. Some credit agencies charge around $5.A credit freeze blocks criminals from setting up bogus accounts whose purchases get charged to victims.The open-source software organization, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), told IBD that it posted a patch for the vulnerability known as CVE-2017-5638 in the Apache Struts program on March 7.Equifax identified that as the vulnerability that hackers used. But the hack did not take place until mid-May through July, Equifax has said. Equifax realized it had been breached on July 29. Equifax disclosed the breach on Sept. 7.ASF suggested that an organization such as Equifax is presumed to be aware of such postings, but ASF does not know what if anything Equifax did know about the patch. It said that Equifax is not a customer of ASF and that ASF has no one-on-one relationship with Equifax.ASF spokeswoman Sally Khudairi told IBD by email: ""The Apache Software Foundation provides Open Source software that is freely available to all at no cost or restriction on its use. Those who wish to use our software projects simply download the projects from apache.org and/or one of many globally-distributed mirror sites.""Khudairi added: ""Any risks, along with patches, are announced and widely shared with Apache project communities. In addition, security vulnerabilities or exploits are disseminated on sites such as NIST (U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology) as well as dozens (if not hundreds) of software providers and security specialists (such as MITRE and Symantec).""Further, Khudairi said, ""As with all Apache software, patches are made available to the public at large. Financial services organizations are often known for being highly aware of security vulnerabilities in general, and are therefore particularly vigilant with their processes for patching any known exploits.""Equifax has not yet responded to IBD questions concerning the patch.ASF oversees more than 350 leading open source projects, including Apache HTTP Server — which it calls the world's most popular web-server software. ASF is a not-for-profit charitable organization, whose sponsors include high-profile corporations such as Capital One (COF), Comcast (CMCSA), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT), Target (TGT) and Yahoo.Any entity can use ASF's software, even if they are not a sponsor. Equifax is not a sponsor.No one using the ""@equifax"" domain has communicated via email with ASF for almost two years, Khudairi says. ASF can't tell if an Equifax person communicated with ASF using a personal email address.On Sept. 8, the day after disclosing the breach, Equifax stock gapped down 14%. In the stock market today, its shares were trading near 91.40, down 37% from its 52-week high reached July 26.Shares in Symantec (SYMC), which owns credit monitoring service LifeLock, broke out above a 33.32 buy point in an irregular base Tuesday. It dipped below the buy point the next two days but rose back above it Friday. The stock ranks fourth in IBD's computer software security group, according to IBD's Stock Checkup. The industry group's ranking has risen to 60 from 177 three weeks ago. IBD tracks 197 industry groups.RELATED:Should You Join Lawsuits Mushrooming Against Equifax?Bogus Online Transactions Are Up In Wake Of Equifax BreachWhat You Should Do Now To Protect Yourself From The Equifax Data Breach

"
28,COF,"Dow Jones industrial average components American Express (AXP) and Visa (V) report quarterly earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.XMeanwhile, Capital One Financial (COF) and Alliance Data Systems (ADS) report on Thursday.The results come as shares of those credit card giants and others in the payments space flirt with buy zones.Here's a look at what to expect:Estimates: Fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of 81 cents, a 17% increase, on revenue of $4.361 billion, a 20% jump, according to Zacks Investment Research.Stock: Visa cleared a 96.70 flat-base buy point on Friday, hitting a record high and closing at 96.93.Shares edged down 0.1% to 96.83 Monday stock market trading. Rival Mastercard (MA), which reports second-quarter earnings on July 27, was holding above 126.29 buy point, dipping rising 0.3% to 127.42. Mastercard also broke out of a flat base on Friday.Even though weak loan growth in a cautious business environment, a tamer forecast for net interest income, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's rant about ""the stupid s**t we have to deal with in this country"" became the main take-aways from JPMorgan's second-quarter earnings on Friday, the bank's credit card sales volumes remained solid. That figure rose 15.3% for Q2, better than in Q1.""We view JPMorgan's results as having positive implications for Visa, as JPM is Visa's largest issuer,"" Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan wrote in a research note on Friday.And amid a fight between banks for the biggest spenders, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake on Friday also said the ""extraordinary success"" of the bank's Chase Sapphire Reserve card — which carries the Visa label and is jammed with perks intended to draw a  wealthier, younger consumer — has been a major accelerant in card revenue.""I always feel compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers,"" she said. ""Their characteristics, their engagement, their spend — these are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. We now have them and we intend to deepen relationships with them.""Visa also stands to benefit from being the sole credit card provider for Costco (COST), a relationship that came at American Express' expense. Its acquisition last year of Visa Europe, growing support of digital payments and its forays into nations where many people still pay largely in cash are also seen working in the company's favor.But more exposure internationally means the company's revenues risk taking a hit from a stronger dollar. Rising client incentives also threaten revenue, Zacks said.Visa and other card investors should pay attention to Bank of America (BAC) earnings Tuesday, for more insight into credit card trends.Estimates: Second-quarter EPS is expected to plunge 43% to $1.47, with revenue dipping 1% to $8.154 billion.Stock: Shares dipped 0.1% to 85.23 on Monday. The stock is still within range of an 82.10 buy point of a flat base cleared nearly a month ago.American Express' breakup with Costco last year, along with a less-friendly foreign-exchange translation and higher provisions for losses are likely to weigh on revenue and margins this year, Zacks said.""Costco used to be a major acquisition channel for American Express' U.S. consumer and small business areas,"" Zacks said. ""Though the company replaced all the volume it used to derive through the Costco channel with other proprietary channels and other products, the adverse impact of the loss of the partnership should continue for next few quarters.""But like Visa, AmEx is also poised to grow as more people use electronic payments and as countries outside the U.S. adopt credit cards. The company has also tried to compete with the Chase Sapphire Reserve by adding its own sweeteners to its high-end Platinum Card.Meanwhile, Capital One is expected to report an 8% EPS gain to $1.90, with revenue up 6.5% to $6.67 billion. But Capital One has missed earnings estimates in four of the last five quarters, including the last two. Revenue has been below views in the last two quarters. The stock is trading between its 200-day and 50-day moving averages as it tries to build a new base. Capital One stock fell 0.4% Monday.Alliance Data Systems, which manages private-label credit cards for retailers and other businesses, is slated to boost per-share profit by 6% to $3.47, with revenue up 5% to $1.837 billion. Shares fell 0.9% to 261.85 Monday. That stock peeked out past a 264.56 buy point from a cup-with-handle base on Thursday, then dipped back below that entry on Friday.RELATED:2 Key Financial Stocks Break Out While Bank Giants Sell OffThis Hot Payment Stock Flirts With Breakout As 3 Peers Forge Buy Points

33,COF,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were among the nation's biggest banks that got the OK from the Federal Reserve to hike shareholder returns, the second round of the central bank's annual stress tests showed Wednesday.X All 34 banks tested were cleared to do so, but the Fed had reservations about Capital One (COF), which got a conditional pass. The credit card company and American Express (AXP) had to adjust their plans to pass muster.After the test results, banks started announcing richer payouts:The Fed said that it is requiring Capital One to ""to address weaknesses observed in the firm's capital planning practices."" Capital One has until Dec. 28 to resubmit its capital plan.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs released a statement saying the Fed did not object to its capital plan, but the bank did not provide specific figures for shareholder returns.""We are well positioned to continue to return capital to our shareholders while expanding our client franchise,"" CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in the statement.Other lenders delivering more capital to shareholders:Shares of JPMorgan rallied 2% late after closing up 2% at 89.82 on the stock market today, breaking out past an 89.23 buy point in a double-bottom base. Bank of America rose 1.4% late after finishing up 2.6% at 23.88, resurfacing above its 50-day average and approaching a 25.90 conventional buy point as well as an alternate 24.45 aggressive buy point.Morgan Stanley rose 1.3% late adding to its 0.2% gain to 44.32, still below a 46.08 entry. Citigroup surged 2.3% late, after rising 1.5% earlier. Wells Fargo added 1.4% to its 2.2% gain at the close, while Goldman Sachs edged up 1.2% late, on top of its 1.3% regular-session uptick.IBD'S TAKE: The stress-test results could give bank stocks a jolt after they've been idling in recent months in anticipation of tax reform and regulatory cuts from President Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. The second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, evaluates the quality of a bank's risk management and capital planning procedures and determines how much lenders can pay out to shareholders. Banks will likely begin announcing their dividend and buyback plans shortly after the Fed releases the CCAR results.The results come after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered a bold vote of confidence for banks Tuesday, saying another financial crisis like the kind seen in 2008 is unlikely ""in our lifetime.""""I think the public can see the capital positions of the major banks are very much stronger this year,"" Yellen said at a conference in London, noting that regulators are more proactive in detecting threats to financial stability than they were a decade ago.The Fed's confidence in the financial system could mean banks may see some relief in the future from the crisis-era measures designed to ensure stability — or at the very least, they may not face tougher rules. But this year's test results are based on economic scenarios the Fed outlined in February.The CCAR test also contains a quantitative portion as well as a qualitative portion, which looks at a bank's internal quality controls. Twenty-one smaller banks this year, however, were exempted from the qualitative part of the CCAR test.The Fed said Wednesday that most of the 13 banks subject to the qualitative portion this year ""have continued to strengthen their capital planning practices since last year."" But it also said that some banks, despite improvements, ""continue to have areas of weaknesses that fall short of meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.""Citigroup in 2014 failed the qualitative portion, and in recent years Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs received ""conditional passes"" and had to resubmit their capital plans. But banks have largely gotten used to the stress tests since they were first instituted in the wake of the financial crisis.They could become easier as the Trump administration looks to shred big parts of Dodd-Frank financial regulations and fill open positions at the Fed and regulatory agencies.The Fed over the years has tried to balance banks' demands for more testing transparency and its efforts to make the tests matter. The Fed worries that giving banks too much information would make the tests too easy to pass.Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, also floated the idea of requiring fewer banks to take the tests.""We believe that future stress tests will also become easier, and the possibility of banks being exempted from the process or not having qualitative reviews for all banks remains open and possible,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note dated Friday.RELATED:Here Is The Latest Bank To Warn On Q2 Trading RevenueHere's Why Bank Stocks Broke Key Support, Sinking Dow

35,COF,"Drugmakers and financial services firms look like attractive investments after years of being beaten down, said Charles Pohl, a manager of the Dodge & Cox Balanced Fund (DODBX), during a panel session Thursday at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago.Financial services are the $15.8 billion mutual fund's largest sector, with 29% of shareholder money as of March 31.That mutual fund is exposed to foreign financials, including ADRs of Netherlands-based Aegon (AEG), which provides insurance, pension and asset management. It also hold bonds from the U.K.'s Barclays (BCS), which provides banking and other financial services, as well as France's BNP Paribas.Still, the fund's financial services exposure is mainly U.S. based, though those holdings do business globally. The fund's top four holdings are U.S. stocks Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Capital One Financial (COF).In the panel discussion occurring on the conference's first full day, Pohl said rising rates in the U.S. are a tailwind. So are gradually easing regulatory burdens abroad.Noriko Chen, a manager of $63.3 billion American Funds New Perspective (ANWPX), agreed, pointing out that political pressures beating down on financials globally have created buying opportunities.Swiss-based insurer Chubb (CB) is a top-25 holding. So is Hong Kong-based AIA Group, which provides life insurance and other financial services.An aging population is a key factor in making pharmaceutical companies attractive.Among pharmaceuticals, ADRs of France's Sanofi (SNY) and Switzerland's Novartis (NVS) are in the top 10 of Pohl's fund. Britain and Sweden's AstraZeneca (AZN) is also a holding.Chen said she also likes certain state-owned enterprises (SOEs) whose home-country governments mandate that the firms pay relatively hefty dividends. Some of those dividend yields in China and Brazil are 25% or higher, she said.Forty-two percent of her fund's assets are foreign stocks. Fourteen percent are domiciled in the Asia/Pacific region.Panelist Amit Wadhwaney of Moerus Capital Management, another value-oriented investor, said he likes British-based Coats Group, the world's largest manufacturer of thread. He likes its pricing power and elastic demand. Shares have climbed 113% the past 12 months vs. 14% for the S&P 500.His firm's taste for stocks with strength and staying power is reflected in its name, the first word of which is a Latin reference to a city's defensive walls. He manages the young and tiny $21.4 million Moerus Worldwide Value Fund (MOWIX).RELATED:What's Going On At The Morningstar Conference

The announcement comes just ahead of Sunday's first round of presidential elections in France, which are seen by many as a de facto vote on whether the country could also exit the European Union.In London, the blue chip FTSE 100 dived 2.1%, while the CAC-40 in Paris was down 1.4% and Frankfurt's DAX was off 0.8% in afternoon trade.Earnings news rolled out in big bites late Monday and early Tuesday. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was down nearly 3%. Harley Davidson (HOG) dropped more than 4%.Goldman Sachs (GS) sank 3.5% after its first-quarter results missed views on both the revenue and earnings lines. Management raised the quarterly dividend to 75 cents, from 65 cents. The stock has been consolidating since early March but is now at the lowest level since Nov. 30.Bank of America (BAC) edged up 0.4% after squarely beating first-quarter performance targets. Earnings rose 46%, revenue climbed 7%, and total expenses were flat.  The stock has been consolidating and below its 10-week line since mid-March.United Airlines (UAL) scratched out a 1.2% gain. Late Monday, the carrier reported first-quarter earnings down 67%, less than expected, and an above-forecast 3% revenue gain. The company projects passenger revenue per available seat mile up 1%-3% in the second quarter. Shares are rising from support at the 50-day moving average.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) racked up a 1% advance at the open. The health insurer reported a surprise 31% surge in first-quarter earnings and a 9% revenue gain, and raised its full-year guidance to above consensus targets. Shares ended Monday's session below a 172.24 buy point in a flat base.Netflix (NFLX) fell 1% at the open following its first-quarter report late Monday. Earnings soared 567%, topping analyst expectations, while 35% revenue growth met views. But the company added 4.95 million streaming video subscribers during the quarter, below the consensus projection for 5.27 million new sets of eyeballs. Netflix has been finding support along its 10-week moving average since mid-February.Sporting goods retailer Cabela's (CAB) reeled in an 7% gain at the open after constructing a deal in which Capital One Financial (COF) will buy its credit card business and Synovus Financial (SNV) will buy Cabela's $1.2 billion in bank deposits.

37,COF,"Lower Treasury yields Friday pressured most financials, including Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS) and American Express (AXP).But Visa (V), the second-best performer on the Dow industrials this year, rose to a fresh all-time high Friday. Its archrival Mastercard (MA) also reached record levels and its stock is still within buy range.The 10-year yield fell below 2.5% intraday, resuming their retreat following the Fed's rate hike on Wednesday, as policymakers did not signal faster tightening ahead.Rates on mortgages and the value of other types of credit are tied in with those yields. The yields also serve as a window into investors' expectations for higher prices in the future — potentially prompting the Fed to raise the benchmark interest rate, which, in turn, can help banks' finances as banks hike their own interest rates and other costs to compensate.Visa rose 0.2% to 90.21 in the stock market today, hitting a fresh all-time high of 90.63  intraday. The stock has been tailing upward since the beginning of the year, logging a 16% gain since Dec. 30.Mastercard climbed 0.1% to 112.83, wthin range of a 109.03 buy point of a flat base initially cleared in mid-January. Mastercard sold off at the end of the month, closing below its 50-day line on Feb. 1. But the stock rebounded, retaking its still-value 109.03 buy point and marching on to new highs.Visa has been gaining on a variety of factors. Among them: stronger consumer optimism, the acquisition of Visa Europe, and the potential in cross-border and electronic payments.Visa and Mastercard, while known for their credit cards, are not technically card issuers. They make money on transaction fees, and aren't directly affected by interest rate shifts. Issuing banks, such as JPMorgan Chase,  Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), actually carry the balances.IBD'S TAKE: Banks and financials have been among the biggest Trump plays this year, on hopes for a combination of fewer regulations and higher interest rates. Steel stocks, potential beneficiaries of Trump's plans for a massive infrastructure investment, are among the others. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.05%, Bank of America 1.4%, Citigroup 1.3% and Wells Fargo 1.1%.Goldman Sachs and fellow investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, both closing just above their 50-day lines.The Dow's American Express, which does issue cards directly and carry the balances, trickled 0.65% lower. Capital One (COF), which also issues cards, fell 2.2%, undercutting its 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Nike, Visa Among Dow's Top 5 Gainers So Far This YearDow Stock American Express Ups Ante In High-Fee, High-End Card Race

38,COF,"The stock market may be up, but Americans' confidence in their ability to afford a comfortable retirement is down in comparison to each of the past two years. That lack of confidence often stems from a lack of progress in building — or even starting — a retirement nest egg. But Yvette Butler, president of brokerage Capital One Investing, recommends three simple and practical steps to break any logjam that's keeping you from building your retirement savings.And the problem is real. More than one-third — 38% — of Americans don't feel confident that they are saving enough to retire comfortably, according to a new survey by Capital One Investing, a subsidiary of Capital One Financial (COF).That's two percentage points more than the portion who lacked confidence last year, according to the financial firm's latest Financial Freedom Survey. And it's a whopping 10 points more than the percentage who lacked confidence in 2015.One reason for the rising lack of confidence is that so few American adults who were surveyed have a longtime financial plan. Only 49% have a plan.To get out of the vicious cycles of not saving or not saving enough, Capital One Investing's Butler recommends steps that are small but effective. ""It's like losing weight,"" Butler said. ""You know what you need to do: exercise more and eat less. But it's hard to get started.""The key is to take easy initial steps that start your savings process, Butler says.""Think about your finances holistically,"" Butler added. ""Each part fits together.""One key to building a retirement account is to make the savings process as automatic as possible. And that's one of the beauties of a 401(k) account. The money is set aside for you. Once you start to participate, you don't have to think about it. It is done for you. Your employer's payroll department or processor diverts each of your contributions for you. And you get a tax deduction with each regular contribution.And how should you choose the investments in your account? If you're not interested in making your own investment decisions, consider using a target date fund.Target date funds are portfolios — usually made up of mutual funds — whose mix of securities like stocks, bonds and cash becomes more conservative as the target date (usually retirement) approaches. Run by professional money managers, they're especially helpful to people who have little if any investment skill. They've become increasingly popular as buy-and-hold investments for retirement accounts.Ninety percent of plans tracked by research firm Aon Hewitt offered target date funds as of 2015. That was up from 33% in 2005.IBD'S TAKE: If you're an experienced investor who owns a target-date fund in a retirement account, run its holdings through Stock Checkup. Some might rate highly enough to consider buying. Also see if any are a member of Leaderboard and ripe for buying.Another solution that's increasingly popular is to use a robo-advisor. That's an online service that selects an asset allocation for you based on factors like your age, your goals, your risk tolerance. Affluent investors are flocking to robo-advisory services offered by big mutual fund firms like Fidelity, Vanguard and Charles Schwab (SCHW).Butler bottom-lined her advice this way: ""The idea for investors is to start a process that puts the power of time and compounding to work for them, and once you start the process to make it as automatic as possible.""Once retirement plans are started and start to grow, investors gain confidence that they're on the right track and any gobbledygook terms start to make sense.Fifty-one percent of Americans fear that they lack enough knowledge and experience to invest in an IRA, the study showed. Also, 49% say they don't trust the markets and the financial industry. Forty-five percent complain about lack of pricing transparency. And 42% cite the complexity of investing as the reason they don't save enough.Americans want to improve their retirement readiness, but many fall short.Thirty-nine percent of the nonretired people polled said they believe they should contribute 15% of more of their income to retirement savings each year. But only 13% are doing so, and that's two percentage points lower than last year.More than half — 52% — of nonretired people are socking away 15% or less each year. And 32% do not save anything.In addition, only 55% of millennials use a retirement account like a 401(k) at work, even though 71% of all working Americans have access to one. Participation rates are much higher among older workers, with 83% of Gen Xers contributing to a workplace plan and 80% of baby boomers doing so.RELATED:Here's How 40% Of 401(k) Plan Members Build Larger-Than-Average Account BalancesThe Big Retirement Savings Mistake That Workers Should Stop Making

40,COF,"Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook (FB) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares (GOOG) by 5.6% and its A-class shares (GOOGL) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com (CRM), a provider of customer relationship management software.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup.Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.RELATED:P-s-s-st!

41,COF,"All those years of rising U.S. auto sales are starting to work against carmakers.A glut of used vehicles has started to depress prices. That trend will intensify as Americans will return 3.36 million leased cars and trucks this year, another jump after a 33% surge in 2016, according to J.D. Power. The fallout has already begun, with Ford Motor (F) shaving $300 million from its financial-services arm's profit forecast for this year.""Ford is the canary in the coal mine,"" said Maryann Keller, a former Wall Street analyst who's now an auto industry consultant in Stamford, Conn.This drag may be hitting the rest of the industry, too. A National Automobile Dealers Association index of used-vehicle prices declined each of the last six months of last year. When auto lenders lease out vehicles, they charge the customer a monthly payment and make an assumption of the car or truck's value when it will be returned for resale. If vehicles are depreciating more than expected, losses can pile up.The NADA Used Car Guide's price index dropped about 4% last year from 2015's average, the first significant decrease since the recession. The boom in cars and trucks coming back off leases will continue into 2017, rising about 9%, J.D. Power estimates.The impact of falling used prices has also hit Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ). The rental-car company replaced its chief executive last month, weeks after cutting its annual earnings forecast due to the falling value of its cars.The average used car depreciated about 23% last year, faster than the average annual rate of 18%, Edwin Groshans, an analyst at Height Securities LLC, said in a report Friday, citing NADA's data.""We expect this trend of above average annual depreciation to continue in 2017 and 2018,"" Groshans wrote. This may drag on auto-finance companies including Capital One Financial (COF) and Ally Financial (ALLY), he said.The trend has yet to put a damper on optimism at Ford's chief rival. General Motors (GM) this month predicted profit will rise more than analysts estimate for 2017, after meeting the high end of its targets for last year. Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday.To keep the momentum going, GM may have to overcome a drop in auction values that Ford has said is spreading beyond passenger cars to larger vehicles. More automakers may join Ford in reassessing profit forecasts for their captive lending arms after making overly optimistic assumptions about the future value of used vehicles, Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a Dec. 7 report.New vehicle sales have jumped each of the last seven years, the longest period since at least the days of the Model T. When used car values were strong, it enabled automakers to offer consumers cheaper lease payments.Leasing has helped consumers afford new vehicles becoming more expensive than ever. Prices have climbed 13% to $34,067 over the past five years, according to Edmunds.com, a rise partially driven by booming popularity of pricier trucks and sport utility vehicles.In the past, leases were primarily a tool used by luxury automakers including BMW and Daimler (DDAIF), which could rely on them for as much as 70% of sales, Keller said.""The difference this time, vs. the last time we had a leasing bulge, is that leasing today doesn't just apply to luxury cars,"" she said. ""It's become a mainstay in mass-market cars and even pickup trucks.""Ford Motor Credit is now starting to cut back on leasing, relying on it for 18% of retail sales in the third quarter, down from 26% in the first quarter.""We haven't seen anything that suggests that what's happening to our portfolio is different from what's happening across the industry,"" Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, told analysts in November.Another way automakers could cope is by expanding their offerings of certified pre-owned vehicles — used cars with extended warranties — to try to bolster prices.The question for auto companies is whether pulling those levers will offset any losses from overlooking the true cost of using hefty incentives and discounted leases to boost new-vehicle sales.""That's just the game they play,"" Keller said. ""It's deferring the loss, but those losses are now coming home to roost.""

42,COF,"Cabela's (CAB) shares fell sharply Friday after the outdoor gear chain said in a regulatory filing that it had received a request for additional information from the Federal Trade Commission on its merger with privately held Bass Pro Shops.The second request issuance ""does not indicate that the FTC has concluded that the transaction raises competition concerns,"" said the company in the filing.The two retailers announced in early October that Bass Pro Shops would acquire Cabela's for $65.50 per share in cash, in a deal worth about $5.5 billion.News of the merger sent shares of Cabela's up 15% on Oct. 3. Shares of Cabela's sank 5.1% to 58.55 on the stock market today after sinking as low as 57.36 intraday.The deal had also included a multiyear partnership between Bass Pro Shops and a Capital One Financial (COF) subsidiary to create a Cabela's co-branded credit card.The Securities and Exchange Commission filing revealed, however, that Capital One ""no longer expects to receive approval from the (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) under the (Bank Merger Act) within a time frame that would permit the transactions under the Merger Agreement and the Bank Purchase Agreement to close by the end of the first half of 2017.""Capital One expects the deal to be approved, according to the filing, but that it likely wouldn't occur before Oct. 3, 2017, the date after which merger parties would have termination rights.The initial news release from October said the companies had expected the transaction to close in the first half of 2017.RELATED:M&A Deals, Chatter: Alphabet, Qualcomm, Janus, Winnebago, Cabela's

43,COF,"Credit-card issuer American Express (AXP) reported mixed fourth-quarter results after the close Thursday and gave strong guidance.Estimates: A 20% earnings-per-share drop to 98 cents, with revenue down 5% to $7.949 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of 91 cents on revenue of $8.02 billion. Provisions for losses rose 9% to $625 million.Outlook: Full-year 2017 EPS of $5.60-$5.80, with the midpoint above consensus estimates for $5.61""We continued to grow our lending portfolio faster than the market while maintaining industry-leading credit metrics. We acquired over 10 million new cards globally last year, and we added more than a million new merchants to our network in the United States alone,"" Chairman and CEO Kenneth Chenault said in a statement.Stock: American Express fell 0.8% late. Shares closed down 1% at 76.69 on the stock market today. Visa (V) dipped 0.15% after finishing 0.2% higher at 81.73, closing in on an 84.06 buy point, while MasterCard (MA) was flat late, but ended 0.1% lower at 108.53, after clearing a 109.03 entry earlier in the day before reversing lower.Last year, American Express' partnership with Costco (COST) ended as the warehouse membership giant switched allegiances to Citigroup (C) and Visa. The strong dollar and low gas prices have also weighed on American Express.Q4 marked the second straight quarter of lower EPS, with further declines seen in Q1 and Q2, until comparisons ease as American Express laps the end of its Costco partnership.Adjusted for the Costco business, currency swings and interest expense, American Express said Q4 revenue rose 6%.IBD'S TAKE: Within the S&P 500, banks are among the few stocks that can benefit when interest rates go up.As with other financial institutions, shares of American Express have risen after the election on the prospect that the new Trump administration would usher in economic growth and higher interest rates.Banks that issue credit cards, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), carry customers' balances and stand to earn more income from interest payments as rates rise.Likewise, American Express, Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) also carry balances, and shares in those companies shot up along with those of banks.

48,COF,"Payment processors Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) sold off sharply on Monday, breaking key technical levels.Visa shares fell 4.3% to 78.38 on Monday, losing sight of a tight consolidation in recent weeks near the 50-day line. That also undercuts an earlier buy point of 81.83. Visa did manage to close just above its 200-day moving average after falling below that support level intraday.MasterCard pulled back 3.3% to 101.14 on Monday, falling in heavy volume below its 50-day line. The stock is in danger of a round trip from a late September breakout, but for now is still above the 100.10 buy point.Visa and MasterCard rose modestly before the opening bell on the stock market today.PayPal, which recently announced alliances with Visa and MasterCard, sank 3.2% to 38.81 on Monday, closing just above the 200-day line after undercutting it intraday. PayPal broke out of a consolidation on Oct. 21, a day after reporting quarterly results, hitting a new high. But shares have been retreating since then, undercutting the pivot point earlier this month and closing below the 50-day line on Friday.PayPal was flat before Tuesday's opening bell.Global Payments (GPN) and Vantiv (VNTV) also have retreated.It's unclear what it is hurting Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. They make their money from transaction fees, letting card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) get the risk and reward from customers' balances. With the yield curve steepening sharply in recent weeks and especially since Donald Trump became president-elect, card interest rates may rise. Bank stocks are soaring on widening yield spreads generally.IBD'S TAKE: While Visa and MasterCard slump, investors continue to rush into bank stocks. They're mostly extended from proper buy points, but you should pay close attention to this new leading group for entry points down the road.That could be why American Express (AXP), Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) are soaring. All three carry customers' balances. American Express rose 2.7% Monday to its best levels since November 2015. Capital One jumped 3.4% to its highest since July 2015. Discover Financial advanced 3.3%, hitting an all-time high intraday.Jefferies analysts said Tuesday that the sell-off in some payment stocks is unwarranted.""Major payments stocks including V, MA, PYPL, GPN and VNTV are off 5-10% in the four trading sessions since Election Day. We don't believe this is because of fundamental concerns on these stocks, but rather because of investor rotation into core Financials which have significantly lagged the payments stocks for years, but are now expected to benefit from rate and regulatory tailwinds under the Trump Administration.""Jefferies added that financial deregulation could repeal the Durbin limit on interchange fees and rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""If Trump's general plans for deregulating the financial services industry ends up including a repeal of the Durbin Amendment and a less-powerful CFPB, this should generally be a tailwind for the Payments industry, though impacts to PYPL/SQ/merchant acquirers may be less clear.""

50,COF,"Tiger Tyagarajan credits the culture of curiosity he built as New York-based CEO of Genpact (G) for much of his company's success. He says it helped create an environment of continuous learning that's vital these days.Here's how to build that kind of culture.Embrace change. Technology causes quick shifts in the way people do their jobs. Tyagarajan has welcomed that and sees it as an edge for Genpact, which supplies digital business-process management and services.""We are in a day and age where change is a given,"" Tyagarajan told IBD. ""The pace of that change is probably faster than it's ever been in the history of mankind. You can't say that you learn in college and then you work. You have to constantly learn.""Make it routine. Anytime you're in a new situation or working with a client or colleague, look to pick up new tips.""You have to have a mindset of constantly waking up and saying, 'What am I going to learn today?' "" Tyagarajan said.Prioritize it. It's vital to stay on top of what's going on in the world, says Steve Arneson, a Boulder, Colo.-based executive coach and leadership consultant. You need to know your competition, the industry and global trends like digital advances and what millennials are thinking.""If you don't do it, you're going to fall behind,"" Arneson said.Hire for it. The ability to learn should be a key factor when you're adding people, Arneson says. Ask candidates to tell you about a time they learned something vital on the job. Ask what they read, including books, and whom they talk to in order to gain knowledge for their job.""How do you keep the organization ahead of the competition if you're not constantly learning?"" Arneson said.Get together. Genpact was formed from General Electric (GE). Tyagarajan and others kept alive the idea of having no boundaries. People from diverse parts of GE, like aircraft, TV and health care, often met to talk about how they did their jobs.""You get ideas from people who are not part of your business,"" Tyagarajan said. ""Assume you don't have all the answers. Problem-solving and critical thinking are a huge part of our culture of curiosity.""Get input. When his employees face a tough issue with a client, Tyagarajan wants them to seek help from peers. One of them has probably gone through a similar situation. People share what they've learned, too.""If there's a problem, don't try to solve it yourself,"" Tyagarajan said. ""Ask 100 people.""Read. It's the key to continuing to learn, Arneson says. He urges clients to buy three business books each year on their birthday and read them that year. Spend time exploring the competition, the industry and the world at large. Study your own company, too.""Take the view that every day you need to learn something new,"" Arneson said.Get out there. Speak at an industry conference or just attend one. That will get you talking with others in the business to see how they do things and to bone up on new trends.""That gets your juices flowing about alternatives and options,"" Arneson said. ""You can't afford to be too busy not to explore.""Embrace mistakes. Genpact's people open up if things don't work out, too. That comes from Tyagarajan, who wants that to be part of his culture to continuously learn.""It's better to learn from fast failure than slow success,"" Tyagarajan said.Interact. When Arneson worked for credit card firm Capital One (COF), he told his group of about 10 to bring in one thing to each weekly staff meeting that they learned about their company.""It was amazing how much we learned,"" he said. ""It's so easy for people to get myopically focused on their own department and don't even learn about their company.""RELATED:Big Plans Are Achieved By Small Steps, When You Make Each One CountAristotle Showed How Logic, Learning Achieve SuccessInformal Group Talks Fuel Personal Growth.

52,COF,"Shares of MasterCard (MA) gapped up 2.4% to 96.01 in the stock market today after the credit-card payments company reported second-quarter results that beat expectations.The company said earnings were 96 cents a share, up 13% and above estimates for 90 cents. Revenue also rose 13% to $2.7 billion, topping views for $2.589 billion.Processed transactions rose 14% to 13.7 billion. Cross-border volumes rose 10%.MasterCard has been making its way through a flat base -- a possible prelude to a breakout -- begun in May. Rival Visa (V) tacked on 0.5%, while American Express (AXP) eased by 0.1% and Capital One Financial (COF) slipped 0.8%.The results come during an earnings season in which the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union has been a frequent topic of conversation during conference calls. MasterCard said the so-called ""Brexit"" vote was unlikely to have much of an effect on their business this year, according to Reuters.Shares of bank and payments companies were hammered after the vote, after which the pound withered against the dollar -- potentially translating into less revenue. Investors were also concerned the financial climate might be less favorable to those companies once the U.K. formally separated from the EU.IBD'S TAKE: As MasterCard makes its way through a flat base, stocks of other card companies have struggled in recent weeks amid worries about the state of consumer debt. Compare and contrast MasterCard and rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup. MasterCard last week announced that it agreed to acquire the vast majority of VocaLink, a London-based company whose technology helps speed up payments, for around $920 million.""With last week's VocaLink announcement, we will expand our capabilities beyond core card-based solutions into a broader set of transactions and payments,"" Chief Executive Ajay Banga said in a statement.

53,COF,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

The S&P 500 is defending a 0.2% gain in what could also be its fourth straight up week and a second straight record weekly close. The Dow was effectively flat, while the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 entered Friday's session down 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, and possibly looking at their first decline in four weeks.Chip stocks were all over the map. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rumbled ahead 10% after swinging to a profit in a big second-quarter beat.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) dropped 9% at the open, despite fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue slipping less than expected. The supplier of components to both Apple (AAPL) and Samsung also boosted its dividend and announced a $400 million share buyback initiative.Chipmaker Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO), an IBD 50 stock, fell 1.5% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue in line with previously increased forecasts. The company also raised its third-quarter and full-year revenue guidance.swAmerican Airlines (AAL) jumped 3% after reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings slipped less than expected, while margins and passenger revenue per available seat mile both decreased, pressured by currencies, global economy and competition.Whirlpool (WHR) rose more than 2% after reporting results early Friday.General Electric (GE) dragged on the Dow, down 2% after second-quarter results showed strong sales and earnings growth, but orders unexpectedly slipped.Among other big movers, U.K.-based wireless telecom Vodafone (VOD) climbed 4%, while Capital One Financial (COF) dropped 3% and Skechers (SKX) tanked 19%.Further, Starbucks (SBUX) edged down 0.4% after same-store sales missed analyst expectations.

55,COF,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are expected to boost shareholder returns at a faster pace than investment banks Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS), top regional banks, and credit card giant Capital One (COF).As investors await the next round of stress-test results Wednesday night, CLSA estimated in a recent report that returns through buybacks and dividends from JPMorgan, BofA, Citi and Wells Fargo could potentially rise to $51 billion over the next year, or nearly two-thirds of earnings, and continue increasing through 2020.The bump in capital return for the big money-center banks would follow their attempts to shore up capital, which helped them pass the first round of annual stress tests last week.In fact, all 33 banks tested passed that round, which quantifies whether banks' capital reserves would meet the Fed's minimum required levels in difficult economic conditions -- including 10% unemployment and negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries in this year's doomsday scenario. Citigroup led the charge in the improved capital levels.""This reinforces our view that the money center banks offer the greatest upside potential for capital return when capital plans are announced next Wednesday,"" Buckingham Research analyst Jim Mitchell wrote in a research note released Friday.In the second of those two rounds, also known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the Federal Reserve determines whether banks could reasonably deliver planned dividend and buyback increases amid financial strain.Buckingham Research, in a note Friday, said the odds were low that big banks of particular significance to the economy would have their plans rejected by the Fed. Similarly, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note on Thursday that most banks that it covers ""appear well positioned to meet our capital return expectations.""""Overall, we believe that stress test results are most positive for (Citigroup), (Bank of America), and Morgan Stanley -- where meaningful increases in capital returns are projected -- but the whole group should benefit if investors view the stress test as becoming less stressful for Universal Banks longer term,"" KBW said.CLSA, however, warned that from 2013 to 2015, one out of seven banks has had qualitative problems in the second round of the tests, even after performing well on a quantitative level.Bank stocks rallied for a second straight session in the stock market today as they and global markets continue to recover from the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. JPMorgan rose 2.8% while Bank of America climbed 3.9% and Citigroup 4.15%. Wells Fargo tacked on 1.9%, Morgan Stanley 2.5% and Goldman Sachs (GS) 2.2%.

56,COF,"Capital One Financial (COF) didn't change its outlook despite an uptick in delinquencies, a day after Synchrony Financial (SYF) dragged card-issuer stocks lower when it warned of more debt write-offs over the next year.Capital One, which is among the biggest card issuers in the U.S., said its domestic May net charge-off rate was 3.99% -- up 60 basis points year over year, but down from 4.29% in April. The domestic 30-plus-day performing delinquency rate rose to 3.01% from 2.74% a year ago and 2.96% sequentially. The 30-plus-day performing delinquency rate for auto loans edged up to 5.48% vs. a year earlier.But while Capital One CFO Stephen Crawford pointed to “an accelerating increase in consumer debt” -- potentially even in subprime loans -- other financial metrics prompted the card-issuing giant not to change its loss forecast. Credit stability has held up in recent years as well.""The other side of that message is, there will be a turn,"" he warned at a Morgan Stanley financials conference. ""And one should just anticipate that that’s going to happen at some point in time.""On Tuesday, Synchrony, which issues private-label credit cards, said it expects a slightly higher net charge-off rate -- an indication of credit that a firm writes off as a loss because it no longer expects to be repaid -- over the next 12 months.Synchrony, which was recently spun off from General Electric (GE), said the rate was still ""historically low"" but that consumers this year have had a harder time paying off debt. Concerns have grown that debt from credit cards and auto loans, among other things, could be rising to less-comfortable levels.Meanwhile, Alliance Data Systems (ADS), which provides consumer and commercial lending and auto financing, said the delinquency rate within its card services segment rose to 4.4% as of May 31 from 3.9% a year earlier.Capital One shares ended trading up 0.3% on the stock market today, after diving 6.6% Tuesday. Alliance Data ticked down 0.5% to 207.95. Synchrony rose 0.2% to 26.50 after tumbling 13% Tuesday.Discover Financial Services (DFS) edged 0.3% higher to 53.12 Wednesday, following Tuesday's 4% drop. American Express (AXP) added 0.6% to 61.42, regaining some of the prior day's 4.1% slide.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) do not issue cards but act as payment networks connecting businesses and banks. Visa lost 0.5% to 78.17. MasterCard dropped 0.8% to 93.34.

57,COF,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.
"
58,COF,"Synchrony Financial's (SYF) warning that its net charge-off rates would be worse than anticipated over the next year sent shares diving Tuesday, also dragging down American Express (AXP), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One (COF).Synchrony, a recent General Electric (GE) spinoff that provides private-label credit cards to a variety of businesses, said it expected a 20-30 basis point increase in net charge-off rates -- a measure of debt that a company no longer expects to get back and has deemed a loss -- and would build up reserves accordingly in Q2.Shares plunged 13.3% to close at 26.45 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50- and 200-day moving averages. American Express dropped 4.1% to 61.07, while Discover lost 4.1% to 53.27, sinking below its 50-day, and Capital One tumbled 6.6% to 64.43. But GE rose 2% to 30.44.While Synchrony said it expected some level of weakness and that its loss rate was ""at historically low levels,"" the announcement came amid growing anxiety about consumer debt.""The consumer's ability to cure themselves when they get into those later due stages has been challenged,"" CFO Brian Doubles said at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in New York on Tuesday. ""It's been challenged all year.""And as auto loans grow, so have warnings about potentially higher delinquencies. Other analysts have said banks are running out of higher-quality borrowers to target, forcing them to reach for less reliable ones.Meanwhile, Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), which do not issue credit cards but act as the middleman between businesses and banks, were less affected. Visa inched up 0.2% to 78.57, while Mastercard eased less than 0.1% to 94.11.Top banks, which issues cards, also sold off, though ""Brexit"" fears have been weighing on financial stocks. Bank of America (BAC) fell 2.5% to 13.26, Citigroup (C) lost 2.8% to 41.96, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was down 1.9% to 62.08, and Wells Fargo (WFC) surrendered 2.3% to 46.88.
"
59,COF,"Median shareholder payout from many of the biggest U.S. banks could rise to as much as 77% of earnings from 68% last year if their dividend-and-buyback plans pass the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests, analysts say, with money centers like JPMorgan (JPM) and credit-card banks American Express (AXP) potentially leading the returns.And banks' finances are generally seen holding up when the Federal Reserve on Thursday reports the first results of the tests, in which the Fed analyzes how well 33 banks' capital cushions could absorb shocks to the market and their finances. In the second round of evaluations, released on June 29, the Fed not only evaluates whether banks' finances pass muster amid broader economic turmoil but also whether their plans to return money to shareholders would be justified as a result, potentially restraining their ability to repurchase shares or hike dividends.Those passing grades would come despite a volatile market over the past year, rising consumer debt and tougher testing standards. In January, the Fed asked banks to assess how they would handle an economy with 10% unemployment and negative interest rates on short-term U.S. government bonds -- stricter criteria than in years past. Banks responded with their plans in April.But analysts feel that the banks are on solid enough footing today to withstand those rigors -- after Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan had to modify their capital return plans to pass the tests last year.""More broadly, we see limited downside risk given that nearly all of the companies under coverage have seen material improvement in capital ratios"" since the previous tests, Buckingham Research analyst James Mitchell said in a note Monday.The big money-center banks -- like JPMorgan, Citigroup, BofA and Wells Fargo -- ""are probably in the best capital shape that they have been since the financial crisis,"" Portales Partners said this month in a research note, which predicted that such banks would turn out the biggest shareholder returns.""I'd be surprised if any of the big four had a big hiccup this year,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Werner told IBD, referring to JPMorgan, Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America.Portales predicted that on average, roughly half of earnings this year and next from those banks would come back to shareholders in the form of buyback programs and dividends.Those increases would be in part driven by low payouts last year and an improved capital buffer, Mitchell said. He also said those big banks would see a bigger payout increase, 20%-44% as measured in dollars, than any other kind of bank Buckingham covers.Credit-card banks like Capital One (COF), Discover (DFS), and American Express (AXP), were also likely to ""enjoy above industry average payouts"" over the next year, Portales said.""It's surprising the credit-card banks have been more resilient, even with the large consumer losses that they predict and that they model,"" Werner said. ""I think the capital levels at those banks have generally been stronger, just because of the nature of the business.""But beyond JPMorgan and the credit-card banks, the picture for potential returns is less clear.On one hand, Buckingham Research said Monday that Morgan Stanley had tremendous potential for ""upside surprise,"" citing in part its move away from volatile fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading. Credit Suisse on Monday also said Morgan was among those best positioned to return a high percentage of its capital.However, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods remained cautious on Morgan, after the bank had to modify its capital plan last year. Portales analyst Paul Gulberg told IBD that investment banks Morgan, along with Goldman Sachs, were more exposed to the U.K.'s potential decision to leave the EU and other world market chaos, and could ""get hurt a little bit.""Coincidentally, the U.K.'s referendum on leaving the EU also takes place Thursday. Analysts have warned that a so-called 'Brexit' could roil the financial landscape in Europe and reverberate into U.S.-based banks. Some U.S. banks detailed what effect Brexit would have on them in their stress-test responses, the Financial Times reported this week.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods has also warned that post-stress-test payouts could be topping out.""Overall, payouts are near the upper end of what we believe is the long-term range of 70% to 80% of earnings over the CCAR cycle for the median bank,"" the firm said in a note last month, referring to the second round of testing, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.Payouts this year could also be affected by proposed adjustments to the stress tests' methodology in the future.Federal Reserve governors this month said some large banks could have to set more money aside to pass stress tests down the road. Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a note that while those new requirements might not take hold until 2018, payout ratios could be affected as soon as this year.""The Fed has done its best to not be so predictable with its models,"" Werner said. ""It sounds like it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game – they don't want to banks gaming the models, but at the same time the banks are trying their best to get a more predictable result.""JPMorgan and Wells Fargo rose about 2% on the stock market today on optimism about the Brexit vote as well as the stress tests. Citigroup climbed more than 4% while Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advanced more than 3%. American Express, Capital One and Discover Financial rose roughly 2%.

Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) unveiled software and services updates at its developers conference, while hardware dominated the E3 video game expo.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 1.9%, hurt by big techs such as Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft. The S&P 500 lost 1.2% and the Dow 1.1%. The Federal Reserve took a more dovish stance on rate hikes, but was still more hawkish than markets. Meanwhile, Brexit fears sent bond yields tumbling worldwide. The German 10-year bund went negative for the first time and the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2012 levels, though both closed well off those lows. The S&P 500 joined the Nasdaq and Dow in undercutting its 50-day line. The Nasdaq fell below its 200-day average.  Energy stocks fell with oil prices, while American Air and global peers tumbled on Brexit and terror fears.The Federal Reserve left interest rates alone, as expected, in the wake of the weak May jobs report and concerns over the looming Brexit vote. Policymakers turned more dovish. Six officials now see just one rate hike this year vs. just one official previous. Still, 11 are betting on two hikes. Yet markets, which have priced out expectations for a hike until next year, sold off following the Fed meeting. The Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat also hit markets, even though no BoJ action was expected.Meanwhile, industrial output fell 0.4% in May, but two regional manufacturing reports were positive in June. Retail sales were stronger than expected in May, while housing starts were in line. Consumer inflation remained tame.Microsoft said Monday that it will acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion cash, or $196-per-share, surprising many investors and analysts. The transaction is seen closing this year. The buy brings LinkedIn's user data and sales tools to the tech giant. Canaccord Genuity said the move might prompt more cloud-computing M&A. Microsoft stock fell 2.6% for the week. LinkedIn shot up 45.6% to 190.80.Net neutrality rules were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, delivering a big win to the Federal Communications Commission, as well as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix. AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Comcast (CMCSA) had hoped the three-judge panel would at least strike down net neutrality rules applied to wireless networks. AT&T and others plan an appeal to the Supreme Court. But the one judge who dissented did agree in part that the agency had the authority to reclassify broadband internet as a telecom service under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.Apple unveiled software improvements for the iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac computers during a keynote event at its Worldwide Developers Conference.

Meanwhile, Sony (SNE) set an Oct. 13 release date for PlayStation VR.Analysts say Electronic Arts (EA) games ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" captured the most positive buzz, though EA was not on E3's show floor but at its own event across the street. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) shares fell amid the absence of new game title announcements. Analysts said the lack of major game titles for new virtual-reality headsets was a letdown, but publishers don't want to devote their resources until the VR market becomes more established.Meanwhile, Chinese messaging giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) reportedly is close to a $9 billion takeover deal for ""Clash of Clans"" creator Supercell.

But the grocery giant sees full-year  EPS at the low end of its guidance due to gas margins.Kroger shares fell 4.4% this week.Meanwhile, the FDA accused Whole Foods Market (WFM) of ""filth"" and other unsanitary conditions at an Everett, Mass., facility. Shares of the organic and natural foods grocer have tumbled nearly 10.9% so far this week.Symantec (SYMC) stock rocketed 15.5% this week to a 52-week high after the No. 2 cybersecurity firm said it would buy Blue Coat Systems for $4.65 billion before the privately held cloud security firm could launch an initial public offering. Blue Coat is a market leader in secure web gateway products and other segments. Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will head up Symantec.

Stockpiles fell by 993,000, less than expectations for a decline of 1.4 million barrels, but below the American Petroleum Institute's estimate that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.2 million barrels. The International Energy Agency said it saw its first ""significant drop"" in supply since 2013 in May and that oil markets will likely balance in the second half of the year. OPEC also sees oil markets in balance by year-end. Meanwhile, U.S. rigs in operation rose for a third straight week to an eight-week high, a sign of stabilization after oil prices rebounded strongly from January lows.But prices fell sharply as Brexit fears raised growth worries and propped up the dollar. Oil prices fell 2.2% to $47.98 a barrel, but closed well off weekly lows.The ISIS-inspired mass shooting of a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that killed 49 plus the shooter sent shares of gunmakers Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) sharply higher Monday as Wall Street anticipated higher gun sales spurred by regulatory concerns. Smith & Wesson reported strong earnings and guidance late Thursday. Smith & Wesson stock rose 10.5% this week. Sturm Ruger climbed 5.6%.Meanwhile, airline stocks tumbled, partly on fears that the Orlando attack could deter travel as well as concerns that the U.K. could vote June 23 to exit the European Union.

But Synchrony said Tuesday that it expected to write off slightly more consumer debt as a loss over the next year. A day later, Capital One said it would not change its loss forecast even as its net charge-off rate and delinquencies rose in May. Warnings have increased about rising credit-card and auto-loan debt. Synchrony crashed 16.3% this week, and Capital One 8.35%. American Express (AXP) lost 4.8% and Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 6.2%.

61,COF,"Stocks held losses in afternoon trading Tuesday, as American Express (AXP) weighed on the Dow, and Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) reversed lower.The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.7%, the S&P 500 fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq gave up 0.5%. Volume was mixed, running higher on the NYSE but slightly lower on the Nasdaq. U.S. stocks have been following European bourses lower amid fears that Britain will exit the European Union and ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting results due Wednesday.Gold miners, steel and financial stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today, while food, beverage and utility stocks edged higher.American Express led the Dow industrials lower with a 5% drop in heavy volume. Shares are now well below their 200-day and 50-day moving average lines. The drop may be in sympathy with Synchrony Financial (SYF), which plunged 16% after the private-label credit card provider forecast net charge-off rates to rise 20 to 30 basis points. That implies more customers are late on payments.Other credit card issuers and payment processors getting hit included Capital One Financial (COF), down more than 7%, and Discover Financial Services (DFS), which fell over 4%, both in hefty turnover.Smith & Wesson fell 5% to below its 200-day line after a sharp downward reversal. Shares spiked 7% Monday in the wake of Sunday's mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub. Analysts expect the firearms maker to post a 23% increase in fiscal Q4 earnings per share on 18.5% higher sales to $214.55 million when it reports Thursday.Sturm Ruger, which gapped up and surged 8.5% Monday, also reversed lower and was down nearly 4%.

62,COF,"Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) and their venture capital units invested more in fintech companies over the past year than their rivals did, but growing concerns about the industry could taper investments this year and boost the odds of consolidation, a new report from CB Insights and KPMG found.Goldman or its corporate venture segments logged nine such deals for fintechs from the first quarter last year to the first quarter of this year, while Citi or its related units had seven, according to the report. Along those lines, two deals were accredited to JPMorgan (JPM) or its venture units, and one each for Wells Fargo (WFC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Capital One (COF).Matthew Wong, an analyst with CB Insights, said the types of investments have run across the fintech spectrum, and banks show growing willingness to collaborate with an industry that could move much of our finances to our mobile devices and overhaul the way bank branches are used.""In some cases, you're seeing banks like Goldman Sachs or others do deals in a lot of these different new areas that are emerging to have a (strategy) -- not just investment -- but being able to monitor how these spaces are evolving,"" Wong said.The investments over the past five quarters included a round of financing in Financeit, a real-time consumer financing firm, that was led by a Goldman affiliate and closed in October. Another division of Goldman led a $40 million round of funding, announced last April, for Hong Kong's CompareAsiaGroup, a site that allows consumers to compare different financial services.Citigroup's venture arm helped lead a $30 million investment, announced in September, in Chain, a company that uses blockchain -- a technology that uses shared ledger databases to cut down on middlemen -- to facilitate transactions.The report comes amid a murkier outlook for the fintech industry. On one hand, investments in fintech companies overall in the first quarter nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.7 billion globally over 468 deals, marking a recovery from the $3.1 billion raised in the fourth quarter, the report said. A recent bond offering from online lender SoFi got a triple-A rating from Moody's.And the report also talked about a massive new front opening up in insurance-related fintech, which Wong said raised more than $2.6 billion last year.""Why consumers have come to dislike insurance is there's a lot of lack of transparency,"" Wong said.He also said that far more tech entrepreneurs have tried to make getting insurance easier through online comparison platforms, brokerages and other avenues than in the past, with the Affordable Care Act even inspiring innovation despite the industry's high barriers.""The regulatory environment, as difficult as it is in other financial services, is extremely difficult to navigate for a lot of startups who are coming in, guns blazing, trying to disrupt the industry,"" Wong said.But the report also said that funding for venture-capital-backed fintech was on pace for a 10% drop in North America this year, and that U.S. investors had lost some interest in payments companies.""In North America especially, there were fewer startups in the payments space during Q1 ’16, likely due to market saturation and the success of market leaders Square (SQ) and Stripe,"" it said.And online peer-to-peer lenders, like OnDeck (ONDK), have faced concerns about insufficient loan volumes. Prosper, another online lender, said in February it would lay off around 28% of its staff.Calls for greater regulation of such online lenders have also grown amid questions about the conduct of some in the sector. The Justice Department said it would investigate online lending platform Lending Club (LC) after its chief executive resigned following a review that found that the company allegedly misled an investor on a loan sale.Shares of Lending Club have thrashed around in recent weeks, crashing after the investigations were announced and rebounding slightly after a group of Singapore-based companies said they had accumulated an 11.7% stake. On Wednesday, shares edged up 0.45%, OnDeck added 0.4%, while Square fell 1.4%. Goldman Sachs rallied 2.3%, and Citi rose 2.35%.Given those challenges, the CB Insights/KPMG report said that ""some consolidation ... is likely over the next 12 months"" in the North American fintech industry overall.And it questioned whether those difficulties could dampen investors' interest in the sector. ""It remains to be seen how the recent announcements by Lending Club and Prosper will impact that appetite and whether the balance of power switches back to more traditional financial institutions,"" Conor Moore, a senior official for KPMG's venture capital group, said in the report.

63,COF,"Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Santander (SAN) are all returning more capital to shareholders ahead of the next round of stress tests that could determine if more generous capital plans on the way.Bank of America will repurchase $800 million of its common stock, coming in addition to the $4 billion in buybacks the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender authorized a year earlier.The Federal Reserve didn't object to BofA's proposed repurchases, the bank said Friday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“The move today is some additional confidence that the buybacks are going to continue,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA.Bank of America shares closed up 2.9% on the stock market today.The news came one day after JPMorgan said it could boost its share buyback program by $1.9 billion through June after getting the OK from the Fed. Capital One Financial (COF) likewise added an authorization for $300 million in additional buybacks last month.The buybacks come as the annual stress tests for banks approach. Banks must submit their capital plans and stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5. The Fed will announce the stress test results before June 30.With the Federal Reserve stress tests coming, up the fact big banks are feeling confident enough to buy back their own stock is a good sign. The Fed’s decision not to object to BofA and JPMorgan’s buybacks also should be viewed positively, Mayo added.“This is certainly a step in the right direction,” he said. “The Fed is not a rubber stamp.”Mayo added, “This is the first time in 20 years that we’ve recommended all four of the biggest banks.”Meanwhile, Santander said it plans to boost its dividend 5% this year after having slashed it by more than 60% last year.Big banks' stocks reacted positively as part of the upsurge for shares in early trading, as the S&P 500 turned positive for the year after January and February's horrible slump.JPMorgan rose 2.9%, Citigroup (C) added 1.6% and Wells Fargo (WFC) also rose 1.6%. Capital One shares rose 1.5%, while Santander edged up 0.4%.

64,COF,"Apple’s (AAPL) Siri, Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Now, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Cortana and other voice-activated services are getting lots of attention -- but they aren't getting that much use, a new survey, as reported by eMarketer, says.Even as consumers increasingly turn to mobile phones for shopping, communicating and information, only 13% of U.S. mobile phone owners use a voice-controlled personal assistant on their device each day, says the survey from 451 Research, which was taken last June.Adding together the 13% of survey respondents who said they use such a service daily to the 14% who said they used it weekly and to the 10% who reported using it monthly, that still only comes to little more than 1 in 3 mobile phone owners who say they use a personal digital assistant at least once a month.But there are big caveats. For one, June is a long time ago for a fast-emerging technology. Moreover, at the time, fully one-third of respondents said they didn't have a mobile phone that gives them an option to use a personal assistant, the survey said.EMarketer models the U.S. to have 177.8 million mobile phone users as of year-end, or just over half of the population. By 2018, it forecasts that there will be 207.1 million mobile phone users, or about 63% of the population.""And, as mobile devices become more sophisticated and offer options like voice-controlled personal assistants, more of those searchers may be inclined to try them out,"" eMarketer said.Amazon's Alexa is able to hail rides from Uber, play music, set timers and manipulate smart devices in homes, such as Google’s Nest smart thermostat service, among other functions.This month, Capital One Financial (COF) announced that it was adding a ""skill"" -- Amazon-speak for a function -- enabling customers to use Alexa to check their credit card balances or make payments.Shares of Apple and Alphabet were up about 1.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Microsoft stock was near 1.3% and Amazon.com was up a fraction.

65,COF,"Siri, the virtual assistant Apple (AAPL) released nearly five years ago, may be topped by Amazon.com (AMZN) and its own spin on said tech, Alexa, an analyst says.MarketWatch cites analyst James Cakmak of Monness, Crespi & Hardt as saying that Alexa could overtake Apple's assistant Siri because of its integration with Amazon's Echo speaker that takes voice commands, and its integration with other home brands. Cakmak sees Alexa increasingly looking headed toward industry-standard position, the report says, especially with the opening of third-party device interoperability.On Jan. 4, Cakmak had downgraded Amazon from a buy to a neutral rating, citing competitive pressure in 2016.Amazon.com stock was up more than 1%, around 565, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 73, where 99 is the highest. The stock touched a six month low of 474 on Feb. 9, but has since rallied nearly 20% since.Amazon's Alexa is able to hail rides from Uber, play music, set timers, and manipulate smart devices in homes, such as the Nest thermostat from the Google unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), among other functions.On Friday, Capital One Financial (COF) announced that it was adding a ""skill"" -- what Amazon calls features -- to Alexa, that would let its customers interact with their financial information with voice commands.Capital One said in a statement emailed to reporters that their customers can do things like check their credit card balance, and make payments via Alexa.Several Amazon devices offer Alexa: the original Echo speaker, the smaller Echo Dot with a scaled-down speaker, and the Amazon Tap that requires pressing a button before Alexa can respond to requests.Google and Microsoft (MSFT) also offer voice-controlled virtual assistants.Faced with rising competition from Amazon, Wi-Fi streaming speaker maker Sonos is cutting staff and pivoting to work on voice-controlled features, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Sonos is a partner to Apple and other music providers.""We’re fans of what Amazon has done with Alexa and the Echo product line,"" Sonos CEO John MacFarlane said in a blog post Wednesday. ""Voice recognition isn’t new; today it’s nearly ubiquitous with Siri, OK Google and Cortana. But the Echo found a sweet spot in the home and will impact how we navigate music, weather and many, many other things as developers bring new ideas and more content to the Alexa platform.""He called Alexa/Echo the first product ""to really showcase the power of voice control in the home"" and said Sonos will ""invest what’s required"" to bring voice-controlled music experiences into the home and to market ""in a wonderful way.""

66,COF,"Wall Street banks have declared war on Silicon Valley mobile payments platforms, arming to do battle in the peer-to-peer mobile payments business.As the likes of Square (SQ), Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) have charged into the uncharted waters of peer-to-peer payments, Wall Street banks have spent five years stitching together an alliance among JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) and others, according to a press release from Early Warning.Early Warning is a real-time payments and authentication firm that will manage clearXchange, a technology that lets bank customers make quick -- near-instant -- transactions. It now generally takes one to three days to transfer money between banks. Banks had been slow to innovate after the financial crisis, but now ""what we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview with Reuters.The banks are starting to use clearXchange to allow customers to transfer money almost instantly to friends and family. Peer-to-peer payments have been popular among millennials for splitting dinner bills, cab fare and paying rent.Achieving a critical mass fast is important for the banks using clearXchange. The so-called network effects -- the value unlocked from having a large customer base -- were critical to PayPal's early success in online payments, for example.PayPal was early to the peer-to-peer market and snapped up the popular Venmo app as a part of its $800 million Braintree acquisition in 2013. Braintree had acquired Venmo in 2012. Last year, Venmo moved $7.5 billion between people, and in January alone it handled $1 billion, PayPal told Reuters.As of Wednesday, only customers at U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America will be able to send money via mobile devices with the clearXchange platform. JPMorgan and Capital One Financial (COF) told Reuters they plan to plug in to the platform ""later this year.""Citigroup (C) is among banks that have not joined the alliance, Reuters said.PayPal stock was up a fraction, near 38, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Shares are just below an early entry at 38.62. A conventional buy point lies at 42.65.Square stock was down a fraction Wednesday afternoon, as the company was set to report its Q4 earnings after the close. Investors are likely going to focus on Square Capital, the company's financial services arm, as an area of growth.Square's peer-to-peer payments app Square Cash recently added a feature that let customers store money in it, much like a PayPal account already does.Facebook built its peer-to-peer payments play within its Messenger app, and it did so in-house. The company has said Messenger has more than 800 million customers. Facebook stock was up 1% Wednesday afternoon, near 107.

67,COF,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

69,COF,"Tech giants like Apple (AAPL) have been exploring the peer-to-peer (P2P) payments market, a field typically inhabited by financial institutions. Meanwhile, the country's largest bank is reportedly eyeing the peer-to-peer lending game, whose players can be found in Silicon Valley.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is planning to partner with a peer-to-peer small-business lender, according to Bloomberg, citing CEO Jamie Dimon at a Washington event on Tuesday.Nothing formal has been announced, but the collaboration will offer ""the kind of stuff we don't want to do or can't do,"" Dimon is quoted as saying.Dimon is well aware of the startups that are fast encroaching on JPMorgan's turf, and the move should be no surprise to shareholders.""Silicon Valley is coming,"" he noted in his April 8 letter to shareholders . ""There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking.""He added, ""We are going to work hard to make our services as seamless and competitive as theirs. And we also are completely comfortable with partnering where it makes sense.""JPMorgan has already dipped a toe into the peer-to-peer lending waters. The same day that the letter was published, P2P lender Prosper Marketplace announced that JPMorgan Chase and a number of other banks had invested a total of $165 million in the company, a move that reportedly valued the Lending Club (LC) competitor at $1.9 billion. Credit Suisse (CS) NEXT Investors led the round.JPMorgan shares rose 0.9% in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Lending Club, which went public last year, rose 1.5% following the news. Lending Club shares remain below their 50-day line.PayPal Venmo, Square Cash Offer P2PIn the meantime, person-to-person payment services such as PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo remain popular. Such digital wallet services allow individuals to link up their debit card or checking accounts and send others money using a smartphone app. Square (SQ) Cash is another such service.Even email services and social networks are in the game. Users can send each other money on Facebook (FB) via Facebook Messenger, and Gmail users can engage in money-sending via Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Wallet.Several weeks ago, the Wall Street Journalsaid that Apple was talking with JPMorgan Chase, Capital One Financial (COF) and other banks about creating its own person-to-person payment service.But the Apple Pay provider might lose money on some of those payments, said Bloomberg, citing Crone Consulting, given the account setup and transaction fees involved.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Apple Pay, Android Pay Cheer Digital Wallet BoostHow Apple Can Help Boost These IBD 50 Payment Stocks.

70,COF,"Spending trends on U.S. credit cards slowed in the third quarter from the prior quarter, while U.S. debit-card spending on the biggest cards picked up.Credit card spending growth for Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), Discover (DFS) and American Express (AXP) networks fell 30 basis points from Q2 to 8.4%, which analyst Robert Napoli of William Blair attributed to a 27% decline in fuel prices and soft retail sales.Meanwhile, combined debit spending volume rose 190 basis points from the prior quarter to a 5.5% gain, even with a 10.8% decline at Discover, which lost a sizable partner.Still, credit quality trends at card issuers, which include American Express and many of the largest banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), are impressive, Napoli says, with record-low charge-offs and generally stable though slightly increasing delinquency rates. Visa and MasterCard do not issue credit.""We believe credit quality could remain much better than average for the industry as a whole until at least 2017,"" Napoli said.American Express had the industry's lowest delinquency rate at 1%, followed by JPMorgan Chase at 1.38%, Citigroup at 1.54%, Discover at 1.65% and Bank of America at 1.71% — all below the industry's weighted average of 2.17%.Credit-card loan growth picked up slightly in the the quarter, with U.S. Bank (USB), American Express and Capital One Financial (COF) reporting positive and accelerating portfolio growth, especially compared to relatively weaker trends at Discover, Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup.""Credit standards are being slightly loosened, credit lines are being increased, the economic and employment environment is improving and the consumer leverage ratios seem to be forming a bottom,"" Napoli noted.Shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Citigroup all rose 2%-3% near the market close, also buoyed by hawkish Fed minutes.

71,COF,"Consumer credit rose by a record amount in September. Even better, more-confident consumers stepped up credit card borrowing at the fastest pace in seven years, good news for major card issuers such as Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).Non-mortgage consumer borrowing rose by $28.9 billion for the month, the biggest dollar gain since records began in 1941. The bulk — $22.2 billion — came in nonrevolving debt — mostly auto and student loans. But revolving debt, which is largely credit cards, advanced by $6.7 billion, or at an 8.7% annual rate. Year over year, revolving debt grew 4.7%, the best since August 2008.Credit card balances peaked in 2008 then fell though 2013 before edging higher last year.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America are among the top credit card issuers, so larger balances — and current low delinquencies — will bolster their own finances. While most bank cards are Visa (V) or MasterCard (MA), neither card giant profits — or risks — from cardholders' balances. Visa and MasterCard rely on various transaction fees. (American Express (AXP) and Capital One (COF) do carry cardholders' balances.)Bank stocks rallied Friday, after the strong jobs report reinforced a growing sentiment that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at its December policy meeting. Higher rates should boost banks' net interest margin — the spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates.JPMorgan rose 3% on the stock market Friday. Citigroup climbed 3.2% and Bank of America 3.7%.Visa shares fell 0.6% on Friday, but after setting a record high on Thursday. MasterCard rose 0.8% to a new closing high.On Monday, JPMorgan stock fell 1.6%, Citi 0.3% and BofA 1.5% as the broader market retreated.

After the shift, when a transaction takes place, the party with the weaker technology will bear the cost of the possible hack or fraud.
"
83,COF,"That's why most national merchants, retailers and banks have been working hard to issue the EMV cards and install EMV card terminals. Those cards carry a chip and are accessible with a PIN instead of the classic magnetic cards that require a signature. The technology embedded in the chip is much more complex; it makes point-of-sale transactions a lot more secure and the cards nearly impossible to duplicate. The chip cards alone do not enhance online payment security, though.
"
84,COF,"This system has already been in use for many years in Europe and elsewhere in the world. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), the originators of the standard. The U.S. is the last payment market to migrate to it, mostly due to the vastness of the old tech and the cost and complexity of the transition.
"
85,COF,"The result is that more credit card fraud migrated to the less secure U.S. market over the years. Now that chip cards will enhance the security on that end, the risk may shift to the weaker links in the industry: small and medium-size businesses and online users.

"
88,COF,"Point-to-point encryption helps merchants protect client data. ""If the data is encrypted from the point they swipe the card to the point that it's received by us as payment processor ... that data is now protected and virtually impossible to unencrypt, and that's a value-added service we make revenue on,"" said Andrew Ciafardini, vice president of corporate communications for Vantiv.
"
89,COF,"The other tool is tokenization, which removes the credit card number completely from the retailer's system. Instead, the retailer gets a representation of the number, which is called a token and is specific to that retailer, Ciafardini explained.

90,COF,"Growth By Acquisiton
"
91,COF,"Vantiv has made three acquisitions in recent years. At the end of 2012, it acquired Litle, an independent e-commerce payment processor for Internet and direct-response marketing transactions. Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).
"
92,COF,"""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""
"
93,COF,"The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.
"
94,COF,"Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.

"
96,COF,"The company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""

Its customer base includes Overstock.com (OSTK), Ancestry.com and Wayfair (W).""That was a technology-based acquisition,"" said Nathan Rozof, senior vice president of investor relations at Vantiv. ""Today, we're using that e-commerce technology to win clients like the USPS, where they need help processing not only in all their post offices but also USPS.com and the kiosks.""The other two acquisitions relate to the integrated payment space. Whenever a merchant, such as a restaurant, buys the software to manage its orders, inventory, kitchen, employee time and accounting, Vantiv can integrate the payment processing technology and offers 24/7 help lines for all platforms if any issues arise.Vantiv's purchase of Element in 2013 brought innovative technology into this integrated payment space, while the larger Mercury buyout in mid-2014 brought with it one of the largest distribution channels in the U.S.More Sales, CybercrimeThe company is certainly benefiting from a positive secular trend. ""The macro backdrop has been a positive (for Vantiv), and the declining gas prices have helped fan its sales growth,"" said Jason Deleeuw, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""We think payment security at the small and midsize merchant level is a key driver of growth for the larger, more sophisticated merchant processors like Vantiv.""Vantiv also plans to use its large cash position to consider offshore acquisitions, grow its core business and return capital to shareholders.As with any business, there are risks. Analyst Johnson mentions integration risk of its acquisitions, pricing pressure from financial institutions, PIN-network transaction-fee declines and economic risk.But the company has ambitious plans to grow its market share. From its spinoff in 2009 to today, Vantiv has grown its U.S. payment transactions share from 13% to 18%. ""We intend to grow faster than the payments industry,"" said Rozof.

115,COF,"Alaska Airlines (ALK) topped the list of best frequent-flier programs, according to a new study published Tuesday. The airline also announced increases in traffic and capacity in July.A new U.S. News & World Report ranked the Seattle-based carrier as the top airline for rewards. The company has partnerships with American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), giving travelers more ways to accrue miles even if they don't always fly Alaska directly. American came in at No.2 and Southwest (LUV) at No.3.Delta came in near the bottom along with United Continental (UAL).Alaska Air shares closed down 0.3% in the stock market today. American shares rose 2.5% to 42.74. Southwest shares were up 1% to 37.93.Rewards such as upgrades to first class and free flights are becoming harder to get for infrequent fliers,according to the report, and airlines have made it harder to take advantage of rewards with blackout dates and other travel restrictions, requiring more miles for perks.Credit cards from Capital One Financial (COF) and Citigroup (C)offer ways to help get more travel miles with purchases.Also Tuesday, Alaska said traffic rose 6.4% last month, with capacity up 6.9% vs. a year ago. Load factor fell 0.4 point to 88.1%.Delta said July consolidated passenger unit revenue (PRASM) fell 3% on pressure from foreign exchange, lower surcharges in international markets and continued yield pressure in domestic markets.Revenue passenger miles rose 4.7% last month, and available seat miles, a measure of capacity, was up 4.2%.Delta shares ended the day up 1.3% to 46.34.Meanwhile, United CFO John Rainey stepped down Tuesday to become the CFO for PayPal (PYPL), replacing Patrick Dupuis, who was in that position for five years.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

201,COF,"Attention shoppers: Apple on Tuesday unveiled tap-to-pay technology for using iPhones to buy things.
"
202,COF,"The company said ""Apple Pay"" will be available in October as a free update to its iOS 8 software.
"
203,COF,"Apple's (AAPL) push into mobile payments isn't expected to power earnings growth, analyst say. But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.
"
204,COF,"Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.
"
205,COF,"Apple is taking on Google (GOOGL), eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, retail consortium MCX, phone companies and others in mobile payments.
"
206,COF,"U.S. consumers have been slow to embrace digital wallets, partly over security concerns. Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others. Apple, stung by last week's celebrity-photo hacking scandal involving iCloud data storage, aims to win over shoppers, retailers and credit-card firms with its approach to protecting consumer financial data and limiting fraud.
"
207,COF,"""Security is at the core of (Apple) Pay, but so is privacy,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said at Apple's product unveiling event Tuesday, taking a shot at Google. ""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""
"
208,COF,"Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users. IPhones will generate single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers to store check-out systems. A ""secure element"" chip stores encrypted data.
"
209,COF,"NFC Rollout Will Get Boost
"
210,COF,"Apple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% to 20% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals, but Apple's push into mobile payments could speed NFC adoption.
"
211,COF,"Aside from its ability to build easy-to-use devices, one of Apple's strengths in the payments field is the more than 800 million credit cards on file in iTunes app store accounts. IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.
"
212,COF,"IPhone users are prime candidates for ushering in the mobile wallet age, says Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research.
"
213,COF,"""Not only do iPhone owners earn more than their Android counterparts, they also spend more,"" McKee told IBD. ""IPhone owners are the most advanced users of mobile transaction services across a wealth of categories. An iWallet would simply be a natural extension of how iPhone owners already use their devices.
"
214,COF,"""The number of iTunes accounts has ballooned from 575 million to 800 million in a year, with many of those accounts having a credit or debit card associated with them.

"
218,COF,"Apple's biggest benefit would be ""significant platform lock-in"" amid fierce competition from Google-Android based smartphones and other rivals, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said. Mobile payments, said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report, will ""increase the stickiness of the iOS platform over time.""
"
219,COF,"Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.
"
220,COF,"Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.
"
221,COF,"Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.
"
222,COF,"Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.
"
223,COF,"Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.
"
224,COF,"Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.
"
225,COF,"PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.
"
226,COF,"Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.
"
227,COF,"MCX, a consortium backed by Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and 60 other retailers, might not be ready to launch its smartphone-based digital wallet until 2015, analysts say. MCX members hope long term to reduce the credit-card transaction fees they now pay, analysts say.

229,COF,"The three firms formed the joint venture in 2011, but early partners Barclays and Capital One (COF) have backed out of the venture.Attention shoppers: Apple on Tuesday unveiled tap-to-pay technology for using iPhones to buy things.The company said ""Apple Pay"" will be available in October as a free update to its iOS 8 software.Apple's (AAPL) push into mobile payments isn't expected to power earnings growth, analyst say. But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.Apple is taking on Google (GOOGL), eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, retail consortium MCX, phone companies and others in mobile payments.U.S. consumers have been slow to embrace digital wallets, partly over security concerns. Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others. Apple, stung by last week's celebrity-photo hacking scandal involving iCloud data storage, aims to win over shoppers, retailers and credit-card firms with its approach to protecting consumer financial data and limiting fraud.""Security is at the core of (Apple) Pay, but so is privacy,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said at Apple's product unveiling event Tuesday, taking a shot at Google. ""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users. IPhones will generate single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers to store check-out systems. A ""secure element"" chip stores encrypted data.NFC Rollout Will Get BoostApple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% to 20% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals, but Apple's push into mobile payments could speed NFC adoption.Aside from its ability to build easy-to-use devices, one of Apple's strengths in the payments field is the more than 800 million credit cards on file in iTunes app store accounts. IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.IPhone users are prime candidates for ushering in the mobile wallet age, says Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research.""Not only do iPhone owners earn more than their Android counterparts, they also spend more,"" McKee told IBD. ""IPhone owners are the most advanced users of mobile transaction services across a wealth of categories. An iWallet would simply be a natural extension of how iPhone owners already use their devices.""The number of iTunes accounts has ballooned from 575 million to 800 million in a year, with many of those accounts having a credit or debit card associated with them. While most vendors are clutching at straws for new ways to increase cards on file, Apple trumps them from day one by a significant factor.""Apple, which acquired Beats Electronics' music streaming service in May for $ 3.2 billion, aims to diversify from hardware into services.At around a penny per transaction, Apple's payment revenue would amount to a few hundred million dollars annually, analysts estimate. A JPMorgan report says the ""impact to Apple's earnings would be immaterial.""McDonald's, Macy's On BoardApple's biggest benefit would be ""significant platform lock-in"" amid fierce competition from Google-Android based smartphones and other rivals, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said. Mobile payments, said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report, will ""increase the stickiness of the iOS platform over time.""Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.MCX, a consortium backed by Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and 60 other retailers, might not be ready to launch its smartphone-based digital wallet until 2015, analysts say. MCX members hope long term to reduce the credit-card transaction fees they now pay, analysts say.A mobile payments joint venture formed by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS), rebranded as Softcard last week, has struggled to gain traction.The three firms formed the joint venture in 2011, but early partners Barclays and Capital One (COF) have backed out of the venture.

281,COF,"The long wait for relief of regulatory burden may finally be over. While the Trump administration continues to push for the reversal the Dodd Frank Act, a bipartisan agreement announced on Monday came as a breather. This is expected to pave the way for significant changes and bring major relief to banks.Highlights of the AgreementThe major relief from the plan, unveiled by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, is likely to come in the form of reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill aims to raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 40. Thus, the banks including SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief.The move is expected to not only lower regulatory compliance costs but also lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Per the plan put forward under the bipartisan deal, banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief once the bill is enacted while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later.Further, the bill gives authority to the Federal Reserve to fast-track the exemption. Notably, the Fed will be required to conduct stress test for banks in the $100-$250 billion range periodically.For several regional banks with more than $250 million in assets, the bill is not so important. Some of these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp, though functioning as community banks, will stay subjected to stricter regulations. This will put them in a disadvantageous position to some extent in terms of lower costs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other BenefitsThe bill also has something to offer to the smaller community banks and credit unions with total assets of less than $10 billion. These will be exempted from implementing Volcker Rule (prevents proprietary trading) and from following stringent capital and liquidity rules as long as leverage ratio is in the range of 8-10%. Also, it aims to ease mortgage rules for small banks.Moreover, the bill is expected to be beneficial to trust and custodial banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). There is a provision that prevents deposits held at the Fed by such banks to be included in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio. This will aid these companies in clearing the annual stress tests.Reactions & Road AheadBankers and the overall banking industry cheered the deal. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed the day 1.3% higher.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association in a statement said, “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks.”Further, Crapo said, “The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks.”Nonetheless, the road ahead is expected to be bumpy. The deal is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations.Still, it is the most important step taken by the Senate to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth. Also, it is critical in securing the support that was lacking from the earlier efforts to lessen undue regulatory burden.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The upside was primarily driven by a 17% rise in the number of switched transactions to 16.9 billion along with a 15% increase in cross-border volumes. These were partially offset by higher rebates and incentives, mainly due to new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.About 2.4 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards were issued as of Sep 30, 2017.Mastercard witnessed a year-over-year increase of 19% in total operating expenses to $1.5 billion owing to higher cost components like general and administrative expenses and advertising and marketing costs.Interest expenses increased a whopping 52% year over year to $35 million.Operating margin declined 90 basis points year over year to 57.1%.Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $5.56 billion, down 17% from the year-end 2016 level.

284,COF,"Nothing comes for free. And this holds true for the most recent tax policy change that lowers corporate tax to 21% from 35%. Consequently, American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) will have to pay a price before reaping benefits in the long term.In a recent regulatory filing, American Express disclosed that the tax act is likely to impose nearly $2.4 billion charges in fourth-quarter 2017. The non-recurring expenses are mainly due to write-down in deferred tax assets (DTAs) (driven by reduction in corporate tax rate to 21%) and one-time tax on the company’s unrepatriated overseas earnings.This one-time charge will lead American Express to incur loss in the fourth quarter. Consequently, the company now expects 2017 earnings to fall short of its guided range of $5.80-$5.90 per share.American Express’ regulatory capital and capital ratios are expected to take a beating by adjustment  in  its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities  resulting from the tax reform. However, these will remain above the minimum regulatory capital requirements.In retrospect, we will not be surprised to see the company cutting back on its share buyback plans to address the capital shortfall.Some other big names in the financial sector like Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Capital One Financial (COF  -  Free Report) have also noted that the tax reform will likely result in significant one-time charges.BofA expects to record a $3-billion charge in the fourth quarter while Citigroup anticipates to take a whopping $20-billion blow on earnings due to write-down on DTAs. In the same vein, Capital One Financial would be affected by nearly $1.9 billion on similar charges.Despite inducing a short-term pain, the tax act is projected to lend some relief to corporates in the long term.Similarly for American Express, this adverse impact is a one-time affair and the company stands to gain in the long run from higher earnings and an increase in capital deployment plans. It might also make accelerated investments in technological upgrade and other growth initiatives.Shares of American Express have nudged up 0.8% since the tax reform bill was signed into law on Dec 22, underperforming the industry’s growth of 1.4%.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

285,COF,"U.S. stocks registered modest gains on Wednesday, as advances in major tech players offset declines in energy stocks. The technology sector snapped a five straight session losing streak to end in the green, buoyed by gains in Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report). But, the broader market largely continued its winning run after the Republicans passed the U.S. tax reform bill for the first time in 30 years.Overall, investors found few catalysts in one of the lowest-volume weeks of the year. Trading volumes in the U.S., in fact, remained at its lowest level in three years in 2017. Only on an average 6.43 billion shares were traded each day this year. Last year, about 7.22 billion shares were traded each day.How the Major Bourses Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 28.09 points, or 0.1%, to 24,774.30. The S&P 500 Index (INX) went up 2.12 points, or 0.1%, to 2,682.62. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,939.34, gaining less than 0.1%. A total of 4.36 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.79 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.What’s Driving the Broader Equity Market?Jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Trump before Christmas, as promised. The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break.Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented next year, instead of being delayed until 2019.Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U.S. companies around $32.5 billion in 2018, as per Congress’s joint committee on taxation.Miners, energy, retailers, tech, banks and pharma are expected to enjoy the biggest gains from the tax package (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Latest Economic ReportsA reading on consumer confidence dropped to 122.1 this month, down from an earlier reading of 128.6.

287,COF,"Almost everyone is cheering the implementation of the new tax law. But this will have an adverse near-term impact on financial performance of some companies. One such bank, Capital One Financial (COF  -  Free Report), is reducing its share repurchase authorization owing to this.In a recent regulatory filing, Capital One disclosed that its board of directors has lowered repurchase authorization to up to $1 billion for Jun 30, 2018 time period (from the prior $1.85 billion authorization). The company resubmitted its 2017 capital plan as required by the Fed to address certain weaknesses in its capital planning process.How lower share buyback authorization and tax act are connected? Well, the company’s financial position is expected to be hit by potential “reduction in the carrying value of certain tax assets and additional tax expenses resulting from the Tax Act.”Capital One, at present, projects that the tax act will likely lead to nearly $1.9 billion charges in fourth-quarter 2017. The non-recurring expenses are mainly due to write-down in deferred tax assets (DTAs) (driven by reduction in corporate tax rate to 21%) and one-time tax on the company’s “unrepatriated” overseas earnings.This one-time charge represents a significant portion of Capital One’s profits. For the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, the company’s net income was $3 billion. So, the charge may substantially wipe out the company’s profits this year.Some big banks like Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) have also noted that the tax act will likely result in significant one-time charges. BofA expects to record $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter while Citigroup anticipates taking $20 billion hit on earnings owing to write-down on DTAs.Still, the tax act is projected to be beneficial to the banks over the long term. Also, several smaller banks including Washington Federal, Inc. (WAFD  -  Free Report) and Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. plan to upgrade technology and may even pass on the benefits to their employees in form of pay rise and one-time bonus.

288,COF,"On Dec 19, shares of Total System Services, Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report) touched a new 52-week high of $80.23. Notably, the stock closed the day a bit lower at $79.67, up 0.8% from the preceding day’s closing.What Investors Cheer ForThe company has recently inked a deal valued at nearly $1.05 billion with Parthenon Capital Partners to acquire payment technology company, Cayan, in an all-cash transaction. This strategic move has impressed investors.The buyout would complement Total System’s merchant goals to deliver a premium quality of services and solutions. The transaction would further strengthen its huge scale and distribution capabilities.The deal accelerates the company’s position as a leading technology payments provider to small and medium size businesses in the United States.Also last week, the company extended its long-term agreement with Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) to continue providing processing services for the company’s North American portfolio of consumer and commercial credit card accounts for multiple years.Can the Momentum Continue?We believe the company to retain its revenue momentum in the coming quarters on the back of a strong market position as well as attractive core business that continue to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions and expansion of service offerings. These will further fuel a strong contribution to the company’s segments comprising Issuer Solutions, Merchant Services and NetSpend.The company increased its expectation for total revenues of 2017 to the band of $4.839-$4.889 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16-17% from the past guidance of $4.80-$4.89 billion.  The company has a strong track of cash flows, enabling capital deployment for acquisition, debt repayment and dividend payment.Recently, the company completed its deleveraging commitments and resumed share buyback activity which should support the stock.Further, Total System stock seems undervalued based on its Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio. The company is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 24.9, which although lies near the upper end of its five-year trading range of 15.2-25.2 and compares unfavorably with the industry P/E ratio of 27.9.The above-mentioned factors suggest that this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has further upside potential.

289,COF,"Hancock Holding Company’s  subsidiary, Whitney Bank, has agreed to acquire the trust and asset management business of Capital One, National Association, a banking subsidiary of Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report). The deal, which is expected to be completed by second-quarter 2018, will be immediately accretive to the GAAP EPS of the acquiring company.However, financial terms of the transaction have not yet been disclosed.As of Sep 30, 2017, Whitney Bank had nearly $16 billion in assets under administration (AUA) and $6 billion in assets under management (AUM).Upon successful completion of the acquisition, Whitney Bank will likely be considered among the Top 50 trust firms by revenues in the United States. The combined firm is expected to have annual revenues of nearly $70-$75 million, AUA of approximately $26 billion and AUM of $10 billion.Whitney Bank’s CEO, John M. Hairston, said, “This transaction is an excellent strategic fit with our existing Hancock Whitney wealth management group, and illustrates the type of largely in-market, low-risk business deals we prefer under our current M&A strategy.”He further added, “As a complement to our current lines of business for individuals and institutions, we believe Hancock Whitney will have one of the most talented teams of advisors located in wealth management offices across the Gulf South, with the opportunity to help improve our strategic goal of enhancing noninterest income as a percent of revenue.”The majority of Capital One’s business that is being acquired is in Louisiana and East Texas. For the new and existing clients, the company will maintain its presence in the New York metro area.Notably, Hancock Holding’s organic growth strategy also remains impressive. By making several investments, the company is well positioned to enhance its core revenues in the future.

290,COF,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Capital One Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.4. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Capital One Financial’s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint (which is 10.5) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Capital One Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Capital One Financial’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Capital One Financial has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Capital One Financial currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes COF a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Capital One Financial is just 1.4, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.5. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.5, which is considerably better than the industry average of 9.0. Clearly, COF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Capital One Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B. This gives COF a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter consensus estimate has not witnessed any earnings momentum in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dipped 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Capital One Financial Corporation Price and Consensus  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and Consensus | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCapital One Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 23% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

291,COF,"Over the last five trading days, the performance of banking stocks has been bullish. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax bill last Saturday, driving investors’ optimism over bank stocks. A significant drop in the corporate tax rate — from 35% to 20% — is one of the major changes proposed in the tax bill.Though low client activities and less volatility across capital markets are expected to hurt banks’ trading revenues in Q4, overall earnings performance is likely to improve on the back of lower taxes.Further, expectations of another rate hike soon, backed by improving U.S. economic data, have boosted investors’ confidence. Mortgage rates increased last week on a bonds sell-off, hitting 3.94%, but remained historically low. In addition, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.367%.Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, acquisitions and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts prevailed over the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Dec 1, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1. Major banks expect weak trading revenues in the fourth quarter. At the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference in New York, top executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) hinted at continued weakness in trading revenues. This is the third time in 2017 that both companies have provided dismal outlook for trading revenues.Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer at JPMorgan, stated that the company’s trading business so far this quarter has been down nearly 15% year over year. Lake noted that “there haven’t been that many catalysts” and volatility remains ""low across the spectrum.""Likewise, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan predicted the same decline for his company. Both executives cited discouraging comparisons to last year, when volatility was significantly high following the U.S. Presidential election results. Notably, remarks by these executives echo similar comments made in November by Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) CFO Martin Chavez, who said, “The market backdrop that has been in place since the beginning of the year has continued into the fourth quarter. Volatility continues to be low, and client activity continues to be subdued.” (Read more: Banks Appear Unlikely to Benefit From Trading Turnaround)John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) at Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), also foresees a decline in the company’s trading revenues by high teens in the fourth quarter. Also, Trump’s tax reform move is likely to affect the bank’s earnings by a solid $20 million as a one-time charge, after it is enforced as law. He also expects credit card revenues to remain flat in the fourth quarter due to pressure from the recent marketing costs.However, the CFO seemed hopeful about return on tangible common equity, expecting it to rise in 2019 and 2020 due to lower taxes that will result in higher income.

Moody's Investors Service — the rating service arm of Moody's Corp. — affirms or upgrades the major banks’ ratings based on performance and earnings strength. Recently, JPMorgan received rating action from Moody’s. The rating agency affirmed the ratings of the bank and kept its outlook stable. The company’s A3 long-term senior debt rating and Aa2 deposit rating have been affirmed.The ratings are based on JPMorgan’s earnings strength and performance of different business lines. Furthermore, the company’s great liquidity and capital position boosted its credit profile. (Read more: JPMorgan's Ratings Affirmed by Moody's, Outlook Stable)Also, Moody's upgraded the long-term issuer rating of BofA from Baa1 to A3. Additionally, the deposits and senior debt rating of its subsidiary, Bank of America N.A., has been upgraded from A1 to Aa3. Its baseline credit assessment has also been upgraded to baa1 from baa2.On the other hand, short-term ratings and assessments of the company and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by Moody's. Notably, the rating outlook is stable. BofA has witnessed improvement in its profitability in the last few years. Moody’s expects the company to sustain this bottom-line growth in the future as well.

The California Department of Insurance plans to revoke or at least suspend Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) insurance license due to its illegitimate practices relating to the online insurance referral program. The regulator noted that about 1500 fake insurance policies were opened by the company without customers’ knowledge. Wells Fargo is said to have wrongly charged them with premiums.Earlier this week, the banking giant’s CEO Tim Sloan commented on the regular screening of its operations during the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs. He had said, “I think actually that we’ll never say it’s finished.” This adds to the many other problems the bank has been facing since the fake accounts scandal surfaced in late 2016.  (Read more: Wells Fargo's Insurance License Likely to Get Revoked)4. Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) has been accused of charging illegal overdraft fees from customers. Per a Reuters report, a federal appeals court recently revived the proposed class-action lawsuit, which had been filed against the company earlier for its wrongdoing. According to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, the rules for charging overdraft fee of Capital One were quite confusing and ambiguous.Thus, a lower court judge had wrongly dismissed a breach of contract claim. Ideally, if a bank pays its merchant for purchases made by customers, who do not have enough money in their accounts, it charges an overdraft fee of nearly $35.

Financial details of the deal, announced in September, were not revealed. The sale is part of SunTrust’s strategy to focus on core Wholesale Banking operations. SunTrust intends to improve profitability by focusing on Wholesale Banking business. (Read more: SunTrust Closes Insurance Premium Finance Subsidiary Deal)6. Amid ongoing developments in the U.S. banking sector, CEO Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo is optimistic on the loan scenario in the fourth quarter based on improved customer activity. During the conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, Sloan commented on the regular screening of the bank’s operations. He said, “I think actually that we’ll never say it’s finished.” According to him, some other areas of mistakes might standout as the bank continues to make improvements.Further, growth in economy is likely to have spurred some customer activity on the consumer and commercial front during the quarter. He expects consumer activity to gain momentum when Trump becomes successful in enforcing the tax bill. In the third quarter, the bank reported nearly 1% drop in its loan portfolio, year over year.He anticipates the commercial and industrial (C&I) lending scenario to be better in the fourth quarter. However, he expects the mortgage segment to be impacted by seasonality during the last quarter, resulting in sluggish growth. Sloan anticipates the auto lending segment to improve late next year.

292,COF,"All the major banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results over the last five trading days reported bottom-line growth. This was mainly driven by a rise in revenues attributable to higher net interest income and loan growth.Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks. Banks were even able to control expense rise. All these led to positive price movement for the stocks over the last five trading sessions.However, mortgage banking continued to disappoint along with muted investment banking performance.

295,COF,"Visa Inc.’s (V  -  Free Report) fiscal fourth-quarter results scheduled for Oct 25, are expected to benefit from Payments volumes — one of the key revenue drivers set to surge on strength in India, the United States, Russia, Mexico and Australia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Payments volume from the Asia-Pacific is $437 billion, up 8.7% year over year.The U.S. dollar has weakened this year, which is likely to drive more volume, particularly inbound. Also, improved spending trends in the global economy and the acquisition of Visa Europe should support overall Payments volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1,967 billion, up a good 20% year over year.Visa’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings are likely to reflect solid revenue growth led by factors such as increased spending as the economy continues to grow and shift toward spending on cards and increased pricing. These factors will likely push up International Transaction Revenues.  Growth in processed transaction is likely to push up Data Processing fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2 billion, up 20% year over year.  Also, lower-than-expected incentives must have aided margins, as Visa has slightly delayed moving some European clients to an incentive structure.A moderation in the exchange drag will also aid margins.  The company has accelerated share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Increased share buyback will provide an added shield to its bottom line.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Visa has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.01%.The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

296,COF,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) has been accused of charging illegal overdraft fees from customers. Per a Reuters report, a federal appeals court recently revived the proposed class-action lawsuit, which had been filed against the company earlier for its wrongdoing.According to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, the rules for charging overdraft fee of Capital One were quite confusing and ambiguous. Thus, a lower court judge had wrongly dismissed a breach of contract claim.Ideally, if a bank pays their merchant for purchases made by its customers, who do not have enough money in their accounts, it charges an overdraft fee of nearly $35.There can be times when the transaction settlement does not take place immediately. Settlement happens after a merchant requests payment. The process might take a few days sometimes.Thus, the overdraft fee to a large extent depends on how and when the transaction is settled. For example, a customer has only $100 in his account and makes five purchases of $10 each and then makes a purchase of $100. If the transactions are settled in the order they were placed, the customer would have to pay only one overdraft fee. However, if the $100 purchase was settled first, the customer would have to face five overdraft fees.Tawanna Roberts, a Capital One customer in the New York City borough of the Bronx, who is among the plaintiff, accused Capital One, saying that the company wrongly imposed overdraft fees when it settled transactions i.e. at the time of making the payment to its merchants instead of when it authorized transactions at the cash register.Notably, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that the total overdraft and bounced check fees in the United States was about $15 billion in 2016.Capital One said to its customers that they could “elect to pay checks and other items drawn on your deposit account or to permit automatic bill payments and withdrawals against your account for an amount in excess of your available balance (an ‘Overdraft’).”However, the appeals court, comprising three judges, thought that it was “equally reasonable” to get an understanding of the term “overdraft” in connection with Capital One’s decision of making payments at the time of authorization, or the payment itself at the time of settlement.Hence, it returned the case to U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan for further proceedings. The appeals court has upheld Schofield’s dismissal of three other claims.Capital One did not comment on the decision.Shares of Capital One have gained 8.8% so far this year, outperforming 1.3% growth of the industry it belongs to.Currently, Capital One carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the finance space are First Bancorp (FBNC  -  Free Report), Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (FFKT  -  Free Report) and Capstar Financial Holdings, Inc. (CSTR  -  Free Report).First Bancorp’s earnings estimate has been revised 9.7% upward for the current year over the last 60 days. In the past year, the company’s share price has been up 50.3%. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Farmers Capital Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

297,COF,"Welcome to the eighth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we jump into the business of college basketball to help provide investors deeper insights into the world of big-time NCAA hoops, as the likes of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), ESPN, and others continue to fuel the sport.Big-time programs engulfed in scandal, debate surrounding the one-and-done rule, and the NCAA’s role in enforcing amateurism are likely to remain some of the biggest storylines during the 2017-18 college basketball season, even as the regular season begins to heat up.Still, in an era where blue chip college basketball programs, such as the University of Kentucky, Indiana, and Duke, could be worth upwards of $340 million on the open market, the sport is seemingly more profitable than ever.CBS and Turner  are set to spend billions of dollars on the rights to the roughly one month NCAA March Madness tournament through 2032. On top of that, major sponsors of one of the biggest U.S. sporting events such as Coke , AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) aren’t likely to leave anytime soon. And this just covers the most mainstream portion of the college hoops season.Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) struggling sports media network, ESPN, is deeply invested in college basketball. The nearly five-month regular season is fueled by marquee games presented by the likes of Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) and sponsor-laden in-season tournaments tied to Progressive (PGR  -  Free Report), Gildan (GIL  -  Free Report), 2K TTWO, and many more. Even social media powerhouse Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) bought the rights to live stream college basketball this season.Lastly, as many college basketball fans and investors already know, Nike, Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour UAA might be the real lifeblood of NCAA hoops.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

298,COF,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Capital One Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues & Costs RiseCapital One third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.42 per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15. Also, it compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.03.Results benefited from higher revenues and easing margin pressure. Also, the quarter witnessed a rise in loan balance. However, increase in provisions and expenses acted as headwinds.After taking into consideration charges related the Cabela’s acquisition, net income for the quarter came in at $1.11 billion or $2.14 per share. This was up from $1 billion or $1.90 per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Growth Supports ResultsNet revenues were $6.99 billion, up 8% year over year. Also, the figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.83 billion.Net interest income grew 8% from the prior-year quarter to $5.70 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 29 basis points (bps) year over year to 7.08%.Non-interest income increased 9% year over year to $1.29 billion. The increase was largely driven by a rise in net interchange fees, partially offset by a decline in other income, and service charges and other customer-related fees.Non-interest expenses of $3.57 billion rose 6% from the year-ago quarter. All cost components, except amortization of intangibles, occupancy and equipment, and marketing, rose year over year.Efficiency ratio came in at 51.07% compared with 52.02% in the year-ago quarter. A decrease in efficiency ratio indicates improved profitability.Strong Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, 2017, loans held for investment were $252.4 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. Total deposits, as of the same date, remained relatively stable sequentially at $239.06 billion.Total stockholder’s equity was $50.15 billion as of Sep 30, 2017, a rise of 2% from the previous quarter.Credit Quality WorsensNet charge-off rate jumped 51 bps year over year to 2.61%. Further, provision for credit losses rose 15% from the year-ago quarter to $1.83 billion.Also, the 30-plus day performing delinquency rate increased 22 bps year over year to 2.93%. Likewise, allowance, as a percentage of reported loans held for investment was 2.94%, up 31 bps year over year.Strong Profitability & Capital RatiosReturn on average assets was 1.28% at the end of the reported quarter, up from 1.18% in the year-ago quarter. Also, return on average common equity increased to 9.40% from 8.59% in the prior-year quarter.As of Sep 30, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.2%, up from 12% in the prior-year quarter. Further, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III Standardized Approach was 10.7% as of Jun 30, 2017, up from 10.6% as of Sep 30, 2016.OutlookConsidering the growth in the last two years, management remains confident about delivering EPS growth (excluding adjusting items) in the range of 7–11% for 2017. This includes as well as excludes the impact of the Cabela’s transaction.For 2017, domestic credit card charge-off rate is expected in the high 4–5% range, with quarterly variability. Also, credit pressure is expected to continue in oil field service and taxi medallion lending portfolios.Notably, the company expects the Cabela’s deal to reduce domestic card revenue margin by 65 bps starting in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, beginning in December, the deal is projected to lead to reduction in the domestic card charge-off rate by 25 bps.The company expects the impact of growth math to moderate in 2017 and gradually decrease in 2018. This means the year-over-year increase in delinquencies and charge-off rates are expected to decline gradually, as new loan balances in the front book season become a larger proportion of the overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book.In 2017, management projects efficiency ratio (excluding adjusting items) in the 51% plus or minus a reasonable margin of volatility. In the long term, management remains optimistic about deriving efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth and momentum.OutlookWhile estimates have been moving upward, the magnitude of the revision is net zero. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

299,COF,"Over the last five trading days, the performance of banking stocks has been bearish. Expected delays in corporate tax reform and a flattening of the yield curve drove investor pessimism over bank stocks.Earlier this week, Democrats won elections in Virginia and New Jersey, which indicates increased prospects for their representatives in next year's midterm elections. This development increases investor apprehension, as this might challenge Republicans' plans of lessening regulations for banks. Expected weakness in economic numbers also added to the woes.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 3.9%, awaiting tax-reform results. Notably, concerns rose after the message sent by Republicans last week, “We think homeowners and home buyers have gotten much too sweet a deal from the federal tax code for far too long — and now we’re going to whack them down.”Nevertheless, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations and increased digital offerings persisted over the last five trading days.  (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 27, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

300,COF,"Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation, downgraded Capital One Financial Corporation’s (COF  -  Free Report) outlook from stable to negative. The company’s senior unsecured debt ratings were affirmed at Baa1. Additionally, the deposit ratings for its subsidiaries were confirmed at A1/negative/Prime-1.Moody’s believes that exceptional loan growth over the years has led to increased charge-offs particularly in credit card and C&I portfolios, which resulted in a decline in the profitability of the company and increased risk levels.Per Moody’s, Capital One’s ratings have been reaffirmed because of the strong credit card and deposit business. The credit card business contributes 60% to total pre-tax earnings and provides a major support to the company’s liquidity and funding. However, capital ratios are relatively weak because tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets is roughly 10%.The affirmation is also the result of strong presence in the retail and commercial banking segment thanks to the acquisitions of three regional banking franchises. It helped Capital One to develop a branch-based retail deposit business.According to Moody’s, Capital One’s ratings are not going to be upgraded in the near future because of mounting charge-offs and a decline in profitability. However, there are chances of the outlook returning to stable if the company is able to stay competitive with its peers in terms of profitability without increasing the level of risk.Shares of Capital One have gained 16.6% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 20.9%.

301,COF,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Capital Oneis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for COF in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.16 per share for COF, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for COF, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.44% heading into earnings season.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that COF has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Capital One, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

302,COF,"Two major consumer loan providing companies — Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) — are slated to announce third-quarter 2017 results tomorrow, after market close. Let’s check out which stock is likely to report better earnings.Capital OneCapital One is projected to witness an improvement in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. This is likely to be driven by increase in net interest income (NII).Given the improving economy and purchase volume growth, credit card loans continued to rise during the quarter. This will aid Capital One’s credit card NII. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for credit card NII of $3.38 billion indicates a 2.7% rise from the last quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial banking NII of $583 million shows 2.5% growth on a sequential basis. Nevertheless, NII for consumer banking division is anticipated to decline 3.7% from the prior quarter to $1.52 billion.Therefore, we believe Capital One will report an increase in total NII in to-be-reported quarter as rising interest rates will further support growth. Also, fee income will likely witness a rise mainly attributable to higher interchange fees.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $6.83 billion reflects 5.6% year-over-year rise.On cost front, operating expenses are expected to marginally trend upward. Specifically, marketing expenses should remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.15 shows 6% growth from the prior-year quarter. Also, our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for Capital One as it has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Card Interest Income to Drive Capital One Q3 Earnings?)Also, Capital One has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteDiscover FinancialDiscover Financial is expected to record a fall in revenues in the third quarter.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.87 billion shows 18.8% year-over-year decline.Revenue performance is mostly likely to be dismal due to its Payments Service segment, which has been a drag over the past several quarters. This quarter is expected to be no different. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its total transaction volume (in dollar terms) is $46.8 billion, down 6.6% from the last quarter.Further, card sales volume, which was a major revenue driver in the prior quarter, is projected to show a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for card sales volume (in dollar terms) of $32 billion reflect a marginal decline sequentially. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for total credit card volume (in dollar terms) of $34.9 billion indicates an 1% fall from the prior quarter.Additionally, Discover Financial’s extensive promotional activities are likely to result in an increase in total expenses, thus impacting the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.53 shows an 1.9% decline from the prior-year quarter.Also, our quantitative model predicts that the chances of earnings beat for Discover Financial are low. The stock has Earnings ESP of +1.24% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lower the predictive power of Earnings ESP. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.(Read more: Can Card Sales Drive Discover Financial's Q3 Earnings?)Discover Financial has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise  Discover Financial Services Price and EPS Surprise | Discover Financial Services QuoteOur TakeFrom both sales and earnings perspective, Capital One is well positioned to report better Q3 results. Also, the stock is likely to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

303,COF,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Tuesday, Oct 24, after market close. The company is expected to witness a rise in net interest income (NII) in credit card and commercial banking divisions while NII for consumer banking segment is likely to fall.Driven by improving economy and purchase volume growth, credit card loans (part of broader consumer loan portfolio) continued to increase during the quarter. This will support Capital One’s credit card NII. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for credit card NII of $3.38 billion shows a 2.7% sequential rise.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial banking NII of $583 million shows 2.5% growth on a sequential basis. However, NII for consumer banking division is expected to be $1.52 billion, down 3.7% from the prior quarter.Overall, we believe Capital One will report an increase in total NII for to-be-reported quarter as rising interest rates will further support growth.Other Factors to Impact Q3 ResultsModest fee income growth: Like the prior quarter, Capital One is expected to witness a rise in its fee income in the to-be-reported quarter. As the quarter is likely to show increased card usage, interchange fees (major part of its fee income) are expected to rise.Marginal increase in expenses: Similar to the prior quarter, operating expenses are expected to trend upward in the third quarter. Specifically, marketing expenses will likely remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Asset quality to worsen: While improvement in card loans is leading to increase in interest income, Capital One will continue to witness a rise in credit card delinquency rates. Also, the company expects a rise in auto businesses charge-off rate of nearly 15-20 basis points in the third quarter, owing to accounting changes in the timing of charge-offs of bankrupt accounts.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:The chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is +0.44%.Zacks Rank: Capital One currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the predictive power of ESP.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has been revised nearly 1% downward over the last 30 days to $2.15, with four out of 11 estimates moving lower. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 6%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $6.83 billion indicates 5.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Franklin Resources, Inc.

304,COF,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Oct 13, 2017)Important Earnings of the Week1.

But many of these platforms don’t have a minimum requirement and are fairly low cost.Here’s some ideas for those who want to invest, not simply trade.For Those Who Don’t Want to Think About Anything1.      AcornsBoth Eric and Danny use acorns.com. Their tagline is “automatically invest spare change.”It operates only as an app. You link it to your credit or debit card and it will round up to the next dollar amount. For example, if you buy a coffee that is $3.75, it will round up to $4.00 and take the $0.25 and put it into your investing account. You can also set up a recurring investment, either daily, weekly or monthly, to boost your balance.It has pre-set ETF portfolios you can invest in that range from aggressive to conservative.The cost is $1 a month up to $5,000 in the account wherein there’s a yearly fee of 0.25%.2.      StashStashinvest.com allows you to buy into pre-set ETF portfolios including ones titled “The Activist”, “The Techie”, “The Globetrotter” and “The Trendsetter.”This is thematic investing.Stash also offers ROTH IRA accounts that you can start with as little as $50.Similar to Acorns, it also charges $1 a month and the 0.25% yearly fee when the account reaches $5,000.Want to Move Up to the Next Level?Motif offers investing in portfolios, trading and IPOs so it is more advanced than the other two platforms.Through its portfolio program, you can invest in a preset plan or you can create your own. This means you already have to know something about stocks.It appears to have a minimum of $1,000 and the cost is $9.95 a month.Actual Trading PlatformsAlready have an idea of stocks or ETFs you want to buy?You probably need a platform that allows you to trade.Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) offers the Sharebuilder Plan which allows you to do a recurring investment each month in stocks, ETFs or mutual funds for just $3.95 per investment.For example, it can buy $100 worth of shares of Alibaba on the third Tuesday of every month.Tracey has used this plan for nearly 17 years. You might be surprised at how quickly this type of investing adds up to something substantial if you do it a few years in a row.For those who want to do more active trading, Capital One Investing has a trading platform as well, as do the well-known brokerage firms such as eTrade (ETFC  -  Free Report) and Schwab (SCHW  -  Free Report).That’s where you put in an actual order on the open market to buy, for example, Alibaba.This is more advanced investing and trading.The Hardest Part is StartingThere are a lot of investing platforms available now and it may seem confusing.But as Eric and Danny discuss, the key is to just start.Eager to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

Other card issuers Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) also underwent CCAR and received non-objection from the Federal Reserve with respect to their proposed capital actions.The capital plan by American Express was passed by the government, signifying that the company possesses adequate capital and that its capital structure is stable under various stress-test scenarios. It also implies that planned capital distribution, in the form of dividends and share repurchases, is viable and acceptable in relation to the regulatory body’s minimum capital requirements.With this announcement, American Express has delivered on its promise and brought some relief to its investors, who were otherwise pessimistic over the stock that is caught in a web of trouble.  In 2016, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to 32 cents per share, after approval from the Federal Reserve.The most recent dividend hike is the fifth by the company since Nov 2007.

309,COF,"Georgia-based Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV  -  Free Report) turned out to be a potential buyer of the financial unit of outdoor goods retailer, Cabela's Incorporated . Recently, the bank completed the purchase of Cabela's banking operation — World's Foremost Bank — which issues store-branded credit cards.Further, the bank subsequently resells the credit-card portfolio to Virginia-based Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report), while holding back about $1.1 billion in deposits.Per the terms, Synovus received $75 million from Cabela’s and Capital One. The bank will likely deploy the proceeds for funding, including balance-sheet restructuring activities, debt repayment and capital distribution.BackgroundBass Pro Shops — retailer of outdoor gear and apparel — was supposed to purchase the retail business of Cabela's in October 2016, while Capital One Financial was supposed to buy the banking unit. However, the deal did not materialize as the bank was undergoing the anti-money-laundering controls’ probe which delayed regulatory approvals.Therefore, Cabela's sold the financial unit to Synovus, which holds $30 billion in assets and has 250 branches across the south.Earlier in September, Synovus received the regulatory approval from the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System for the acquisition.Nonetheless, the deal was also subject to the completion of the merger of Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops, which has received regulatory approvals, as well as the nod from Cabela’s shareholders. Per the deal, Bass Pro acquired Cabela’s for $61.50 per share in cash, representing an aggregate transaction value of approximately $5 billion.ConclusionSynovus’ results have been quite decent in the last quarter. We believe the company’s focus on both organic and inorganic growth, together with cost-containment efforts, will gradually pay off and aid bottom-line expansion in subsequent years.Moreover, the deal will likely provide additional liquidity for organic growth. This, in turn, will help the company achieve long-term targets, which include return on assets of 1% and efficiency ratio to remain lower than 60%.Another finance company worth considering includes The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), which recorded upward earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

The Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance in its just-concluded September meeting was the primary reason for increased investors’ optimism for banks.While the downsizing of balance sheet was expected, what surprised the market was the Fed signaling four more rate hikes over the next 12 months.

311,COF,"On Sep 20, 2017, we issued an updated research report on Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report). The company is currently facing deteriorating asset quality and continued rise in operating expenses. These are expected to keep the company’s bottom line under pressure in the near term. However, its top-line growth might alleviate some pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised nearly 1% downward over the past 60 days. Similarly, for 2018, earnings estimates have declined 1.4% over the last 60 days. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Also, shares of Capital One have gained 1.8% over the past three months compared with 3.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Capital One’s asset quality has been deteriorating over the last couple of years, with both provision for credit losses and net charge-off rates witnessing a rise. The same trend continued this year as well. Credit quality is expected to remain under pressure due to losses in auto portfolio and U.S. card business.Additionally, elevated non-interest expenses are a big concern for Capital One. Expenses have been mounting at a compound annual growth rate of 4% for the last five years (2012-2016), with the trend continuing in the first half of 2017. As the company continues to invest in franchise and grow inorganically, expenses are projected to remain elevated in the near term.Nevertheless, revenue growth looks promising for Capital One driven by higher loan demand and acquisitions. Over the last few years, it acquired the online banking unit of ING Direct USA, HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBC  -  Free Report) U.S. credit card business, Beech Street Capital and GE's healthcare unit.

312,COF,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks has been bullish. Though a tepid trading revenue outlook from some of the major banks indicates a bleak earnings picture, the rising 10-year Treasury bond yields supported bank stocks.

314,COF,"Over the last five trading days, investors’ pessimistic stance continued for the banking stocks. Release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting indicated a divide over the timing of interest rate hikes. The primary reason for this is the expectation of inflation staying below the Fed’s targeted level of 2% for an extended period.While banks, at present, are reaping benefits from higher rates (easing margin pressure and increase in interest income), it now seems uncertain when the next rate hike will occur. This is perhaps one of the reasons that affected investors’ confidence in the banking stocks to some extent.Also, disbanding of President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council and the Strategy & Policy Forum indicate continued disruptions happening in the White House. Though this development is not likely to directly affect several proposed policy initiatives that are expected to strengthen the economy, investors now seem to be concerned over the timing.Apart from these macro factors, banks continue to reel from litigation and regulatory probes. Legal headwinds pertaining to business malpractices in the pre-crisis period persist.On the other hand, banks are intending to boost profitability through streamlining strategies. Also, with an aim to focus more on diversifying revenue base, banks are increasing market share in lucrative sectors.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Aug 11, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

A lawsuit has been filed in the federal court in Manhattan by three public pension funds against six major banks. In the suit filed by the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, Orange County Employees' Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association, the banks have been accused of collaborating and conspiring to remove competition from the stock lending market.The accused banks are Bank of America Corp.

(GS  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG.In the stock lending market, investors can sell a stock without owning it through a process called short selling. Investors or firms borrow stock with the help of agents by paying a fee and then sell it expecting to buy it again in the future at a lower price.Some upstart lending platforms were developed to help various borrowers and lenders interact directly without the use of middlemen.However, the above mentioned banks have been accused of trying to boycott and hence block the development of such lending platforms over the years. This was done to remove competition from the lending market and thereby charge higher fee from borrowers who wanted to engage in short selling. The act is in violation of the federal antitrust law.Moreover, in order to prevent borrowers from going to other places in the market to get better prices, the banks had created a lending platform of their own called EquiLend LLC.

However, the bottom line declined 11.4% from 79 cents per share earned in the year-ago quarter.Results were driven by higher revenues on the back of increased originations. However, an increase in costs, lower net finance and other income, and deteriorated credit quality perhaps disappointed investors. As a result, the stock lost 3.7% after the announcement.Net income came in at $265 million, down 6.5% from the prior-year quarter. The company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $14 million, or 4 cents per share for the reported quarter.Revenue Growth Partially Offset by Rise in CostsTotal revenue amounted to $1.69 billion, up 0.6% year over year.Net finance and other interest income totaled $1.14 billion, down 5.3% year over year. The decline was primarily due to a combination of lower retail installment contract (RIC) balances and higher cost of funds stemming from a rise in benchmark rates.Other income decreased by 35% from the prior-year quarter to $24.4 million.Operating expenses increased 3.7% year over year to $282 million. Constant investment in compliance and control functions led to the rise.As of Jun 30, 2017, net finance receivables, loans and leases were $35 billion, 3% higher than the Dec 31, 2016 figure. Further, total originations of $5.2 billion surged 6.6% from the prior-year quarter. Credit Quality WeakensSantander Consumer’s credit quality deteriorated in the quarter. Provision for credit losses increased 1.7% year over year to $521 million. Further, the total net charge-offs ratio increased from 6% to 7.5% for the quarter ended Jun 30, 2017. Also, end-of-period delinquency ratio was 4.7%, up from 4.2% in the year-ago period.Capital and Profitability RatiosAs of Jun 30, 2017, Santander Consumer’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio came in at 14.3%, rising from 12.6% as of Jun 30, 2016.Return on average assets declined to 2.7% as of Jun 30, 2017 from 3% as of Jun 30, 2016. Also, return on average equity was down to 19.1% from 24% recorded in the year-ago quarter.Our TakeWe believe that with the improvement in disposable income and consumer spending, Santander Consumer will primarily benefit from a rise in auto finance. However, a rise in provision for credit losses will restrict bottom-line growth.Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.

Also, it compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.76.Better-than-expected results were attributable to higher revenues and easing margin pressure.

Also, net interest margin increased 15 basis points (bps) year over year to 6.88%.Non-interest income grew 6% year over year to $1.23 billion.

All cost components, except amortization of intangibles, and communications and data processing, rose year over year.Efficiency ratio came in at 50.92% compared with 52.69% in the year-ago quarter.

Further, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III Standardized Approach was 10.7% as of Jun 30, 2017, down from 10.9% as of Jun 30, 2016.Our ViewpointThe company’s strategic acquisitions – General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) healthcare-related loans and its Healthcare Financial Services business, HSBC Holdings plc’s (HSBC  -  Free Report) credit card business and ING Direct USA, the online banking unit of ING Groep NV (ING  -  Free Report) – over the years have supported its financials.

324,COF,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, a decline in non-interest income, an increase in provisions and higher expenses were responsible for Capital One lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher net interest income (NII) and easing margin pressure supported the results to quite an extent.Also, the company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history, as it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 4.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90 for the to-be-reported quarter has also been revised more than 1% downward in the last 30 days.The price performance of the company has also been disappointing. Capital One’s shares fell 6.5% year to date compared with the Zacks categorized Financial - Consumer Loans industry’s decline of 4.6%.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are quite low. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. But, this is not the case here as elaborated below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is -1.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.87 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90.Zacks Rank: Capital One currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which reduces the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsStable Revenues: A decent increase in commercial and credit card loans in the quarter should led to a rise in Capital One’s net interest income. Also, higher rates are expected to support the company’s NII to some extent.However, as the performance of the auto industry remained relatively weak, the company may witness a slightly weaker demand for auto loans. Hence, overall revenues are likely to remain more or less stable.Marginal Increase in Expenses: With moderate improvement in loan balances, marketing expenses are anticipated to rise slightly.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter results on Jul 21. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

325,COF,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind.

During its Investors’ Day presentation held this week, Wells Fargo came out with impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets. The bank also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80%, from 55-75% it had set in 2016. However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates. The bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Considering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank stated that it expects the restriction’s impact on its after tax net income to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that modest growth in loans and deposits balance helped reduce the impact to about $100 million.3.

The deal, expected to close later this quarter, is expected to result in one-time gain for Capital One.Notably, in November 2017, Capital One had announced its intention to stop issuing residential-mortgage loans and home-equity lines of credit.

336,COF,"Major banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results over the last five trading days managed to record bottom-line improvement, driven by rising rates, stable asset quality and lower taxes. Apart from the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results reflected a slight improvement in lending activities.However, higher expenses and slowdown in mortgage banking business continued to be major headwinds. Also, it seems that the guidance provided by management didn’t meet investors expectations. Thus, the performance of banks over the last five trading sessions was bearish.Apart from first-quarter earnings releases, a huge penalty for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines. The bank’s business misconducts have even led to several probes into its business activities.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 20, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

The bank has been penalized for alleged customer abuses at its mortgage and auto lending businesses. The company agreed to pay $1 billion (in total) to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Both the regulators fined Wells Fargo for wrongly charging fees to borrowers who wanted to lock in an interest rate on a pending mortgage loan and for sticking auto loan clients with insurance policies they didn't want or require. Notably, the company admitted that tens of thousands of its customers who could not afford the combined auto loan and extra insurance payment fell behind on their payments and had their cars repossessed.Nevertheless, these allegations are separate from the bank’s sales practice scandal that erupted in September 2016.As a result of this huge fine, Wells Fargo adjusted its first-quarter 2018 earnings by an additional $800 million accrual. This lowered the company’s first-quarter net income by $800 million or 16 cents per to $4.7 billion or 96 cents per share.Nevertheless, this isn’t the end of litigations/probes for Wells Fargo. The company’s wealth management business, currency trading operation and retirement-plan services unit are reportedly under investigation by several regulators.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: Company Last Week6 monthsJPM-1.2%9.3%BAC-0.6%9.3%WFC-0.2%-4.5%C-1.2%-5.5%COF-6.5%0.0%USB0.7%-5.4%PNC1.1%6.8%In the last five trading sessions, PNC Financial was the major gainer, with its shares gaining 1.1%.

Also, its steady capital deployment plan reflects a strong balance sheet position. However, persistently increasing expenses are expected to hurt bottom-line growth to some extent.

340,COF,"Shares of CIT Group Inc. (CIT  -  Free Report) declined 1.2% following the release of its first-quarter 2018 results. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 74 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents. However, this was above the prior-year quarter’s figure of 54 cents per share.Results were adversely impacted by a decline in net interest revenues and higher provision for credit losses. These were partly offset by lower expenses, a rise in non-interest income and a strong balance sheet.After considering several non-recurring items, the company reported net income of $97 million or 74 cents per share, down from $180 million or 88 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Stable, Expenses DeclineTotal net revenues for the quarter were $495 million, relatively stable year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $481 million.Net interest revenues were $270.7 million for the quarter, down 7.5% from the prior-year quarter.Total non-interest income was $358.3 million, increasing 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Net finance margin decreased 12 basis points to 3.45%.Operating expenses (excluding restructuring costs and intangible assets amortization) were $275.3 million, down 5.1% from the prior-year quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet charge-offs were $50 million, surging 78.6% from the prior-year quarter. Also, provision for credit losses came in at $69 million, increasing 38% year over year. The rise was mainly due to a $22 million charge-off of a single commercial exposure and a higher level of reserves primarily within the Commercial Finance division of Commercial Banking.However, non-accrual loans decreased 8.5% year over year to $237 million.Strong Balance Sheet & Capital RatiosAs of Mar 31, 2018, interest bearing cash and investment securities amounted to $10.1 billion, comprising $3.9 billion in interest bearing cash and $6.2 billion in investment securities. Further, there was approximately $0.2 billion of non-interest-bearing cash.As of Mar 31, 2018, Common Equity Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 14.0% and 16.7%, respectively, as calculated under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules compared with 14.3% and 15.1% in the prior-year quarter.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, CIT Group repurchased 3.7 million shares for $195 million.Additionally, the company received no objection for the amended 2017 capital plan from the Federal Reserve. This increased the approved equity distributions to up to $900 million for the first half of 2018.Our ViewpointThe company's business-streamlining initiatives are expected to improve efficiency, going forward. Also, its efforts toward becoming a leading regional commercial banking institution through restructuring are commendable. However, despite certain cost-savings measures, expenses are expected to increase due to the company’s strategic initiatives and continued investments in the franchise.CIT Group Inc.

Yet, an increase in expenses was the undermining factor.Sallie Mae’s (SLM  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 core earnings of 27 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Earnings growth was supported by an increase in net interest income and non-interest income. The private education loan portfolio and deposits grew considerably. However, these positives were offset by elevated expenses and poor credit quality.Navient Corporation’s (NAVI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted core earnings per share of 40 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Results reflected lower revenues and a rise in expenses. However, lower provisions were a tailwind.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

343,COF,"QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Apr 25. Both Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (“QCT”) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (“QTL”) segments are anticipated to generate lower revenues in the quarter on a sequential basis.Whether this will lead to lower earnings remains to be seen.Top-Line WoesThe company expects higher-than-normal seasonality to affect its fiscal second-quarter results due to near-term inventory build in the handset market and ongoing impact of non-paying licensees. The fiscal second quarter is typically a seasonally high quarter for QTL revenues and a seasonally low quarter for QCT. Qualcomm expects that the lower QTL margins, due to higher litigation expenses as the impact of Apple nonpayment, is more pronounced in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, QTL revenues are also likely to be affected by softer sell through due to lower demand in China. Qualcomm expects QTL revenues to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in the to-be-reported quarter, down approximately 4% sequentially at midpoint, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1,261 million.Margin for QCT is anticipated to be lower on a sequential basis on lower MSM (mobile station modem) volume, partially offset by benefits from product cost initiatives. We anticipate that fiscal second quarter’s non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be flat to down approximately 2% sequentially, as increased litigation expenses and the reset of Employee Benefit taxes are more than offset by the absence of the prior bad debt charge. Qualcomm expects QCT revenues of $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion in the quarter, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3,861 million, down sequentially from $4,651 million.Stiff competition in the Chinese market has added to the concerns. Moreover, Qualcomm has been facing challenges from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip as well as handset manufacturers’ SoC (System on Chip) projects such as Exynos by Samsung. The company is also facing severe competitive threat from Intel, which has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next four to five years, major part of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may exert pressure on Qualcomm’s margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qualcomm is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

344,COF,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results after the closing bell on Apr 25. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, it delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 6.4%, beating estimates twice.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAT&T is gearing up to launch the first standards-based mobile 5G services to consumers in multiple U.S. markets by the end of 2018. The company has been working hard since 2017 to lay the foundation for mobile 5G network and has completed network upgradation in 23 major cities.In August 2017, AT&T deployed 5G technology trials in three new cities — Waco, TX; Kalamazoo, MI and South Bend, IN. In December 2017, the company initiated its largest 5G fixed wireless trial in Waco, partnering with the home and lifestyle brand, Magnolia. The company claims it to be the largest trial in terms of mobile traffic. Notably, completion of 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s first implementable 5G New radio (NR) specification has set the stage for the global mobile industry to start full-scale development of 5G NR for large-scale trials and commercial deployments in 2019.AT&T is also mulling to deploy Open Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) and optical SDN initiatives to its live network. The deployment will be done using multiple vendors and an optical SDN controller integrated into AT&T’s Enhanced Control, Orchestration, Management and Policy virtualization platform, the first of which will be done in Dallas.The ROADM technology helps to automatically manage and adjust optical bandwidth on high capacity fiber optic lines. AT&T already uses ROADMs and SDN controller for its internal management purposes. Now, the company is planning to apply the same to its live network, enabling customers to detect and modify bandwidth, automatically depending on network congestion in different locations. All these measures are likely to boost the company’s revenues in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model conclusively shows that AT&T is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

345,COF,"Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24. The company is expected to witness year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings.Also, the company has a decent earnings surprise history. It topped earnings in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5%.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were supported by higher net interest income and a strong capital position. However, lower non-interest income and higher provisions were the undermining factors.Fifth Third’s shares have gained 4.8% in the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018, against the industry’s decline of 2.4%.Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise Fifth Third Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | Fifth Third Bancorp QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Fifth Third’s stock? That depends largely on whether the firm is able to impress the market with its first-quarter results.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsExpenses Might Increase Slightly: Fifth Third’s ongoing strategic investments in several areas, such as technology, will increase expenses. However, the company might be successful in offsetting the expense rise through its North Star initiatives to some extent.Net Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly on the commercial and industrial front. Thus, loan growth, combined with a rise in interest rates, is likely to boost the company’s NII.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.55 billion indicates 5.8% year-over-year growth.Fee Income Might Rise Slightly: Fifth Third’s focus on strengthening its fee income base through North Star initiatives is likely to lend support. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues.However, poor mortgage banking revenues during the quarter are likely to offset the positives to some extent.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Fifth Third will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Fifth Third is -1.39%.Zacks Rank: Fifth Third carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Also, Fifth Third’s activities in the first quarter were inadequate to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward.

346,COF,"Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31) results on Apr 25, after the market closes. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Improved investment banking drove the company’s fiscal first-quarter 2018 earnings, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was partially offset by elevated expenses.Also, the stock has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.8%.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be reported quarter earnings of $1.63 has been revised 4.1% downward over the last 30 days. Nonetheless, the earnings estimates reflect a year-over-year jump of 27.3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.81 billion indicates 15.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Raymond James Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Raymond James Financial, Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q2 ResultsTrading rebound to lend support: After three consecutive quarters of muted activities, the markets witnessed significant volatility and revival of client activities in the last two months of the quarter. Concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of the monetary policy by the Fed and sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility. Therefore, Raymond James will likely witness an improvement in trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Stable underwriting fees: Unlike prior quarters, growth in underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, is expected to be muted. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances.Further, high volatility in the equity markets across the globe is expected to have somewhat slowed down equity issuances. While the prior quarter was an exception, IPOs and follow-on offerings in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to be modest. Thus, growth in both debt and equity underwriting fees for Raymond James is likely to be muted in the to-be-reported quarter.Muted advisory fee growth: M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally witnessed a fall in the quarter, though the overall deal value recorded a significant rise. Thus, as number of deals declined, advisory fees are expected to be adversely impacted to some extent. So, Raymond James is not likely to remain untouched.Loan growth in RJ Bank to support interest income: With economic stabilization and a rise in demand for loans and higher rates, RJ Bank segment is expected to record a jump in interest income.Expenses to rise: Raymond James consistently hires advisors and invests in franchises and thus, overall expenses are expected to increase. Further, regulatory changes and a highly competitive environment will likely lead to a further rise in expenses.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model shows that chances of Raymond James beating the earnings estimates this time are low. That’s because it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Raymond James is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Raymond James has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further decreases the predictive power of ESP.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.79% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

347,COF,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after market close. The company is expected to witness an increase in total net interest income (NII) on a year-over-year basis.Driven by an improving economy, purchase volume growth and credit card loans (part of broader consumer loan portfolio) continued to increase during the first quarter. This, along with higher interest rates, is likely to support Capital One’s credit card NII.Moreover, the acquisition of Cabela's Incorporated’s credit card operations in September 2017, is expected to further aid credit card NII growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic credit card NII for the quarter is $3.29 billion, which shows 6.2% year-over-year rise. Also, international credit card NII is projected to be $296 million, increasing 17%. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for credit card NII of $3.54 billion indicates 5.7% growth on a year-over-year basis.Further, the consensus estimate for commercial banking NII of $585 million shows 3.5% year-over-year growth. Also, NII for consumer banking division is expected to be $1.61 billion, up 7.5% from the prior-year quarter.Thus, Capital One will likely report an increase in total NII for to-be-reported quarter.Other Factors at PlayModest fee income growth: Capital One is expected to witness a rise in fee income in the to-be-reported quarter. As the quarter is likely to show increased card usage, interchange fees (major part of its fee income) are expected to rise.Marginal increase in expenses: Similar to the prior quarter, operating expenses are expected to trend upward in the first quarter. Specifically, marketing expenses will likely remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Asset quality to worsen: While improvement in card loans is leading to an increase in interest income, Capital One will continue witnessing a rise in credit card delinquency rates. Also, the charge-off rate in auto finance business will likely increase.Now, let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is +0.79%.Zacks Rank: Capital One has a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the predictive power of ESP.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the quarter of $2.31 reflects year-over-year jump of 32%. Also, the consensus estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.95 billion, which indicates 6.4% growth from the prior-year quarter.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25.

While the company is expected to witness year-over-year growth in earnings, revenues might decline.In the fourth quarter, Navient surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings on higher fee income. However, lower net interest income and higher expenses were the headwinds.The company has a decent surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise.The company’s activities during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence, as reflected by 2.4% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings over the last 30 days.

As a result, pressure on net interest margin will likely ease and support its top line.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Navient will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key components.

349,COF,"Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (SC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens. While its earnings for the quarter are projected to remain stable year over year, revenues are expected to decline.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Elevated expenses, and lower net finance and other interest income hurt the results.Nonetheless, the company has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 12.8%.Notably, activities of the company in the first quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 40 cents declined 2.4% over the last 30 days.Further, Santander Consumer USA’s price performance has been disappointing.

QuoteWill the dismal price performance continue post first-quarter earnings release or will the trend reverse? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with improved financials.Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsManagement expects net finance and other interest income to be flat or up 2% sequentially, driven by origination volume. Total other income is projected to be up $55 million to $75 million, given the seasonality and lower Bluestem balances.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $1.61 billion for the quarter, which reflects a decline of 1.1% year over year.Management expects operating expenses to be in the range of $289-$309 million in the to-be-reported quarter. This is up from adjusted expenses of $269 million recorded in fourth-quarter 2017.Driven by improving credit performance and depending on new originations, provision expenses are expected to be down $20 million from the prior quarter. Further, the company expects hurricane benefits to reverse mostly in the first quarter.Now, let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our quantitative model shows that chances of Santander Consumer USA beating the earnings estimates this time are low.

351,COF,"Most banks that reported first-quarter 2018 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of rising rates, lower taxes and improved trading activities. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, banks’ results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, the results show eased margin pressure.Importantly, high volatility led to improved trading activities in the quarter, leading to higher trading revenues for banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor. Nevertheless, legal expenses remained under control. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Apr 13, 2018)Important Earnings of the Week1.

The reported figure was up 44% from the prior-year quarter. Results in the reported quarter included 11 cents per share of mark-to-market gains related to the adoption of new recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.Decent loan growth (driven mainly by improved wholesale loans) and higher interest rates aided net interest income growth. Further, higher equity trading income (up 26%) and fixed income trading (up 8%) supported the top line. Additionally, mortgage banking income witnessed a rise, driven by growth in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by fall in mortgage origination volume.

Though mortgage banking revenues declined, overall non-interest income witnessed year-over-year growth. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent.

352,COF,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after the market closes. Its earnings and revenues in the quarter are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues. Also, growth in assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) were on the positive side. However, rise in expenses acted as a headwind.That said, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 10.7%.Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ameriprise Financial, Inc. QuoteHowever, activities of the company during the first quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.50 for the to-be-reported quarter decreased nearly 1% over the last 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure represents growth of 29.6% on a year-over-year basis.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.12 billion, which reflects an improvement of 7.6% year over year.However, the company’s price performance has not been very encouraging. Its shares have lost 18.2% in the past three months compared with 12.5% decline of the industry.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings release? To a great extent, this depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to influence the quarter’s results.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsAmeriprise has been consistently making efforts to improve business. This is expected to have a positive impact on its profitability during the quarter.Further, we expect Advice & Wealth Management segment’s (AWM) performance to continue driving the company’s results in the quarter. The segment witnessed growth in assets in the previous quarter. Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity, the same is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Although the Asset Management segment witnessed inflows in the fourth quarter, it has been witnessing elevated levels of outflows for the last few quarters. In fact, as the company continues to make changes to enhance financial performance, outflows are expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. This might affect the segment’s performance.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income of $360 million for the quarter represents an improvement of 1.4% sequentially. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for management, financial advice and service fee of $1.70 billion, reflects a decline of 1.5% sequentially.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Ameriprise beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of -4.38%.Zacks Rank: Ameriprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further decreases the chances of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks that you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 23.

353,COF,"Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after market close. Its revenues and earnings for the quarter are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, Zions’ earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and benefit from provisions aided results. However, higher adjusted non-interest expenses was the undermining factor.Also, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched it in one of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.1%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteFactors to Influence Q1 ResultsIncrease in net interest income: Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans (constituting a large part of Zions’ loan portfolio) recorded robust improvement in the first quarter, while growth in commercial real estate loans remained modest. Overall, the quarter witnessed a marginal improvement in lending activities on a year-over-year basis.Thus, modest loan growth along with higher interest rates will likely support the bank’s net interest income in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, Zions expects net interest margin for the first quarter to remain stable sequentially. Benefits from the December rate hike will likely be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yield.Modest fee income growth: Zions’ first-quarter non-interest income will benefit from rise in service charge on deposits as deposit balance is expected to increase in the quarter. Also, as trading activities improved during the quarter, the company’s capital markets and foreign exchange fees are expected to rise.On the other hand, loan sales and servicing income are anticipated to fall as mortgage banking activities continued to be hurt by higher rates. Thus, Zions’ non-interest income is expected to witness a slight increase in to-be-reported quarter.Expenses not to lend much support: Despite undertaking a number of cost control initiatives, Zions’ adjusted non-interest expenses are expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter due to its continued spending on technology systems overhaul and investment in franchise.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is -1.21%.Zacks Rank: Zions has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat.Nonetheless, Zions’ activities in the first quarter encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 83 cents for the quarter increased 1.2% over the last 30 days. It reflects year-over-year improvement of 36.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the first quarter is $666.1 million, which reflects improvement of 7.3% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.79% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

354,COF,"Investors in Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the March 23, 2018 $108 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Capital One Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Capital One Financial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Consumer Loans industry that ranks in the Bottom 47% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.09 per share to $2.26 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Capital One Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

355,COF,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we take a look at the multibillion-dollar business that drives NCAA March Madness after a wild opening weekend for the college basketball tournament.A No. 1 seed lost to a No. 16 seed for the first time ever, big brand name schools busted brackets early, and ratings jumped accordingly. But what might be more fascinating than the craziness on the court is the mind-boggling money that is generated during the event.CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner’s  Turner bet big on the long-term viability of March Madness, committing billions of dollars to broadcast the tournament through 2032. The two media companies broadcast and stream all of the games across an array of networks, and the deal will see them retain the broadcasting rights no matter how fans consume games in the future.On top of these broadcast fees, the NCAA makes millions from tickets and marketing deals. Capital One (COF  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) remain the tournament’s biggest sponsors this year. Meanwhile, companies like Pizza Hut (YUM  -  Free Report) and Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) will be ever present over the next few weeks, while Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) debuted the first advertising campaign for its cloud computing products as part of a new multiyear NCAA partnership.The players themselves will also act as walking, talking, and dunking billboards for Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report).

Millions  are seeking to capitalize on the opportunity by enthusiastically filling in the brackets.Though the championship has diverted a large number of Americans from the stock market and dried up trading volumes, it usually leads to a buying frenzy and strong stock gains. The year 2018 seems no different as the bull market turned nine on Mar 9 and is extending its rally driven by strong corporate earnings, massive tax cut policies and solid economic growth at home and abroad (read: 9 ETFs Winners From 9-Year Bull Run).Being the biggest modern sporting event in the United States, the championship is a money-spinner for media networks (TV, digital and social media) and advertisers, attracting billions of revenues in three weeks.What’s on A Roll?The two TV media conglomerates – CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) and Turner Sports – continued to score the highest revenues from the event by broadcasting through four networks, CBS, TNT, TBS, and truTV. In fact, CBS turned out to be the winner in the first round of the tournament with 4.98 million viewers, up 11% from last year, according to Nielsen final live-plus-same day numbers. Total viewership for the tournament across all linear and digital platforms increased  to 8.6 million, up from 8.2 million last year.Per Kantar Media, the NCAA championship generated about $1.285 billion in total advertising revenues in 2017, up 3.3% from 2016. As such, the event only trails $1.547 revenues generated from the NFL playoffs.All the games will also stream on the NCAA’s March Madness site and via “The NCAA March Madness Live App,” which is available for many devices, including iOS, Android, Roku and Apple TV. Further, social media sites like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Instagram, and Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report) are attracting fans to their respective platforms via media deals with NCAA or Turner Sports (read: Log In to Social Media ETFs on Twitter's Strength).Apart from media, the contest is a boon to the casino industry. According to the American Gaming Association – a national trade group that represents the casino industry – March Madness could  attract $10 billion to the industry. Only 3% will be wagered legally through Nevada sports books while the remaining will be placed with offshore sportsbooks and local bookmakers.Sponsors invest millions in advertising and marketing for March Madness. Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) is one of the biggest sponsors again this year. AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) are the two other corporate champion sponsors.

357,COF,"NCAA March Madness begins Thursday morning, and when the games tip off it marks the start of one of the richest months in sports. But while people around the U.S. begin to stare at scores, check their brackets, and make initial payments on their office pools, let’s take a look at where the real money is made.TV Money Two years ago, at the end of the 2016 men’s college basketball tournament, CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner’s  Turner extended their already-massive March Madness rights deal. The previous 14-year, $10.8 billion deal was set to end after the 2024 tournament. The new contract tacked on eight years and $8.8 billion, and now runs through 2032.The new deal pays an average of $1.1 billion per season, up from $770 million on the current contract, for the roughly three week basketball extravaganza. This is clearly a lot of money to pay for the rights to broadcast and stream just 63 games—not including the play-in games.Yet both CBS and Tuner understand that this continued investment is a well-calculated risk at a time when advertisers flee linear television in favor of Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and other online outlets. Their bet is that live sports will remain a viable money-making business for the foreseeable future.The most recent deal also includes language that will see CBS and Turner own the exclusive rights no matter how people actually consume March Madness content in 2030.“Whatever new platforms develop, we have all of those rights,” CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus told the Wall Street Journal in 2016. “If people are watching on a skinny bundle, a phone or Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) TV, we have the ability to exploit all of those rights going forward.”CBS and Turner share these rights across an array of channels, alternating which network broadcasts the Final Four and championship game. TBS will broadcast the climax of the college basketball season this year, while fans will be able to watch almost all of the games live on streaming services and March Madness Live—though login information is required for TBS, TNT, and truTV games.NCAAThe NCAA pulled in a record $1.06 billion in fiscal 2017, which includes tournament broadcast rights, as well as tickets sales—$129.4 million, including the NIT—and roughly $60 million in marketing rights deals.This money is then used to fund scholarships, stipends, medical insurance, travel, and a slew of other programs for most non-revenue generating sports across the country.Marketing The NCAA Tournament is played at a nearly perfect time in order to generate the most viewership and buzz. The NFL season is over, MLB is just staring to gear up, and the NBA playoffs are still about a month away. Therefore companies pour millions of advertising and marketing dollars into March Madness.Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) is one of the biggest sponsors again this year, with hundreds of commercials scheduled to appear while its name remains splattered all over the official NCAA tournament website—including “The Capital One March Madness Bracket Challenge.”AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) are the two other “presented by” sponsors this year.Sportswear Giants Aside from TV coverage, marketing, and advertising, the players themselves are also walking billboards for three companies.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) will be on display over the next three weeks on the chests, legs, ankles, and feet of nearly every athlete. These companies often provide schools and teams monetary benefits for winning or making it past a certain round of the tournament.Check back later for a complete breakdown of which sportswear company dominates March Madness and how the other two stack up.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

358,COF,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks remained optimistic. Rebound in trading activities (after dismal 2017 performance) is perhaps the primary reason for this bullish price performance.Banks like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expect trading revenues to improve in first-quarter 2018. This is likely to be driven by solid revenues in foreign exchange, emerging markets and equities trading. Specifically, Citigroup expects “low-to-mid” single digit year-over-year increase in trading revenues and JPMorgan projects market revenues to rise in mid-to-high single-digit rate from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, progress in rolling back parts of the Dodd Frank Act cheered investors. The Senate is working on a bipartisan banking bill expected to lower stringent banking regulations. This will likely reduce regulatory compliance cost for several banks.On the other hand, mortgage rates continued to rise, with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.46% (marking the ninth consecutive weekly increase). The rise seems to be attributable to chances of rate hike later this month and impending trade war following the imposition of tariffs. This steady rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity, thereby hurting banks mortgage banking revenues to some extent.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, business misconducts continued to dominate headlines for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 2, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. William Galvin, the top securities regulator of Massachusetts, announced that his office has started investigating the wealth management arm of Well Fargo to see if the division has been steering rollover money into managed accounts or if its employees have been making investment recommendations to clients that are unsuitable for them according to their needs.This investigation comes almost a week after Wells Fargo, in its 10K filling revealed that it was conducting an internal review to assess whether there had been unjustified referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.Wells Fargo had agreed to do a detailed investigation only after facing inquiries from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require.The bank did find that in some cases customers had been overcharged fees in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues of incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.However, Wells Fargo has not yet determined the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing.Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for the bank’s brokerage division, recently said in a statement that the bank has made ""significant progress in our work to identify and fix any issues, make things right and build a better, stronger company.""Thus, Galvin said that his office was seeking information about the scope of Wells Fargo’s investigation. They have asked the bank to give them information regarding “inappropriate referrals of brokerage customers to managed and advisory accounts, unsuitable recommendations of alternative investments, as well as unsuitable referrals and recommendations in connection with 401(k) rollovers.”Galvin said, “Given the recent retirement savings crisis in America, referrals and recommendations involving 401(k) accounts should be closely scrutinized, in light of the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule.”2.

359,COF,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) surged more than 1.2% in late-morning trading Monday after new reports linked the company to the financial industry, suggesting that the e-commerce behemoth’s plans to launch new account services might include a major partnership.Amazon has been in talks with JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) about its proposal to launch a product similar to traditional checking accounts, The Wall Street Journal said Monday. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report indicated that Amazon’s target is younger consumers and people without existing bank accounts.A dive into the financial sector would be another addition to Amazon’s growing list of attempts to influence its customers’ everyday lives. The move would also help the company avoid some of the fees it currently pays financial firms and learn more about people’s income and spending trends.But in talking to JPMorgan and Capital One, Amazon has shown that it does not intend to entirely disrupt the existing structure of the financial business.“Why put up all the capital that’s required to run a bank and why pick up all the extra expense and headache of running a bank when you can go to a Chase and any number of smaller banks and have them license their bank?,” Ali Raza, managing principal at the payments consultancy Blue Leviathan, said to Bloomberg.Amazon already has a few services that might help illustrate its financial vision. For one, the company offers Amazon Cash, a platform that lets users add cash to an Amazon wallet by displaying a barcode in person. This enables customers without a credit card to shop online.Amazon also recently launched Prime Reload, which rewards users with a 2% bonus is they use their debit card to transfer money from a bank account to an Amazon balance. By handling the transaction themselves, Amazon can avoid paying fees to Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report).Want more market analysis from this author?

361,COF,"Over the last four trading days, volatility in the stock market has affected the banking stocks as well. The main highlight was the release of the Fed minutes of the January FOMC meeting. The latest report highlights that improving economic growth, stimulus from the recent tax cuts and rise in inflation support a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Further, given the growth in economy, low unemployment rate and healthy consumer sentiment, the demand for loans and other related products of banks will rise. Overall, though these will be beneficial for the banks’ financials, the markets seem to be wary of such a scenario. Thus, this led to significant volatility and bank stocks’ performance turned bearish over the last four trading sessions.Mortgage rates were also on an upswing, with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.40% (highest since April 2014), as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, efforts to strengthen profitability persisted. Further, past business misconduct continued to haunt over the last four trading days. Moreover, banks are undertaking initiatives to pass on the benefits from lower tax rates to employees and shareholders.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 16, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

In March 2017, the rating agency had rated U.S. Bancorp’s senior unsecured and subordinated debt as A1.Moody’s initiated the review on account of the $613 million settlement that U.S. Bancorp had agreed upon with several U.S. regulatory bodies last week due to shortcomings in its anti-money laundering and willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.Ratings for U.S. Bancorp’s subsidiaries along with its bank subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association, have been placed for review. U.S. Bank’s long-term deposits rating of Aa1, issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1, baseline credit assessment (BCA) of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2(cr) are also under review. However, short-term ratings of Prime-1 for short-term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review.Following the legal settlement, Moody’s felt the necessity to review whether the company’s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors. Though, the settlement amount was beyond Moody’s expectations, it anticipates U.S. Bancorp’s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact.The rating agency will be considering whether U.S. Bank’s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified. Also, the changes in board processes along with oversight and the ability to guide management in identifying and mitigating potential future risk will be reviewed.U.S. Bancorp’s enterprise-wide risk governance, asset quality and operational risks will also be in focus of the review process. Notably, the company remains exposed to the risk of coming into light some other breach of law, which would lead to a violation of the two-year deferred prosecution agreement that the company had agreed upon with the regulators.4.

362,COF,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.5% in the past month, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COF due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Capital One Q4 Earnings Improve Y/Y, Costs UpCapital One fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.62 per share increased 2.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $1.83.Results benefited from a rise in revenues and easing margin pressure. Also, the quarter witnessed a rise in loan and deposit balances. However, increase in provisions and expenses were the undermining factors.After taking into consideration charges related the tax act and other non-recurring items, net loss for the quarter was $971 million or $2.17 per share. This compared unfavorably with prior-year quarter’s net income of $791 million or $1.45 per share.For 2017, adjusted earnings per share of $7.74 were up 7% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $7.47. After considering several notable one-time items, net income was $1.98 billion or $3.49 per share, down from $3.75 billion or $6.89 per share in 2016.Revenue Growth Supports ResultsNet revenues were $7.01 billion, up 7% from the prior-year quarter. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.12 billion.For 2017, net revenues grew 7% year over year to $27.24 billion. However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.37 billion.Net interest income increased 7% from the prior-year quarter to $5.81 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 18 basis points (bps) year over year to 7.03%.Non-interest income increased 7% year over year to $1.2 billion. The increase was mainly driven by a rise in net interchange fees, partially offset by a decline in other income, and service charges and other customer-related fees.Non-interest expenses of $3.78 billion increased 3% from the year-ago quarter. All cost components, except amortization of intangibles, occupancy and equipment, marketing and professional services, rose year over year.Efficiency ratio came in at 53.89% compared with 56.03% in the year-ago quarter. A decrease in efficiency ratio indicates improved profitability.Credit Quality WorsensNet charge-off rate surged 41 bps year over year to 2.89%. Further, provision for credit losses rose 10% from the year-ago quarter to $1.93 billion.Also, the 30-plus day performing delinquency rate jumped 30 bps year over year to 3.23%. Likewise, allowance, as a percentage of reported loans held for investment was 2.95%, up 30 bps year over year.Strong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, loans held for investment were $254.47 billion, up 1% from the prior quarter. Total deposits, as of the same date, increased 2% sequentially to $243.7 billion.Total stockholder’s equity was $48.73 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, a decline of 3% from the previous quarter.Profitability Ratios Deteriorate, Capital Ratios ImproveReturn on average assets was negative 0.95% at the end of the reported quarter against 0.91% in the year-ago quarter. Also, return on average common equity was negative 8.14% against 6.48% in the prior-year quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.8%, up from 11.6% in the prior-year quarter. Further, common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III Standardized Approach was 10.3% as of Dec 31, 2017, up from 10.1% as of Dec 31, 2016.OutlookManagement expects the impact of growth math to gradually decrease in 2018. This means that the year-over-year increase in delinquencies and charge-off rates are expected to decline gradually, as new loan balances in the front book season become a larger proportion of the overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book.In the long term, management remains optimistic about deriving efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains.In Consumer banking segment, the charge-off rate will increase gradually and loan growth will moderate.For 2018, management expects effective tax rate to be around 19%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

363,COF,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks has been bullish. The 10-year Treasury bond yields escalated at four-year highs on higher-than-expected inflation. Positive economic growth, along with central banks’ moves globally to improve interest rates from ultra-low levels, boosted yields which supported bank stocks, encouraging investors to focus more on bank stocks.Additionally, investors’ confidence received a boost from President Trump’s much-awaited $200-billion infrastructure plan that rolled out earlier this week.Mortgage rates were also on an upswing, hitting a nearly four-year high of 4.38%, as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Increase in mortgage rates will limit reduce refinancing activity.Further, strategies to enhance profitability through streamlining operations, and resolution of litigations and probes related to legacy matters and business misconducts persisted in the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

364,COF,"Stock market correction seems to be in the offing as over the last five trading days extreme volatility was witnessed. The banking stocks are not untouched by this.It all started last Friday when January job and wage data was released. Needless to say, wages grew at the fastest pace last month in more than eight-and-a-half years. Though this indicates an improving economy, it raised fears of rise in inflation, in turn, reinforcing assumptions of a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Additionally, a two-year budget deal announced by top senators will likely further strengthen the economy, thus giving the Fed all the more reason to raise rates. This also drove up the bond yields.While indications of an improving economy and expectations for a more hawkish Fed stance are beneficial for banks on the whole, overall markets seem to be wary of such a scenario.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated the headlines for all the wrong reasons.

371,COF,"Investors in Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 26, 2018 $85.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Capital One Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Capital One Financial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Consumer Loans industry that ranks in the Top 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.07 per share to $2.09 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Capital One Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

All cost components, except amortization of intangibles, occupancy and equipment, marketing and professional services, rose year over year.Efficiency ratio came in at 53.89% compared with 56.03% in the year-ago quarter.

Also, deteriorating credit quality remains a major near-term concern. In fact, asset quality is likely to continue remaining under pressure due to losses in the auto portfolio and U.S. card business.Capital One Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteCapital One carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

373,COF,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 23, after market close. The company is expected to witness a rise in total net interest income (NII) on a year-over-year basis.Driven by improving economy, purchase volume growth and seasonality, credit card loans (part of broader consumer loan portfolio) continued to increase during the fourth quarter. This, along with higher interest rates, is likely to support Capital One’s credit card NII.Moreover, the acquisition of Cabela's Incorporated’s credit card operations, completed in September 2017, is expected to further aid credit card NII growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic credit card NII for the quarter is $3.38 billion, which shows 9.4% year-over-year rise. Also, international credit card NII is projected to be $304 million, increasing 15.6% year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial banking NII of $594 million shows 5.1% growth on a year-over-year basis. Also, NII for consumer banking division is expected to be $1.52 billion, up 1.4% from the prior-year quarter.Thus, we believe Capital One will report an increase in total NII for to-be-reported quarter.Other Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsModest fee income growth: Capital One is expected to witness a rise in its fee income in the to-be-reported quarter. As the quarter is likely to show increased card usage, interchange fees (major part of its fee income) are expected to rise.Marginal increase in expenses: Similar to the prior quarter, operating expenses are expected to trend upward in the fourth quarter. Specifically, marketing expenses will likely remain elevated with rising loan growth opportunities.Asset quality to worsen: While improvement in card loans is leading to an increase in interest income, Capital One will continue to witness a rise in credit card delinquency rates. The company expects domestic credit card charge-off rate to be in the high 4-5% range in 2017.Now, let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of Capital One beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of a positive earnings surprise.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Capital One is -0.04%.Zacks Rank: Capital One currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Activities of the company in the fourth quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the quarter remained stable at $1.85 over the last seven days. However, the estimate reflects year-over-year improvement of 27.6%.Notably, considering the growth in the last two years, management remains confident about delivering EPS growth (excluding adjusting items) in the range of 7-11% for 2017.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $7.12 billion, which indicates 8.5% growth from the prior-year quarter.Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Capital One Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Synovus Financial Corp.

375,COF,"On Jan 4, 2018, we issued an updated research report on Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report). Driven by loan growth and strength in its credit card and online banking businesses, the company remains well positioned for top-line improvement. While, mounting expenses and deteriorating asset quality might hurt bottom-line growth, given a solid liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.The company’s price performance also looks encouraging. Its shares have gained 14.5% in the past year, outperforming 6.3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Further, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has also been revised 2.1% upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Capital One’s revenue growth looks promising driven by higher loan demand and acquisitions. In the last few years, it has acquired the online banking unit of ING Direct USA and HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBC  -  Free Report) U.S. credit card business, which has been largely driving revenues. In fact, the acquisition of Cabela's credit card portfolio further supports its growth prospects.Moreover, the company’s Domestic Card, which accounts for more than 85% of its Credit Card net revenues has shown solid loan growth and purchase volume growth. Given the domestic economic recovery, the company’s Credit Card segment should continue to show strength.A geographically diversified loan and deposit portfolio remains another positive for the company. Many of the company’s strategic decisions and inorganic expansion plans over the last few years have helped it counter economic challenges.However, elevated non-interest expenses remain a concern for Capital One. As the company continues to invest in franchise and grow inorganically, expenses are projected to remain elevated in the near term, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Also, Capital One’s asset quality has been deteriorating over the last couple of years, with both provision for credit losses and net charge-off rates witnessing a rise.Other Stock to ConsiderA couple of other stocks worth considering in the same space are Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.Ally Financial’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has remained stable over the last 30 days. Its shares have gained 49.5% in the past year.Discover Financial’s earnings estimates for 2017 have also remained stable over the last 30 days.
