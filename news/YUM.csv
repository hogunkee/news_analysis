1,YUM,"Grubhub (GRUB) is the IBD Stock of the Day, and it could be poised to make tasty gains as it flirts with a buy point.XThe Chicago-based online and mobile food ordering company has carved out a niche by delivering meals from a wide variety of local restaurants.Its ordering platforms allow diners to order from more than 80,000 takeout restaurants in over 1,600 cities in the U.S., while the company has branched out to cover the English capital of London. The firm's brands include Grubhub, Seamless, Eat24, AllMenus and MenuPages.The stock was down 2.8% at 104.77 on the stock market today, dropping back below a 105.78 entry. Grubhub initially broke out from a double bottom base last week, but volume was so-so. It also hit resistance at its prior high afterward.While Grubhub set an intraday high of 113.61 on Tuesday, the stock finished well below that mark, and its Relative Strength line that day didn't hit a new high, a bearish sign. But if Grubhub can top its 113.61 high in big volume, that would be a buy signal.Meanwhile, the stock boasts excellent fundamentals, which is reflected in its unbeatable IBD Composite Rating of 99. It also boasts a top notch EPS Rating of 99.Amazon (AMZN), which has its own food delivery service, was down 0.4%. As well as smaller outlets, Grubhub also delivers from the likes of Jack In The Box (JACK) and Denny's (DENN). Back in February it signed a partnership with Yum Brands (YUM) to be its exclusive online delivery partner for Taco Bell and KFC.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Its value has risen by around 140% from its closing mark of 43.88 this time last year, reducing the odds for another big run-up.The Relative Strength has also been lagging and has slid this week. Ideally, the line will hit a new high before the stock breaks out. But if not, then look for the line to at least follow the stock in tandem to a new high, confirming a buy signal.In addition, the stock has been enjoying annual EPS growth above 25% for the past three years, a key CAN SLIM requirement.

7,YUM,"If you like a quick bite, you might keep in mind the fast food business is changing. Fast. McDonald's (MCD) is rapidly expanding its self-service offerings. And it is competing with Yum Brands (YUM), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Wingstop (WING) and many others to develop home delivery options.All aim to eat into what some analysts estimate to be a $180 billion takeout and delivery market.Grubhub (GRUB) has taken up a key post in that battle. At the same time, its stock has taken up a position just below a 112.51 buy point in a cup base.McDonald's said Monday it plans to expand the number of restaurants offering self-service kiosks by 1,000 per quarter for the next two years. That would place a self-service option at more than half of the burger joint's locations by the end of 2020.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe company has also brought aboard Uber Eats to provide delivery services for 5,000 of its restaurants.Uber Eats, Grubhub and DoorDash are the three top names rolling up restaurant deliveries through online ordering channels. All are early movers in consolidating the online delivery space. Uber Eats has the backing of its deep pockets parent. But Grubhub, the only publicly traded name among the three, has been rapidly consolidating smaller regional delivery plays since its launch in 2014.And it has some deep-pocket backing of its own. Yum Brands bought a $200 million piece of the Chicago-based company in February. Yum owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. Last year, Grubhub paid $288 million for Yelp's Eat24. It also acquired Groupon's OrderUp, as well as Boston-based Foodler.As with most retail and delivery markets these days, the big question resides in the shade of Amazon.com (AMZN). In September, the paradigm-crushing e-commerce giant shored up its food delivery stance with the acquisition of Olo.Grubhub shares hunkered down for five weeks following the announcement. Then they broke out on Oct. 25, and have since climbed 90%.The stock reset its base count with a deft undercut of a flat base in February. So it's current base technically counts as a first-stage structure — a positive for the stock. But shares have already run up more than 150% since an April 2017 breakout, so be cautious.An unexpected move by McDonald's or a surprise announcement from Amazon could easily send investors scrambling to lock in a profit.

8,YUM,"Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund owes much of its success in investing in growth stocks to great team work. And this top-performing mutual fund's team is bigger than most funds' — big enough to field a baseball team.The $1.5 billion Federated Kaufmann Small Cap(FKASX) has nine portfolio managers. Each covers stocks in industries in which they have expertise. As a result, the portfolio recently has been investing in growth stocks such as Veeva Systems (VEEV), Grubhub (GRUB), Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS), RealPage (RP) and Tyler Technologies (TYL). All are market leaders with IBD EPS Ratings of 90 or higher and Relative Strength Ratings ranging from 99 to 83.This year through June 30, investing in growth stocks like these have brought gains ranging from 24% by enterprise software maker RealPage to 86% by upscale winter wear maker Canada Goose.Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund has another trait that stands out. The portfolio has held many of its heavy-hitting stocks since they first came to market.With its team of experts working together to find new companies that the fund can hold long-term, this top mutual fund as of Dec. 31 has beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. That feat makes it a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd it's won the award in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and small-cap funds. And that's no easy feat: Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.Fund lead manager Stephen DeNichilo, 42 years old, has been with federated since 2012 and has 20 years investment experience. He discussed his fund's hot streak and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from his team's offices in Manhattan.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportBeyond Q2: Stock Fund Managers' Outlook NowMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Nine portfolio managers guide this fund. Why so many?DeNichilo: There are two lead managers, me and John Ettinger. Each portfolio manager has buy and sell discretion. ... Each manager focuses on different sector verticals — technology, biotech, consumer, financials, software and so on. Industrials, materials and energy are my areas. Our arrangement brings buy and sell decisions closer to the research process.IBD: You've outpaced the broad market in four varying time periods. What enables the fund to outperform so consistently?DeNichilo: The consistent focus of our process. Our sole focus is to find innovative, growing companies regardless of the macro environment's noise.We at Federated have used the same philosophy on our flagship Kaufmann Fund (KAUAX) (now a $6.6 billion midcap growth portfolio) for 30 years. And members of the small-cap fund's team have been working together on average over 15 years.IBD: Why use so many portfolio managers rather than analysts?DeNichilo: When you have companies that are small and growing 15%, 20%, 30% sequentially, things are moving very fast. You need to be on top of those. Our process brings the portfolio manager closer to the research process. The closer, the better. And on top of it, we have senior managers — I am one of them — monitor the portfolio, monitor risk management. They provide a sort of check and balance.IBD: Why does your fund participate in so many initial public offerings?DeNichilo: The team analyzes virtually every IPO that comes to market. I would say, broad brush, we buy anywhere from 25% to 50% of IPOs we see, varying widely throughout the years based on the quality of deals.Each IPO is vetted by the sector PM, who often has a solid working understanding of the company and market segment before the deal comes to market.Over 50% of the fund's holdings were initially bought on IPO. That's one of the most inefficient parts of the market. And buying at IPO gives us a first-mover advantage with a stock.IBD: Why has Veeva Systems trended higher the past couple of months?DeNichilo: This is a stock we've owned since the IPO. It has a fantastic combination of experienced leadership who know what to build and how.This is a SaaS (software as a service) solutions company for the life sciences market. Sort of a Salesforce.com (CRM) for life sciences.They have a proprietary content management platform that's used for medical promotions and regulatory-clinical trials. And it enables their customers to move critical functions in regulatory submissions and manufacturing quality to the cloud. They have a knack for hiring people with deep industry knowledge, who work closely with customers to build what their most advanced customers want, and apps that can be tailored and integrated for high levels of customer success.IBD: Grubhub's earnings per share growth has sped up for three quarters. Why?DeNichilo: This is another name we bought on IPO. They're in an enormous and rapidly growing total adjustable market. They stand to benefit. They're expanding into additional cities. They're signing major restaurant chains like Yum Brands.There's some concern about competition from Uber Eats and DoorDash. But we think the market is large and growing, with room for more than one player. And Grubhub has first-mover advantage and a strong brand name.IBD: Enterprise software maker RealPage has eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds. What's this feeding frenzy about?DeNichilo: This is another stock we bought on IPO in 2010. They are a real estate software company that helps solve huge inefficiencies in the property management vertical.They enable property managers to better manage renter life cycles and property management workflow. They are a leader in helping apartment owners manage their property, their tenants, their buildings, schedule repairs and take rental payments.They have a huge amount of recurring revenue, a nice history of hitting their numbers and they are a nice consolidator in the industry.IBD: After two quarters of declining EPS, Canada Goose posted gains of 39%, 48% and 166%. What do you like about them?DeNichilo: We think there's big growth in the consumer functional luxury space. Canada Goose is successful in their wholesale business, and is in the early stages of developing its retail business with just a handful of stores in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. And it's moving its brand beyond winter garments into an all-seasons assortment.The company limits distribution and inventory growth to maintain premium pricing and avoid discounting, which is the death knell for any retailer. Sales have grown in excess of 30% (annually). We think estimates for only 25% growth will prove conservative.IBD: Tyler Technologies is in the same IBD enterprise software group as RealPage. It provides IT management services and software for various levels of government. Why is that attractive to you?DeNichilo: They are a SaaS company for municipalities. They make government more efficient. Their software automates processes. It's used in everything from public safety to small-claims arbitration. It lets everything be done online.IBD: Government is often rapped for being slow and resisting change.DeNichilo: After the financial crisis, when municipalities found themselves in fiscal trouble, they saw the payback and return on investment for using Tyler was so large that they couldn't ignore it.IBD: What's your thesis for Novanta (NOVT), which makes photonics and motion control systems?DeNichilo: We think they are still an undercovered company on Wall Street. Management has done a fantastic job turning the company around, pivoting from cyclical to secular areas. Now they're focused on such secular growth areas as 3D printing, DNA sequencing, robotic surgery and warehouse automation.Novanta allows customers' (devices) to have precise movements down to the micron level. They've reduced their semiconductor exposure from 50% of revenue to less than 10% today. And they're focusing more on industrial automation and next-generation medical processes.IBD: What's the appeal of At Home Group (HOME)?DeNichilo: They're a value player that is taking share in retailing. They showcase a broad, inexpensive assortment of home decor in large-format stores. They were created out of the bankruptcy of the former Garden Ridge.Their productivity remains relatively low with significant opportunity for growth in same-store sales. They have plenty of real estate opportunities as other large-format stories like Sears and Kmart close.They have ability to grow 20% annually. They're not online currently, but that's a longer-term opportunity.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Millennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A MillionaireYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

9,YUM,"The major indexes showed little willingness to surrender last week's fine gains as big-cap growth, semiconductor, oil-related and some defensive names flexed strength in late trading Monday.XOn the negative side, certain health care groups — namely drugstore chains, drug distribution companies, hospitals and home-based care providers — slid hard. Video-game software developers cooled off as well.The Nasdaq composite was off around 0.2% at 3 p.m. ET, following a nearly 1.5% gain last week and a 1.1% lift in the prior week. Apple (AAPL) defied the small drop, rising 0.3% to 155.80. The megacap tech is now less than 1% away from climbing back above the 156.75 buy point in an 11-week flat base. The stock, however, remains below its 50-day moving average.Apple's 78 RS Rating belies a significant rally since the stock broke out on Jan. 6-9 past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares have rallied as much as 39.6% since triggering that proper entry.IBD's TAKE: The cup with handle is one of the most important chart patterns that every growth investor can learn in order to master the timing of buying outstanding companies during a confirmed market uptrend. Learn more about this historically proven chart pattern and others by reading the Investor's Corner archives.The S&P 500 was off nearly 0.2%, and the Dow Jones industrials shed less than 0.1%. Volume is running sharply lower vs. the same time Friday.The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF was practically at break-even. At 147.60, the index ETF is up 37% since IBD's The Big Picture column noted a rare Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016.Priceline (PCLN) helped push the travel booking group into the top 10 winners of the day, rising 0.9% and moving further above the 50-day moving average. Shares are forming a shallow base since hitting a peak at 2,067.99.The current base by the top online travel booking firm is now more than eight weeks long and features a 14.2% decline, or within the maximum 15% correction allowed for a flat base. On Aug. 9, shares gapped down in massive volume after Priceline, which also owns popular digital properties including TripAdvisor and OpenTable, reported Q2 results.Priceline is expected to post mild double-digit profit growth this year (up 11% to $74.79 a share) and in 2018 (up 15% to $86.31 a share). The megacap leisure-sector play has a market cap of $94 billion and a very respectable EPS Rating of 90, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.Watch to see if Priceline can 1) hold above its 50-day moving average, and 2) improve its 80 Composite Rating, on a scale of 1 to 99.One negative in Priceline's current base: It has yet to show an up week in above-average volume. However, the week ended Sept. 1 featured a 3.2% gain in higher weekly turnover, and the stock earns a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating on a scale of A to E. A grade of C+ or better indicates net institutional buying over the past 13 weeks.Elsewhere in the market today, Yum China (YUMC) held on to  strong gains as it broke out of a second-stage cup-like base at 42.22. The stock gapped up at the open and rushed more than 5% higher to 43 in volume running more than 90% above its 50-day average.As reported by IBD on Thursday, the China-focused chain that was spun off by Yum Brands (YUM), owner of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut fast food outlets, reported a solid 6% increase in same-store sales in Q3. Total sales picked up 8% to $2.04 billion, the best year-over-year gain in five quarters.Earnings rose 8% to 52 cents a share, according to data from William O'Neil + Co., and are seen accelerating to a 12% increase in Q4 to 19 cents a share.One headwind for Yum China is mediocre performance by the Retail-Restaurants group. It's ranked within the bottom half of IBD's daily rankings of 197 industry groups and subgroups for six-month relative price performance.

10,YUM,"McDonald's (MCD) stock surged Monday as a new value menu helped lift first-quarter earnings and sales above Wall Street forecasts, dispelling fears it would do the opposite.The fast-food giant unveiled its $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu in January, prompting worries among franchisees that receipts would drop. Instead, McDonald's found that customers who bought from the value menu tended to purchase more items than customers who didn't.CFO Kevin Ozan told analysts on a conference call that customers often created their own meals with items on the value menu, and others ordered regular combo meals and added something from the value meal. In addition to the value menu, McDonald's Signature Recipe Burgers also boosted sales, he said.EPS rose 22% to $1.79, the second straight quarter of accelerating profit growth, topping Zacks views for $1.67. Revenue fell 9% to $5.14 billion, better than forecasts for $4.9 billion.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

McDonald's stock also sank in March after an analyst warned that the $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu — the company's revamped menu for cheap eats — had gotten off to a ""tough start"" amid a swarm of discounts from rivals.Some restaurant operators, in a recently-published survey from Kalinowski Equity Research, also said the $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu was ""confusing"" and lacked ""compelling items that anybody wants.""Others had more tempered optimism.""This price point, in light of labor costs and food & paper costs, will be hard for competitors to match long term,"" one franchisee said in the survey.

24,YUM,"At Taco Bell, Brian Niccol was seen as a turnaround artist of sorts. He was an early believer in mobile ordering. Nacho fries, Doritos Locos Tacos, Quesalupas and breakfast? All of them appeared on Taco Bell's menu on his watch.X But as he prepares to take the helm at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) in March, leaving the Yum Brands (YUM) unit, a similar approach — possibly resulting in a more mobile Chipotle with more food choices and a better loyalty program — would raise new questions about the assembly-line format, pared-down menu and higher ingredient standards that once won it praise from Wall Street.Niccol's appointment, announced late Tuesday, has generally made analysts happy and taken a massive weight off its stock. Shares sprinted 15.4% higher to close at 289.91 in the stock market today. Chipotle stock has fallen for more than two years, hitting a five-year closing low Tuesday, following food-safety concerns and continuing disappointing sales.But restaurants' efforts to allow people to order via smartphone have occasionally chafed with the actual locations themselves. Starbucks (SBUX) has been trying to untie the knots of customer traffic that have formed at its locations due to the popularity of its mobile order and pay service. As delivery proliferates, others, like McDonald's (MCD), have had to tweak how they manage the flow of cars through their parking lots as they roll out mobile ordering and delivery.Ivan Feinseth, research director at Tigress Financial, said moving food-prep duties like cutting vegetables off-site could help Chipotle move customers through lines more quickly as digital orders grow. A new loyalty program, paired with a mobile app, could mean fewer cash payments — which slows down lines — from consumers willing to pay more, he said.""They don't reward their loyal customer base,"" he said. ""Taco Bell has a very robust loyalty and mobile ordering app.""Chipotle Mexican Grill has already introduced second-make lines, or lines that sit behind the main ordering stations, to handle digital orders. During its Q4 call, Chipotle said wait times have fallen on those lines. It plans to have second-make lines in at least 30% of its restaurants by the end of this year.Feinseth also called for the company to expand delivery and open for breakfast — something McDonald's doubled down on in 2015 to turn its sales around. He said Chipotle could easily do a breakfast burritos and bowls menu. Mexican-blend coffee, he said, along with plain coffee, wouldn't hurt either.Those changes would be possible, he said, without deviating from Chipotle's core menu. And he remains upbeat that people will respond to new additions.""While people do like simplicity and consistency, the quick-casual industry also drives traffic by change,"" he said.The fast-casual Mexican chain's new products, so far, have had mixed reception. People said the queso was too gritty. Others said its brand of chorizo, a combination of pork and chicken, was not chorizo-y enough.What's more, Chipotle is not Taco Bell. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, in a research note, said that Chipotle's sales trends are in far worse shape than Taco Bell's were when Niccol joined that chain in 2011.""The guys at Chipotle tried a lot of things,"" said John Zolidis, president at Quo Vadis Capital. ""They didn't just sit there waiting for the customer to come back.""Zolidis said Chipotle's higher food standards — ""Food with Integrity"" and the like — may have also made it more difficult to bring in new menu items.""I don't think Taco Bell was holding itself to that same standard,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How McDonald's Will Invest $6 Billion In The U.S. Through 2020Restaurant Brands Doubles Payout: Dividend Yield Now Tops McDonald's, Wendy's

25,YUM,"Fast food giant Yum Brands (YUM) beat earnings estimates but missed expectations on sales in its Q4 earnings report Thursday. Meanwhile, the parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza announced a partnership with online food delivery firm Grubhub (GRUB).X Yum Brands earned 96 cents per shares, a 25% jump vs. a year earlier. That easily beat estimates for 80 cents  according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue fell 22% vs. a year earlier to $1.577 billion. That largely reflects franchising efforts. But that missed views for $1.607 billion.Same-store sales grew by 3% at KFC, 1% at Pizza Hut and 2% at Taco Bell divisions. Worldwide comps grew by 2%.Yum Brands also reported a special one-time charge of $434 million in the fourth quarter related to the repatriation of foreign earnings due to the Trump administration tax reforms.Shares in Yum Brands fell 4.8% to 76.30 on the stock market today, closing below its 200-day moving average for the first time since last April. The stock is ranked 11th in the IBD's Retail-Restaurants Group and has a Composite Rating of 67. Last Friday it plunged through its 50-day moving average line, a key technical support level.""Despite headwinds from refranchising dilution and lapping a 53rd week, we delivered full-year core operating profit growth of 7%,"" Yum's president and CFO David Gibbs said in a press release. ""We are on track with our strategic transformation to accelerate growth and made significant progress toward achieving these objectives in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

This raised pretax proceeds of $1.1 billion.Its global franchise ownership mix increased to 97%. KFC opened 539 international restaurants during the quarter, Pizza Hut opening 340 and Taco Bell opening 134.Separately, Yum Brands struck a deal with Grubhub to be its exclusive online delivery partner for Taco Bell and KFC. Yum will buy $200 million of stock in the online business, which will provide Grubhub with funds to accelerate the expansion of its delivery network.Grubhub, the leading provider of online ordering and food delivery services, also reported earnings Thursday, with revenue of $205.08 million, up 49% and beating the consensus estimate of $201 million. Its stock soared 27.4% to 89.04, hitting a record 94.89 intraday.Meanwhile, Yum China (YUMC), which was spun off from Yum Brands at the end of 2016, posted a quarterly loss Wednesday. This was partly due to a one-time tax charge of $164 million stemming from the changes to U.S. tax law.The firm's adjusted EPS of 19 cents beat estimates by two cents, rising 11% year-over-year. Revenue climbed nearly 13% to $2.228 billion, clearing views for $2.158 billion.Yum China's stock fell 7.45% to 41, tumbling below its 50-day line and a recent 43.65 buy point.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED INAmazon Will Now Deliver Whole Foods Groceries To Your House In Two HoursFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru WindowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineTaco Bell Founder Glen Bell Popularized Mexican Fast-Food Fare

26,YUM,"Shares of Restaurant Brands International (QSR) jumped Monday morning, helped by strong fourth-quarter sales at Burger King, and the fast-food operator's move to more than double its quarterly dividend.X Restaurant Brands declared a first-quarter dividend of 45 cents per share, up from a 21-cent-per-share dividend declared in October.The move makes its dividend yield the highest among franchised rivals, RBC said in a research note Monday.""Based on the current stock price, this implies a 3.2% yield — well above that of franchised peers including McDonald's (MCD) (2.5%), Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) (2.4%), Yum Brands (YUM) (1.8%), Wendy's (WEN) (1.8%), and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) (0.9%),"" RBC analyst David Palmer said.For the fourth quarter, the company earned 66 cents per share, a 50% jump, above Zacks forecasts for 57 cents. Revenue climbed 11% to $1.234 billion, missing Zacks estimates for $1.259 billion.Same-store sales at Burger King rose 4.6%, better than the 2.5% gain forecast by Consensus Metrix.Same-store sales at Tim Horton's — which last year launched a mobile app and new espresso drinks — ticked up 0.1%, short of expectations for 1.2% growth.At Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen same-store sales growth dipped 1.3%, better than the 1.5% decline expected.Shares leapt 6.1% to 59.95 in the stock market today, but found resistance at the 50-day moving average. On Friday, shares tumbled intraday to their worst levels since late April.Restaurant Brands in recent years has grown through acquisitions, most recently by snapping up Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen last year.""We believe these trends/sales momentum likely continue as compares remain easy and BK continues to leverage its scale and innovative pipeline to compete on value,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note released shortly after the company's earnings.He said he was also pleased to see Tim Hortons same-store sales stay in positive territory and would be looking for more detail, during Restaurant Brands' earnings call, on how the company might turn things around at Popeyes. Palmer also said he'd be looking for more commentary about restaurant competition in Canada.Restaurant Brands' results follow those of McDonald's late last month, when the company said it would invest roughly $6 billion over the next few years, in part to bring more technology to its restaurants.McDonald's stock rose 1.9%. Wendy's edged up 0.45%. Yum Brands, which rallied Friday from its 200-day line on its Grubhub (GRUB) delivery alliance and mixed earnings, fell 1.6%.

29,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on Tuesday clocked a fourth-quarter same-store sales increase that just beat estimates, but the fast-casual Mexican chain sees 2018 comps decelerating from last year.X The forecast comes as analysts wait for new leadership to step in and offer clarity on how the company plans to rebound following a handful of food-safety scares over the past two-or-so years.Chipotle on Tuesday said was making ""good progress"" on its attempts to find a new CEO. The company said in November that it was looking for a new chief executive with ""demonstrated turnaround expertise"" to replace Steve Ells, who founded the company in 1993. Ells, Chipotle said, would become executive chairman once the search concluded.How that progress might sit with Wall Street remains unclear. Cowen analysts said in a research note this month that survey data indicate that Chipotle's ""quality as well as value perceptions are near trough levels both among the general population as well as the brand's core 18-34 year old consumer base.""""Upcoming efforts to improve these measures and in turn drive sales are unclear until a new CEO is hired,"" they added.The company on Tuesday forecast same-store sales gains in the ""low single digits"" this year, compared to a 6.4% boost seen in 2017.In a statement, Ells said that ""while there is still work to be done, we are starting to see some success,"" in the turnaround efforts.For the fourth quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.9%, above Consensus Metric forecasts for a 0.7% gain. Revenue rose 7.3% to $1.1 billion, missing estimates for $1.117 billion.Chipotle earned $1.34 per share during the quarter, when factoring out a 21-cent per-share bump it got due to the GOP's tax legislation. That was better than views for $1.33.Shares rose 1.2% after hours in the stock market today, after rising in the minutes following the earnings' release.Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM), which reports Thursday, was unchanged after hours. El Pollo Loco (LOCO) picked up 0.5%. McDonald's (MCD), which reported earnings last week, rose 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The company said it planned to invest more than a third of the savings resulting from the Trump tax cuts into its employees. CFO Jack Hartung said Chipotle would make its managers and crew eligible for one-time cash and stock bonuses, and improve other benefits.In the days leading up to Tuesday's earnings, some analysts wondered whether Chipotle would use the occasion to announce a new chief executive.Chipotle's stumbles have resulted in Monty Moran's departure from the role of co-CEO in 2016. The company has also shaken up its board and spent more to strengthen its safety standards. It has focused on new menu products and ways to improve traffic and the experience of dining there overall.The launch of Queso didn't do as much for sales as expected, although the company changed the recipe after customers complained that it had an off-putting, grainy texture. Chipotle also faces more competition from smaller rivals that have used the Chipotle formula — serving food marketed as higher quality on an assembly-line format — for their own success, Cowen said.Already, as Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote last month, two ""dream candidates"" for the CEO job at Chipotle had apparently been ruled out.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) CEO Patrick Doyle, who will step down from that position in June, had been seen as one potential candidate. But at the company's investor day in January, Doyle suggested the speculation about what he'll do post-Domino's wasn't close to accurate.""There are all sorts of conspiracy theories out there on what I'm going to do and every single one of them is incorrect,"" he said.Ron Shaich, the former CEO of Panera Bread who was also a rumored candidate, was perhaps bit more direct, tweeting: ""why in the world would I ever leave Panera to go try to solve Chipotle's problems?""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Options Play Helped Control Earnings Risk With Restaurant BrandsJack In The Box Sells Qdoba In Hot Year For Restaurant MergersDomino's Pizza Shows Improved Relative Strength; Still Shy Of Benchmark

Also joining the e-commerce giant as partners are Yum Brands (YUM) chain Pizza Hut, Uber Technologies, Mazda and Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing.""This announcement marks a major step forward in our evolution towards sustainable mobility, demonstrating our continued expansion beyond traditional cars and trucks to the creation of new values including services for customers,"" Akio Toyoda, the automaker's president, said in a statement Monday.Toyota's news comes as major car manufacturers and tech giants gather this week in Las Vegas at CES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show, to showcase whole suites of products meant to overhaul human mobility. Auto companies from General Motors (GM) to Tesla (TSLA) as well as interlopers like Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Waymo are racing to bring fully self-driving cars to market, and the payoff will be massive for the ones who pull it off first.Toyota's vehicle unveiled at CES — called the e‐Palette concept — will come in three sizes and sport open interior layouts with flat floors to allow users to outfit them according to their companies' needs. The larger vehicles resemble small buses and allow adults to stand up inside. The company suggested they could even be reconfigured as mobile hotel rooms.""We're constantly looking for ways to innovate and help improve our logistics operations, and in this partnership with Toyota we'll collaborate and explore new opportunities to improve the speed and quality of delivery for our customers,"" Tim Collins, vice president of Amazon Logistics, said in an emailed statement.In the near term, the alliance will focus on developing the battery-electric e-Palette, which will have an open‐source control interface that allows partner companies to install their own automated driving systems instead of Toyota's, if desired. In addition, Toyota will provide an array of services to help e-Palette customers use their vehicles, including leasing and insurance support and fleet management. Users will also have access to its global communications network and a so-called Toyota Big Data Center.""What's unique about our system is we offer all the software, all the hardware and all the financial tools you would need to run mobility as a service, soup to nuts,"" Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said. The process is intended to be cashless, allowing users to make payments automatically once they've gained access to the vehicles with smart keys or a facial recognition system.Pizza Hut, which built its reputation on sit-down pizza service, said its partnership with Toyota could help it deliver more pizza faster, with driverless cars potentially helping during particularly busy times, like Super Bowl Sunday.Even though driverless delivery is still a few years off, the tie-up with Toyota could make the company's delivery system safer and more efficient by analyzing driver data, according to Artie Starrs, who runs Pizza Hut's U.S. operation.The largest of the three major pizza chains in the U.S., Pizza Hut has lagged behind its rivals on technology and struggled to shed its roots as a sit-down dining destination in an industry where delivery is king.""It's an incredibly symbiotic relationship,"" Starrs said. ""This reinforces Pizza Hut as a delivery-centric brand.""Toyota is not alone in exploring such concepts. Ford Motor (F) conducted a test this past fall with Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to gauge consumer appetite for driverless-pizza delivery. Nissan Motor (NSANY) plans to unveil at the Hanover Motor Show in Germany in September a driverless van that can transfer packages from central warehouses to surrounding homes. GM plans to have its self-driving cars ready for a ride-share service next year.Toyota has small stakes in launch partners Uber and Mazda and is already seeking additional partners to either utilize the self-driving vehicles or help develop the technology. Didi, the only China-based company joining the alliance, will cooperate globally with Toyota, according to an emailed statement.Toyoda, 61, is a scion of Toyota's founding family who's served as president of the carmaker since 2009. He's said frequently the company needs to accelerate the pace of its technological innovations. He's also said that since Toyota can't create the future of mobility all by itself, it needs to get better at creating partnerships, even with companies like Amazon, which he cited in August as a potential competitor.""The automobile industry is clearly amidst its most dramatic period of change as technologies like electrification, connected and automated driving are making significant progress,"" Toyoda said.The automaker plans to have the self-driving fleets available at Tokyo's 2020 Olympic Games. Additional testing, including in the U.S., will begin in the early 2020s.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Nvidia Shares Break Out On Autonomous Car Deals, Can They Stay Up?

43,YUM,"Yum Brands (YUM) on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped forecasts early Thursday.XEstimates: Wall Street expects the company, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, to report earnings per share of 61 cents, down 19%, with revenue dropping by more than half to $1.412 billion. Same-store sales are seen up 2.2%.The EPS and revenue estimates reflect the spinoff of its China business, now called Yum China (YUMC), late last year.Results: Yum earned 68 cents a share. Revenue was $1.45 billion. Same-store sales rose 2% worldwide. Pizza Hut's global same-store sales fell 1% in Q2 vs. Taco Bell's 4% gain and KFC's 3% advance.Stock: Shares sank 2.4% to 74.78 on the stock market today. Yum hit a record high on Wednesday.Before the results, Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski raised his full-year EPS forecast on the company. Taco Bell, he said, continued to stand out by virtue of ""not being a burger brand,"" and efforts to keep its menu fresh.Among those efforts? Naked Chicken Chips — that is, seasoned white-meat chicken, in chip form, with nacho cheese sauce. Kalinowski said the promotional push for those chips during the quarter appeared to pay off.Meanwhile, he said, results out of Pizza Hut will likely be uninspiring through the rest of the year, as rivals Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) pull ahead of the industry with delivery technology.But he appreciated some of the company's recent efforts: Pizza Hut last month said it had developed a ""proprietary delivery network algorithm"" that can predict delivery times while factoring in weather, traffic, construction and other things that might affect a pizza's journey to a customer's doorstep. Kalinowski also said he expected Pizza Hut to launch a loyalty program sometime this year.Papa John's (PZZA) last month announced that customers could order food via Facebook (FB). Papa John's shares jumped Tuesday after the company a day earlier announced a $500 million hike in its buyback plan and said it would raise its leverage ratio, even though it reported second-quarter North American same-store sales that missed expectations.RELATED:McDonald's Touts Digital Progress; Domino's Falls HardBurger King Parent Restaurant Brands Earnings Top, Sales MissChipotle, Wynn Resorts, U.S. Steel, Hawaiian Earnings Top

The company, Palmer noted, believes it could eventually increase its store count to at least 20,000 in the nation, up from around 7,600 today.That expansion, Palmer said, would come from ""entering new markets with established or planned infrastructure investments that include high-speed railways, roads, schools and hospitals.""Palmer also said KFC China had ""turned the corner,"" citing in part the launch of a loyalty program, the introduction of mobile payments and the simplification of its menu.

I think that that's what you're seeing more and more of.""Another way to grow is to simply swallow another company whole, as in the case of Restaurant Brands International (QSR).The parent of Burger King and Canada's Tim Hortons outlets, Restaurant Brands is growing by acquisition, recently closing the buyout of Popeye's Chicken and adding the fried-chicken chain to its portfolio of burgers, coffee and doughnuts. The decision was broadly well-received.""I think it gives (Restaurant Brands) an interesting growth vehicle down the road,"" said Hottovy, adding that demand for fried chicken could be particularly appealing to the company's franchising partners abroad.Following a quarter of weaker-than-expected same-store sales growth in North America, Restaurant Brands' management sounded bullish on expanding Popeye's abroad.""One of the reasons we get really excited is the ability to accelerate the pace of growth, both in the U.S. and Canada, and all around the world,"" said Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz about the deal, on the April 26 call to discuss first-quarter earnings.For the quarter, profit of 36 cents a share marked 20% year-over-year growth and topped consensus by 2 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $1 billion, exceeding estimates for $990.3 million. But weak year-ago sales comparisons, including a 2.2% decline at Burger King's U.S. restaurants and a 0.2% dip at Tim Hortons' Canadian locations, marred the consensus beat.A certain Big Mac maker might have been to blame for the same-store-sales slips. In a world filled with artisanal burgers and trendy Shake Shack (SHAK)-type eateries, McDonald's (MCD) ubiquity still provides enormous power.""The comps were a little bit softer than what people were expecting, and I think probably you can trace a good portion of that back to McDonald's success,"" said Hottovy. ""A comp point for McDonald's has a much more disproportionate impact on the rest of the industry, just given its size and scale.""But it's worth keeping in mind that for Restaurant Brands, same-store sales growth isn't necessarily the most significant metric.""In a virtually 100% highly franchised business model like (Restaurant Brands), unit openings drive more operating leverage than comps,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles noted the day after earnings were released. He has a market-perform rating on the restaurateur with a 54 price target. And Piper Jaffray's Nicole Miller Regan reiterated her overweight rating and 66 price target.""Continued execution against the company's strategic blueprint as well as cash flows being returned to shareholders at an increasing rate (i.e., recently raised dividend now yielding 1.3%) remains the key catalyst,"" she wrote in late April.To be a fast-food giant in 2017 almost seems quaint, given the trends toward customized meals, natural and organic fare, and millennial-friendly experiences. But Burger King, the Pepsi to McDonald's Coca-Cola, remains engaged in a heated rivalry with the Golden Arches as both attempt to align their technology with modern customers.Burger King is reportedly debuting mobile payments soon. That feature is currently in test mode in the Miami area, according to Bloomberg, citing Burger King head Jose Cil on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant Brands tried to break out of a two-month-long flat base on April 25, immediately retreated the next day and then mounted another breakout on May 5 and hasn't looked back since. Shares continue to reach new highs. The company is currently ranked fourth in IBD's Retail-Restaurants Group, behind Dave & Buster's (PLAY).There's no national release date yet, but no doubt the Whopper maker is eyeing McDonald's plans to debut a mobile-order-and-pay platform in 20,000 locations by the end of 2017. Both lag behind Starbucks' robust mobile-order-and-pay system, an app feature that has become so popular, so quickly, that it actually wound up creating congestion in many locations a couple of quarters ago.Hottovy considers all three big foodie names winners, despite the macro pressures.""Some of the efforts McDonald's has done has put them in the winners' camp, and I think that's had a halo effect over probably Restaurant Brands as well as Dunkin' (DNKN) at this point,"" said Hottovy, adding that Starbucks would still be considered a winner despite not being at the top of its game.Both the BK parent and McDonald's have performed well in recent months. After struggling to break out of a flat base with 58.08 entry point, Restaurant Brands shares rose decisively into buy range on May 5. Its Relative Strength rating, which pits its performance against the S&P 500, is a solid 87.McDonald's recent ascent has been even sharper, gapping up 5.6% on its April 25 earnings report.As far as growth is concerned, McDonald's might have to contend with an ever-larger rival. After all, Restaurant Brands was born of a 2014 merger between 3G Capital-backed Burger King and Tim Hortons.The company will ""probably continue to look for more acquisitions in the future,"" said Hottovy.  ""Tough to say exactly where, but I think it gives them nice new growth and cost-cutting opportunities at the same time.""And Restaurant Brands is not totally immune to the charms of novelty items.

53,YUM,"Yum China (YUMC), the Yum Brands (YUM) spinoff in charge of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations in China, jumped late Thursday after the company reported strong same-store sales growth and expanded its shareholder returns.XEstimates: EPS of 55 cents on revenue of $1.995 billion. Yum China began trading in November. Same-store sales are expected to increase 2.9%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Flat EPS of 53 cents on revenue of $2.038 billion. Same-store sales jumped 6%.Comps at KFC, whose presence in China is the largest of the three chains, rose 7%, above views for a 5% gain. Pizza Hut has been a weak spot for the company, but its same-store sales were flat — better than forecasts for a 2.2% dip.The company said it had increased its buyback plan from $300 million to an aggregate $550 million. Yum China's board has also OK'd a regularly quarterly cash dividend and declared an initial cash dividend of 10 cents per share.Stock: Shares popped 2.3% to 40.90 after-hours in the stock market today, closing in on a 42.22 entry.

Mobile payments accounted for more than 45% of the company's sales in the quarter.""In this quarter, our strategic initiatives on digital and delivery continued to show encouraging development, which we believe will enable our long-term growth,"" Pant said in a statement.""The connection with our over 120 million loyalty members is getting stronger,"" he added. ""The growth in mobile payments and cashless settlement methods for sales continued to outperform previous quarters.""Yum China last month said it had launched a new restaurant, called KPRO by KFC, in Hangzhou, China. That concept, intended to draw the nation's ""burgeoning population of urban professionals,"" has what it calls a ""greenhouse"" layout and a seasonal menu. The restaurant also has digital kiosks, mobile ordering and ""Smile to Pay"" facial recognition payment technology from Alipay.RELATED:Restaurant Stocks To Watch As Winners Emerge: Investing Action PlanMcDonald's Stock Is Near Buy Zone Again As Sales Fears EaseMcDonald's Clears Key Benchmark, Hitting 80-Plus RS Rating

"
59,YUM,"Domino's Pizza (DPZ) on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, though the bottom line was aided by an accounting change.XEstimates: Earnings per share of $1.22, a 27% jump, on 11% revenue growth to $631 million. System-wide same-store sales were expected to rise 6.5%, while international franchise comps were seen up 3.2%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: EPS of $1.27 on revenue of $643.6 million. The adoption of new accounting guidance earlier this year shrank Q3's provision for income taxes and boosted EPS by 7 cents.Domestic same-store sales jumped 8.4%, though that's down from 9.5% growth in Q2, and international comp sales grew 5.1%.Stock: Shares closed down 3.9% at 201.03 on the stock market today, after falling more than 6% in premarket trading. On Wednesday, Domino's shares had crept closer to a 221.68 buy point in a cup-shaped base. Rival Papa John's (PZZA) fell 1%, and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands (YUM) dipped 0.3%.The earnings come shortly after Domino's Pizza Group, a large franchisee for the pizza chain in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe, reported Q3 same-store sales growth of 8.1% in the U.K., topping estimates, according to a Nomura-Instinet research note.Weaker international results, particularly in parts of Europe, weighed on Domino's second-quarter results, which were reported in July.CEO Patrick Doyle, during the company's earnings call at that time, cited weaker consumer confidence in U.K. and issues around ""making sure we're getting value right"" in the nation. But he said that even as food-delivery options grow in the U.K. and the U.S., business hadn't been affected. And he said at the time that the problems in Europe were ""known and fixable.""Shares at that time also sank in part on weaker operating margins, the sense that the company's tax rate accounted for much of its EPS, and that no accelerated payouts were announced after a recapitalization.IBD'S TAKE: While delivery has largely been pizza's domain, more options, from chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Jack in the Box (JACK), have become available.Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, in a research note on Wednesday, said that worries over Domino's international difficulties were likely to be ""short-lived."" While he said that the company was heading into more difficult comparisons in the U.S., he liked the company's prospects, citing ""explicit value"" in the company's $5.99 Mix and Match offering and a ""growing technology and delivery moat.""Still, Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said that with more companies trying to compete on food delivery, there was little room for error, and that any dent in same-store sales could further worry Wall Street.""When companies such as McDonald's (MCD) and Amazon (AMZN) are entering your core business ... we get concerned,"" he said in a research note.RELATED:Ford, Domino's Carpool On Pizza DeliveriesStocks Generating Improved Relative Strength: Domino's Pizza

61,YUM,"When an UberEats driver heads to Paul Tulaphorn's McDonald's (MCD) on Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, Calif., a loudspeaker pings sharply, loud enough to be heard over the frappe machine, to let the staff know.Behind the counter, employees manage those orders via an iPad next to a dedicated register. A designated tech worker helps install that technology, and stands ready to fix a register when it goes down, change over the store's data-processing systems, or upgrade the ""smart clock"" that changes the restaurant's digital menu displays.Restaurants often lag other industries in adopting new technology, lacking the time or budget for massive digital overhauls. But as industry sales have slowed recently, smartphone conveniences have found their way into the world of burgers and fries. Many in the industry are betting that its future lies in that technology — in large part through mobile orders, payments and delivery.""We have to be ready,"" Tulaphorn, a four-decade McDonald's veteran who owns nine McDonald's locations in Southern California, said of the coming technological wave. ""And I think we'll be ready.""Mobile ordering and delivery from the likes of McDonald's, Jack in the Box (JACK), Wendy's (WEN) and Burger King mark the biggest change in the way people order fast food since the drive-thru. As that change ripples through the industry, restaurants are facing down questions like how to preserve margins, avoid parking-lot traffic jams, and keep French fries crispy once they enter the balmy ecosphere of the delivery bag.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's is one of the best performers on the Dow Jones industrial average this year. But it's only the 8th in IBD's Retail-Restaurant group. To see which eateries are the true leaders, and how they stack up vs. rivals, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Just as the drive-thru accommodated generations shaped by mass-market car culture, the new digital efforts cater to a new cohort of fast-food customers shaped by e-commerce, social media, smartphones, streaming video and, in one way or another, a lack of time.Restaurants' trial runs and partnerships with delivery services could give chains a head start in capturing today's tech-savvy diners. Cowen & Co. estimated last year that U.S. restaurant delivery alone could become a $35 billion market by 2025.""We're currently very optimistic that we're tapping into a new customer base and serving them in a new way,"" Bill Garrett, corporate vice president of delivery at McDonald's, said in an interview. ""It's a customer that otherwise would likely have not gone out to eat.""The company is still trying to glean precise details about core delivery customers, Garrett says. He sees ""a lot of research"" ahead.Some restaurants have been on the delivery and digital path for a while. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) are old pros. Starbucks (SBUX) began offering mobile order and pay in 2014.The Golden Arches already offered delivery internationally and has dabbled with it in the U.S. This year it has expanded its partnership with UberEats, the ride-hailing service's food-delivery segment, to major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. McDonald's said that as of the end of June at least 3,500 of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants offered UberEats delivery. The burger chain also plans to offer mobile ordering via an app in thousands more locations this year.Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King is also testing mobile order and payments. Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts and Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell and KFC have partnered with the delivery service DoorDash. Panera Bread (PNRA), which is being taken private, also has jumped into delivery and plans to hire 10,000 drivers.So far, McDonald's delivery customers tend to skew younger, Garrett says. Delivery demand has been spread evenly across the day, though the end-of-dinner, late-night period appears to draw a slightly higher share of business compared to the company's traditional business. Dunkin' Donuts, in an email, said its delivery service is popular with millennials and ""a younger generation who live in an on-demand world.""As fast-food chains figure out who these new consumers are, they also have to solve the logistical puzzle that digital ordering can bring to restaurants, which face space limitations in their kitchens and parking lots.No massive problems have been reported by the delivery newcomers. McDonald's says its kitchens, drive-thrus and parking lots are able to handle more orders. At the same time, McDonald's shares are reaching new highs, rising to a record intraday peak of 156.56 on Friday.But digital orders can come with a learning curve.Starbucks has said the customer flow at some locations slowed as customers who ordered ahead on its popular mobile order and pay app crowded into restaurants. Management said in April that Starbucks would add staff to its busiest stores at peak times and consider new equipment and layouts to speed throughput. The company was introducing a digital order management system to help baristas track orders with a tablet and notify customers via mobile app when drinks were ready.Even a few seconds can make a big difference in processing orders and deliveries. The fast-food business, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said, is ""maniacal about drive-thru speeds."" Years ago, then-McDonald's CEO Jack Greenberg said unit sales got a 1% bump for every six seconds shaved off the drive-thru time.Tulaphorn says French fries take three minutes to cook and have a seven-minute holding time. When an UberEats driver arrives, the restaurant aims to have orders in the car and on the road within five minutes.DoorDash aims to deliver within around 20 minutes. That means different things in different areas.""Manhattan, on a bike, could be 20 blocks or 30 blocks,"" said Eitan Bencuya, DoorDash's head of communications. ""In Dallas, Texas, 20 minutes could be five miles away.""Early on, UberEats drivers sometimes got address numbers wrong, Tulaphorn says. And as with any other change, the new technology requires training for employees and older customers.McDonald's initially thought sending drivers through the drive-thru would be best, Garrett says. The company later found it was better to let drivers choose whether to take the drive-thru or go inside the restaurant. In Southern California, McDonald's restaurant operators can decide whether they want to allocate parking spaces just for UberEats drivers.DoorDash, meanwhile, found that the drive-thru wasn't the way to go. ""Just by looking at the number of deliveries that we bring to a restaurant, we found that it would actually overload the drive-thru to have Dashers lining up through their cars,"" Bencuya said.Some foods hold up better than others inside a delivery container. Pizza works, and ideally is still cooking when it's being delivered, Normura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski says. Chinese food, tacos, soups, sandwiches, pasta and salads also hold up fine. French fries, however, are a delicate situation.At Tulaphorn's McDonald's, fries go into a sleeve, then into their own separate bag, then into a bigger delivery bag that's sticker-sealed to verify that it hasn't been opened on its way. The UberEats driver also has a thermal bag to carry this delivery bag.Garrett says the company is looking at packaging changes that might help keep drinks and desserts from spilling, but wouldn't get into specifics.Restaurants that work with DoorDash get access to the deliverer's own packaging. DoorDash drivers can wrap the takeout container in a thin, metallic ""space blanket"" and put that inside an insulated bag.Similarly, some companies are more naturally suited to delivery, analysts say.In general, digital ordering benefits bigger brands with deep pockets for technology, Kalinowski says.McDonald's cites its massive geographic reach as an advantage. By its own estimates, nearly three-quarters of the population in its top five markets — the U.S., France, U.K., Germany and Canada — lives within three miles of one of its restaurants.Charles says a place like Wingstop (WING), which has limited seating and already does a lot of to-go business via digital, could be well-positioned for delivery.Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier says Panera's food — soup, sandwiches, salads — travels well. She notes that Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden has been strong in to-go orders; Italian food also tends to withstand delivery better than French fries.""I think that's McDonald's biggest challenge,"" she said.Wall Street likely will focus more on the profit impact when the novelty of digital ordering wears off and restaurants gain more sense of who their digital customers are. Commissions paid to third-party delivery services risk degrading margins, so restaurants need to watch their delivery sales trends to justify the hit, Charles says.Delivery fees also raise costs for consumers. A McDonald's Quarter Pounder with cheese meal, with a medium Coke and fries, delivered via UberEats to IBD's Los Angeles office from the Marina del Rey area takes an estimated 20 to 30 minutes. A $4.99 ""booking fee"" is tacked on to the food charge of $6.89 and 60 cents in taxes, bringing the total cost to $12.48.Independent restaurants' sales growth has outpaced that of restaurant chains, a pattern that could continue for the rest of the decade, food-industry consulting firm Pentallect estimated in April. Customers, it said, felt independent restaurants were more community oriented, with better quality, value and service. The trend comes on top of the day-to-day difficulties of competition, discounting and higher labor costs.""I think that simply put, you've got a pretty mature industry out there that's experiencing periods of weakness,"" Charles said. ""So essentially operators are looking for: 'What's the shiny object out there? What's the lever I can pull to really get my sales going?' It increasingly seems like it's delivery.""RELATED:These Are The Dow's Top 5 Stocks In 2017 — And Apple Isn't No. 1McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's Pizza Eyes Delivery Wars As McDonald's Expands ServiceJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdob

62,YUM,"The Nasdaq outperformed Wednesday afternoon amid a mixed and mostly unchanged performance for the NYSE indexes.XOil- and gas-related groups in IBD's database were among the day's worst performers, following the lead of August WTI crude oil, which was down 3.9% to $45.39 a barrel after Russia said it would not support further production cuts.The Nasdaq composite added 0.75% shortly after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its June meeting. Policymakers were divided over when the Fed should start to rein in its massive $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, though some suggested it could happen in September. The Dow Jones industrial average was about flat while the S&P 500 edged up 0.2%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.5%.Microsoft (MSFT), Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC) led the Dow with gains of nearly 2%. Micron Technology (MU) was a top percentage gainer in the Nasdaq 100, rising 4%. It's back above the 50-day moving average after giving up the support level Monday.Chip stocks were strong overall after the Semiconductor Industry Association said late Monday that global chip sales in May jumped 22.6% from a year ago to $31.9 billion.In the stock market today, Tesla (TSLA) gave up support at the 50-day moving average, falling more than 4% to 337.15, on more negative comments from Goldman Sachs. Goldman maintained a sell rating on the stock but lowered its price target to 180 from 190.Tesla is one of several market leaders below the 50-day line now, including most of  the FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google's parent, Alphabet (GOOGL). Amazon was back above the 50-day line Wednesday afternoon. But the price action of all five means they're probably ready to consolidate gains and take a breather. That's normal after a big price move.Inside the IBD 50, PayPal (PYPL) continues to show good action around the 10-week moving average. Shares rose 3%, helped by news of a merger in the payment-processing space. Group peer Vantiv (VNTV) announced plans to buy U.K.-based Worldpay for $10 billion. Also in the group, Square (SQ) is trading tightly and holding near highs. It's getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout.Yum China (YUMC) lost 1% ahead of its earnings report after the close. The stock has been a solid performer since Yum Brands (YUM) spun the company off late last year.Yum China was featured as a potential call-option idea in the latest Earnings Preview column. When shares were trading around 39.60, a monthly call option with a 40 strike price (July 21 expiration) came with a premium of around $1.40, presenting a trade with downside risk of 3.5%. The contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Yum China at 40 for a cost of $140, excluding commission. If Yum falls on earnings, the maximum loss for the option trade would be $140, the amount paid for the contract.RELATED:Yum China Earnings Due: What To Expect From Hot Restaurant StockTesla Slammed By Goldman Sachs As Sell Rating ReiteratedIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index Hits 10-Month Low On TrumpCareCrude Prices, Exxon Fall As Russia Says Nyet To More Cuts

65,YUM,"No matter how you slice, mash or fry it, Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) has been on a tear since going public a year and a half ago.The Eagle, Idaho-based company has become a top supplier of frozen potato, sweet potato, appetizer and vegetable products to restaurants and retailers worldwide. By finding new ways to get spuds to the public in new forms, its stock keeps trending higher.Take last quarter, when the company got a sales boost via Taco Bell's Nacho Fries. Yum Brands (YUM), the fast-food chain's parent company, called the spicy potato fries the most popular debut in Taco Bell's history. Nacho Fries are supposed to be a limited time offer, but could become a permanent menu item, Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said in an April 5 report on Lamb Weston.""This item provided a volume and likely mix benefit, and we believe that the success of this introduction is likely to keep the item permanently on the Taco Bell menu, furthering the need for even more capacity in the future,"" Growe said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLamb Weston Chief Executive Tom Werner says the company has benefited from strong demand and new product innovation.""As our strong third quarter and year-to-date results show, our commercial and supply chain teams are executing well and the operating environment continues to be favorable,"" Werner said on a recent earnings call with analysts.Lamb Weston has been expanding its production capacity to handle growing demand for its products.It recently added a french fry line in Richland, Wash., with an annual capacity of 300 million pounds of potatoes. It has broken ground on another french fry line in Hermiston, Ore., with similar capacity, which it expects to be operational in its fiscal fourth quarter 2019.Plus, it opened a new facility with an annual capacity of 180 million pounds of potatoes in Russia. Lamb Weston sells products in more than 100 countries and has 24 manufacturing plants around the globe.The company is focusing on product innovation to drive sales growth. Its current lineup shows a huge assortment of different ways to prepare potatoes. In fries alone, it offers straight, crinkle, curly, waffle and wedge cuts in different sizes, textures and seasonings. There are also potato chips, hash browns, tater tots, cubes, pancakes and varieties of mash.Like the scene in ""Forrest Gump"" where a character lists all the ways you can prepare shrimp, the litany of potato products seems to never end.In April, Lamb Weston introduced a new product called the Seashore Puff. It's a potato puff seasoned throughout with sea salt, black pepper and garlic.Earlier this year, it also introduced a way for food delivery services to keep fries hot and crispy in transit. The Crispy on Delivery offering combines product and packaging innovations.""It's a comprehensive solution that enables fries to stay hot and crispy for the fast growing home delivery channel,"" CEO Werner said. ""It is a promising solution to help customers expand delivery of fries which are typically the highest margin food product on their menus while meeting a clear consumer opportunity.""Crispy on Delivery fries maintain heat and crispiness for 30 minutes, while traditional fries start to lose their appeal after only 5 minutes. The new fry is lightly battered to withstand the challenges of delivery without sacrificing taste, the company said.Lamb Weston spun off from Conagra (CAG) in November 2016 and ended its first day of trading at 31.84. Since then, it has formed five bases and broken out of each to run higher.The stock broke out of a six-week flat base at a buy point of 68.80 on June 26.

Earnings per share jumped 54% year over year, compared with declines in the previous four quarters. Sales rose 12%, accelerating from single-digit gains in the preceding five quarters.The company said it expects fiscal 2018 sales to grow at the upper end of the mid-single digit range. It also targeted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $805 million to $810 million. That compares with its prior outlook of $780 million to $790 million.Lamb Weston has not yet set a date for reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results, but that's expected to happen in late July.Analysts expect the company to earn 62 cents a share on sales of $890 million. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 22% in earnings per share and 7% in revenue.The company expects a fourth-quarter tail wind from its Grown in Idaho brand retail products. The items have gained distribution with several large new customers, Werner said.""Over the next few months we will step up marketing investments to support this growth and that of our other brands,"" Werner said on the recent earnings call, which took place April 5.Lamb Weston cautioned that it sees increases in agricultural production and transportation costs. That could provide a headwind to growth.""We continue to believe that we are well positioned to create shareholder value over the long-term by focusing on our strategic and operational objectives,"" Werner said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart PatternsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

The jobless rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.4% as more people looked for work. Average hourly wages advanced 0.2%, a little less than expected. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index for June rose to the best in years while the ISM nonmanufacturing gauge showed still-strong expansion.For the second straight week, U.S. investors paid more attention to the European Central Bank than to the Federal Reserve. Both central banks released minutes from their June meetings.Economists interpreted the Fed minutes as indicating a bit more uncertainty about whether inflation will rebound and, thus, about the Fed's rate trajectory. Still, absent a surprise, the Fed seems likely to announce in September that it will gradually scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, inflated with Treasury and mortgage bonds purchased in response to the financial crisis.The ECB's policy signals have been jarring because they represent a pretty dramatic, if gradual, potential change from the central bank's long-running asset-purchase program.ECB President Mario Draghi indicated last week that the eurozone monetary authority could begin scaling back its asset buys, which economists now expect to happen by early 2018.

June sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.4 million, the lowest rate of the year.An eight-day win streak came to sharp end on Wednesday, while even a sharp drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories couldn't give prices much of a boost.

74,YUM,"The split market continues: Nasdaq 100 futures fell early Wednesday while futures for the Dow Jones industrial average rose slightly vs. fair value. North Korea's latest moves revived geopolitical concerns.XNasdaq 100 futures fell 0.4% vs. fair value while Dow futures were 0.1% higher and S&P 500 futures were roughly flat. The dollar, which has been trending lower, retreated vs. the Japanese yen on news that North Korea successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time.North Korea's Kim Jong Un promised more ""gift packages"" for America. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed that North Korea launched an ICBM, calling it a ""new escalation"" that will brought before the United Nations Security Council. The U.S. and South Korea ordered a significant live-fire missile test as a response, just hours after China and Russia urged the two countries to halt big military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.25% after initially falling modestly while South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3%. China's Shanghai composite climbed 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.5%. In European trade intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE was flat, Germany's Dax was little changed and France's CAC-40 climbed 0.1%.The overnight action exacerbates the Jekyll-and-Hyde market split underway for the last few weeks.On Monday,  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and many other leading big-cap titans pushed the Nasdaq composite lower again after another failed attempt at retaking the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average powered to a record high and S&P 500 index edged higher, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) leading the Dow while Bank of America (BAC) cleared a buy point.As the classic tale of ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" shows, a split personality is unstable. While there are leaders and laggards, the major averages generally follow the same path. So will Bank of America and JPMorgan carry the day, or does the market succumb to Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google and a tech-led correction?Apple was the first and most notable tech titan to undercut its 50-day moving average on June 10, following the sudden tech stock reversal on June 9. In recent days, Apple has been relatively stable, holding in a consolidation beneath its 50-day, but not heading below that area. But it certainly isn't showing leadership either.Facebook fell 1.9% on Monday, finally closing below its 50-day line after several tests. Amazon, which finished last week just pennies below the 50-day, initially rallied Monday but then reversed for a 1.5% loss, clearly separating from its support line. Netflix, the smallest of the FANG internet giants, continued to descend, sliding 2.2% to its lowest level since late April. Google parent Alphabet lost 1.1%, back to late April prices.Among other big techs, Microsoft (MSFT) retreated 1.1%, continuing to find 50-day resistance.A slew of chip and chip-equipment stocks have tumbled through their key support lines in recent days and weeks. Even the holdouts are running into trouble.Nvidia (NVDA) is still above its 50-day line, but is rapidly approaching that level after climax-like action from May 9-June 9. Micron Technology (MU), which reversed lower Friday despite seemingly strong earnings and guidance, fell sharply on Monday, undercutting its 50-day line.Workday (WDAY), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Paycom (PAYC) are top software firms that dropped below the 50-day on Monday.BofA, JPMorgan and other bank stocks have surged after they announced huge stock buybacks and dividend hikes last week following the completion of the second round of annual stress tests. A sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields, partly due to a stronger eurozone economy that's lifting German bund yields and the euro, should be good for banks.JPMorgan rose 1.5% on Monday to 92.75, closing in on a 94.08 cup base. BofA advanced 1.7% to 24.68, closing above a 24.35 aggressive buy point. It's approaching a conventional entry of 25.90.  Investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and superregionals Comerica (CMA) and Keycorp (KEY) are just below buy points themselves.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 have advanced even though the Dow includes Apple and Microsoft (and laggard techs Intel (INTC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO)), while the S&P 500 has all those plus a plethora of chip, internet and software plays. Energy stocks have given a recent lift to both indexes, as oil prices have risen for eight straight sessions.But U.S. crude futures fell 1.6% early Wednesday amid reports that Russia opposes deeper production cuts.RELATED:The Big Picture: Dow Hits Record High But Nasdaq Can't Hold Key LevelDow Jones Leads, Oil Strong; Time To Sell Microsoft, Intel?Microsoft Layoffs, Yum China Earnings, Fed Minutes: Investing Action PlanDespite Market Troubles, Leading Financials Look To Break OutThis Lender Is Beating The S&P 500 In Yield, And Forming A New Base

77,YUM,"X The earnings dump this week from the restaurant industry continued today with better-than-expected profits after the close from Shake Shack (SHAK), Wingstop (WING), Del Taco (TACO) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO). But Shake Shack plunged on weak same-store sales.Estimates: The fast-casual burger chain is expected to report first-quarter earnings per share of 8 cents, flat from a year ago. Revenue is seen leaping 38% to $74.7 million.Results: EPS rose 25% to 10 cents. Sales grew 42% to $76.7 million. Same-store sales slid 2.5%.Outlook: Shake Shack raised its full-year revenue target to $351 million-$355 million from $349 million-$353 million. Analysts had expected $356 million. Shake Shack now sees flat comps vs. prior guidance for a 2%-3% rise.""We are clearly dissatisfied with our comp result in Q1, but as a reminder our small comp base is made up of only 32 Shacks, the majority of which exist in the Northeast region which was most affected by cold weather and the holiday shift in March,"" CEO Randy Garutti said in a statement.Stock: Shares plunged nearly 7% to 30.85 in late trading. Shack Shack had closed down 2.6% to 33.16 on the stock market today. Habit Restaurants (HABT), which topped earnings views late Wednesday, rallied 1.6% to 19.20.Buckingham research analyst John Zolidis, who expected a 1% bump in Shake Shack's same-store sales, said the results would have to compete with a strong showing a year ago, when nicer weather and the introduction of Chick n' Shack helped results.Shake Shack, which began trading in 2015, has been opening new stores. That has raised concerns about whether the company's plans to move beyond where it is already popular will pay off.Goldman Sachs, in a note last month quoted by CNBC, cited ""declining novelty and therefore excitement around unit opens as a risk to new store productivity, and … cannibalization as a growing risk to traffic trends at SHAK, as the company continues to add density in markets outside of N.Y.""Zolidis said new-store results could be better than expected, but added ""we continue to expect that new unit performance will decline over time due to geographic expansion into less productive markets.""Shake Shack stepped up expansion plans. It expects 12 net openings of licensed locations this year, as opposed to 11 earlier. The company now expects to add 23-24 U.S. company-owned stores, up from 22-23.""We remain committed to executing our strategy of growing in premier locations, investing in our teams and delivering a great guest experience,"" Garutti said.Estimates: First-quarter EPS down 18% to 14 cents, with revenue up 5% to $98.72 million.Results: EPS fell 6% to 16 cents as sales climbed to $99.8 million. Same-store sales fell 0.3%.Stock: Shares rose 2% in after-hours trading. Shares rose 0.8% to 12.50, above their 50-day average but below their 200-day line.The Mexican chain had warned that Q1 results could take a hit due to the rainfall in California, but said same-store sales got better as the weather got nicer and tax refunds increased, SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said in a March research note.And the California-based company's locations in Houston, which Bartlett earlier described as its ""beachhead expansion market,"" were still a weak spot.""Until its Houston stores show a meaningful improvement, we expect investors to doubt the sustainability of LOCO's unit-growth story, which should limit multiple expansion,"" he said in the research note.Rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) last week reported results that topped analyst expectations.IBD'S TAKE: As smartphones become more common, running a successful fast-food restaurant could become more about going digital. McDonald's, on its first-quarter earnings call, talked up its more mobile, touchscreen future. Estimates: Analysts expect the chicken-wing chain to report first-quarter EPS of 16 cents, flat from a year ago. Revenue is expected to rise 9.5% to $24.17 million. Domestic same-store sales, as of Monday, were expected to fall 1.4%.Results: Adjusted EPS was 22 cents, up 37.5%. Revenue rose to $26.6 million. U.S. same-store sales fell 1.1%.Outlook: Wingstop Nnow expects full-year EPS growth of 19%-21%, well up from an earlier forecast of 8%-10% growth.Stock: Shares soared 12% to 32.50 in after-hours trading. Shares closed down 0.6% at 29. Wingstop is in a cup-with-handle base with a 30.38 buy point, so it's likely to test that entry Friday morning.Cowen analysts believe national TV advertising during March Madness likely strengthened the company's results.Estimates: First-quarter EPS of 9 cents, up 12.5%. Revenue is expected to rise 8% to $105.21 million.Results: EPS of 10 cents, up 25%, on sales of $105.3 million. Same-store sales rose 4.2%.Stock: Del Taco was not yet active in late trading. Shares closed down 0.7% to 13.40 but are in a base with a 15.42 entry.The taco and burger chain's locations are largely concentrated in California, which earlier this year was hit by a string of rainstorms after years of drought, raising concerns about the impact on businesses more broadly. At the end of March, Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan praised the company's menu additions and ""expansion to new dayparts.""On Wednesday, Yum Brands (YUM) reported quarterly same-store sales at its Taco Bell chain jumped 8%.RELATED:Is It Safe To Buy Chipotle Again?

79,YUM,"Habit Restaurants (HABT) topped earnings views while Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) missed estimates, after strong Taco Bell results helped Yum Brands (YUM) overcome weak Pizza Hut sales Wednesday, and Papa John's (PZZA) beat estimates Tuesday, continuing a busy week of restaurant earnings, which will include results from Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) Thursday.The reports come amid ongoing troubles for the restaurant business — groceries are still cheaper, although for how much longer depends on whom you ask. An abundance of value deals also means less money on the top line.Estimates: EPS to fall 20%, to 8 cents, with revenue up 17%, to $78.58 million. Same-store sales are seen creeping up 0.4%.Results: EPS of 9 cents on revenue of $78.6 million. Company-operated same-store sales climbed 0.9%.Outlook: Full-year revenue of $338 million-$342 million, with the midpoint in line with consensus estimates for $340 million, as comps rise 2%.Stock: Habit edged up 0.5% late. Shares fell 2% to close at 18.90, still extended from a 17.80 buy point.Most of Habit's locations are in California. Management has said that an abnormally large amount of rain in California, amid an enduring drought, led it to be cautious on its same-store sales expectations for the first quarter.Higher wages in the state, and thus higher costs, have also prompted concern on Wall Street, Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh noted. But he said he believed ""the current push to higher quality products (while maintaining its everyday value) will help … offset such concerns.""Estimates: EPS to increase 7%, to 73 cents, on revenue of $570.08 million, up 3%. Same-store sales are seen up 0.6%.Results: EPS of 72 cents on revenue of $563.4 million. Same-store sales rose 0.3%.Stock: Cheesecake Factory shares sank 6.5% late and look to drop back below a 64.51 buy point. Shares re-entered a buy zone Tuesday.Estimates: EPS of 60 cents, a 37% drop from a year earlier — before Yum spun off its China business, Yum China (YUMC) — with sales tumbling 48% to $1.351 billion.Results: EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $1.42 billion. Same-store sales rose by 2%, led by an 8% jump at Taco Bell, while KFC saw a 2% increase and Pizza Hut saw a 3% decline.Stock: Shares closed up 2.9% at 68.25 on the stock market today.Analysts say that Taco Bell has the most going for it out of Yum's three fast-food chains.""We view Taco Bell (32% of Yum's operating profits) as the crown jewel of Yum's portfolio and believe the brand will capture investor focus given nearly 100% domestic exposure,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a research note last week.Further out, RBC's Palmer said in a note last week that Yum's sales could be helped by ""ongoing"" momentum in Taco Bell, where value items like $1 taco burritos and $5 Triple Double Crunchwraps remain hits.Estimates: Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 7% to 74 cents on revenue of $438.71 million, up 2%. Same-store sales were expected to rise 2.2%.Results: EPS of 77 cents on revenue of $449.3 million, as same-store sales rose 2% for North America and 6% internationally. Digital sales percentage topped 60%.Stock: Papa John's fell 1.55% to end at 79.22, reversing earlier gains and falling back below its 200-day line. Shares closed up 2.3% on Tuesday.As with Domino's Pizza (DPZ), which reported first-quarter results last week that beat estimates, Papa John's digital ordering platform has lifted sales and helped the company avoid the bruises that other fast-food chains have dealt one another in an ongoing battle for the better value meal.The company still competes on value — pizza's main ingredients are typically cheaper than others. Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, though, said in a research note last month that ""sector competition may prevent meaningful upside"" to his same-store sales at North-American locations.Beyond Domino's, Yum Brands' Pizza Hut in March began ""what appeared to be some rather robust discounting activity in the U.S.,"" Kalinowski said in that note.The parent of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins reports first-quarter results on Thursday.Estimates: EPS of 48 cents, up 9%, with revenue up 1%, to $192.17 million. Comps at U.S. Dunkin' Donuts locations are expected to rise 0.7%.Stock: Shares dipped 0.65% to 56.36 but are still near a 58.53 buy point.Kalinowski said that Dunkin' Donuts was likely hit by the ""industry malaise"" that watered down results in other restaurants. McDonald's (MCD) $1 coffee promotion also means more competition.Slabaugh said Dunkin's Cold Brew and espresso drinks were bright spots but cited ""concerns surrounding traffic, a lack of clear catalysts, and a potential slowdown in operations outside of the northeastern U.S.,"" a Dunkin' Donuts stronghold.However, RBC analyst David Palmer said the company was working to make its franchisees more profitable.The company over the past year has tried to make Dunkin' Donuts what it has called a ""to-go, coffee beverages brand."" The company has expanded its mobile ordering platform and rewards program, and put more effort into increasing demand for packaged products at grocery stores and bottled drinks.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which on Monday reported first-quarter results that topped estimates, surged 11.6% to 51.30 on Tuesday, hitting a record high.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's Pizza Eyes Delivery Wars As McDonald's Expands Service

82,YUM,"Shares of Wendy's (WEN) jumped on Wednesday to their best level in nearly 10 years after the burger chain's first-quarter earnings came in above analyst estimates, likely helped by advertising around fresher ingredients and its 4 for $4 value meal.Wendy's North America same-store sales rose 1.6% — the 17th straight time the company has turned out an increase for the key industry metric — topping consensus expectations for 1.1% growth.Earnings per share fell 18% to 9 cents, but that was a penny above what Wall Street had forecast. Revenue fell 24.6% to $285.8 million, beating estimates for $282.56 million.Wendy's attributed the steep sales decline to 301 fewer company-operated restaurants.Shares jumped 5.1% to 15.87 in the stock market today, hitting its best level since late 2007. The stock is now extended from a 14.57 buy point.Rival McDonald's (MCD) climbed 0.1% to 144.52, near all-time highs. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) rose 1.2% to 59.92, holding above a 58.08 buy point.""We would note that these (Wendy's) results likely came on the continued success of its value news (rotation within the 4 for $4) and increased brand marketing around fresh beef, which we believe has helped to drive awareness/re-trial of core items,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.Wendy's also signaled that food costs could rise more than it had expected this year, potentially helping to discourage the discount wars that have attracted customers looking for cheap fast food but wilted industry sales.The company hiked its commodity inflation forecast to 1.5% to 2% from an earlier outlook of flat, ""which reaffirms our view of an inflationary (second half of 2017),"" RBC analyst David Palmer said in a research note.The decline in grocery prices has been steeper than that at restaurants, however, making eating in a more attractive option and compounding restaurants' sales difficulties.However, in a research note last month, SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said the pricing gap between restaurants and grocery stores narrowed ""meaningfully"" in March. Earlier this year, he said poultry and hamburger prices could rise this year, which would also help narrow that gap, and that restaurant sales could pick back up again starting in Q2 as the industry enters more forgiving comparisons.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresCheesecake Factory Misses, Habit Profit Tops After Yum, Papa John's Beat

But the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower on the back of 1-point drops or more by at least 4 of the Dow industrials' 30 components.The Nasdaq composite led the rally, rising 0.7% for the day, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. Volume fell on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.The Dow Jones transports slipped 0.3%.Last week, the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark rallied 1.5%, on top of a nearly 0.9% lift in the prior week. The Nasdaq had risen more than 4% over the prior two weeks, a clear signal that money continued to flow in the technology sector.In a heavy day for economic data, even bond investors didn't seem overly concerned about a surprise 0.1% dip in the March PCE prices gauge, excluding volatile energy and food prices, the first month-on-month drop since September 2001, according to Reuters. Plus, in the 12 months through March, the PCE index was up just 1.6%, vs. up 1.8% through February.The Federal Reserve has made it widely known that it wants to see inflation hitting at least 2% before taking more steps at reducing liquidity from the banking system. On Monday, meanwhile, investors sold U.S. government bonds hard; the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond inched up to 2.32%. The spread between the 2- and 10-year yields have slimmed a tad over the past 30 days.The interest-rate-sensitive Dow Jones utility average fell nearly 0.7%.Back to equities, looking at IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups, four of the top 10 groups come from the telecom and tech sectors (wireless services, semiconductor equipment, computer networking and computer data storage).Other top groups within the top 20 included the gaming group, which has vaulted from No. 80 to No. 13 over the past six weeks. Restaurants have jumped from No. 82 to No. 17 over the same time frame, while the lodging group has risen from No. 70 to No. 14.Among the four tech groups mentioned above, these names have stood out.Brooks Automation (BRKS) was up more than 5%, to 26.76, in heavy volume. The expert in automation and cryogenic systems for chipmakers and life sciences companies is extended sharply after a successful rebound off the 10-week moving average, near 16.90, in late January.Brooks also has been highlighted in the IBD Stock Spotlight.Western Digital (WDC) was down 1% to 87.97. The stock probed 52-week highs on Friday and has overall done well since it burst past an 81.77 flat-base buy point March 30. The stock is up almost 30% year to date, and harbors an A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if Western Digital, thriving after its acquisition of SanDisk, eases back within the 5% buy zone from the 81.77 entry, or up to 85.85.

But its recent pullback has produced a faulty cup base that falls short of the six-week minimum. Notice on a weekly chart how Cabot has gone two weeks down, then two weeks up into new high ground.At the same time, the 9.3% drop within the narrow consolidation was perhaps not enough to justify the V-shape-like action as an outright sell signal.Cabot faces a tough comp in fiscal Q3 earnings as profit grew 103% in the year-ago quarter that ended in June.

""Create it.""Starbucks has made no secret about its aggressive growth plans in China, which include doubling its store count there to 5,000 by 2021.For now, tea remains the hot drink of choice for 99% of Chinese consumers at home.But Scott said Starbucks' positioning as a ""third place"" outside of home and work ""has spawned a growing cafe culture in higher tier cities,"" one that has made going out for coffee one of ""cultured indulgence.""And that's already prompting a shift in how Chinese consumers get their caffeine fix. Outside of the house, coffee and tea consumption are now about equal, wrote analysts, citing Euromonitor and MSUSA estimates.Shares of Starbucks dipped 0.1% to 62.19 on the stock market today, their fifth straight decline. Starbucks is near the top end of buy territory after overextending for a few weeks. The stock broke out of a flat base with 59.64 entry point in late April.Calling Starbucks the ""most promising growth model in the industry,"" Mizuho's Scott initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and 75 price target.

102,YUM,"Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut is the new official pizza sponsor of the NFL, months after Papa John's (PZZA) blasted the football league's handling of player protests.X The move was announced Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Papa John's said it would no longer be filling the role, with CEO  Steve Ritchie insisting the company is shifting its focus from a broad NFL sponsorship to partnerships with 22 NFL teams, as well as with players and league personalities.The new multiyear deal takes effect April 1, and Pizza Hut will begin its marketing campaign around the NFL Draft, which takes place at the end of that month. The NFL will get more exposure from the new tie-up, as Pizza Hut has more than double the number of outlets, with more than 7,500 locations.Meanwhile, Pizza Hut will aim to take advantage of the partnership, which includes collective use of all 32 team marks, through new products and packaging, its loyalty program and a push into beer delivery. It launched a pilot program to deliver alcohol to homes in Phoenix last year.The change in sponsorship also comes after Papa John's missed on fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday, as EPS of 65 cents came in 3 cents light of Wall Street expectations. Revenue increased 6.4% to $468 million, narrowly beating. North American same-store sales fell 3.9%, wider than the 3.2% decline expected, though international same-store sales were up 2.6%.Shares climbed 2.45% to close at 57.74 on the stock market today. Papa John's plunged below its 50-day moving average line on Feb. 5 and has been unable to move back above the key technical support since. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 56, meaning it is in the top 50% of companies tracked.Yum Brands, which is also the parent of KFC and Taco Bell, rallied 1.5%. It has a healthier Composite Rating of 75. Dominos Pizza (DPZ) fell 1.8%.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.There were tensions between Papa John's and the NFL in recent months, with company founder John Schnatter claiming during an earnings call in November the league had ""hurt"" his company due to its handling of players kneeling during the national anthem. The firm later tried to walk back the comments on social media.Despite the fact Papa John's no longer holds the high profile sponsorship, which it held from 2010, Deutsche Bank analyst Brett Levy said the company is taking many of the necessary steps to improve its positioning and business. However he also struck a cautious note on the months ahead, saying it is unclear when there will be measurable improvements in results.""We also continue to hold a cautious view on the shares, despite our belief that many of management's ideas are prudent decisions and the right investments,"" Levy said in a research note. ""We believe PZZA's intermediate prospects are up in the air, but our greatest near-term hesitations revolve around how long it will take for sales to re-accelerate, how long it will take for the initiatives to prove out and what the magnitude of their benefits will be, all while operating in the shadow of solid competitors.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Grubhub Price Target Raised On Optimism Over Yum Brands DealTaco Bell Parent Yum Brands Serves Mixed Earnings, Teams Up With GrubhubWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?

Panera, which is being bought by JAB Holding, said it will hire 10,000 new employees, with about three-quarters of them being delivery drivers.Addressing the growing demand for drivers, Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said during a conference call with analysts that the company's drivers will be ""more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else.""Shares of Domino's were up 2.5% to 185.55 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average on strong quarterly results, but off session highs of 188.85.Rival Papa John's (PZZA), which reports Tuesday, edged up 0.45%, and McDonald's added 3 cents.Domino's Q1 EPS jumped 42% to $1.26, beating Wall Street forecasts by 10 cents, as sales climbed 16% to $624.2 million, above views for $615.85 million. Same-store sales leapt 10.2%.The results come after Domino's stock lost 5.8% on April 7 on a report from M Science that forecast that U.S. first-quarter sales gains would come in ""well below the rough consensus estimate,"" according to CNBC.Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, in a research note before Domino's earnings, had also expressed caution about Domino's sales. He cited what he said appeared to be ""rather robust"" discounting at Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut last month, when the NCAA basketball tournament took place. Slower sales in the U.K. and Australia were also concerns.As other fast-food restaurants fought each other on discounts and cheaper groceries discourage eating out, Domino's last year largely remained above the fray, putting up solid sales and EPS figures.Customers are already used to ordering pizza over the phone, so Domino's mobile ordering platform has worked particularly well as other restaurants try to digitize ordering and the experience inside their locations.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

The fund has also topped 94% of its direct rivals as well as the big-cap bogey this year going into Wednesday and 90% of them along with the benchmark over the past three years.Bruce Aronow, the management team's chief investment officer, says the secret sauce for AB Discovery Growth Fund's recent outperformance has two ingredients. One is ""getting fundamentals right,"" he said. ""That means identifying faster growing companies. The other is identifying companies that can outgrow consensus expectations, that can enjoy positive earnings revisions and surprises.""This top mutual fund uses fundamental research and quantitative modeling to find the companies it wants. ""That quant model triggers off such factors as earnings revisions, momentum, earnings surprises.""

One thing that Aronow likes about Arista is that it does not have to try to make old technology solve new customer challenges. ""Our thesis is that Arista has better solutions to go after the data center market,"" Aronow said. ""It was designed from the ground up to target that, whereas legacy companies like Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have to live with legacy code and technology, which makes it tougher for them to be as nimble as Arista.""Not having to adapt old technology has many benefits, Aronow says. ""Arista's solutions are more scalable,"" he added. ""It offers orders of magnitude better economies. It's been built to focus on what the market needs. That takes some bells and whistles out of the equation. But they provide solutions that the market values.""Arista's three-year earnings per share growth rate is 49%.

Check out IBD's easy-to-read Stock Checkup page to see how Arista's traits compare to its rivals'. Align Technology is another disruptive holding. In its case, the market it has upset is the one producing orthodontic braces. ""They make Invisalign, which is different from the traditional wire and bracket (orthodontic) solution. Invisalign holds big appeal for adults, who don't want to march around with metal braces as badges of honor. So there's a growing demand from adults.""Align has strengthened its growth by learning to provide aligners for increasingly complex cases, Aronow says. It is also expanding its market by developing products for older teenagers, not just adults.About 20% of North Americans needing orthodontic devices use clear aligners, Aronow says. Invisalign has about an 85% share of that market, he adds.Aronow thinks that clear aligners' market share can at least double. And with just a roughly 10% penetration internationally, ""there's an even better runway there,"" he said.EPS went from negative 2% five quarters ago to gains of 18%, 37%, 60% and 100% in the four most recent stanzas.Takeout food ordering platform Grubhub is an example of a company that benefits from being a first mover. ""This is a classic network effect model,"" Aronow said. He added, ""The model that has the most restaurants and diners continues to grow as a competitive leader because restaurants want broad reach (to the greatest number of prospective customers) and diners want variety.""Grubhub's acquisitions and alliances reinforce its network effect. Among those announced or completed in 2017 were its purchase of Eat24 from Yelp, OrderUp and food-ordering firm Foodler and its Dash delivery service. Grubhub also entered a partnership with Groupon to bring food delivery to Groupon customers across the U.S.Grubhub also agreed to integrate online ordering from all of its restaurants onto Yelp's platform and to make Grubhub the exclusive food-delivery provider for Yelp visitors in exchange for a referral transaction fee.And in February of this year, Yum! Brands said it would buy a 3% stake in Grubhub. Grubhub also said it would provide KFC and Taco Bell with online ordering, pickup and delivery services at their U.S. restaurants.Copart auctions off vehicles that have been declared total losses by insurers. Their inventory is up because more drivers are distracted by smartphones and because repair costs have soared. ""As vehicles have more sophisticated content in the form of sensors and electronics, the cost to repair more vehicles gets increasingly hard to justify,"" Aronow said.Copart share prices have not been hurt badly in the broad market's recent sell-off. Its shares are up about 68% in the past 12 months.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Hot Stocks Light A Fire Under AB Discovery GrowthYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Managers of Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund are mingling semiconductor stocks with biotech stocks, online travel agencies and a Chinese fast-food chain, all to good effect. That's been a benefit to investors with retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $3.3 billion fund is working its way back toward its multiyear top-notch outperformance. This year going into Wednesday, the fund's 8.97% gain topped 62% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the 5.75% advance by the S&P 500.That's an improvement over its showing during the past 12 months, when the fund outpaced just 54% of its direct rivals with a nonetheless decent 15.49% rise. So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

118,YUM,"With work such an integral part of people's lives; why not make it better for yourself and others?That's from Richard Moran, author of ""The Thing About Work: Showing Up and Other Important Matters."" A venture capitalist and consultant to Fortune 500 companies, Moran currently serves as president of Menlo College in Atherton, Calif.Evan Carmichael, author of ""Your One Word: The Powerful Secret to Creating a Business and Life That Matters,"" said that many people ""want to spend their time doing more meaningful work, but they can't define what that meaningful work looks like. They want to be a part of something great, but they don't actually believe that they have greatness within them.""Tips for upping your career status quo:Mine for gold. Carmichael, an acclaimed global business speaker, says start by asking yourself: What makes you happy?An exercise he suggests: Find a common theme between what your favorite movie is, who your favorite boss is, and the activities that make you feel most alive. Similarly, if need be, make a list of everything and everyone that makes you unhappy, and find what binds them together in order to articulate what the opposite is.He says finding your one word, one core value, one most important belief is ""the path to self-awareness, standing for something important, and breaking the chains of mediocrity in all areas of your life and business.""Carmichael's one word? ""Believe.""Sell yourself. People want to know what you stand for and what kind of company you are before they buy from you, Carmichael says.""Lead with the mission,"" he added. ""Lead with your why. Lead with your values. … Customers will come to you, buy more, and refer their friends because you're making them feel like they are a part of an important mission as well. That's 'core selling.' ""Follow through. Making a to-do list is not the same as getting things done, Moran points out.""Success in any organization is determined more by implementation, not planning,"" he states. ""There is no contest to win by having a long 'to-do list.' Pay attention to the 'done list.' ""Also, don't fall into the trap of getting things accomplished that don't matter as much, at the expense of what actually does.Stay relevant. Availability is not a skill, Moran says.""Just because you are available does not mean you are going to get snapped up into a new and rewarding career,"" he continued. ""Always be current in skills and be ready to change as the skills in demand change.""Be proactive. Carmichael offers this perspective for when you want to shake things up: ""Everything in your environment holds you exactly where you are."" This can mean your entire routine, including the way you think, what influences you and the people you hang out with.Make changes when need be. As futurist Alvin Toffler said, ""Change is not merely necessary to life, it is life.""Accomplish the basics. Just as losing weight is fundamentally about eating right and getting exercise, Moran says, success in business is fundamentally about ""setting a strategy, executing on the strategy and measuring results.""Make real face-time. People today, especially, can work from home, a local Starbucks (SBUX), or even out of the trunk of their car, Moran says, but the boss or your colleagues still need to know who you are.""One of the best parts of work is the relationships we develop,"" Moran said. ""Show up. Have coffee with colleagues. Go to the holiday party.""Forge ahead regardless. Moran writes that Bob Noyce was 41 when he founded Intel (INTC), John Pemberton 55 when he invented Coca-Cola (KO), Colonel Sanders 65 when he founded KFC (YUM).""So for all of you thinking of something big, of making a change, of starting something, the world has not passed you by,"" Moran wrote. ""Your ideas are still worthy. It is never too late.""As the Chinese proverb proclaims, `The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.'

122,YUM,"Domino's Pizza (DPZ) lifted its long-term growth outlook Tuesday after reporting fourth-quarter results that topped forecasts as comp sales surged.Estimates: EPS to leap 25% to $1.44, with revenue up 5.5% to $782.2 million.Results: EPS of $1.48 on revenue of $819.4 million. U.S. same-store sales at company-owned locations jumped 13.7%, easily exceeding the Consensus Metrix forecast for a 10.5% increase.Outlook: Over the next three to five years, Domino's now sees domestic comp sales growth of 3%-6%, up from a prior view of 2%-5%, and global retail sales growth of 8%-12%, up from a prior view of 7%-11%. Net unit growth is now seen at 6%-8%, up from an earlier view of 5%-7%.Stock: Shares closed up 2.4% at 189.81 after falling as low as 182.26 on the stock market today. Papa John's (PZZA) edged up 0.5%. Yum Brands (YUM), which owns Pizza Hut, dipped 0.3%.Domino's has been at the forefront of mobile ordering technology. Digital ordering platforms seem likely to become more important in the restaurant industry as more people do more things via their phones and find more reasons to stay in. Domino's is in a good position, because pizza travels better than most other fast food. Meanwhile, mom-and-pop pizzerias can't afford to develop their own mobile platforms, though they could sign up with food ordering hubs such as Grubhub (GRUB).IBD'S TAKE: Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle recently spoke to IBD about how his company should continue to benefit from digital ordering, even as other fast food companies try to catch up. He also discussed Netflix and a future of self-delivered pizza.Last week, Papa John's turned out middling quarterly results and guidance as the restaurant sector struggles with cheaper groceries and competitive discounting.Domino's and Papa John's were rare bright spots in the industry last year. Other restaurants struggled with, among other things, bad weather, discounting, cheaper groceries relative to menu prices and difficulties in keeping up with a strong performance in 2015, analysts have said.Yum Brands reported weaker-than-expected revenue earlier this month, citing ""disappointing and not acceptable"" Pizza Hut results.

124,YUM,"Many investors began to drool over the energy and financial sectors after the November elections. The prospect of lower corporate tax rates and less restrictive regulatory yokes was a big reason. But Larry Puglia, manager of $34.2 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX), began to place a lot of new bets on the technology sector.That's despite the fact that the tech sector stands to benefit less from changes in corporate taxes. Many tech companies already have less-than-peak rates, Puglia says. In addition, tech industry leaders worry that President Trump's immigration policies could deprive them of skilled workers. Also, investors feared there was friction between President Trump and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, over the newspaper's campaign coverage.But Puglia feels the benefit to corporations — including many tech companies — of repatriation of bank accounts stuffed with cash has been overlooked somewhat. And Puglia thinks the likelihood of antagonism between the tech sector and the White House is overblown. ""We do not think that would happen to a great degree,"" Puglia said.Puglia's warm outlook for tech is reflected in the fund's most recently disclosed top-10 additions in the past six months. They included not only banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but also techies Microsoft (MSFT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Priceline (PCLN) and Facebook (FB).Fast-food restaurant operator Yum Brands (YUM) was another top-10 addition. And the fund began a new position in brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) that was large enough to also enter its top 10.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda continues to steer the stock market, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to find highly rated stocks and sectors poised to move higher.Puglia's moves are worth watching. Going into Thursday, his fund's 14.64% average annual gain over the prior five years outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500's 14% pace also trailed. He's in the top 84% year to date, which marks a rebound from 2016's modest 0.98% gain.JPMorgan shot higher shortly before Election Day. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 1%, 20% and 20% in the past three stanzas. Like other banks, JPMorgan benefits from investors' expectations that this corner of financial services will face a lighter regulatory burden than it would have under a Democratic-held White House or Congress. In addition, banks are expected to carve out wider net margins as interest rates increase. They are not expected to raise interest paid to depositors by much if any, yet they will be able to charge more for loans.Microsoft is well-positioned to keep on generating strong growth in its Office 365 suite of products, Puglia says. He also likes the outlook for its corporate cloud operations and Azure, its public cloud-computing platform.Chipmaker NXP is a leading provider of semiconductor solutions used in automotive connectivity and infotainment, he says. NXP's chips are also used in smartphone near-field communications payment applications. On Tuesday, Qualcomm (QCOM) extended its takeover bid for NXP until April 4.Alibaba offers consumer-to-consumer e-commerce services through its Taobao business and it runs T-Mall, a business-to-consumer platform. Both have dominant market share, Puglia says. Alibaba is also a leader in cloud processing services. The Chinese government is a key customer. Trading around 103 as of early Thursday, shares are below a 104.67 cup-with-handle entry.Money-transfer services provider PayPal has a five-year earnings annual growth rate of 25%. And it has reached deals with Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) that are mutually beneficial, Puglia says. Many investors had feared a more adversarial competition among the three companies. And Puglia likes PayPal's Venmo, Braintree and One Touch services.Trading around 43, shares are still trading just under a 43.17 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 9%, 13% and 17% in the past three quarters.Priceline gapped up nearly 6% on Feb. 28, a day after reporting a 32% increase in fourth-quarter EPS. Its top line grew 17% to $2.34 billion. Both earnings and revenue topped the company's own guidance. Hotel bookings have been the stock's largest growth driver. Airline ticket sales fell. That's despite steadily low oil prices, which have helped keep airfares down. The company's EPS grew 12%, 23% and 32% the past three quarters.Facebook shares are up 20% this year. Investors have begun to appreciate how well the company's advertising products, video strategy and Instagram photo sharing are being received, Puglia says. He adds that its investment in WhatsApp and Messenger also provides solid positioning in the messaging market, which is growing in popularity. ""We especially like the company's efforts to promote the use of video on its platform and to better monetize Instagram and video,"" he said.Facebook reportedly made the launch of its Facebook Live video service a priority last year. But enough users have posted videos of violence and crime to make at least some advertisers wary of the platform, according to CNBC.com. Facebook also has been hit with measurement controversies.Yum shares rose 9% this year through Feb. 13 to a 52-week high, but they've pulled back 7% since then. That has left them a scant 3% above where they were when Yum spun off its China division last Oct. 31. After EPS grew 44% for three quarters in a row, EPS grew 18% in Q4.Schwab has done a nice job of growing customer assets under management, Puglia wrote to shareholders on Dec. 31. ""Its earnings should benefit substantially from rising interest rates,"" Puglia added. ""This is enhanced by the fact that Schwab has a significant bank embedded within the company. That enables it to sweep brokerage deposits into the bank, creating more net interest income.""Rain fell on Schwab's parade recently when it got caught up in a pricing war with Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) over brokerage commissions. But Puglia says Schwab is far less dependent on commissions than TD Ameritrade is.RELATED:12 Blue-Chip Beauties That This Top Money Manager Likes NowDoes Your Mutual Fund Manager Have Skin In The Game?

126,YUM,"An encouraging reversal two days ago evaporated quickly as the major indexes closed with sharp declines and near session lows Thursday.X The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 4.2%. American Express (AXP), Caterpillar (CAT), General Electric (GE) and Intel (INTC) were each down about 4%, erasing most of the rebounds from earlier in the week.The S&P 500 slid 3.8% and the Nasdaq composite 3.9%, and both undercut the lows made on Tuesday. Volume was higher than Wednesday's levels, according to early figures. Declining stocks led advancers by nearly 7-to-1 on the NYSE and by 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq.No doubt, sellers are still in firm control of Wall Street. Tuesday's positive reversal had the makings of a longer rebound. Instead, stocks have run into a wall of selling as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 met resistance near their 50-day moving averages.The chip-equipment industry group was roiled for a loss of nearly 7%. Auto, oil, biotech and other semiconductor groups also saw sharp losses, as only about a dozen of 197 groups were higher in today's market.The 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high, before easing to 2.85% Thursday afternoon. One factor affecting yields is a spike in government debt.Many top-rated stocks tumbled, and some showed serious damage on their charts, such as breaks of support at the 50-day moving average.Yelp (YELP) gapped down to a loss of 14% in big volume, undercutting a base it had been forming since November. The company beat expectations for adjusted earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, but still sold off.Coherent (COHR) gapped down to the lowest price since last April in huge volume. The company posted better-than-expected December-quarter results, but its outlook disappointed.Grubhub (GRUB) was one of the few standouts Thursday. The stock soared 27% after the company beat expectations and announced a deal to be the exclusive online delivery service for Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell and KFC chains.Grubhub helped brake the IBD 50's loss.

The entry point is 66.36.Now that Yum Brands has offloaded its China business, Taco Bell could draw more of Wall Street's attention, Cowen & Co. noted recently.Cowen recently called the taco chain ""the crown jewel of Yum's portfolio"" that balanced ""tactical value with menu innovation to navigate a challenging quick-service backdrop.""Throughout last year, restaurants' financial results got hit by competitive discounting, bad weather, election-related anxieties and lower prices at grocery stores. Some chains also saw sales slow at the end of December, possibly because fewer people went out shopping during the holidays, Cowen said.Pizza Hut, meanwhile, has struggled to compete with the likes of Domino's Pizza (DPZ).IBD'S TAKE: The fast-food and tech worlds are colliding.

130,YUM,"Yum Brands (YUM) just might be better off shedding Pizza Hut, an analyst said Thursday, as the unit struggles to stay relevant amid competition from Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA).Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note that after some 20 years of shrinking market share, ""it is time for Pizza Hut to be divested.""Citing figures from Technomic, he said Pizza Hut's share of the limited-service pizza business in the U.S. had shrunk to 14.5% in 2015, from 25% in 1995.Both Domino's and Papa John's, Kalinowski noted, ""are single-brand (read: focused) companies, while Pizza Hut is part of a much larger corporate entity. In that context, focus can be much more difficult to come by.""He said that Yum might be better off if it offloaded much of its ownership in Pizza Hut but kept a minority stake, in the same way Wendy's (WEN) has held a minority stake in Arby's.Kalinowski's also said that Domino's looks ""poised"" to overtake Pizza Hut as the U.S. market-share leader among limited-service pizza chains, possibly this year or next.Shares of Yum Brands finished 1.2% higher at 67.39 on the stock market today, still in buy range. Domino's increased 0.4% and Papa John's added 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Within the restaurant industry, Domino's Pizza has been a leader in digital ordering. Read more about those efforts in IBD's interview with CEO Patrick Doyle.

Intraday, Tesla rose as high as 260, crossing a 258.56 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.

Intraday, shares rose to 120.92, a record high and just above a 120.03 buy point in a six-week cup base. Six weeks is the minimum for a cup pattern. It's also a late-stage base after a huge run-up, making this breakout more likely to fail than an early-stage move.Nvidia's fundamentals still look great. The company is at the forefront of several booming markets, expanding from PC graphics chips to the AI and autonomous driving fields.

143,YUM,"After a strong start, the stock market reversed from early gains — and record highs — heading into the later part of the trading day.After reaching fresh all-time highs earlier, the Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average only moved up 0.1% apiece.The S&P 500 fell just short of new highs through midday trading and reversed lower in the stock market today.Volume was tracking modestly higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Monday.Leaders in the blue-chip index were Boeing (BA) and Apple (AAPL), with both stocks rising more than 1%.Boeing, which offers a 3.4% dividend yield, continues to outperform the market as it gains traction from its 160.17 flat-base entry.Apple moved up 1.3%, adding to recent gains. The smartphone maker is now up almost 12% from its cup-with-handle buy point.According to Canaccord Genuity on Tuesday, Apple accounted for 18% of smartphone unit sales in Q4, but grabbed 92% of the industry's profits.The energy sector continued to lag the general market as oil prices dropped for a second straight day. The price of crude fell about 2% and was testing its 50-day line.Dow components Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 1% each. Both oil companies have struggled in recent weeks and are consolidating beneath their 50-day lines.Tesla (TSLA) broke out of a long cup-with-handle base with a 258.56 entry. But the electric-auto maker mirrored the general market — it started off strong but has now faded. Shares were trading down 0.2%.After Monday's breakout, NetEase (NTES) fell 1% to trade just beneath its 257.78 cup-with-handle buy point. The Chinese gaming company will report earnings after the close Feb. 15.Weibo (WB) broke out of a double-bottom base with a 52.59 buy point and was trading about 1% above it.

However, the stock was beginning to reverse from its highs and fell about 1% under its buy point.While Nvidia has shown tremendous resilience after triggering a sell signal during a climax top in late December, the stock is breaking out of a six-week cup base, which is rather atypical. Also, the absence of a handle means there has been no shakeout of weak holders. Finally, volume has been notably light as the stock bounced off the 10-week line around 99.Besides Nvidia, the other main winner on the IBD 50 was GrubHub (GRUB). The Chicago-based food deliverer rose 1.5% Tuesday afternoon as it builds a handle.On the downside, HealthEquity (HQY) sold off after the company reaffirmed its 2017 outlook and issued in-line guidance for 2018's revenues. The leading provider of health savings accounts dropped more than 7% to fall back to its 50-day line. The stock had broken out of a flat base with a 45.10 entry.

144,YUM,"General Motors (GM) appears likely to be caught between populist forces in the U.S. and abroad this year, with the automaker stressing ""very constructive"" dialogue with the Trump administration but forecasting ""relatively flat"" 2017 results in Europe as it navigates the aftershock of Brexit.But as automakers find themselves in the crosshairs of President Trump's Twitter account — his platform for strong-arming the industry into being more U.S.-focused — GM tried to position itself as sufficiently weatherproofed for any tweet storms, tariffs or border adjustment taxes that might come from Trump's strain of economic nationalism.""Our analysis shows the U.S. auto industry, on average, derives in the mid-50-percent range of its content from non-U.S. sources. Ours is lower,"" CFO Chuck Stevens said Tuesday on the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. ""If current proposals are enacted, we expect to be less affected than some others.""The company's fourth-quarter earnings per share fell 8% to $1.28, beating estimates for $1.17. Revenue rose 11% to $43.91 billion, topping views for $41.5 billion. The company also backed the strong full-year EPS outlook it gave last month — of $6.00-$6.50 a share, above estimates at the time for $6.01.However, adjusted earnings before interest taxes fell in all segments except its finance division. And Wall Street, Bloomberg noted, on Tuesday appeared to be concerned about thinning margins and the prospects of some new crossovers, which like SUVs tend to be higher-margin vehicles. The company also said incentive spending could creep up this year.Shares tumbled 4.7% to finish the regular trading session at 35.10 on the stock market today, puncturing support at their key 50-day line. Ford (F) slid 1.4% to 12.34, also undercutting its 50-day line. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) lost 4.6% to 10.27, as French investigators referred the company for possible prosecution over its diesel emissions.The slide came even as General Motors said it nonetheless expected a surge in global volumes.""GM expects its global volume from new or refreshed vehicles to grow to 38% from 2017-2020, up from 26% in the 2011-2016 period,"" the company said in its earnings release. ""New or refreshed crossovers, trucks and SUVs are expected to represent a majority of this volume between 2017-2020.""Due to the automaker's 2016 performance, ""52,000 eligible GM U.S. hourly employees will receive up to a maximum profit-sharing payout of $12,000."" GM also boosted its stock buyback program by $5 billion.Trump has accused the auto industry of not building enough cars or creating enough jobs in U.S. The president has also called for a stiff border tax on U.S. companies that try to sell products in the U.S. but don't make them here.Stevens, during the call, said there was still ""significant uncertainty"" over what any new U.S. trade or tax policy might actually look like. But analysts contend that General Motors makes more vehicles in Mexico than Ford and is more exposed to China, two nations Trump argues have taken advantage of the U.S. on trade.""We are supportive of efforts by President Trump and Congress to implement tax reform that improves the competitiveness of American companies,"" Stevens said on the call. ""GM continues to share job-creation ideas and industry information with lawmakers to help them create proposals that will be positive for the U.S. economy and keep vehicles affordable.""CEO Mary Barra expressed optimism about the company's conversations with the Trump administration — be it about trade, regulations, autonomous cars, and the nature of its operations, some of which require years of planning ahead of time.""There's a lot of information being shared to level the foundation,"" she said.The company said that it would have broke even last year without Brexit, or the U.K.'s vote last year to leave the European Union. Management said China's results were solid and that it was seeing the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" after weak conditions in South America.As Trump urges a shift in production from nations like Mexico to the U.S., automakers have faced concerns about waning demand after a long ascent for auto sales. U.S. sales for the Big Three automakers fell last month, even though Ford and GM expressed optimism about the year ahead.In reporting January sales, GM said it would ""continue to match production with customer demand."" The company added: ""Previously announced plans to reduce passenger car production at plants in Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing, Mich., were implemented at the end of January.""Ford CEO Mark Fields last month said he felt the company had ""the appropriate amount"" of plants in the U.S. and that there were no current plans to build new ones.IBD'S TAKE: As businesses prepare for potentially years of criticism from an unpredictable president, here's a look at what some companies have done in attempt to insulate themselves from the fallout. GM also began selling its new all-electric Bolt, and investors will be eager to digest any further morsels of guidance as Tesla (TSLA) is set to begin production of the Model 3 and make it available for sale later this year.In January, GM delivered 1,162 Bolt cars, bringing the total since its mid-December debut to 1,741. The plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt rose 62% vs. January 2015 to 1,611.Late Monday, CFRA Research issued a report that warned Tesla will see competition on electric vehicles, though it enjoys a head-start on autonomous technology.""However, as more competitors are joining the electric vehicle space, we see risks increasing that Tesla's dominance in all-electric vehicles will wane by the time the market reaches critical size,"" according to analyst Efraim Levy in a statement.Still, Tesla shares fell 0.1% to close at 257.48 after hitting 260 intraday, briefly topping a cup-with-handle buy point of 258.56. Tesla rose 2.6% on Monday.RELATED:Will Tesla Get Run Over By China, GM, Ford, BMW In Electric Vehicles?GM To Join Ford, Chrysler In Repackaging U.S. Investment Plans For TrumpTesla, Nvidia, Weibo, Yum Brands Hit Buy Points, But Are They Buys?

145,YUM,"Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Starbucks (SBUX), Yum Brands (YUM), Jack in the Box (JACK) and Panera Bread (PNRA) are all closing in on buy points, despite continued headwinds of rising labor costs and and high menu prices relative to making dinner at home.Domino's Pizza was a big winner in 2016, as the restaurant took the lead in mobile ordering, giving a turbo boost to its natural advantage in pizza delivery as more Americans order in.Domino's has reported two straight quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth. Domino's has not yet given a date for its fourth-quarter report, but should report in the next few weeks.Domino's rose 0.6% to 170.57 on the stock market today. The stock has a 172.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.RELATED:Domino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' FutureStarbucks reports earnings on Thursday, with analysts expecting its slowest earnings growth — 13% — in five years. Shares have rallied since early November as investors bet on better days ahead.Starbucks rose 0.4% to 58.70. It's closing in on a 59.64 entry in a saucer-with-handle base. A saucer base is like a cup base, but less deep.But there are caveats to this analysis. If you look at Starbucks' chart as a base going back to Oct. 30, then the midpoint of the handle is fractionally lower than the midpoint of the consolidation. (Handles below the base midpoint are invalid because breakouts are more likely to fail). But, using the 52-week high set in April, the handle is above the base midpoint — and so the 59.64 buy point is valid.RELATED:Starbucks Stock Near Buy Zone Ahead Of EarningsYum Brands has been in a consolidation since Oct. 4. But shares rose 0.4% to 65.60 on Wednesday, just below a buy point of 66.36.On Monday, shares tumbled, but found support at the 200-day line and closed above their 50-day line. On Tuesday, Yum rose 1.4% to 65.33, clearing support just above 65. Investors might see this as an aggressive entry point, but the volume was 28% below average. So Tuesday's action was more of a passive-aggressive move. Investors interested in Yum Brands should probably wait for the 66.36 trigger.Yum Brands will report earnings on Feb. 9, its first quarterly report since spinning off Yum China (YUMC).Jack in the Box has gained recent notoriety for its tacos, which have been incredibly popular despite all culinary odds. The California-heavy chain has begun testing deliveries in San Francisco. Even though burgers and fries don't typically hold up as well in delivery as pizzas, Jack in the Box has said its late customers have been ""forgiving.""Jack In the Box climbed rose to 109.45 in the morning but closed down 0.1% to 108.03, closing just below its rising 50-day line. It has a 113.40 buy point in a flat base.RELATED:Jack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerPanera Bread rose to 215.96 intraday but fell 0.6% to 212.22, nearing its 50-day.

150,YUM,"Tesla (TSLA), with its stock breaking out Tuesday, had the best-selling electric vehicle for the past two years in a relatively small market, but General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and others are racing for the lead as China pumps on the gas.Global sales of plug-in electric vehicles, including hybrid plug-in models, jumped 42% in 2016 to 773,600 units. Sales have more than tripled since 2013, according to EVvolumes.com. It says sales of plug-in vehicles grew more than 20 times faster than the overall market, but still only captured a global market share of 0.86%.More than 2 million plug-ins are on the road, says EVvolumes, of which 61% are pure electric vehicles like the Tesla and the rest plug-in hybrids like the Chevy Volt by General Motors.China manufacturers are a growth engine, with sales up 85% to 351,000 units in 2016.

155,YUM,"With much of the fast-food industry embracing fried chicken despite health concerns about the greasy fare, Taco Bell is making its own foray into the category.The Mexican-themed chain, a division of Yum Brands (YUM), will begin serving a new chalupa this month with a shell made out of fried chicken, rather than corn or flour. The item is an attempt to capitalize on record-high demand for chicken while still appealing to its customers' desire for over-the-top food combinations.Taco Bell has been experimenting for years to find a fried-chicken item it could add to its menu.""Fried chicken is growing at a tremendous clip,"" Taco Bell President Brian Niccol said in an interview. ""It's a real void on our menu, and it's something that our customers ask us for.""Colonel Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken, now also owned by Yum, helped to popularize the southern specialty when he first began cooking for hungry travelers at a gas station in 1930. KFC said same-store sales jumped 6% in its most recent quarter domestically. The chain's Extra Crispy ad campaign helped pull in diners.Taco Bell's offering will go for $2.99. The item, called the Naked Chicken Chalupa, will debut on Jan. 26 and may be added to the menu permanently if it does well, Niccol said.""The thing about chicken is, it can take on a lot of different flavors,"" he said. ""It hits the right chord of being known, but yet different.""Americans are expected to eat about 91.7 pounds of chicken per person this year, the most on record, according to the National Chicken Council. That dwarfs demand for beef and pork. And at quick-service restaurant chains, much of it is being served up fried.Shake Shack (SHAK), better known for burgers and milkshakes, rolled out a fried chicken sandwich nationally last year. It has already become one of its top sellers, and the company is adding a barbecue version.Habit Restaurant (HABT), another burger chain, also began selling a Southern-style chicken sandwich last year. Customer response has been ""overwhelmingly positive,"" Chief Executive Russell William Bendel said on a conference call in November.Fast-food chains are having to fight harder to get customers in the door, increasing pressure to add the most in-demand menu items. Industrywide same-store sales — a key measure of health — grew less than 1% for the past eight months through November, according to MillerPulse data.Fried poultry is showing up at fancier places too. David Chang, head of the Momofuku Milk Bar empire, is known for his $8 spicy fried chicken sandwiches at Fuku in New York. This year, he's opening another Fuku location on Wall Street.

156,YUM,"She turned down a headhunter five times in one month — passing on such enticements as higher pay and four weeks of paid vacation — but Lisa Aragon just couldn't get the job recruiter to take no for an answer.Aragon doesn't work in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street. Far from it. She manages a Wendy's (WEN) in Albuquerque, N.M. In 20 years, Aragon had never been pursued as aggressively as she had by the recruiter from the Pilot Flying J chain of truck stops, a major franchisee of fast-food restaurants.""I told him, 'I'm happy where I'm at,'"" said Aragon, 41, who already looked forward to quarterly bonuses and a bump for her work as a trainer. ""There's no need for change right now.""In today's tight labor market, restaurants are embroiled in a full-on food fight over workers. The rank-and-file is winning referral bonuses, free meals and days off, and the scarcity of candidates may be raising the minimum wage without help from lawmakers.The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.7% in December, near a nine-year low. With its insatiable appetite for new workers, the fast-food business serves as a leading indicator of a labor shortage. In September, annual turnover for restaurant workers jumped to 113%, the highest since industry-tracker People Report began collecting data in 1995.While that's good news for workers, it may not be for companies and customers. Restaurants will either have to raise prices or accept falling margins. Some stores' service is suffering.Andrew Puzder, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. Labor Secretary, will be acutely aware of the phenomenon. A foe of raising the minimum wage, he is chief executive of privately held CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. burger chains. Further intensifying demand for lower-skilled employees, Trump has promised to curb illegal immigration.""It's a hot job market,"" said Michael Harms, executive director of operations at Dallas-based TDn2K, People Report's parent. ""Every employee, whether they're 17 years old or 40 years old, has options.""Aragon's boss is already pulling out all the stops to keep employees. Over the last year, Eddie Rodriguez, who operates 177 Wendy's in Florida, New Mexico and Texas, raised hourly pay by nearly a dollar, to an average $9.05.Rodriguez gave referral bonuses of up to $250 to employees who found prospects. He offered more flexible schedules and used his own headhunters to find staff for his corporate office in Pompano Beach, Fla. He also makes sure he doesn't take anyone for granted.""Today's employee, they want to feel wanted,"" Rodriquez said.Customers, however, may feel less appreciated. Rodriguez can't find enough employees for the lunchtime rush, which means it takes longer to get a junior bacon cheeseburger.Diners also are kept waiting at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is trying to hire about 600 ""crew members"" for its U.S. restaurants. To be able to pay more, the company, for the first time since 2014, is considering raising prices in some parts of the country.Chipotle is already paying an average $10 an hour. (For those inside the Federal Reserve looking out for evidence that the tightening labor market is sparking inflation, this could be exhibit A.)CEO Steve Ells in a December conference call complained that the lack of well-trained workers has resulted in napkins left on tables, untidy drink stations and slower meals.""We took our eye off the ball on the customer service side,"" Ells told investors.Restaurants aren't just competing with the fast-food joint down the street. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) last year raised wages of more than a million employees to either at least $10 an hour or by 2% for those making more.Casual restaurants such as Olive Garden-owner Darden Restaurants (DRI) and quick-service haunts like Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell are all struggling to hire.""It's as hard as it's ever been to attract and retain great people,"" said Greg Flynn, Chairman and CEO of Apple American Group, a franchisee of Applebee's, Taco Bell and Panera Bread (PNRA) restaurants.Terry Smith, a franchisee who owns three McDonald's (MCD) restaurants, said he has been able to avoid the crunch and maintain his staff of 150 to 160 employees with small perks such as free meals and paid days off. He also visits each of his restaurants every day, making sure he knows workers by name.""I rotate through the restaurants and they see me,"" he said. ""If you treat them right and have a vested interest in them, they'll stick around.""

158,YUM,"McDonald's (MCD) agreed to sell a controlling stake in its China and Hong Kong operations to a group of investors for about $1.7 billion, a key component of the fast-food giant's reorganization in a market where it's striving to catch up with more nimble rivals.Chinese state-backed conglomerate Citic Ltd., Citic Capital Holdings and U.S. private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP will acquire an 80% holding in a deal valuing the business at as much as $2.08 billion, according to a statement Monday. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's will keep the remaining stake. The new owners plan to add more than 1,500 restaurants over the next five years in smaller Chinese cities.McDonald's and rival Yum China Holdings (YUMC), which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut brands in the mainland, are among retailers that are trying to fend off domestic competition and attract middle-class Chinese consumers who increasingly demand high-quality and healthier dining options. As McDonald's streamlines its sprawling global operations, the fast-food giant is also looking at further deals in markets such as South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia.Under the agreement, Citic Ltd. and Citic Capital Partners will jointly take a 52% stake, while Carlyle will hold 28%.""Citic and Carlyle's resources will allow McDonald's to expand rapidly and refurbish old restaurants, which is expensive to do,"" said Ben Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group. ""Given that McDonald's lags behind KFC in terms of store count in China, we can expect them to expand aggressively and invest heavily.""McDonald's currently operates or franchises more than 2,400 outlets in mainland China. Its five-year target means about 300 stores will be added annually. That compares with 600 stores for Yum China Holdings, which was spun off late last year by Yum Brands (YUM), and 500 restaurants for Starbucks (SBUX), according to the companies.While Citic and Carlyle are paying a ""substantial price"" for 20-year franchise rights, the food and beverage chains are ""cash machines,"" Cavender said. In contrast, Yum China licensed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands from Yum Brands for 50 years, with automatic renewals that could make it possibly indefinite.The McDonald's transaction is Carlyle's second-biggest deal in China, trailing only its investments in China Pacific Insurance Group Co., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The U.S. private-equity firm invested a total of more than $700 million in China Pacific Insurance in 2005 and 2007, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. A spokeswoman for Carlyle declined to comment.McDonald's CEO  Steve Easterbrook is pursuing a turnaround plan to revive the company as it faces the fourth consecutive year of traffic declines in the U.S., its largest market. The China deal combines McDonald's with partners ""who have an unmatched understanding of the local markets and bring enhanced capabilities and new partnerships,"" the CEO said in the statement.The new partnership will also focus on areas such as menu innovation, retail digital leadership and delivery, the statement said.McDonald's, which said in March it's seeking strategic partners in Asia, has committed to re-franchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and has set a long-term target to have 95% of its outlets owned by franchisees.U.S. restaurant chains have seen their market lead in China challenged by a growing lineup of Asian competitors such as Ting Hsin International Group's Dicos eateries. The seller of Big Macs is also playing catch-up to Yum China. Since the spinoff from its U.S. parent, that company has a carte blanche opportunity to pursue growth, its Chief Executive Officer Micky Pant has said.The monthslong auction process drew interest from international private-equity funds and local companies. In October, people with knowledge of the matter said TPG Capital had exited the race, leaving its erstwhile partner, Chinese grocery operator Wumart Stores Inc., to compete against Carlyle and Citic. Bain Capital had also teamed up with Chinese hotelier GreenTree Hospitality for a bid, the people said at the time.

159,YUM,"Glen W. Bell Jr. wasn't one to move with the rest of the pack in the nascent days of the fast-food industry.While burgers were the standard fare at stands like McDonald's Drive-In in the early 1950s, Bell opted to introduce the American consumer to Mexican food.""An innovative product will set you apart,"" said Bell (1923-2010), the founder of Taco Bell and pioneer of the Mexican chain fast-food segment, in ""Taco Titan: The Glen Bell Story,"" a 1999 biography by Debra Lee Baldwin.That was his goal when in 1951 he added homemade crisp-shelled tacos to the menu of his Bell's Burgers stand (it also served hot dogs) located in a Hispanic neighborhood in San Bernardino, Calif. — at 19 cents a pop.Bell recalled the response of his first taco customer: "" 'That was good. Gimme another.' Right then I knew we had a winner.""From those humble beginnings, Bell laid the groundwork for Taco Bell, which he started in 1962, serving what his customers called 'Tay-Kohs.'Armed with determination, resourcefulness and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, Bell not only transformed Taco Bell into a restaurant dynamo, he also revolutionized the chain restaurant business by pioneering and popularizing a new category — the Mexican quick-service restaurant — which Taco Bell continues to dominate.Today, Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum Brands (YUM) and the No. 1 Mexican-inspired quick-service restaurant brand. Taco Bell represents approximately 30% of Yum's operating profit, according to Yum. Last year, system sales (includes results of company-owned and franchise restaurants) rose 6% to $9.66 billion, including the 53rd week.""The Mexican chain fast-food market was Bell's creation,"" Darren Tristano, food service trend expert and advisor to Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm, told IBD. ""He looked at the niche of tacos, which at the time wasn't a big mass food opportunity, and really built that business. He brought tacos (and Mexican fare) to the American consumer in the chain restaurant (venue).""Taco Bell remains a giant in its field. The size of Taco Bell ""dwarfs"" every other Mexican fast-food chain in the category, which also includes Taco John's and Del Taco Restaurants, Tristano says.Taco Bell's menu today includes various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and other related items.Bell began formulating his recipe for success as a leader as he ventured on the path to overcome financial woes as a youth and as he pursued his goal to start a restaurant business.At every juncture, with every experiment, setback and win, Bell learned what he called his ""recipes for success"" — 60 lessons outlined in his biography.His first two recipes were key ingredients for running his restaurant chains and important to his success:""You build a business one customer at a time. In the early days, I never closed when there was a customer waiting even though I had put in 12 hours and was eager to go home. … One happy customer is worth his weight in gold.""Find the right product, then find a way to mass-produce it. When I had my hamburger stand, similar takeout stands were spreading all over San Bernardino. If my business was to survive and grow, I would have to apply what I knew about quick service to a different product.""That's where the taco came in. Key to Bell's success was the way he ran Taco Bell's operations, says Dan Jones, who owns four Taco Bell franchises in California — two in Long Beach, one in Azusa and one in Montebello. Jones started at Taco Bell in 1965, running its original restaurant in Downey, Calif.""He was really concerned about the quality of the food, the customer service and cleanliness of the restaurants,"" Jones told IBD. He was very strict on operations. (The franchisees) were motivated by that. We knew the standards by which Taco Bell was supposed to run.""Franchisees knew how to run a restaurant profitably by allocating certain food, payroll and other costs according to certain percentages set by these standards, Jones says.If a franchisee was not following the standards, Bell would send troubleshooters to help them with their operational problems.Jones, who worked in various posts at the Taco Bell corporate level for 11 years and has been a franchisee since 1976, describes Bell as a ""mild-mannered and gentle man"" who never raised his voice.Bell created a culture where he motivated by setting a good example.""You wanted to work for him to grow the company,"" Jones said. ""He was the most honorable person I ever met and an awesome guy to work for.""The franchisees put in 60 hours a week because they ""loved being part of a dynamic company,"" Jones says.In the early years, he was active in helping franchisees. For example, if someone had a low-volume store, Bell would do something like lower the rent or reduced the royalty.Bell also hired people to whom he could delegate responsibility.""Find people who know things you don't,"" he said in his biography. ""I'm an entrepreneur, not an administrator. Taco Bell prospered because I recognized my limitations, hired professional managers to make up for them, and knew when to let go.""Another recipe for success: ""Respect your competitors and learn from them. At first, no one, not even the McDonald brothers, fully recognized the potential of fast food. But we did know, because of the customers' response, we were onto something. We experimented and continually made changes. Our 'market research' was to observe our competitors and to borrow their best ideas.""Bell learned a lot eyeing other entrepreneurs and competitors, especially the McDonald brothers.""One thing I learned from the McDonald brothers is don't sell everything your customers ask for,"" Bell said. ""Decide what you're going to sell, then make it the best it can be.""When Bell came up with the idea to sell tacos at his Bell's Burgers in 1951, he needed to develop the recipe for the best taco — one that could be made and served quickly and was good to eat. At the time, tacos served in Mexican restaurants were made with soft tortillas. Bell wanted tortillas that were ""delicately crisp"" and ready to be filled. After weeks of experimentation, Bell developed a crisp-shelled taco that was quick to assemble and tasty.Tristano calls Bell a visionary. ""The biggest trend he recognized was that Mexicans were immigrating to this country, and there was an opportunity to feed them,"" he said. ""More importantly, he Americanized Mexican food in a way he was able to create demand for his product from the American consumer.""Before Taco Bell started expanding throughout the country, no one knew what Mexican food was, says Jones, who was a franchisee consultant at the time the first Taco Bell in Florida opened.At the time, people didn't know what they were eating or even how to pronounce the names of the food on the menu, Jones says. But that didn't stop the Florida eatery from being a success.""The food was great,' Jones said. ""We couldn't make tacos fast enough.""After Florida, Bell pushed Taco Bell's expansion across the country.Bell was also a visionary in identifying the void in the market for more exotic multicultural fast food.Bell developed Taco Bell during a time when the burger market was taking off with McDonald's (MCD) and Burger King.Bell focused on franchising. ""This was his way of building an empire in a very short time span,"" Tristano said. ""Franchising has proven to be a strong growth vehicle, especially in fast food. Access to capital wasn't as common back then. He was able to build stores without having to operate them or finance them.""The first Taco Bell franchise opened in Torrance, Calif., in 1965. Bell's first venture in the restaurant business was in 1948, when he opened Bell's Drive-In, in San Bernardino. The idea to build a restaurant came to him after he studied the success of the McDonald brothers and their namesake burger drive-ins first founded in San Bernardino.Between 1954 and 1955, Bell and a business partner built three drive-thru taco stands in Southern California called Taco Tia. Bell's partner wasn't in favor of expanding Taco Tia into Los Angeles. Bell sold his interests in the taco stands. Later in the 1950s Bell and a new group of partners opened a chain called El Taco, which Bell also sold his interests in.Taco Bell went public in 1970.In 1978, Bell sold 868 Taco Bell restaurants to PepsiCo (PEP). PepsiCo spun out Taco Bell and its other restaurant chains in late 1997 to Tricon Global Restaurants. With the purchase of two other chains, Tricon Global restaurants changed its name to Yum Brands in 2002.Bell was born in Lynwood, Calif. At 16, with his family struggling financially, Bell ""rode the rails"" across America looking for work, according to his biography. Bell joined the Marine Corps in 1943, and served in the Pacific. While in Guadalcanal, his job was to serve meals to high-ranking officers.That's where he gleaned one of his key recipes for success:""Any job is an opportunity to learn. You would think that serving food to generals in Guadalcanal wouldn't have much relevance later on. But it taught me how to estimate how much food was needed based on the number of people served. That knowledge gave me confidence to start a restaurant.""Pioneered and popularized Mexican quick-service restaurantOvercame: The competition from the burger-chain giants to convince American consumers to eat Mexican fast foodLesson: Learn from your wins, setbacks and experiments.""An innovative product will set you apart.""

160,YUM,"Four Equifax (EFX) executives did not commit insider trading when they sold shares of the credit-rating bureau in the days after it discovered a massive security breach, according to findings from a special committee that were released Friday.XThe committee, which was formed in September to investigate those trades, said that ""none of the four executives had knowledge of the incident when their trades were made, that pre-clearance for the four trades was appropriately obtained, that each of the four trades at issue comported with Company policy, and that none of the four executives engaged in insider trading.""The committee, composed of independent Equifax board members, found that CFO John Gamble, president of U.S. information relations Joseph Loughran, investor relations director Douglas Brandberg, and workforce solutions president Rodolfo Ploder first learned that ""a security issue was being investigated"" at various points in August after the sales occurred.The stock sales were the subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, Bloomberg reported in September. The breach led to the departures of CEO Richard Smith and other executives.Suspicions of the trades were first raised after Equifax detailed the timing of the breach, which left more than 145 million U.S. consumers vulnerable to identity theft and left many feeling hopeless about their ability to protect their personal information.The company said that the data breach — in which hackers likely accessed Social Security and driver's license numbers, birth dates and addresses — likely occurred from mid-May through July, and that it discovered the intrusion on July 29.CFO John Gamble sold $946,374 worth of the company's stock on Aug. 1. Joseph Loughran also sold shares on that date. Ploder and Brandberg made their trades on Aug. 2. Equifax disclosed the breach to the public on Sept. 7.Equifax shares were down 0.2% at 108.70 on the stock market today and are more than 25% off their high reached before the hack was revealed.  Rival TransUnion (TRU) rose 0.8% to 53.86, a record close.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the outrage against the company now, a JPMorgan analyst said Equifax will probably be fine. Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut, Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods and Sonic (SONC) and Hyatt (H) are among the companies that have disclosed security breaches in recent weeks. According to an Ars Technica report last month, Equifax's site was being used to send out fake, malicious Flash updates.That news was ""just Reason No. 10,000 why consumers should assume their personal information is already out there and act accordingly,"" Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst from CreditCards.com, said in an emailed statement at that time.RELATED:Sonic Discloses That Hackers Breached Customers' Credit CardsEquifax CEO Richard Smith Retires After Mass HackKey Question On Equifax Options Trade Is Who Initiated OrderEquifax Stock Sales Said To Be Focus Of U.S. Criminal Probe

164,YUM,"Restaurant stocks were off investors' menu after NPD Group forecast that industry traffic would ""remain stalled"" this year, as restaurants struggle to stand out and cheaper groceries offer more of a reason for diners to eat at home.While the research group on Tuesday said it expects quick-service restaurant visits to rise 1% next year, compared to flat growth last year. However, traffic at full-service restaurants is seen falling 2%, meaning no growth for the industry overall, NPD said.McDonald's (MCD) fell 1.7% to 119.62 in the stock market today, slipping further from a 124.10 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base. McDonald's shares tumbled through their 200-day line and are approaching their 50-day average. Yum Brands (YUM), which operates Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, fell fractionally as it tries to find support at its 50-day.Jack in the Box (JACK), among the better-performing restaurant stocks in recent months, dropped 2.9% to 108.40. The stock fell to 107.10 intraday, briefly dipping back into buy range from a 102.78 entry point.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) was down 0.6%, but extended a trend below its 50-day line after running up last year partly on the strength of its digital ordering platform. Dave & Buster's (PLAY), whose gaming-centric approach has also made it an investor favorite, fell 0.8%.NPD's forecast comes after restaurants last year struggled with a combination of harsh or unseasonable weather, competitive value deals, election-related anxiety and an oversupply in some ingredients that has helped keep costs down but also made groceries cheaper.""Commodity costs are expected to continue their decline and this may help restaurant operators in terms of offsetting higher prices for labor and medical insurance costs,"" NPD said in a statement. ""However, as the gap widens between away-from-home and at-home food costs, it will make for a more challenging environment for operators to get a greater share of consumers' wallet.""RBC Capital Markets, however, said in a research note last month that the drag from food deflation ""should diminish significantly"" in the second half of the year, helping fast food restaurants' same-store sales.NPD also said that restaurants would need to be more innovative to differentiate themselves from rivals and court millennials more likely to seek unique, memorable experiences in what they spend their money on.Mobile ordering, NPD said, is set to ""grow exponentially."" Menu customization and other technology that caters to personal choice will also be essential to restaurants' relevance, the firm added. Loyalty programs are also likelier to be a focus.Third-party delivery and pickup services, like GrubHub (GRUB) and Amazon.com (AMZN), are also likely to get more attention.""Taking advantage of the increasing popularity of delivery will provide restaurant operators with another avenue to drive traffic,"" NPD said.IBD'S TAKE: In an interview with IBD, Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said phone-based ordering will soon look ""quaint"" and he was still assessing what companies like GrubHub and Uber Eats mean for the restaurant industry.GrubHub sank 1.5% on an analyst downgrade Tuesday, while Amazon closed up 0.5%.SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett said in a research note Tuesday that he continued to expect restaurant stocks with the ""most differentiated concepts"" — such as Dave & Buster's, Wingstop (WING), fast-casual burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK) and Bojangles (BOJA) — to outperform.RELATED:Trump Taps Fast-Food CEO, Big ObamaCare Foe, To Head Labor DepartmentFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperWhat To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?

166,YUM,"For much of the summer and fall, pizza stocks seemed to be the only restaurant stocks performing well, with Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) hitting a series of all-time highs. But since the election, several other restaurant operators have soared.Dave & Buster's (PLAY), Jack in the Box (JACK) and Bojangles (BOJA) are in buy range.Meanwhile, Wingstop (WING), Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), Cracker Barrel (CBRL) and Panera Bread (PNRA) are all closing in on sound entry points.Among restaurant giants, Yum Brands (YUM), parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, is consolidating well. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is approaching a buy point.

Since then, shares have traded near the high end of its buy range, pulling back 2.5% to 104.95 Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant stocks rallied on the election results on hopes that a Trump administration would have a lighter regulatory touch on eateries, on ObamaCare, franchisee rules and overtime pay. A federal judge last week blocked Pres. Obama's overtime rule, set to launch Dec. 1. Here's how the overtime ruling affects fast food chains and other retailers.Bojangles is a Southern-inspired chicken-and-biscuit chain.Bojangles came public at 19 a share in May 2015, hitting a record 28.45 a few days after its debut.

"
168,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Co-Chief Executive Officer Monty Moran is departing the company, leaving founder Steve Ells in sole charge of reviving the embattled burrito chain after a food-safety crisis.Moran, 50, has stepped down as co-CEO and vacated his board seat, the Denver-based company said in a statement Monday. He will retire altogether from Chipotle next year.The move follows a tumultuous year for Chipotle, which suffered a series of foodborne-illness outbreaks in 2015 and then struggled to repair its image. The company renewed investor fears last week when it warned that customer service has slipped, partly because Chipotle has been focused on the crisis. The stock fell almost 8 percent on Tuesday after those remarks.With the turnaround faltering, it was time to make a change, said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.""The inability to run good restaurants this year is almost mind-boggling,"" he said.Chipotle's board cited operational problems in pushing to have the 51-year-old Ells retake the CEO job alone. He started the company more than 23 years ago and ran it until 2009, when he assumed the shared role with Moran.IBD'S TAKE: While Chipotle struggles, several restaurant stocks have broken out in recent weeks. Check out this IBD Stock Analysis of 2015 IPO Wingstop. ""As the company grew, operations became more complicated and less consistent,"" Neil Flanzraich, lead director of Chipotle's board, said in the statement. ""Given the ongoing challenges facing the company, the board felt strongly that it was best for Steve to resume leadership of the company going forward.""The shares rose 3.3% to 382.36 on the stock market today. Chipotle had slid 23% this year through the end of last week, dogged by the slow recovery from E. coli and norovirus outbreaks last year.Before Moran was hired as co-CEO, he had served for almost four years as chief operating officer. He also worked as general counsel and previously was CEO of the Denver law firm Messner & Reeves LLC.At the time, Ells said that Moran helped bring a ""people culture"" to Chipotle, rather than just a ""food culture."" Ells, a classically trained chef, had created the chain with the aim of bringing higher-quality ingredients and cooking techniques to the fast-food industry.A co-CEO arrangement is often meant to help a company's founder handle a growing business's mechanics. But if Moran was supposed to be the operations guy, it wasn't showing up in recent results, Halen said.Chipotle's workforce hasn't been managed well, he said. In the aftermath of the E. coli crisis, Chipotle kept restaurants fully staffed — despite lower customer traffic — in a bid to maintain its customer service. But the turnaround effort has been lackluster.The restaurant chain said last week that it has now imposed a hiring freeze. It also warned that it was ""nervous"" about meeting its 2017 guidance. In October, Chipotle forecast 2017 earnings of $10 a share.""They kept labor in the restaurants and at the same time operations still deteriorated,"" Halen said. ""They need to make some changes.""Ells said on Monday that he would be focused on improving the company's restaurant teams — and in turn, the dining experience.""While our plans will take some time to implement, we will act with a sense of urgency toward all of the changes we are pursuing,"" he said.Chipotle isn't the only food company to abandon dual-CEO roles this year. Whole Foods Market (WFM) made a similar move last month, putting its co-founder back in sole control of the chain.At Chipotle, Moran's departure may help the company make other management changes, according to John Zolidis, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group. The co-CEOs' pay packages had drawn criticism in the past, and the latest change could free up resources to apply elsewhere.The move ""sets the stage to bring in new individuals and amplify the executive team with a skill set more closely aligned to addressing the company's current issues,"" Zolidis said in a note.RELATED:Chipotle Chief: Service Hampering ComebackDave & Buster's, Panera, Wingstop, Yum Among Restaurants Back On Menu

176,YUM,"Even as Jack in the Box (JACK) appears poised for a windfall from looser marijuana laws nationwide, Goldman Sachs says that diminishing benefits from California's minimum-wage hikes and Taco Bell's focus on breakfast and $1 offerings pose risks to the burger chain.Jack in the Box's same-store sales have likely been helped by California's minimum-wage increases, said Goldman Sachs, which initiated coverage of the stock Monday with a sell rating and an 88 price target. But rising unemployment in the state during the fourth quarter could work to neutralize demand.Taco Bell's recent focus on breakfast, begun in 2014, and a $1 breakfast menu launched this March have also made competition more difficult for Jack in the Box, Goldman said. The $1 price is something a burger chain ""would struggle to replicate,"" analyst Karen Holthouse wrote in the firm's initiation note.""Taco Bell has one of the most flexible menus for engineering entry-level value,"" she wrote, ""and it plans to emphasize its all-day $1 menu in its fall creative.""The two chains also have a large presence in California — both have their roots in the state — and also vie aggressively for the attention of millennials, Holthouse noted.Jack in the Box's own Mexican chain, Qdoba, also faces competition from an array of fast-casual rivals, including Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which reports earnings Tuesday. But its push into catering could present future opportunities, Holthouse said.Jack in the Box fell 1.5% to 97.06 in the stock market today. Yum Brands (YUM), Taco Bell's owner, rose 1% to 87.80.IBD'S TAKE: Value deals like Taco Bell's $1 menu offerings have become more common as food costs fall. But eating at home has become cheaper as well, while labor costs continue to rise in the fast-food sector.However, Goldman noted, Jack in the Box's year-over-year comparisons get easier as the company laps ""promotional mismatches"" in its fiscal 2016 and McDonald's (MCD) launch of All Day Breakfast.As promotional competition adds to many restaurants' struggles this year, McDonald's and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) were outliers in the third quarter. McDonald's remains popular among younger diners. Domino's, meanwhile, has been helped in part by its digital ordering platform.McDonald's fell 0.3% to 113.57 Monday, after rising 3% Friday on its stronger-than-expected earnings.Domino's Pizza rose 0.1% to 166.53 after surging 10% last week to a record high on its booming earnings.As other chains contend with consumer anxiety about the presidential election, Jack in the Box's prospects look a little brighter elsewhere on the ballot.""Within quick-service,"" Cowen & Co. said in a research report last month, ""we note Jack in the Box has the greatest exposure to recreational marijuana use becoming more widely accepted in states that have already legalized use (10% of the store base), as well as 5 states with an upcoming legalized recreational use proposal on state ballots for the November election (52% of the store base).""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-MartMcDonald's: Labor-Saving Self-Order Kiosks Are Not A 'Risk' To JobsWhat Jack In The Box, 'Hunger Games' And 'Seinfeld' Have In Common

177,YUM,"Not even Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or Brexit have affected appetites for Domino's Pizza (DPZ), as its shares jumped more than 6% on earnings Tuesday, and its chief executive said he expects more consolidation among fast-casual rivals as the company grows.CEO Patrick Doyle told Investor's Business Daily that the company has no interest in participating in a merger via acquisition, but he said some fast-casual pizza restaurants could probably come together as more pop up.""At some point, scale matters, and there are enough different players within that category that I'm sure you will see some consolidation at some point,"" he said.During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Doyle also said enough fast-casual restaurants started up at the same time and have a similar approach that tie-ups were likely.That consolidation would come as Domino's tries to position itself as a better-ingredient pizza chain and as bigger players in the business take market share from smaller competitors.The consolidation would also follow Domino's outperforming a slumping restaurant sector. Domino's third-quarter U.S. same-store sales jumped 13%, well above views for an 8.8% increase, the company said on Tuesday.Earnings soared 43.3% to 96 cents a share, topping estimates for 90 cents. Overall revenue rose 16.9% to $566.7 million.Shares ended trading up nearly 5% to 159.45 on the stock market today. The stock saw a similar bounce after Domino's reported second-quarter earnings, but shares in recent weeks had trended closer to their 50-day line, a key test of investor support.International comp sales climbed 6.6%. The stronger dollar, particularly against the pound, remained difficult, as it has for other companies with a presence in the U.K. But Doyle said he doesn't anticipate this summer's Brexit vote hurting U.K. demand.""It still has to play out, and you're still a couple years away from the actual exit taking place,"" he said of the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. ""But honestly, I think that was overplayed at the time on just how big an effect that might have on the U.K. economy and on the global economy.""Shares of Domino's and Papa John's (PZZA) have been outliers in a restaurant industry where comparable store sales have lagged due to value-meal-related discounting. Consumers also appear more likely to eat in or order in as grocery prices fall and anxieties about global events weigh.Fast-food bellwether McDonald's (MCD) reports Friday and total sales are expected to continue declining.During the call, Doyle said that frozen-pizza offerings at grocery stores have not affected Domino's sales all that much, adding that they were more likely to cannibalize other frozen food.""Despite how they've tried to position themselves, one more sale of frozen pizza is one less sale of frozen lasagna,"" Doyle said on the call.Domino's and Papa John's, analysts say, have benefited from a variety of factors. Lower ingredient costs in general have allowed for healthier margins for the business and more value — and food — for consumers. Digital ordering technology also lends itself more easily to the pizza business, where customers have already been ordering delivery over the phone for decades.Analysts had been watching to see if Domino's could continue to buck the trends seen with other restaurants.""This quarter further demonstrates Domino's ability to leverage its digital platform to consistently take market share in a mature, slow growth category,"" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh wrote in a research note.""Domino's posted the best Q2 domestic same-store sales growth of the 25 largest restaurant chains in the U.S. -- and now looks poised to do so again in Q3, likely by a wide margin,"" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Since breaking out of a cup base on July 21, Domino's shares have continued to rise, staying above their 50-day line and earning a place on IBD's Leaderboard. On Tuesday's earnings, shares jumped out but could be extended, signaling a note of caution for new investors.Domino's results follow a difficult third quarter for Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands (YUM). Pizza Hut's same-store sales slid 1% during the quarter.""We believe that Domino's particularly took share from Pizza Hut (which reported a 2% same-store sales decline for its third quarter), regional pizza concepts, and mom-and-pop pizza shops,"" Kalinowski wrote.Smaller pizza restaurants are likely to suffer as Domino's strengthens its digital ordering platform, Kalinowski said. Domino's last month launched a bot that allows U.S. customers to order pizza via Facebook (FB) Messenger, following ordering platforms it has introduced via Amazon (AMZN) and Twitter (TWTR).Doyle would not comment specifically on what other platforms the company was targeting, saying it would continue to look at where their customers spend their time.Even as anxiety about the election and global events weigh elsewhere, Doyle said he hasn't seen any meaningful change in consumer behavior as a result. Instead, he credited company fundamentals for Domino's success, rather than a greater desire to eat in due to that anxiety.And he said a dip in demand for Election Day, typically a big night for pizza orders, appeared unlikely, even as the presidential campaign takes on a darker, meaner tone.""Any time people are gathering around television sets, we're going to feel a positive effect from that,"" Doyle said.""In terms of its overall effect on a quarter, it's just not big enough that you'll actually feel it in our numbers,"" he continued. ""Certainly anything that becomes a spectator sport — and this election has clearly become a spectator sport — is going to have some positive effect.""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-MartForget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar Stores

179,YUM,"Yum Brands (YUM) Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed said the fast-food giant will have ""higher growth and less risk"" after separating its China business, the biggest shake-up at the company in almost two decades.With the restaurants in China paying to license Yum's brands, the company still will benefit from the growth potential of the world's largest consumer market, Creed said at an annual investor conference in New York on Tuesday. Yet having the locations in a separate company will allow Yum to reduce costs and return more capital to shareholders, he said.The comments signal that Yum -- the owner of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant chains -- is on track to deliver on the promises it made when it announced the China split a year ago. The move came after Carl Icahn protege Keith Meister's Corvex Management took a stake in the company pressured Yum to hive off the business in a bid to boost its value to shareholders.Yum shares were the top performers in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index at the outset of trading on Tuesday, rising as much as 3.8%. But shares gave back some of those gains and ended trading up 1% to 88.25. The stock already had gained 20% this year through Monday.Yum said Tuesday in a statement that it plans to have at least 98% of its locations run by franchisees by its fiscal year ending in 2018. That's up from 77% now and a projected 93% by the time of the China separation.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper groceries and lingering dread over global politics have dampened customers' enthusiasm about dining out. Even pizza stocks like Domino's Pizza and Papa John's have lost support, after weeks of being outliers, in part due to their digitally focused model that makes ordering in easier.Handing more of its restaurants over to franchisees will allow the company to cut costs and return more capital to shareholders. Yum plans to reduce capital spending to $100 million in fiscal 2019 from about $500 million after the separation. General and administrative expenses will fall by $300 million. The company plans to return about $13.5 billion in cash, including dividends, to shareholders between the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2019.The China split also will allow management to turn its attention to the U.S. business, which faces the challenges of sluggish spending by consumers and increased competition with fast-food rivals. Pizza Hut is grappling with an escalating battle of discounts and promotions with Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA). Third-quarter sales at Pizza Hut chain dropped 1%, trailing estimates.""Making it easier to get a pizza is really critically important to us going forward,"" Creed said.Taco Bell, meanwhile, has found success by focusing on enticing diners with indulgent fare, such as beefy crunch burritos, along with a revamped $1 menu. The chain also is making a bigger push to open locations abroad and recently just added its first Brazil location. Same-store sales rose 3% in the most recent quarter at the chain.Yum had struggled to regain footing in China in recent years after a former supplier was accused of selling expired food. KFC and Pizza Hut also are facing more local competition and a tougher economy where consumers are less willing to spend. Last week, the company said the dispute over the South China Sea hurt last quarter's sales.Yum China will begin trading Nov. 1 on the New York Stock Exchange under the YUMC ticker. The company will give one share of Yum China for each share of Yum Brands held. While the separation will allow Yum to focus more on its domestic operations -- where it's trying to revamp brands and boost sales -- Creed said Yum has remain involved with the business.""We intend to continue that collaboration for the days, weeks and months ahead,"" Creed said.RELATED:Yum Brands Stock Dives Late As Earnings, Sales Miss; China Comps DownRestaurant Stocks Continue To Turn Investors' Stomachs

180,YUM,"To bring back customers following last year's foodborne illness scare, Chipotle has deployed chorizo, better food-safety protocols, promotions, this love story video, and  even a drone pilot program.But customers still appeared squeamish. Traffic at the fast-casual Mexican chain was still disappointing, CNBC reported Tuesday, citing a report from M Science on StreetAccount.Shares closed down 3.4% at 423.02 on the stock market today, after nearly retaking their downward sloping 200-day line Monday for the first time in a year. Meanwhile, Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) rose 1%, while Qdoba parent Jack In The Box (JACK) fell 1.7%. El Pollo Loco (LOCO) edged up 0.4%, and Del Taco (TACO) dipped 0.3%.Chipotle's stock has tumbled since last year. The broader restaurant sector, meanwhile, has struggled to compete with cheaper groceries, their own competitive value deals and broader consumer anxieties.IBD'S TAKE: Despite restaurant stocks' struggles, shorter-term opportunities do exist. For more see this story  about restaurant stocks, and IBD's column The Short Side. In July, Chipotle said its efforts to bring back customers were paying off and touted its Chiptopia loyalty program, which had attracted more than 3.6 million participants by then.Those efforts, the company said, had helped cushion falling same-store sales that month. For Q2, comp sales still plunged 23.6%, though that was an improvement over Q1's 30% dive.More changes could be coming — activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square in September disclosed a 9.9% stake in the fast-casual chain, prompting speculation on how he might influence the company.RELATED:Do McDonald's Japan Sales Point To 'Pokemon Go' Fatigue?Why The Next Apple Could Come From A Drone Wildcatter

182,YUM,"Yum Brands (YUM), the owner KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, reported third-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street forecasts, and a key China metric fell far short of views less than a month before the spin-off of its operations in that countryEstimates: Earnings per share up 10% to $1.10, with revenue up 1% to $3.464 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS was $1.09.

During the regular session, shares closed down 1.9% to 88.61 in heavy volume on the stock market today, dropping below their 50-day line where they had found support last week.Why It Matters: Cheaper groceries and lingering dread over global politics have dampened customers' enthusiasm about dining out. Even pizza stocks like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have lost support, after weeks of being outliers, in part due to their digitally focused model that makes ordering in easier. Both pizza stocks closed Wednesday above their 50-day lines.Yum Brands's Q3 results may have benefited from Taco Bell's Triple Double Crunchwrap and KFC's Extra Crispy chicken promotion, RBC said in a research note last month. But competition from Domino's may have hurt Pizza Hut, and the pizza chain's limited-time offerings may have been less effective, the firm added.Yum is set to complete its spinoff of its China business at the end of this month, and the company's U.S. results could become more important. Late Wednesday, Yum said Yum China Holdings will begin trading Nov. 1 on the NYSE under the ticker symbol YUMC.""Speaking of YUM! U.S. more broadly,"" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a recent research note, ""investors may watch the U.S. same-store sales numbers a little more closely than they usually have in the past given that YUM! China is scheduled to become a master franchisee market shortly – thus likely rendering the U.S. business relatively more important to YUM's results post-spin than it has generally been pre-spin.""Yum's results come a day after Darden Restaurants (DRI), which operates Olive Garden, reported fiscal Q1 same-store sales and revenue that missed forecasts, while EPS topped and the company raised full-year EPS guidance.Last week, fast-food chain Sonic (SONC) gave preliminary Q4 EPS figures that were below consensus, warning about ""lower consumer spending in restaurants and continued aggressive competitive activity.""RELATED:Kroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-Mart

Small caps performed better, with the Russell 2000 gaining 0.6%.The Dow utility average also outperformed, rising 0.8%.

192,YUM,"A team made up of the Carlyle Group (CG) and a Chinese state conglomerate is seen as the front-runner to win an auction for McDonald's (MCD) locations in China and Hong Kong, Reuters reported Thursday.As part of its turnaround plans after several quarters of sluggish sales, McDonald's this year said it wants to ""identify strategic partners"" for its franchise business in Asia, a move that would shift costs onto independent owners.Carlyle and partner CITIC Group, a state-run investment conglomerate, had made final bids for the China and Hong Kong restaurants, Reuters reported, as had private equity firm TPG Capital and real estate outfit Sanpower Group. It was unclear if others had also made bids.TPG teamed up with Chinese mini-market chain Wumart in the bid, while Sanpower had previously said it would work with Beijing Tourism Group, Reuters said, as having local partners can help companies outside China more easily deal with supply and real estate-related difficulties.Shares of McDonald's closed up 0.4% at 116.14 in the stock market today, but have been crawling near the bottom of a flat base in recent weeks. Yum Brands (YUM), which is planning to spin off its China operations later this year, climbed 1% to 87.79.IBD's TAKE: Even as the restaurant sector struggles, Papa John's continues to hover near a buy point. Find out why pizza stocks are doing better than other restaurants. McDonald's business in China and Hong Kong could be worth as much as $3 billion, Reuters said.The development comes as McDonald's and rival Yum Brands try to limit their exposure in the region after suffering from food-safety scandals in China in 2014.RELATED:Ackman's Chipotle Menu?

193,YUM,"Fads come and go, and it's not a stretch to wonder if the slowdown in McDonald's (MCD) Japan's same-store growth might point to fewer Charizard captures, just months after ""Pokemon Go"" partnered up with the country's Big Mac chain.While Japanese consumers can be especially fickle with their fads, tech trends often begin there before spreading elsewhere.Same-store sales for McDonald's Japan grew 11.5% in September, a deceleration from a 15.9% gain in August and the spectacular 26.6% surge in July, when the game first debuted in Japan.Most McDonald's locations across the country became Pokemon ""gyms"" and game-related hot spots, which boosted McDonald's Japan sales, according to Nikkei reports. The stock also saw a 2.2% boost July 19 when the game went live in Japan, marking its biggest increase in seven months.Even with a mild slowdown last month, that's still a marked difference from the prior year's negative 1.9% in same-store sales, however. McD's in the country were plagued last year by the aftermath of several food-contamination incidents that tainted the Happy Meal maker's image in the country.McDonald's shares edged up 0.45% to 113.92 in the stock market today after falling intraday to their lowest level since November 2015. U.S.-listed shares of Nintendo (NTDOY), which has a stake in game developer Niantic and in Pokemon Co., fell 2.3% to 31.80.Nintendo spiked earlier in the summer on its viral popularity, and popped nearly 29% on Sept. 7 after Apple (AAPL) announced that ""Pokemon Go"" would be coming to the Apple Watch.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant stocks, including fast-food chains to sit-down establishments, haven't been experiencing the best year. Yum Brands is sinking after a late Thursday Q3 miss.While McDonald's Japan posted but two months of positive comps in 2015 and only one month of positive comps in 2014, this year has seen nothing but hefty double-digit comparable sales.September's growth is the lowest so far in 2016, though it's unclear just how much of that is tied to a fade in ""Pokemon Go"" users frequenting the fast-food chain.Spending per customer also decelerated to 4.1% from 7.9% in August and 15.3% in July. The number of customers that frequented McDonald's Japan in September grew 7.1%.RELATED:Restaurant Stocks Continue To Turn Investors' StomachsOff The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs. Eating In

195,YUM,"Texas Instruments (TXN) could be a surprise candidate to step in and acquire NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), a move that would leave Qualcomm (QCOM) in the dust, says Nomura.""It almost seems inevitable that NXP will be acquired,"" wrote Nomura analyst Romit Shah in a research note Tuesday. Dow Jones last week was first to report that Qualcomm is looking to acquire NXP for about $30 billion.Like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments is one of the top 10 chip companies worldwide. TI specializes in analog chips and embedded processors. NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications, and its shares quintupled 2012-2014 before slowing in the past 16 months.""Most investors expect Qualcomm to win the process,"" Shah wrote. ""While we don't disagree, we also see Texas Instruments as a dark horse that hasn't been seriously thought of and could rush past the field in triumph.""Shah says Texas Instruments is overdue to make a big acquisition, having made 33 over the past 20 years but none in the past five years.Buying NXP would boost Texas Instruments' microcontroller market share to No. 1 from No. 7. NXP is the leading supplier of non-automotive microcontroller units and second in industrial and automotive application processors, says Shah. Also, NXP would lift Texas Instruments from the fourth-largest to the second-largest non-memory semiconductor company by revenue, Shah wrote.Moreover, NXP CEO Rick Clemmer and Chairman Peter Bonfield are former TI employees, says Shah.""We believe that Clemmer maintains close ties with the TI management team, while Bonfield has spoken publicly about his affection for Texas Instruments,"" Shah wrote.NXP stock closed at 103.23, up a fraction, in the stock market today. Shares jumped 17% on Thursday, on reports of Qualcomm's interest, and have risen another seven percentage points since then. Texas Instruments slipped a fraction Tuesday, to 69.59.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers often come with big challenges, and many never pan out. For an example of huge deal that so far is working out, look no further than the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. Broadcom, a product of a merger completed early this year between Broadcom and Avago, resides at No. 36. More than that, Broadcom also is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Assuming NXP gets acquired, it would be part of a wave of consolidation occurring in the chip sector.RELATED:NXP Hires Adviser To Field Offers As Qualcomm CirclesTexas Instruments, Inphi, Yum Lead Wednesday Investing Action Plan

200,YUM,"Yum Brands (YUM) said late Wednesday its Chinese operations have momentum ahead of a spinoff later this year, and the fast-food giant raised its full-year outlook after second-quarter earnings topped views.The parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut said adjusted earnings per share climbed 9% to 75 cents, beating analyst expectations for 74 cents. Revenue dropped 3% to $3.01 billion, missing Wall Street's $3.09 billion target, as China sales eased 3% to $1.59 billion.

The fast-food giant has said it will spin off its Chinese operation, its biggest source of revenue, by October.Banks were among the leading industry groups, mostly up about 2%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) rose 2% after reporting earnings that beat estimates.

203,YUM,"A common pitfall for new and experienced investors alike is to buy a stock just ahead of its earnings report because it's ""acting right.""

Shares gapped up on the news. But it didn't work out with Mobileye (MBLY) recently when shares crashed 8% on the day it reported its quarterly results. The company delivered another strong quarter of earnings and sales growth, but news that the company would be ending its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) rattled investors.IBD recently introduced an options strategy to limit risk around earnings. The strategy provides a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings, while reducing the risk of a negative reaction to an earnings report. Weekly or monthly options can be used -- so long as the cost for the option is right.The options market might sound a bit daunting, but the strategy isn't complicated.First, look for stocks at or near proper buy points. Most will be building bases. After that, look for a slightly out-of-the-money weekly or monthly call option. This means the strike price is just above the underlying stock price. Every strike price comes with a premium, or the cost of the option. Divide the premium by the stock price, and multiply by 100; this gives you the downside risk for the trade in percentage form. Looks for trades with downside risk of 4% or less.The strategy is detailed every week in the Earnings Preview column of the IBD Weekly edition on page B2. Several stocks featured in recent weeks delivered nice options wins.One of the early winners was Nvidia (NVDA), featured in the May 9 edition of IBD Weekly as it got support at the 10-week moving average. When shares were trading around 35.50 on May 12, a slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with a 36 strike price (May 13 expiration) came with a premium of $1.27. That offered a trade with 3.6% downside risk.Shares gapped up May 13 on earnings and closed at 40.98. The option could have been exercised that day at 36. If you didn't want shares, you could have sold the option itself for a nice profit.Other winners in recent weeks included Salesforce.com (CRM), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), Paychex (PAYX), Yum Brands (YUM) and Domino's.Of course, earnings option plays aren't always going to work, but they're a lower-risk alternative to buying a stock outright ahead of earnings because risk is predefined.

207,YUM,"McDonald's (MCD) is reportedly struggling to find qualified bidders for its China outlets in an auction that could bring in as much as $3 billion.The franchising of its China stores is part of the company's earlier reported revitalization plan. The plan also includes revamping its menu, including making breakfasts available all day long, and is seen as a way to distance itself from earlier food scandals in China.In May, McDonald's said it would streamline its international operations into four market segments, each headed by a then-current McDonald's executive, to cut down on bureaucracy.The world's biggest restaurant company has received more than a half-dozen bids. Among the bidders are state-owned China Cinda Asset Management, dairy foods company Beijing Sanyuan Foods, Sanpower Group and noodle shop owner ChemChina, another state-owned company, the Financial Times reported.The franchise auction reportedly involves local partners taking over the company's 2,800-store China and Hong Kong stores for 20 years and paying royalties to McDonald's.After reporting four quarters of shrinking earnings, McDonald's has reported double-digit earnings growth for the last three quarters in a row.

Global sales at stores open at least a year rose 2%.Foreign-currency translation negatively impacted operating profit by $28 million, leading to a 12% rise in operating profit to $564 million.CEO Greg Creed said all four of the company's divisions posted positive same-store sales and core operating profit growth.""I’m especially encouraged by the continued turnaround of our Pizza Hut U.S. business, which delivered 5% same-store sales growth,"" he said in a statement.The China division, which accounts for about half of Yum's business, saw system sales increase 6%, or 11% excluding foreign-currency moves. Same-store sales grew 6%. Operating profit jumped 35%.The growth is encouraging ahead of the unit’s spinoff, following food-safety scares in recent years that sent sales plunging.""KFC China had an outstanding Chinese New Year bucket promotion leading to 12% same-store sales growth for the quarter,” Creed said.Yum plans to spin off its China restaurants by the end of 2016 and expects to add 600 stores there this year, pushing its total to 7,800. Yum China has an estimated value of $7 billion-$8 billion.An investor group that includes China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp., KKR & Co.

"
212,YUM,"Investors will get a chance to see how much more sizzle McDonald’s (MCD) can add to its stock price this week when the fast-food king reports first-quarter earnings.The iconic burger chain is already one of the restaurant industry’s top performers this year, with a stock price trading near record highs and an aggressive growth plan that includes a big expansion in Asia.Now all all eyes will be on McDonald’s Q1 results, due Friday morning. Industry watchers expect another strong quarter, at least on the bottom line.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters look for McDonald’s to log a 15% year-over-year earnings gain to $1.16 a share, which would be the third straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth. That hasn’t happened in more than four years.The top-line forecast is a little muddier. McDonald’s overall revenue is seen dipping 3% to $5.8 billion for the quarter, which would be the sixth straight quarter of lower revenue.However, same-store sales growth — a more important industry metric — has been strong. Most analysts see McDonald’s Q1 U.S. comps up 4% to 4.5%.During the 2015 fourth quarter, McDonald’s posted a 5.7% increase in same-store sales, well above consensus. Earnings rose 16% to $1.31 a share, topping forecasts by 8 cents. Sales fell 4% to $6.34 billion, but still topped views for $6.2 billion.The company’s recent financial turnaround is partly the result of success with its all-day breakfast menu, which debuted in the fall. Its McPick 2 for $2 deal, an alternative to the Dollar Menu, didn’t fare as well. It was later replaced by the McPick 2 for $5, which has performed better.""While the McPick 2 for $2 and industry conditions were relatively weak in January, McPick 2 for $5, along with ongoing strength from All Day Breakfast, have bolstered sales trends in March,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report. ""We believe that the McPick 2 value brand will be one of several reasons that McDonald’s can sustain (same-store sales momentum).""Meanwhile, McDonald’s said it will begin selling Johnsonville Brats again after a seven-year hiatus, perhaps in response to a recent move by rival Burger King to sell hot dogs.Starting April 25, brats will return to menus at 125 McDonald’s locations in southeast Wisconsin, according to news reports.Another potential growth driver is McDonald’s big expansion in Asia. It recently announced plans to add more than 1,500 locations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea over the next five years. It already has more than 2,800 locations in those markets, most of which are company owned. This time McDonald’s is looking for ""strategic partners"" to help in its Asia expansion.""This will allow McDonald's to accelerate our growth and scale faster across diverse markets, placing us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement. ""We're in the midst of transforming our business and taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to enhance our ability to grow around the world. These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision making and achieve restaurant growth.""Wall Street seems happy with McDonald’s direction. The company’s stock price set a new high of 128.90 on Monday and is up about 9% since the beginning of the year. McDonald's ended virtually unchanged Tuesday.That’s part of an overall rebound in fast-food stocks. Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) has risen around 13% for 2016; Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is up 10%; and Wendy’s (WEN) has risen about 2%.Meanwhile, shares of fast-casual stocks such as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Shake Shack (SHAK) and Habit Restaurants (HABT) have struggled.
"
213,YUM,"Sector champions wield strong identities, strategies and capabilities. How they rise skyward:Sharpen focus. Many firms don’t know how to harness their own power. That’s the implication from a global survey by Strategy&, a division of consulting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.It found more than half of senior executives don’t think they have winning strategies.“That’s a concerning figure,” said Paul Leinwand, co-author with Cesare Mainardi of “Strategy That Works.”Another survey of 500-plus senior executives found 90% believed they were missing major market opportunities, and 80% said company strategies were not well understood internally.Soul search. When it comes to scheming to lead, some leaders ask the wrong questions.Instead of focusing outside on areas to grow or markets to seize, a company should look to its core and ask:“Who are we going to be? What few capabilities do we have that nobody else has?” Mainardi told IBD.The trick is delving within.“It’s more of an inside-out approach,” Leinwand said.Power up. Flexing that strategy muscle requires matching a firm’s unique identity with its specific abilities.Those who do -- termed coherent companies by Leinwand and Mainardi -- have:“A way to play” value proposition that distinguishes them from the competition.Distinctive capabilities that allow them to deliver on that proposition.A chosen portfolio of products and services that spring from those capabilities.“The notion is to build a super competitor that shapes the market it’s in,” Mainardi said. “Shape the future rather than respond to it.”Proclaim intentions. Chinese appliance manufacturer Haier Group declared its identity as a top quality provider in dramatic fashion -- with a sledgehammer.“This is a company that for a long time focused on basic quality,” Mainardi said.When a customer complained via letter that a Haier refrigerator wouldn’t stay cool, CEO Zhang Ruimin had employees move 76 similarly faulty units outside the factory, and allowed them to smash the coolers to bits.From then on, “everything that leaves our plant should be a grade 1 product,” Ruimin told workers.The sledgehammer is now displayed at a Beijing museum. “That was a symbol of what he meant,” Mainardi said.Build brawn. Mexico-based cement maker Cemex (CX) strengthened its business by talking with customers.Some wanted help with homebuilding, so the company created its Patrimonio Hoy (Property Today) program. It helps lower-income families with everything from arranging credit via microfinance loans to guiding customers through building regulations.When you work from that core ability, “you don’t fall into the trap of adjacencies that don’t make sense,” Leinwand said.Activate teams. Translating strategy into action can be tricky. “All change is people-powered change,” said Lisa Hillenbrand, co-author with Ellen Auster of “Stragility.”That’s their term for strategic, agile, people-powered change.Elevate them. Fast food firm KFC needed stragility in the 1990s.“The business was really soft and franchisees were incredibly angry,” Hillenbrand said.David Novak -- then KFC president, now executive chairman of parent firm Yum Brands (YUM) -- listened patiently to franchisees. Then he asked them to work in groups on top priorities.Three areas dominated the franchisee discussions -- product quality, menu innovation and training.“Chances are, they’re the same things (Novak) would have come up with anyway,” Hillenbrand said.What he gained was unity.“It went from being his plan to (the team's) plan,” she said.Image provided by Shutterstock.

214,YUM,"Pizza stocks Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) jumped Wednesday as an analyst sees pizza deliveries faring well amid civil unrest.In afternoon action in the stock market today, Domino's Pizza rose 1% to 136.89, just below a 137.12 buy point after rising as high as 137.87.Domino's is slated to report second quarter earnings on Thursday. Analyst consensus is for Q2 earnings per share to rise 16% to 94 cents and revenue to grow 9.25 to $533.44 million. Domino's has missed Wall Street's earnings target in two of the last three quarters.Papa John's jumped as much as 4% after KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded its stock to overweight from sector weight and raised its price target to 80. KeyBanc said in a client note that people may be eating at home more often, and munching on delivered comfort foods like pizza amid civil unrest and a contentious presidential election race. Papa John's, which is in the midst of a long consolidation, climbed 3.15% to 71.30 Wednesday, clearing resistance near 70.Among other restaurants, Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which operates Burger King and coffee-and-doughnuts chain Tim Hortons in more than 100 countries, was also breaking out Wednesday from a flat base with a 44.06 buy point. Restaurant Brands shot as much as 3% to an all-time high at 44.93 before settling to a 2.3% gain at 44.50.Burger King rival McDonald's (MCD) eased 0.35% to 126.06 and Jack-in-the-Box (JACK) climbed 1.4% to 89.13, hitting an 11-month high.Yum Brands (YUM), which operates Pizza Hut as well as KFC and Taco Bell, rose 0.35% to 87.87.The Retail-Restaurants group, ranked a weak 151 on IBD's list of 197 industries, has traded in a narrow range since mid-March but on Tuesday rose above its 200-day average and continued climbing on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Several restaurant operators report quarterly financials Thursday.

215,YUM,"McDonald's (MCD) said Wednesday that it will add McMuffins, McGriddles and biscuit sandwiches to its All Day Breakfast menu nationwide in September, amid concerns about whether the company's recent sales growth is sustainable as it approaches some tough year-over-year comparisons.Shares dipped 0.1% to 120.63 in the stock market today. The stock is making its way through a flat base and has drifted below its 50-day line since May.The stock has gotten a huge lift since All Day Breakfast was introduced last fall, demonstrating to investors that the company could change and turn around flagging sales after a weak 2014.In the years prior to the launch, McDonald's lost customers to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and other fast-casual chains tapping into a growing preference for higher-quality or healthier ingredients.But some analysts have questioned whether the burger giant has relied too much on All Day Breakfast for its sales growth. Others say the menu expansion could help prop up sales, but not tremendously.""It's a positive, but it won't have nearly the same impact that the initial All Day Breakfast launch had,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's stock is in the midst of a consolidation, but below its 50-day moving average, a sign of weakness. Investors should wait for MCD to build the right side of a base and form a proper entry point before making any moves.Analysts have also worried about slowing industry sales amid broader economic uncertainty. Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski last month downgraded McDonald's, citing the tough comparisons and saying the U.S. restaurant industry ""could remain sluggish for the remainder of 2016"".Chipotle shares climbed 1.1%.

RBC last month said the improved sales showed the ""heavy lifting"" done by All Day Breakfast.Meanwhile, same-store sales industrywide have weakened in the second quarter, possibly due to growing consumer anxiety, bad weather or an abundance of competitive discount offerings spurred by cheap food costs.Also, burger chains like McDonald's and Wendy's, in general, face more competition from the likes of Shake Shack (SHAK), Five Guys, In-N-Out and others who put more of a focus on higher-quality ingredients.Kalinowski estimated that comps for burger chains were just ""barely positive"" in the second quarter. ""No longer is the burger segment a beacon of brightness for the industry, as it was in Q1.""He added that a data breach affecting more than 300 Wendy's restaurants could hurt also hurt its same-store sales. He cut his price target on the stock to 11 from 12.50.McDonald's closed 1.6% lower at to 120.62 on the stock market today, nearing the low end of the flat base it is forming with a 132.06 buy point. Wendy's fell 1.8% to 9.81. Yum Brands (YUM), now Kalinowski's top stock pick, lost 0.5% 83.89 but is still near an 85.89 buy point.Kalinowski also brought the pain to the pizza industry on Wednesday, downgrading Papa John's (PZZA) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ), citing slower industry trends and more competition from Yum's Pizza Hut.Papa John's fell 0.35%, while Domino's slipped 1.6%.

220,YUM,"Restaurant Brands International (QSR) shares are looking tastier, while Domino's Pizza (DPZ) is going cold after both companies reported earnings Thursday.The Burger King and Tim Hortons parent earned 30 cents a share, well above views for 22 cents a share, on $918.5 million in revenue, short of forecasts for $932.3 million. That represents a 67% profit tumble on a 1% revenue decline from last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.Burger King same-store sales rose 4.6%, while Tim Hortons comps grew 5.6% in constant currency.""It appears as though BK has weathered the storm of competitive discounting during Q1 with its own value platforms, namely 2 for $5 and 10 for $1.49 nuggets, while new innovation including hot dogs likely also contributed somewhat,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer.The fast-food realm has seen a proliferation of super-cheap promotion deals, including Wendy's (WEN) ""4 for $4"" deal and McDonald's (MCD) recently ended ""McPick 2 for $5"" promotion.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 1.1%, nearing buy range after loitering in a broad area of consolidation since last August.

221,YUM,"Cooking-equipment maker Middleby (MIDD) spent a good part of last year trying to address a troubling situation: 75 reports that gas ranges made by Viking, the high-end oven maker it bought some three years ago, were turning on by themselves. Viking recalled around 60,000 ovens due to those reports, and Middleby -- which makes cooking appliances for homes and restaurants -- stresses those ovens were made prior to the acquisition. But the recall heightened problems within Viking that weighed on Middleby's finances. Among them: Delays in refrigeration products Middleby had been trying to make more energy-efficient, concerns about Viking's residential products and questions over whether the $380 million Middleby paid was too much for a company seen as lacking new ideas or sufficient margins.For Middleby officials, quality concerns of this magnitude are not what they're used to encountering.""Papa John's (PZZA) runs our oven almost 18 to 20 hours a day -- especially on weekends,"" Chief Executive Selim Bassoul told IBD. ""And it cannot break down. It is not allowed to break down.""Yet shares of Middleby are up around 32% since February as the company turns out sales growth that outpaces competitors and works aggressively -- and to a large extent effectively, some analysts say -- to turn Viking around. The company has a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. That sales growth has been led by an array of kitchen items that cater to more selective home chefs and a competitive restaurant industry, which has been set on international expansion and on serving food in a way that's quicker, fresher and more cost-effective.Roth Capital analyst Tony Brenner wrote in a research note last month that new product introductions addressing increased speed, energy and labor saving ""should continue to play a key role in increasing sales and margins."" Those gains would also come as the bar rises for service, even within fast food.  An array of big restaurant chains are customers of Middleby -- Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- along with higher-end chains. Want an oven that can cook a pizza in 90 seconds or a steamer that saves water by utilizing the food's moisture? Middleby has those. Need an oven that can make a steak look and taste like it was fussed over by a chef, or an oven system that can do the work of a line cook or two? Middleby has some of those too.Middleby has a lot of those things in no small part because of acquisitions. It has made more than 40 since 2000, according to the Great Lakes Review stock-picking service, with most of those deals coming during Bassoul's tenure. ""He never sits on his laurels,"" Elliott Schlang, Great Lakes' founder, said of Bassoul. ""He's always doing something new and innovative, to broaden his product line and to give the restauranteur what he needs.""Restaurants, Bassoul said, face greater demand for breakfast, potentially requiring adjustments to space in the kitchen and on the grill. Greater demand for delivery and analytics, he said, will necessitate more connected, automated cooking equipment. And higher employee wages -- as have been demanded industrywide -- are inevitable.""It's going to happen,"" he said. After reaching an intraday high of 127 on June 8, shares slipped below their 50-day moving average Friday in light of the U.K. Brexit selloff. Shares ended Monday trading around 110. That means restaurants will likely seek technology in place of people. The company's Kitchen of the Future, a conveyor-oven system with an infrared broiler and warming cabinet, helps restaurants get more usage out of each square foot. The system also uses technology that cuts usage of oven burners when not in use.    ""This array replaces convection ovens, fryers, microwaves, grills, charbroilers and salamanders (broiler units), prepares food faster and with greater consistency and can eliminate two or three line cooks from the kitchen,"" Brenner wrote. Profit margins on such projects, he said, ""reportedly exceed 50%.""Middleby's ventless cooking equipment saves energy -- and a lot of money -- because it doesn't require a large, bolted-down ventilation system. Since much of a kitchen's layout hinges on where ventilation is located, ventless technology helps kitchens become more flexible with floor space and menus. The company's holding trays can also control for moisture and heat, enabling restaurants to keep items fresher for longer and served quickly.""People have a tendency to think this stuff tastes like airplane food,"" BB&T analyst Schon Williams said of machine-prepared items. ""I've done a lot of taste tests -- and it's improved the taste concept among customers.""The company's food and beverage equipment has also helped some restaurants with an international presence to step up their breakfast game, although Middleby wouldn't say who.""We have a number of key executives throughout our organization that literally know how to build a store, build a restaurant, build a small-box retail operation, that know how to lay out a kitchen, that actually have done that,"" COO David Brewer told IBD.And as more people aspire toward the artisanal in their homes, the sophistication in Middleby's commercial operations has made its way into its residential products. Viking plans to launch an oven that, it says, can cook a rack of lamb in four minutes and a 12-pound turkey in 42 minutes.The company could also use design elements from AGA Rangemaster, a U.K. company it acquired that's known for its rustic-chic ovens and cast iron cookers, to make fancy home products even fancier.Management's experience in cooking equipment has also helped during the company's rare moments of difficulty, as with the Viking acquisition.After that acquisition, the company deployed scores of engineers to Viking to assess potential problems. In quality tests, they hung weights off of refrigerator doors, which could sometimes fall off, Williams said, and in one instance Bassoul slammed an oven door over and over until it broke.The company strengthened Viking's packaging materials. Following the recall, Middleby has sued former senior staff at Viking, and Middleby's salesforce has worked to reclaim goodwill among dealers and made the wiring of Viking ovens less complicated.""That's a hallmark of Middleby, just in terms of reducing the number of parts, reducing complexity whenever possible,"" Williams said. He later added: ""Time and time again they've proven they can restructure all these businesses.""Almost all Viking dealers have resumed buying the company's products, Middleby says. As restaurants expand internationally, so will Middleby, and Bassoul hopes to make its Viking residential platform a more global entity.Steel prices, Schlang noted, risk hurting the bottom line if they rise, and the company's food-processing business still lives project to project, analysts say. Brenner also said that Middleby's main competitors are bigger and have deep pockets. Manitowoc (MTW) is among its biggest rivals, but its focus isn't exclusive to food service.Restaurant same-store sales were also sluggish in the second quarter and could lag through the year. But as they try to keep costs down and investors happy, equipment could play just as much of a role as the food in improving what they offer to customers.""You can do that in a simple way,"" Brewer said. ""You can put the ketchup on top of the meat patty, you can put ketchup underneath the meat patty, add a pickle -- that maybe gets you a quarter. But eventually you have to bring in a new bread and toast it a different way.""

224,YUM,"McDonald's (MCD) CEO Steve Easterbrook said Thursday that self-ordering kiosks and other technology were unlikely to result in job cuts and were not ""meant as a labor replacement,"" even as higher wages prompt fast-food rival Wendy's (WEN) to aggressively seek labor-saving technology.Easterbrook's response came at an occasionally tense company shareholder meeting, before which protesters staged demonstrations and demanded McDonald's pay its employees more. He was addressing an attendee who asked the following question:“With all the talk and all the protesters and the $15-an-hour wage, if that is mandated, if the government does raise the minimum wage, do you see McDonald’s substituting capital -- having kiosks where people order, automatic pancake machines and things like that taking the place of workers where people will end up losing jobs because of the higher wages?”Easterbrook said that he saw that technology complementing labor more than replacing it.""If we were able to alternate certain non-value-added processes in the restaurant we’ll do that because it’s a smart thing to do,"" he said. ""But then that gives us more opportunity to bring that manpower front-of-house -- we can offer better dining area experience and service experience. So I don’t see it being a risk to job elimination.""Still, he said, the jobs themselves could be different.""It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it’s through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks -- that is a societal trend,"" he said. ""We want to adapt to that, but it’s not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just re-apportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.""Easterbrook's announcement follows Wendy's plans to make kiosks available across its restaurants in the second half of this year, although franchisees don't have to use them. Minimum wage hikes in some areas as well as efforts to attract stronger talent have pushed up Wendy's labor costs, the company said this month on its first-quarter earnings call.President Todd Penegor said then that ""we'll continue to invest in technology with things in the front of the house and consumer facing, like customer self-order kiosk, mobile order, mobile pay.""McDonald's is testing mobile ordering apps, something that Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell, Starbucks (SBUX), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and others and others already are doing. New mobile payment services such as Apple (AAPL) Pay, Samsung Pay also are fueling the shift. Such mobile services also substitute for labor, though workers could be shifted elsewhere.Along with higher wages, fast-food restaurants have been squeezed by competition both on value offerings and chains advertising better ingredients. April was a slow month for the restaurant business, possibly due to bad weather in some areas, the discounting and more tepid consumer sentiment, analysts suggest.""In addition, we wonder if declining food at home prices have begun to weigh on restaurant demand,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote in a research note last week. ""For fast food, we believe recent weakness is increasing resolve to deploy value marketing this summer, which may increase risk of market share losses by those chains with limited marketing scale.""McDonald's shares closed up 0.4% on the stock market today. Starbucks edged up 0.25%, Domino's added 1.4% and Apple added 0.8%. Wendy's dipped 0.6% and Yum Brands fell 0.2%.

"
227,YUM,"There's more than meets the eye to California Gov. Jerry Brown's plan to hike the state minimum wage to $15 an hour — about $3.50 more.Including nonwage costs — payroll taxes, paid sick leave and ObamaCare's employer mandate — minimum compensation for a full-time worker could rise as high as $18.52 an hour by 2022, an IBD analysis finds.Social insurance taxes would add $1.15 an hour to the $15 wage. Three days of paid sick leave now on the books in California would add another 19 cents. And the ObamaCare after-tax fine, now $2,160 per uncovered full-time worker and rising each year, will equate to roughly $2.18 an hour in pretax wages. Adding in workers' compensation insurance and unemployment insurance would push the total close to $19 an hour.One big change from a $15 minimum wage has flown below the radar: Many low-wage workers would no longer qualify for Medicaid. For example, a single mom with one child who worked 32 hours per week would earn more than the 138% of poverty cutoff for expanded Medicaid under ObamaCare, though her child would still qualify. A single adult who works just three full days a week also would exceed the income threshold.To no small degree, the $15 minimum-wage movement is asking low-wage employers to lift their workers up closer to the middle class and to provide a full menu of social benefits on top. It looks like a recipe for trouble, and even Brown may be wary about it, insisting that the governor retain authority to delay wage hikes if the state sees a fall in employment or retail sales, or if the state faces a budget deficit. Brown had little room for maneuver because a $15 wage initiative that qualified for the November ballot looked like a sure winner and would have provided no flexibility if the wage hike started backfiring.One early-warning sign for California's wage experiment was Wal-Mart's (WMT) announcement in January that it would shutter stores in Oakland and Los Angeles and cancel two planned stores in Washington D.C., dealing a blow to three cities on the leading edge of the push for a much higher minimum wage.Before Los Angeles put its minimum wage on a path to $15 an hour, the question of how city employers would respond to the simultaneous imposition of a health insurance mandate was simply ignored. An analysis of the wage hike's labor cost impact by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, explicitly excluded health insurance — or a mandate penalty. The authors explained: ""Health benefits are excluded since ... the costs of the benefits will not change if wages are increased."" The Congressional Budget Office came to a different conclusion, finding that the ObamaCare employer mandate would exacerbate the impact of a minimum-wage hike. It estimated that a minimum-wage hike to $10.10 an hour could cost 500,000 jobs.""(The) additional cost on employers for some low-wage workers who do not currently have employment-based health insurance ... further boosts the likelihood that employers' savings from reducing the size of their workforces would exceed their adjustment costs,"" the CBO said.Those adjustment costs might include adding labor-saving technology.Wendy's (WEN) CFO Todd Penegor explained in an August earnings call, ""We continue to look at initiatives and how we work to offset any impacts of future wage inflation through technology initiatives, whether that's customer self-order kiosks (or) whether that's automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant.""Starbucks (SBUX) and Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell are among the restaurant chains promoting mobile ordering, which reduces the need for cashiers. McDonald's (MCD) is about to start testing mobile apps as well.The truth about the ObamaCare employer mandate is that it hasn't been nearly as much of a burden on businesses as feared, so they haven't had to cut workers' hours below 30 per week in a dramatic way. But the reason is hardly cause for celebration: Employers have figured out how to dodge liability by offering ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay.That's left millions of modest-wage, full-time workers without affordable coverage options. It's possible that California's embrace of a $15 minimum wage will add to their ranks. But the status quo of full-time workers thrown under the bus by ObamaCare may not hold. If the mandate ever becomes something that can't be easily dodged, minimum-wage employers in California will likely cut work hours in a big way, diluting the promise of a living wage.
"
228,YUM,"Wendy's (WEN) said that self-service ordering kiosks will be made available across its 6,000-plus restaurants in the second half of the year as minimum wage hikes and a tight labor market push up wages.It will be up to franchisees whether to deploy the labor-saving technology, but Wendy's President Todd Penegor did note that some franchise locations have been raising prices to offset wage hikes.McDonald's (MCD) has been testing self-service kiosks. But Wendy's, which has been vocal about embracing labor-saving technology, is launching the biggest potential expansion.Wendy's Penegor said company-operated stores, only about 10% of the total, are seeing wage inflation of 5% to 6%, driven both by the minimum wage and some by the need to offer a competitive wage ""to access good labor.""It's not surprising that some franchisees might face more of a labor-cost squeeze than company restaurants. All 258 Wendy's restaurants in California, where the minimum wage rose to $10 an hour this year and will gradually rise to $15, are franchise-operated. Likewise, about 75% of 200-plus restaurants in New York are run by franchisees. New York's fast-food industry wage rose to $10.50 in New York City and $9.75 in the rest of the state at the start of 2016, also on the way to $15.Wendy's plans to cut company-owned stores to just 5% of the total.Still, Penegor said that increased customer counts more than price hikes drove the chain's 3.6% same-store sales increase in the first quarter.Although profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, Wendy's shares dived nearly 9% Wednesday because of weak second-quarter sales.""We are seeing a bit of a softer overall category in April"" relative to the past two quarters, Penegor said on an earnings call, implying more of an industrywide trend than an issue specific to Wendy's.Penegor said the reason for softer growth was hard to pinpoint, but he listed a cautious consumer, tougher spring weather in the Northeast, and a wider gap between the cost of food at home vs. food away from home as possible contributors.While Wendy's management was upbeat about company prospects, noting that it just experienced its first year with a net increase in restaurants since 2010, its downbeat comments about sector growth were contagious. McDonald's eased 1.7% after touching a new record high on Tuesday. Yum Brands (YUM), which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, slipped 2.6% and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) fell 3.4%.For now, Penegor said, wage pressures have been manageable both because of falling commodity prices and better operating leverage due to an increase in customer counts. Still, the company is wary about both wage hikes and a possible recovery in commodity prices and is ""working so hard to find efficiencies"" so it can deliver ""a new QSR experience but at traditional QSR prices.""In addition to self-order kiosks, the company is also getting ready to move beyond the testing phase with labor-saving mobile ordering and mobile payment available systemwide by the end of the year. Yum Brands and McDonald's already have mobile ordering apps.

That plan includes the all-day breakfast menu launched in the fall, as well as this year’s McPick 2 for $5 promotion.""The ongoing investments we’re making in running great restaurants and delivering what matters most to our customers are beginning to yield sustained positive results,"" Easterbrook said. ""For the quarter, we generated higher sales, revenues and operating income in constant currencies across all business segments.""Another element of the turnaround plan has been an aggressive move to refranchise restaurants. Over the past five quarters McDonald’s has refranchised about 700 restaurants, JPMorgan analyst Virginia Chambless noted in a report. That figures includes 200 restaurants during the first quarter.McDonald’s recently announced plans to start selling Johnsonville Brats again after a seven-year hiatus, perhaps in response to a recent move by rival Burger King to sell hot dogs at its restaurants. Starting April 25, brats will return to menus at 125 McDonald’s locations in southeast Wisconsin.Another potential growth driver is McDonald’s expansion in Asia. The company recently said it will add more than 1,500 locations in China, including Hong Kong and South Korea over the next five years. It already has more than 2,800 locations in those markets, most of which are company-owned. This time McDonald’s is looking for ""strategic partners"" to help in its Asia expansion.""This will allow McDonald's to accelerate our growth and scale faster across diverse markets, placing us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,"" Easterbrook said. ""We're in the midst of transforming our business and taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to enhance our ability to grow around the world. These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision-making and achieve restaurant growth.""It might take awhile for McDonald’s ambitious Asia expansion to be completed, however.""The company continues to search for a strategic partner in Asia but cautioned the process could take 12 to 18 months,"" Chambless noted.McDonald’s isn’t the only fast-food chain to enjoy a rebound on Wall Street. Shares of Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) is up 10%, edging higher Friday morning.Shares of Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) have risen about 12% this year. But Yum suffered a reversal Thursday: Shares jumped as much as 4%, breaking out to an eight-month high on strong Q1 earnings and raised guidance. But shares closed down 1% on that day. They fell 0.6% Friday.

230,YUM,"Grant Chen's Seattle restaurant netted just $8,856.57 last year after he had to start paying a minimum wage of $11 an hour. Starbucks (SBUX) raked in about $2.8 billion.So here's a puzzle: How can it be that the city's minimum-wage law puts Chen, a decidedly small-time restaurant owner, in the same large-employer category as Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz?You might call it guilt by association. Chen, a second-generation Chinese American, pooled together retirement savings with a few friends, along with loans from family members, and used the money to buy a franchise of a fast-casual chain that could provide the stability of a familiar brand, training and procedures that wouldn't require them to reinvent the wheel.Yet now national chains like McDonald's (MCD) that use the franchise model are under political and legal attack on multiple fronts. Small businesses — many of them minority-owned — are suffering collateral damage.Under the Seattle law, and potentially to a much greater extent under New York state's minimum-wage hike for fast-food outlets, small-business owners are being penalized for their association with large corporations that license out their brands.Discriminating against franchises ""paints the cross hairs on a disadvantaged portion of the population that utilizes the franchise model because the barriers to entry are low,"" Chen wrote in a blog post. The title: ""Seattle's $15 Minimum Wage Is Driving My Restaurant Out Of Business.""The crackdown on franchising comes even as minority ownership of franchises is surging, providing a tried and true method of democratizing the benefits of capitalism. The latest data from the Census Bureau released late in 2015 show that among businesses with at least 10 employees who operate franchises, 17.5% were minority-owned in 2012, up from 13.8% in 2007. Meanwhile, outside the franchise business, just 10.8% of firms with 10-plus workers were minority-owned.This year, Chen and Starbucks have to pay a minimum of $13 an hour, rising to $15 in 2017, with inflation adjustments thereafter. Smaller employers, those with 500 workers or fewer, get two extra years before they have to pay $15.In New York state, where the minimum-wage just began rising toward $15 an hour for quick-service chains with at least 30 U.S. locations, even small-business operators with a single location are on the hook for the higher wage. Meanwhile, the state's minimum wage for everyone else is $9 an hour, at least for now.The higher New York wage applies to a broad range of limited-service or takeout places, including Starbucks, Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell, Shake Shack (SHAK), Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN), Jamba Juice (JMBA), Wendy's (WEN) and Subway.The earliest consequences of this attack on national franchises are mostly confined to Seattle and New York state. Yet the consequences for the franchise business model could be incredibly far-reaching if courts uphold the National Labor Relations Board decision to designate McDonald's a joint employer of the 90% of its workers who are hired, managed and paid by franchise operators.That case, now being argued before an NLRB administrative law judge in Chicago, could put companies that use the franchise model on the hook for labor violations by the franchisees that operate company-branded restaurants.""To protect yourself, you would have to manage the employees,"" said Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, the company behind chains Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.""At that point, the 4% royalty doesn't work anymore,"" Puzder said, referring to the common 4% of revenue that goes to the franchisor as payment for everything it provides to help a franchise succeed.Further, if the franchisor is found to be a joint employer with its franchisees, that would effectively turn small businesses into large ones and create new liability to provide workers clocking 30 hours a week with health insurance under ObamaCare's employer mandate, says David Kaufmann, whose law firm Kaufmann Gildin & Robbins represents franchise industry employers.But the primary objective in rewriting decades of law and regulations governing the franchise industry is ""unionizing workers at franchises,"" Kaufmann said.Unquestionably, the push to unionize would be easier. Instead of organizing workers at individual franchises or groups of outlets under common ownership, unions could deal directly with the corporations behind the brands.The big flaw in the NLRB's case is that McDonald's, like other big franchisors, doesn't control the workers at its franchise locations and doesn't have the power to tell franchise operators how much to pay in wages. That reality was evident when McDonald's said last year it would raise its starting wage at company-owned locations to $1 above the local minimum wage. Franchise operators were reportedly less than thrilled by the move, likely because their workers wanted the same deal. But they had the ultimate decision.The NLRB joint-employer designation would fundamentally redefine the role of a franchisee, from someone who puts up risk capital and runs a business to make a profit into one among perhaps hundreds or even thousands of middle managers in a corporate empire.""The ability to run my own business was the very reason I put my savings on the line to become a franchisee,"" wrote Amir Siddiqi in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last year.Born in Pakistan, Siddiqi came to the U.S. at age 19 in 1985 and worked as a dishwasher at a Carl's Jr. across the street from his community college. He eventually worked his way up through management of the parent company, then seized the chance to become his own boss, putting up all of his savings and borrowing the rest needed to buy three Carl's Jr. franchises. Now he has more than 40 restaurants and 900 workers, including teenagers and immigrants working their first jobs.Making franchisors joint employers, Siddiqi said, could ""destroy a road to the American dream for people who are willing to take some risks for the chance to build a business and a better life.""The NLRB's joint-employer rule is expected to wind up before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and possibly the Supreme Court before it takes effect. Meanwhile, the International Association of Franchises has joined business owners in asking the Supreme Court to invalidate Seattle's discriminatory treatment of franchises. Among the petitioners is Ronald Oh, whose dad fled North Korea as a youngster. Now the family has its livelihood invested in a Holiday Inn Express (IHG) with a few dozen employees.""The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket,"" Oh said at a hearing on the wage hike, quoting Andrew Carnegie. ""This is our basket, and the eggs are the lives of my entire extended family. We are watching that basket carefully.""

231,YUM,"It's the most exclusive club for financiers in Dallas. With seven Jeffersonian-style buildings and manicured lawns, Old Parkland looks more like a college campus than a hive of private-equity firms, hedge funds, foundations and family offices.But the 9.5-acre site, where an abandoned hospital once stood, is now home to some of the city's wealthiest investors.Old Parkland is the pet project of Harlan Crow, 66, a son of swashbuckling real estate developer Trammell Crow, whose empire was in tatters when he gave up control in the late 1980s. It's also a symbol of a decades-long effort to rebuild the family's legacy. Step inside any of the buildings and you might think you're in a museum, with Rodin sculptures in the hallways, a 17th century antique sofa in a lobby and, on display, a piece of curtain Abraham Lincoln is said to have grabbed after being shot.""When I got involved in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was not really clear that our company was going to survive,"" Crow said, sitting in a wood-paneled room in his Old Parkland office, just past a Rembrandt Peale portrait of George Washington, a stain on the lapel of Crow's rumpled suit jacket and a piece of white printer paper stuffed haphazardly in a pocket.After nine years of renovation and expansion, the complex is now home to TRT Holdings, owner of Omni Hotels and Gold's Gym; Highside Capital Management, the hedge fund turned family office led by Lee Hobson; an outpost of Boston-based real estate private-equity firm Rockpoint Group; and the investment company of Roger Enrico, former CEO of PepsiCo (PEP). Residency is by invitation only.Statuary GardenAt the center of this financial hub is Crow Holdings, an $8.6 billion investment firm built on the remains of Trammell Crow's real estate empire that included the Dallas Market Center, San Francisco's Embarcadero Center, the Wyndham Hotel chain and thousands of homes. The Wall Street Journal in 1986 called Crow the largest landlord in the U.S.Harlan Crow has spent the past quarter-century making his family wealth about more than the buildings bought and constructed by his father. A prominent Republican contributor and friend of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Crow hosted a fundraiser at his $39 million home last year for Marco Rubio. He has amassed a collection of historical documents that includes Walter Raleigh's last plea to King James, written a month before his execution in 1618, a memo from Lincoln condemning slavery written before he decided to run for president, and a signed copy of Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf.""He also has a collection of statues in his backyard that he jokingly calls his ""Garden of Evil."" There's Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro.Crow said he likes hunting for the best statues from dying regimes, though there's also one of Margaret Thatcher on display.'Wildly Optimistic'""My father was wildly optimistic, and most of what he thought would happen did,"" Crow said. ""I have a little bit of a mentality that the world is dangerous and the only thing you can really do is be morally, mentally and physically strong. The rest of the stuff, well, you just do the best you can.""Old Parkland was built on the site of the original Parkland Hospital, which opened in 1894. A new hospital had already been built by the time President Kennedy was shot during a Dallas motorcade in 1963 and rushed to the facility where he pronounced dead, and Old Parkland had been converted into a treatment center for tuberculosis and psychiatric patients.The building fell into disrepair, was covered with graffiti and became a blight on a gentrifying neighborhood five minutes from Dallas's downtown and the same distance from its priciest neighborhood, Highland Park, where Crow lives.Today, Old Parkland charges among the highest office rents in Dallas. It has a restaurant, a barbershop, a gym and a circular underground debate hall. A statue of Alexis de Tocqueville overlooks a central courtyard, and Crow said he plans to install a painting of George W. Bush standing in the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers.""There's a feeling of university campus more than an office building,"" said Ben Weinstein, a managing director at Korenvaes Management, the family office for the founder of hedge fund HBK Investments. He used the campus network to raise money to fund the purchase of Super Chix, a fried-chicken sandwich restaurant concept, from Yum Brands (YUM) in August.""It's nice,"" he said, "" to be part of a network that shares.""

232,YUM,"The Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) brand has taken a beating due to several food-safety scandals, but analysts appear mostly positive on the fast-casual eatery's ability to engineer a turnaround -- eventually.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday ended its food-safety probe of Chipotle. But perceptions can take longer to change, and Chipotle late Tuesday warned of a ""very difficult"" 2016 after reporting sharply weaker fourth-quarter earnings. The company also disclosed it received a new government subpoena as a criminal probe expands.Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan told IBD that the earliest he sees Chipotle sales returning to a pre-food-crisis level is in 2017.""Even when they do, we may see a different Chipotle"" than the one investors knew before the outbreaks hit, he said, given permanent supply chain changes and food-safety measures. Plus, labor inflation and food cost inflation aren't going to stay static, and the company ""is not in a position to take prices up over the next year and a half, two years.""Restaurant-level margin percentages have ranged from the mid- to high-20s over the last few years, but Chipotle recorded a 19.6% margin in Q4.""Margins look closer to 20% than what they've looked historically, and that makes Chipotle not exceptional where they have been exceptional in the past,"" said Setyan. He said that brings its valuation into question.""Arguably, it now no longer deserves a premium to its restaurant peers,"" he said.Sales growth already was stalling before the food illness news slammed business. But investors were taken aback by Chipotle's January sales news and forecasts for no profit in the current quarter.Shares fell 2.9% to 461.74 in the stock market today after trading as low as 440.41 intraday.Several other analysts see the light at the end of the tunnel.""We are optimistic that margins can begin to recover in 2017, particularly if food-cost inflation remains benign, as we expect,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a Wednesday note. ""Chipotle's restaurant-level economics remain best-in-class despite recent brand damage.""Palmer cited improving throughput, new menu items, catering, mobile ordering and strategic marketing as reasons to believe that Chipotle can return to mid-single-digit comps and 20% earnings growth in the wake of its food-safety issues.Bob Derrington of the Telsey Group projects that same-store sales will turn positive in Q4 of this year. The bar is low for lapping comps, however, as Chipotle posted a 14.6% same-store sales decline for Q4. Wedbush's Setyan also sees positive comps ""no sooner than Q4.""January comps crashed 36%, Chipotle said late Tuesday.Credit Suisse analysts Jason West and James O'Brien ""continue to believe the brand will fully recover,"" according to a report Wednesday. The bank maintains an outperform rating but lowered its price target to 475 from 530.Bank of America boosted Chipotle's rating to neutral from underperform, citing poll results in which almost one-third of respondents said they still ate at the restaurant as often as they used to. Only about one-tenth had stopped visiting Chipotle.During Tuesday's post-earnings call, Chipotle management said it would be ""really hard to predict"" a recovery timeline.""When we looked at other events, other companies that have gone through something like this. The recovery typically takes four or five quarters or so,"" Chipotle CFO John Hartung said during the call. But he added that the company won't know until the recovery starts.Yum Brands (YUM) and McDonald's (MCD) restaurants in China were several years ago rocked by food-safety scandals, which pressured sales for a number of quarters. Yum Brands reported a 2% same-store sales gain at its China division late Wednesday as Q4 earnings topped views. Shares fell late after closing fractionally higher.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) rose slightly late despite reporting weaker-than-expected earnings and sales as well as offering light 2016 guidance. Buffalo Wild Wings already closed down 4.2% Wednesday amid reports of a norovirus outbreak at a Kansas location.In the near term, Chipotle has work to do before it gets back on track.Chipotle's Hartung said during the earnings call late Tuesday that it is ""likely we will post an EPS that is around break-even for the (first) quarter."" Wall Street had expected about $2.08, but analysts were racing to slash targets Wednesday.The beleaguered fast-casual chain, struggling to resuscitate its image after a series of E. coli and norovirus incidents that affected around 200 people total, topped analysts' Q4 earnings views with a 43.5% plunge to $2.17 a share, but revenue fell almost 7% to $997.5 million. Estimates were for $1.01 billion.Chipotle is aggressively ramping up marketing and promotion spending in a bid to win back customers.""Near-term, I think they're doing the right thing,"" said Setyan, ""communicating the message that they're sorry for what happened, they're making changes.""RELATED:Chipotle Warns Of ‘Very Difficult’ 2016, Sees No Profit In Q1

233,YUM,"Here's one data point that doesn't gibe with the complaint that economic gains are increasingly limited to an exclusive club: Minority-owned business ownership has been surging.Among businesses with at least five employees, the percentage with minority owners rose to 13.3% from 9.7% from 2007 to 2012, finds an IBD analysis of the most current data from the Census Department.The rise in minority ownership among businesses operating franchises of established brands has been especially impressive. In 2012, 21.1% of franchise operators with at least five workers had minority owners vs. 15.8% in 2007. Meanwhile, among firms that don't operate franchises, 12.6% had minority owners in 2012, up from 9.3% five years earlier.The jump in minority ownership of franchises helps explain a surge in minority-owned restaurants noted by the National Restaurant Association.The data confirm something that is well understood by many entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds who have sought to carve out a share of the economic pie: Franchising has provided one of the most accessible and surest paths to business success.Among African-Americans, for example, fully 24% of all businesses with at least 50 workers are engaged in franchising, the new Census data show.Yet this model is increasingly under attack from the political left, which sees franchising as a problem, not a solution. Whereas thousands of minority business owners may see franchising as the best approximation of a golden goose within their reach, the labor movement and its campaign for a $15 minimum wage can't see past their arch-nemesis — the golden arches.In their view, dispersing economic power among franchisers makes it harder to unionize service-industry workers than it would be if labor unions could directly target corporate giants. In that sense, minority-owned franchises are merely an obstacle that must be steamrolled for the greater good.The National Labor Relations Board provided a steamroller suited to the task in designating McDonald's (MCD) a joint-employer of employees who work for franchise-owned locations — about 90% of the restaurant chain's total workforce.McDonald's contends that the designation makes no sense because franchise operators make all decisions involving hiring, firing, pay and work schedules. The company's legal challenge is now being heard by an NLRB administrative judge, but the case may take a few years to play out as it heads next to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then possibly to the Supreme Court.Beyond facilitating a push to unionize franchises, the joint-employer designation would turn small employers into large ones subject to ObamaCare employer penalties for failing to offer qualifying health coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. It also would make corporations with deep pockets liable for labor violations of its franchise operators.Together, these factors would put so much strain on franchise operators and their brand-name partners that their agreements — typically 4% of revenue goes to the franchisor in return for training and the benefits of scale and name-recognition — may no longer be viable.That's a risk the left is apparently unconcerned about, as evident in the appeal before the Supreme Court challenging Seattle's discriminatory treatment of franchises. In petitioning justices for a hearing, the International Franchise Association highlighted internal emails among government officials expressing their disapproval of the franchise model.At issue in the case is Seattle's more-rapid phase-in of its minimum wage for franchise businesses, which are considered to be large employers if the chain has more than 500 workers systemwide, even if the franchise operator has a single location.In an email to a fellow city council member, Nick Hanauer explained the reason for treating small-business that operate franchises differently than other small businesses: ""The truth is that franchises like Subway and McDonald's really are not very good for our local economy. They are economically extractive, civically corrosive and culturally dilutive.""Presumably, one of the reasons that a broad segment of franchising companies has made a concerted effort to increase local minority ownership is to make the business model more of a contributor to local economies.There are other advantages, as well, such as a low cost of capital. In the ObamaCare era, letting others do the hiring also may help limit the cost of the employer mandate.New York, in ordering fast-food companies to pay a $15 minimum wage — phased in by 2019 in New York City and by 2021 statewide — also lumped small franchise operators in with bigger employers.The New York Fast Food Wage Board blasted the franchise industry for a ""combination of profits and impoverishment,"" saying that the industry gets a subsidy in the form of public assistance to its workers.The rule covers a long list of food vendors without table service which have at least 30 locations in the U.S. Among them are Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell, Shake Shack (SHAK), Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN), Jamba Juice (JMBA), Wendy's (WEN) and Subway.Ironically, big franchisors like McDonald's might stand to gain if their franchises raised wages. That's because the typical 4%-of-revenue royalty would rise if the franchise was able to pass along a price hike to customers to cover higher labor costs. Thus, the real gripe with the franchise industry may be a royalty structure that provides an incentive to keep costs down. That's why franchisers may be highly likely to eliminate labor costs by investing in technology if wages rise too high.Image provided by Shutterstock.

234,YUM,"All-day breakfast and adjustments in food-prep helped McDonald's (MCD) beat fourth-quarter estimates Monday, indicating the fast-food mainstay’s strategy to compete with newer alternatives is working.U.S. comparable sales, a figure considered pivotal to the company's rebound efforts from years past, surged 5.7%. That was far above Wall Street forecasts for around 3% growth and marked a second consecutive quarterly increase after two years of declines. Milder weather during the quarter also helped.""We are demonstrating that our turnaround plan is key to restarting growth and becoming a modern and progressive burger company,"" said CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last March and launched all-day breakfast in October.In a statement, he later added: ""As we enter 2016, we expect continued positive top-line momentum across all segments.""Shares closed up 0.7% Monday after climbing as much as 3% earlier to touch an intraday high. The stock has rallied more than 30% from a year ago.McDonald's earnings per share during Q4 jumped 16% from a year earlier to $1.31, topping forecasts by 8 cents. Sales fell 4% to $6.34 billion. But the decline, weighed by the strong dollar, wasn't as bad as expected. Analysts had modeled a slip in sales to $6.2 billion.Globally, comps rose 5%. In the company's high-growth markets, operating income jumped 27%, helped by an easier comparison in China, where the company suffered from a food safety scare in 2014 after a supplier sold expired meat to McDonald's and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC.McDonald's management on an earnings call said it's mulling a sale of part of its stake in the company's struggling Japan business and plans to open 250-plus restaurants in China this year. In Australia, all-day breakfast will launch nationwide this quarter, the company said.As part of its new approach, McDonald's has embraced more natural ingredients, offered deals through its mobile app, and experimented with customizeable burgers. But it was all-day breakfast that dominated the discussion -- and the U.S. comp growth.""Our guess is this result implies the chain outperformed the fast-food industry by about 3 (percentage points),"" RBC Capital Markets said in a research note. ""While input costs have started to turn favorable for McDonald’s (and projected to be down 1-2% in 2016), we believe that All Day Breakfast was also a contributor to lower cost-of-goods percentages.""Company-operated restaurant expenses fell 7% during the quarter. Breakfast items are generally cheaper as they relate to cost of sales, noted Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, and beef costs have dropped as cattle herds expand.He also pointed to other changes that likely contributed to the rebound, such as searing beef patties better, toasting buns just before giving burgers to customers, and making the menu board more efficient.""I think there’s been a number of operational improvements that they’ve done that have been mostly behind the scenes,"" Slabaugh told Investor's Business Daily.McDonald's Q4 success comes after years of struggles for the chain, which had suffered as more diners, seeking fresher, higher-quality fare, flocked to fast-casual outlets like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).But Chipotle has had problems of its own, namely a foodborne illness outbreak last year that has forced the company into damage control. Shares of other fast-casual chains and fast-food rivals have also drifted lower, while McDonald's shares have risen in recent weeks.Chipotle closed down 1.9% Monday and have plunged more than 40% since October. Once high-flying Shake Shack (SHAK) has tumbled 59% from its peak.Shares of Yum Brands, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR), Wendy’s (WEN) and Jack In The Box (JACK) have lost ground too.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan also noted that some rivals in the sector are only starting to tweak their strategies, while McDonald's is putting its own in place.""They spent the last 12-plus months creating strategy, and now they’re executing,"" she told IBD.

236,YUM,"While much of the media attention in the restaurant industry has focused on the McDonald’s (MCD) financial rebound and Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG) food safety problems, drive-in chain Sonic (SONC) has quietly become one of the sector’s top performers on Wall Street.The company’s shares are up about 7% since the beginning of the year and have risen more than 35% since Feb. 10. In comparison, IBD’s Retail-Restaurant group as a whole has risen about 4% since the beginning of the year and 9% since Feb. 10.Sonic’s stock touched a 52-week high of 36.34 on April 6. The high capped a rally that began a week earlier, when the company beat fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue views and logged a 6.5% annual gain in same-restaurant sales, or at outlets open more than a year. The latter increase was especially impressive, considering that it came on top of an even bigger gain during the previous year’s second quarter.""The clear highlight of the quarter was a better-than-expected systemwide comp of 6.5% against a difficult 11.5% comparison, easily ahead of our estimate of 3% to 4% and consensus of roughly 1.5%,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote in a research note.Sonic reported results after the close on March 29. The next day, its stock price popped 6%.It was a welcome reaction for a company that has largely flown under the radar in the restaurant sector. Most of the attention has focused on rebounding fast-food stocks such as McDonald’s, Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), as well as flailing fast-casual chains like Chipotle, Shake Shack (SHAK) and Habit Restaurants (HABT).McDonald’s has benefited from successful initiatives such as its all-day breakfast menu and its ""McPick 2 for $5"" promotional deal. Meanwhile, Chipotle continues to feel the fallout from the E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at several of its restaurants.Sonic operates in a kind of middle ground between fast food and fast casual. Like fast-food chains, it focuses on quick service. The main difference is that at some Sonic restaurants, you can have carhops on roller skates deliver your food to your car.Like fast-casual restaurants, Sonic specializes in fresh, made-to-order fare that includes burgers, hot dogs, toaster sandwiches, burritos and various breakfast and side items. It has more than 3,500 locations in 45 states, making it the nation’s largest chain of drive-in restaurants. The drive-in concept separates it from other quick-service restaurant (QSR) brands like McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s (WEN), which offer drive-through but not drive-in service.""Sonic represents one of the most highly differentiated QSR brands in the country with a fun, 'retro-future' look that breaks through the clutter in a crowded QSR segment,"" Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle noted in a report.Another way in which Sonic differentiates itself is its technology focus. Over the past couple of years, the company has invested heavily in new Point-Of-Service (POS) and Point-Of-Personalized-Service (POPS) platforms, while other chains have focused more on mobile apps.Sonic’s POS platform is designed to improve the order process, cut food and packaging costs, reduce employee waste and theft, and optimize labor so the right amount of staff is on hand at the right time. The POPS platform lets Sonic tailor offers to customers based on their past purchasing history. It also provides on-site redeemable offers to customers.At the end of the second quarter, the POPS platform was in 1,616 locations and was about halfway through its rollout, Zackfia noted. The rollout should be finished by the end of the 2017 calendar year.""POPS will facilitate technology and social media initiatives (and) allow for uniquely personalized engagement that we anticipate will be a key driver of future same-store sales momentum, including the systemwide rollout of a mobile app that includes mobile payment,"" Zackfia said.Although Sonic’s heavy investment in technology has cut into the company’s bottom line, most analysts reckon that it will pay off in the long run.""While some investors might have hoped for a little better flow-through to the bottom line given the (same-restaurant sales) upside, the team appears to be making the appropriate investments in the business to continue generating market share gains in the future,"" Slagle noted.Sonic officials have a similar take. On a second-quarter conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Clifford Hudson said the company’s POS and POPS investments provide an ""opportunity to leverage this technology and enhance the customer experience in a way that competitor brands can’t.""Even with rising technology costs in recent years, Sonic has done pretty well on the earnings front. It has logged 11 straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth.Earnings came in at 18 cents a share during the fiscal second quarter, which ended Feb. 29. That was up 38% from the prior year and two cents ahead of consensus. Revenue rose 5% to $133.2 million, also topping estimates.Sonic raised its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to a range of 4% to 6% vs. prior guidance of 2% to 4%.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Sonic to post earnings of $1.36 a share for the entire fiscal year, which ends in August. That would represent a 24% year-over-year gain. Earnings are seen rising another 14% in fiscal 2017.

237,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) move to trademark ""Better Burger"" didn't just signal a possible new burger chain. It also underscores that Chipotle's core business may have peaked.Chipotle is just starting to recover from a slew of E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at several of its restaurants late last year, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ending its investigation on Feb. 1. Same-store sales plunged 14.6% in the fourth quarter and were down 26% in February. Chipotle has predicted it would report its first-ever quarterly loss in Q1.The burrito giant should see a rebound in sales from depressed levels. Consumer sentiment regarding Chipotle bottomed in January, according to William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia on Friday, citing her survey  of 800 adults. But while Chipotle's stock also bottomed in January, it hasn't made much of a recovery.IBD's Take: How Healthy Is Chipotle's stock and how does it stack up vs. rivals?But Chipotle's growth was decelerating rapidly, even before the food illness outbreaks. And other industry data also suggest that demand for Mexican food generally is no longer outpacing other types of cuisine.Chipotle is the king of fast casual eateries, as well as the clear leader among similar Tex-Mex chains, such as Jack In The Box (JACK)-owned Qdoba Mexican Eats, privately owned Freebirds World Burrito and more.But the Mexican restaurant sector is maturing, while upscale burger chains are growing in popularity, according to market tracking firm Technomic's President Darren Tristano.""When we looked at the market in 2015, sales in the (upscale) 'better burger' category grew 15%. Mexican slowed down to only 7% or 8%,"" he told IBD. Mexican restaurant growth had also been in the double digits.Take a look at the figures for high-flying burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK). There, sales rose 47%, but that was just $51 million compared with Chipotle's revenue at just under $1 billion in the fourth quarter.Chipotle needs to continue diversifying to grow, Tristano said.""When you have such large sales growth, it has to slow down. We saw that with a lot of other fast casuals too,"" he said.Sandwich and bakery chain Panera Bread (PNRA) used to enjoy double-digit and then high-single-digit same-store growth. But in the fourth quarter, that was reduced to 3.4%.It's not surprising that Chipotle's growth has faltered, but what is astounding is that it stayed so high for so long. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Chipotle's same-store sales rose a robust 9.3% vs. a year earlier. But comparable growth then accelerated every quarter until it peaked at 19.8% in the third quarter of 2014.""It was just getting bigger and bigger a few years ago,"" Argus Research analyst John Staszak said. ""Comparisons were getting more difficult.""Same-store sales growth cooled to 16.1% in Q4 2014, then to 10.4%, 4.3% and 2.6% in the first three quarters of 2015, respectively. Some of that was due to carnitas shortages as the company sought more humane suppliers.Another factor to consider is that Chipotle's food-illness woes haven't necessarily helped rivals. Jack-In-The-Box's Qdoba reported same-store sales growth slowed to 1.8% in its latest quarter, down from 14% a year earlier.Total U.S. Mexican restaurant sales grew at a 2.9% annual rate from 2010 to 2015, when they reached $38 billion, IBISWorld said in a report. The market tracker forecasts growth will slow to 2.5% a year for the 2015-2020 period.Further, Chipotle and its peers are losing ground when it comes to satisfying the public's appetite for hotter cuisines. Diners still love spicy foods, but that's expanded beyond Mexican and Asian dishes to fare such as KFC's spicy chicken wings and Restaurant Brands International (QSR)-owned Burger King's ""Angriest Whopper,"" which features hot sauce in the bun.""People looking for spicy foods might be headed for a Mexican restaurant, but there are many other choices for Americans now,"" Tristano said.Chipotle has already expanded into the Asian food sector with its ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants, though it hasn't rapidly increased those locations. It's dipped its toe into the fast-growing custom pizza sector by investing in the Locale pizzeria chain.Despite slowing growth, analysts are still bullish on Chipotle.""There is still strong association with the Chipotle brand. People have very short memories"" for health scares, said Bonnie Riggs, restaurant analyst for market-tracking firm NPD Group.In addition to eyeing the high-end burger sector, Chipotle at the end of March began testing an expanded drinks menu at a store in its home city of Denver as another way to regain customers and boost same-store sales and margins. Some analysts still see an opportunity to expand into breakfast.And the biggest mid-term source of growth is simply creating more Chipotle locations. The company added 192 stores in 2014 and 229 locations in 2015, with 220-235 planned in 2016.Investors can take heart, however. A restaurant operator that is maturing doesn't necessarily mean a death knell for the stock. Investors can, and usually do, reset expectations.Take a look at Panera, which is trading at-all time highs. There's also the fast-food king, McDonald's (MCD), which has rebounded to record highs, largely over excitement that U.S. same-store sales have turned positive following a long slump.And don't forget that expanding into burgers would bring some symmetry to Chipotle's story. McDonald's, home of the Big Mac, was a big Chipotle investor before divesting its stake.

"
239,YUM,"Quality, cleanliness and service. Those are core values on which Harry and Esther Snyder built In-N-Out Burger, the regional fast-food chain that counts celebrity chefs Gordon Ramsey and Thomas Keller among its rabid fans.In-N-Out’s star burns even brighter outside the limelight.With annual sales of over $750 million and a per-store average of over $2 million, In-N-Out’s per-store figures beat those of high-profile national chains.In-N-Out started in 1948 as a tiny hamburger stand in the Baldwin Park suburb of Los Angeles.It now boasts 309 locations in California, Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona and Oregon.Despite pleas from customers and Wall Street, In-N-Out has resisted an IPO and franchising, preferring a steady expansion that lets it maintain a close watch on each store’s product and execution.It all goes back to quality, cleanliness, service, “the formula that emerged for the standard of running In-N-Out,” wrote Stacy Perman in “In-N-Out Burger: A Behind-the-Counter Look at the Fast-Food Chain That Breaks All the Rules.” “It was not based on some fancy management methodology — rather, it grew out of Harry’s own instincts and exacting personality.”Harry Snyder (1913-76) was born in Vancouver, British Columbia.He had a hard-scrabble upbringing in Seattle and Santa Monica, Calif., often working odd jobs to help support his parents and older sisters in the wake of his father’s usual unemployment.Not one to hit the books, Harry possessed a strong work ethic. He spent his World War II Army deployment in a series of desk jobs due to a perforated ear drum. After the war in 1945, he worked as a caterer at Fort Lawton in Seattle.Esther Snyder (1920-2006), nee Johnson, also grew up in challenging circumstances, as one of eight children in rural Illinois. Unlike Harry, Esther made a college degree a priority.Working part time and taking care of her ill grandmother, she received a teaching certificate and then enrolled in the women’s arm of the Naval Reserve during World War II.After the war, she moved to Seattle, where she finished her bachelor’s degree in zoology from Seattle Pacific University.At 27, she was managing a restaurant in Fort Lawton where she met Harry, 34. Love struck fast, and they married in 1948. Then it was off to Los Angeles to start their new life, also in the food arena.The pair settled in fast-growing Baldwin Park near Los Angeles.While at Fort Lawton, Harry had noticed the increasing popularity of the boxed lunches he delivered. In L.A., he saw the postwar appetite for independence and pleasure and imagined the car becoming a larger aspect of California life.He noticed that Baldwin Park had few restaurants, yet was on a busy route between L.A. and Palm Springs -- a perfect spot for a hamburger stand.The practical Snyders named it In-N-Out to evoke car culture convenience. Harry received $5,000 startup capital from local businessman Charles Noddin and opened the first store in October 1948 on Garvey Avenue, across from the home he shared with Esther.Adding spark to his concept, Harry developed a two-way radio ordering system that let customers get a quick meal without leaving their cars.More than high tech, the high quality of the burgers and fries kept customers coming back.Harry inspected each produce shipment and made sure lettuce was hand-leafed, with tomatoes and onions up to par.Esther formed the day’s patties each morning. At home, she kept a close eye on the books while Harry supervised the stand.Soon, Esther's workload grew with the addition of their two sons, Guy and Rich. Leaving the day-to-day operations to Harry, she continued to do the bookkeeping and always stopped by the store to check in with employees and let them know how important they were to In-N-Out’s burgeoning success.The Snyders' combination of street and book smarts helped create a simple yet exceptional experience. Lines of happy customers around the block became a daily occurrence. After three years, in 1951, In-N-Out opened a second location in nearby Covina.Noddin and Harry soon dissolved the partnership after the former pushed to cut costs by reducing employee pay and using cheaper ingredients. Harry vowed to never again take on outside financing.Harry didn’t dream of putting an In-N-Out on every corner. His goal was to create a sustainable and healthy business to pass on to his sons.He knew a healthy business could be achieved only if his associates felt respected and cared for.From the beginning, Harry and Esther paid associates above minimum wage. Vendors received the same treatment. The Snyders always paid invoices on time.They didn’t cut corners and expected the same treatment from their employees and vendors.If a produce vendor was caught sneaking subpar product into a shipment, Harry ended their relationship on the spot.Employees were so satisfied working at In-N-Out, many didn’t want to leave even though they had plateaued in their positions.Meanwhile, the Snyders continued to expand, in large part to provide professional opportunities to those who helped build the firm.Harry and Esther did so under two conditions: (1) They had to own a building outright. (2) They had to know who would manage it.In-N-Out grew in the 1950s and ’60s with its traditional look and ethos -- perhaps a reassuring presence during huge cultural shifts.“There’s something very appealing about ‘No surprises.’ When you walked in, you knew you were going to be taken care of,” Michael Stern, co-author of “Roadfood,” told IBD.In the mid-1960s, Harry invested in the Irwindale Raceway, a now-defunct drag strip, and had In-N-Out provide event food.After visitors from other parts of the country tasted their first In-N-Out burger at the L.A.-area track, they took glowing reports far and wide. That made the eatery more than a West Coast secret, and requests to franchise grew.In 1976, Harry died at age 63 from lung cancer. In-N-Out had grown to 18 locations in Southern California, and 24-year-old Rich became its new president. The young man was committed to preserving his parents’ commitment to quality, service and cleanliness.With the help of industry mentors and the blessing of Esther, who maintained the position of secretary-treasurer, Rich expanded In-N-Out at a faster clip.In order to grow while maintaining the company’s core values, he came up with two innovations.The first was In-N-Out University, a training facility that opened in 1984. The school taught the management practices that Harry standardized in the early years. Rich “started videotaping employees, and they would review the tapes (during training) to discuss performance, a practice Rich picked up from the NFL,” Perman said.The second was a customer care line, a toll-free phone system staffed by those who had worked at In-N-Out restaurants.During the 1980s, Esther continued her day-to-day involvement in the chain’s operations while increasing philanthropic activities.In 1984, the company began supporting causes to help abused and neglected children, leading to the In-N-Out Burger Foundation.In 1992, In-N-Out opened its first store outside of California — in Las Vegas. But the next year, tragedy struck. Rich died when his plane crashed on the way home from a store opening in Fresno, Calif.Guy, who had worked at In-N-Out but struggled with substance abuse, stepped in as president.By many accounts, Guy demonstrated a talent for updating quality controls. But in 1999, he died from a drug overdose.In-N-Out had grown from those 18 stores when Harry died to a chain of 140 stores in two states.At nearly 80, Esther finally assumed the presidency.She remained the emotional center of the firm, visiting stores and checking on employees regularly.Lynsi Snyder, Guy’s daughter and the only member of the family’s third generation, was only 17 at the time of her father’s death.After high school, she assumed various roles in the company and moved toward the top.After Esther died at age 86, Mark Taylor rose from vice president of operations to the presidency.Then in 2010, Lynsi finally took the helm.The operating procedures instilled by Harry and Esther continue to resonate with customers.In 2015, In-N-Out won Nation’s Restaurant News’ top consumer pick for a limited-service chain for the third year in a row.Meanwhile, Lynsi Snyder-Ellingson is following in her grandparents’ footsteps. The new owner has said she will pass the company to her four children.Built In-N-Out Burger from a hamburger stand to 300-plus location chain.

255,YUM,"All-day breakfast and adjustments in food-prep helped McDonald's (MCD) beat fourth-quarter estimates Monday, indicating that the fast-food mainstay’s strategy to compete with newer alternatives is working.U.S. comparable sales, a figure considered pivotal to the company's rebound efforts from years past, surged 5.7%. That figure was far above Wall Street forecasts for around 3% growth and marked a second consecutive quarterly increase after two years of declines. Milder weather during the quarter also helped.""We are demonstrating that our turnaround plan is key to restarting growth and becoming a modern and progressive burger company,"" said CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last March and launched all-day breakfast in October.In a statement, he later added: ""As we enter 2016, we expect continued positive top-line momentum across all segments.""Shares closed up 0.7% Monday after climbing as much as 3% earlier to touch an intraday high. The stock has rallied more than 30% from a year ago.McDonald's earnings per share during Q4 jumped 16% from a year earlier to $1.31, topping forecasts by 8 cents. Sales fell 4% to $6.34 billion. But the decline, weighed by the strong dollar, wasn't as bad as expected. Analysts had modeled a slip in sales to $6.2 billion.Globally, comps rose 5%. In the company's high-growth markets, operating income jumped 27%, helped by an easier comparison in China, where the company suffered from a food safety scare in 2014 after a supplier sold expired meat to McDonald's and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC.McDonald's management said on an earnings call that it's mulling a sale of part of its stake in the company's struggling Japan business and plans to open 250-plus restaurants in China this year. In Australia, all-day breakfast will launch nationwide this quarter, the company said.As part of its new approach, McDonald's has embraced more natural ingredients, offered deals through its mobile app, and experimented with customizable burgers. But it was all-day breakfast that dominated the discussion -- and the U.S. comp growth.""Our guess is this result implies the chain outperformed the fast-food industry by about three (percentage points),"" RBC Capital Markets said in a research note. ""While input costs have started to turn favorable for McDonald’s (and projected to be down 1-2% in 2016), we believe that All Day Breakfast was also a contributor to lower cost-of-goods percentages.""Company-operated restaurant expenses fell 7% during the quarter. Breakfast items are generally cheaper as they relate to cost of sales, noted Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, and beef costs have dropped as cattle herds expand.He also pointed to other changes that likely contributed to the rebound, such as searing beef patties better, toasting buns just before giving burgers to customers, and making the menu board more efficient.""I think there’s been a number of operational improvements that they’ve done that have been mostly behind the scenes,"" Slabaugh told Investor's Business Daily.McDonald's Q4 success comes after years of struggles for the chain, which had suffered as more diners, seeking fresher, higher-quality fare, flocked to fast-casual outlets like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).But Chipotle has had problems of its own, namely a food-borne illness outbreak last year that has forced the company into damage control. Shares of other fast-casual chains and fast-food rivals have also drifted lower, while McDonald's shares have risen in recent weeks.Chipotle stock closed down 1.9% Monday and has plunged more than 40% since October. Once high-flying Shake Shack (SHAK) has tumbled 59% from its peak.Shares of Yum Brands, Burger King parent Restaurant Brands (QSR), Wendy’s (WEN) and Jack In The Box (JACK) have lost ground too.Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan noted that some rivals in the sector are only now starting to tweak their strategies, while McDonald's is putting its own in place.""They spent the last 12-plus months creating strategy, and now they’re executing,"" she told IBD.

276,YUM,"Yum Brands' decision Tuesday to split off its China business and separate into two publicly traded companies means that the remaining non-China unit will be ""significantly de-risked,"" according to an analyst.In contrast to its early success in the giant consumer market, Yum's (YUM) now-embattled China unit has been hit by economic volatility in the country, continuing fallout from food-safety scandals, and other missteps.""We view today's announcement as a large positive, as it will get Yum Brands off of the China roller coaster in a meaningful way and allow for better focus on enhancing non-China business lines (although more could and should be done),"" wrote Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski, who reiterated a buy rating on the stock.Shares of Yum closed up 1.8%.The spinoff comes despite the fact that China accounted for over half of Yum's total revenue in fiscal 2014 and was a major growth driver for years as Yum was quick to capitalize on the burgeoning fast-food cravings of China's rising middle class.But Yum's Q3 report earlier this month offered no signs of a turnaround in China, where same-store sales growth of 2% fell far below views for a 9.6% jump. The company, which also missed Q3 earnings and revenue expectations, said China sales remain ""difficult to forecast"" as the segment's recovery is slower than expected.Yum now sees ""flat to low-single-digit"" full-year EPS growth, down from guidance in the low single digits, which was lowered from an earlier view for ""at least 10%"" growth.By the end of 2016, Yum expects its China split to be complete. Shanghai-based Yum China will become a franchisee of Yum Brands in mainland China and have exclusive rights to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.'Pure Play' FranchisorThe spinoff is expected to have ""no significant debt, with substantial financial capacity to invest in its business,"" said the company in a statement.Yum China is on track for 700 new restaurant openings this year and is ""targeting expansion to over 20,000 restaurants in China"" down the road.Meanwhile, the core Yum Brands will become ""more of a 'pure play' franchisor over time"" and continue with the global expansion of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The company said it is aiming for at least 95% of its 41,000 locations to be franchisee-owned and operated by the end of 2017, following the split.The company said last week that it was wrapping up its strategic review.

299,YUM,"President Obama in 2011 endorsed a U.S. pivot to Asia, working to strengthen alliances in the region as China rises. Now McDonald's (MCD) is making its own strategic shift, announcing plans Thursday to add more than 1,500 locations in China, Hong Kong and South Korea over the next five years.The fast food giant already owns more than 2,800 restaurants in those markets, mostly company owned. But this time McDonald's said it's seeking ""strategic partners who will add value and unlock growth potential in key markets"" to help in its Asia expansion.""This will allow McDonald's to accelerate our growth and scale faster across diverse markets placing us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement. We're in the midst of transforming our business and taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to enhance our ability to grow around the world. These actions build on our turnaround efforts and will advance local ownership, enable faster decision-making and achieve restaurant growth.""McDonald's recently said it was seeking strategic allies in Japan and Taiwan. McDonald's has a goal of boosting franchise locations to 95%, even in the U.S. where the franchise model is under attack.In China alone, McDonald's will boost its store count to 3,500 from 2,200 now, Easterbrook told the Wall Street Journal. That would make China its No. 2 market after the U.S. and ahead of Japan.McDonald’s has over 14,000 locations in the U.S. and more than 36,000 worldwide.McDonald's Asia expansion comes as Yum Brands (YUM) seeks to spin off its China operations. Yum's KFC and Pizza Hut chains have a big foothold in China, with Taco Bell set to open its first location in the country this year. China used to be a huge growth driver for Yum, but food illness scares slammed sales, which have been slow to recover.McDonald's has seen its U.S. business improve, helped by an all-day breakfast menu and other changes. Thursday's announcement suggests the company is now turning its attention to overseas initiatives as well.McDonald's shares rose as high as 126.96 on the stock market today, a new record, but pulled back to close up 3 cents at 12.86. On Wednesday, shares moved out of a cup base with a buy point of 124.93.Sonic Corp. (SONC), a burgers-and-shakes chain, rose 1.7% to 35.16, extending its breakout.

302,YUM,"McDonald's (MCD) held its annual investor/analyst day Tuesday on the same day that thousands of fast-food workers nationwide held protests calling for higher pay, but the company chose to focus on its growth strategies.The meeting took place as McDonald's eyes ways to better compete against fast-food rivals such as Yum Brands (YUM) — owner of the KFC and Taco Bell chains — as well as fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Shake Shack (SHAK).During the first hour of the scheduled four-hour meeting, McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook and other officials outlined several new goals that the company looks to achieve in coming months.""My priorities for McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company are threefold: driving operational growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value,"" Easterbrook said. ""We are taking bold, urgent action to reset the business and prepare the company for the next chapter of its history.""McDonald's constant-currency financial targets for 2016 include systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%, excluding potential charges associated with its refranchising strategy and cost-saving initiatives.More Franchises, Fewer CostsIn terms of refranchising, the company raised its target to 4,000 restaurants from an earlier target of 3,500. This accelerates the pace and increases the global franchised percentage from the current 81% to about 93% by the end of 2018. McDonald's long-term goal is to become 95% franchised.McDonald's also raised its net annual general and administration cost-savings target to $500 million, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017. This reflects a $200 million increase from the previously announced target. The new target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes.In addition, Easterbrook said McDonald's has no plans to spin off its properties into real estate investment trusts, as had been speculated.""We have given REITs serious consideration, but we don't believe it serves best the interests of shareholders to pursue REITS at this time,"" he said.Easterbrook also mentioned plans to grow its store count internationally and improve McDonald's level of efficiency and customer service. It looks to add more restaurants along Germany's Autobahn, for example. Meanwhile, it is looking to change the way it toasts buns and grills meat.""We were not executing to our standards,"" he said. ""We were missing customer expectations in too many places. For too long we've asked customers to adapt to us. A big part of turning that around is giving customers more choice and always adapting to meet their needs.""Meanwhile, McDonald's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 89 cents per share of common stock, payable on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 1. This represents a 5% increase over its previous quarterly dividend.Protests NationwideWhile the meeting was taking place, fast-food workers in hundreds of U.S. cities held strikes and demonstrations calling for higher wages. It was the largest collection of rallies yet in a cause that seeks to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.The demonstrations began around dawn at McDonald's locations in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities. The protests are expected to continue throughout the U.S. for the remainder of the day and culminate in a rally at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee.Earlier this year McDonald's said it would raise wages by more than 10% for workers at U.S. restaurants that it operates, and pay at least $1 more per hour than the local minimum wage for workers at U.S. restaurants.Financially, though, the company has been in a bit of a funk of late. It has logged five straight quarters of lower sales. Year-over-year earnings have declined in four of the last five quarters, though its most recent quarter showed a 28% EPS gain. That kind of performance compares unfavorably to other stocks in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, including Starbucks (SBUX), Chipotle and Shake Shack.Even so, McDonald's stock price has been on a nice roll lately. Shares hit a fresh high of 113.96 on Oct. 26 and are up more than 10% since Oct. 21.Growth DriversIn a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as recent earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""On a more positive note, McDonald's recent decision to offer an all-day breakfast menu has been a success.""We believe that McDonald's consumer base is broader at breakfast, so increased availability of breakfast items could inspire trial of other core items and day parts,"" Palmer said.McDonald's shares rose 0.3% on the stock market today. Starbucks added 1.4%, while Chipotle climbed 3.2% and Yum lost 0.3%.Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.

310,YUM,"San Francisco might manage a $15 minimum wage without much of a dampening effect on employment, but what about a $36-an-hour minimum?That's roughly the equivalent of the challenge now facing El Centro in California's Imperial County, where the $15 minimum wage will equal 95% of the average wage in 2015.It's only logical to expect that El Centro, whose nearly 19% jobless rate in February was the highest of any metropolitan area in the U.S, will have an enormously more difficult time adapting to a $15 wage than San Francisco and San Jose, where average wages are close to $40 and joblessness is just 3% to 4%.Yet California, almost unbelievably, has ignored the dramatic economic disparities from the Bay Area to the Central Valley to the communities near the Mexico border and has embraced a one-size-fits-all $15 wage, phased in by 2022. It puts the Golden State out a limb where neither New York nor Oregon dared to go as those liberal states pushed their minimum wages into uncharted territory.Oregon took a three-tiered approach, putting its minimum wage on a path to $14.75 in the Portland metropolitan area by 2022, while the wage will top out at $13.50 in midsize counties and $12.50 in so-called ""frontier"" areas.New York City will get a $15 minimum wage by 2018, with the surrounding counties getting there by 2022. But the minimum wage for the rest of the state is on course to get to $12.50 an hour by 2021 — with one exception. Quick-service chain restaurants throughout New York will be on the hook for a $15 wage, including small businesses operating a single franchised location. New York's fast-food wage applies to a broad range of limited-service or takeout places, including Subway, Starbucks (SBUX), Wendy’s (WEN), Shake Shack (SHAK), Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell, Dunkin’ Brands’ (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts and Jamba’s (JMBA) Jamba Juice.On the same day that Gov. Jerry Brown signed the minimum wage law, Dunkin’ announced plans to open 29 franchised stores in the next few years. Such deals don’t come together overnight, and the adoption of a $15 statewide minimum was seemingly sudden and abrupt. Still, the possibility of a $15 wage initiative on the fall ballot has been in the news, so some businesses still see opportunity amid much higher wages.Yet the biggest batch of new Dunkin’ Donuts is slated for Contra Costa County, a suburban county in the East Bay area of the broad San Francisco metropolitan statistical area. With above-average wages and a 4.5% jobless rate, the economy of Contra Costa County will have a far better chance to sustain a $15 minimum wage than Imperial County, an agricultural area bordering Arizona and Mexico.Rather than a great leveler, a $15 minimum wage may end up widening geographical disparities as the high wage scares employers from adding jobs in economically depressed areas.Dunkin’ Brands CEO Nigel Travis told CNN last year that New York's $15 fast-food wage would mean ""probably less hiring, probably less growth.""In its third-quarter conference call, the company told analysts that one franchise that raised prices in response to a minimum-wage hike lost sales, so it’s advising that the best approach is to focus on increasing sales, not prices.An early warning of the potential downside of adopting a much higher minimum wage came from Wal-Mart (WMT), which earlier this year announced store closures in Los Angeles County and the city of Oakland while scrapping plans for two stores in a low-income part of D.C.The New York Farm Bureau warned that a statewide $15 minimum wage would threaten the financial viability of close to 20% of farms. Particularly if farmers in neighboring states didn’t face a similar hike, the high wage would shrink the size of the state’s agricultural industry and cause farming operations to shift to less labor-intensive crops.Now California has gone where New York feared to go -- at least in most of the state -- and the agriculture industry is bracing for the fallout. One supplier of farm labor predicts a 10% drop in agricultural hiring.The consequences of a $15 wage also may be understated for another reason: When you add up all the nonwage costs -- paid sick leave, extra payroll taxes and the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer health insurance -- California's statewide $15 minimum will really amount to $18.52 for full-time workers.

311,YUM,"Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell is delving deeper into the fast-food wars with a nationwide Thursday rollout of its new 10-item $1 Morning Value Menu, which offers a mini skillet bowl, breakfast soft taco and sausage flatbread quesadilla, among other dishes.The company is likely looking at the proliferation of low-price offerings from competitors like Wendy's (WEN) and Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King, as well as the success that McDonald's (MCD) has had in recent months since introducing all-day breakfast offerings.An NPD study from December found that the all-day breakfast menu was helping McDonald's attract new customers and boost lunch visits, and so far, quarterly results have been backing the change in strategy.The Golden Arches' U.S. same-restaurant sales popped 5.7% in the fourth quarter, reported in late January, far above analyst estimates. It also marked the second straight rise in comps following two years of same-restaurants sales declines.McDonald's shares have risen about 17% since the close of Oct. 6, the day all-day breakfast was launched nationwide, and are now building a flat base with a 124.93 buy point.Meanwhile, Yum shares have largely been in a broad area of consolidation since last May. The stock has declined about 8% since Oct. 6.On Thursday, Yum closed up 0.6%, and McDonald's rose 0.3%.Yum Brands, which also owns KFC and Pizza Hut, is working on a spin-off of its ailing China division.Taco Bell first introduced breakfast two years ago and experimented with items such as waffle tacos before landing on this value-emphasized menu.Competition for even a dollar is fierce. Rival Wendy's offers a ""4 for $4"" deal. Burger King has a ""5 for $4"" promotion. McDonald's, in addition to all-day breakfast, serves up two items for $5.""While dollar menus disappear across America, Taco Bell is continuing to reinvent breakfast with delicious and unique menu items only Taco Bell can provide, with 10 items for $1 each,"" Taco Bell's Chief Marketing Officer Marisa Thalberg said in a statement.RELATED:McDonald’s Morning In America: Breakfast Revives U.S. SalesMcDonald’s All-Day Breakfast Draws Amid Chipotle WoesYum Brands Makes Case For Split As China Sales LagImage provided by Shutterstock.

347,YUM,"(Just to add another notch in the belt - Yesterday we learned that the ISM Service sector report missed analysts' expectations - although to be fair - it IS still in expansionary mode - but so many took the opportunity to accentuate the negative which then translates into a positive for risk assets....)
"
348,YUM,"And did you see that the treasury sold a 'new gov't security' with a 3-month yield of ZERO for the first time in history? Ok...so just so we understand - investors gave the gov't a 3-month FREE loan......no interest, Here! - just take it. See the Money and Investing Section of today's WSJ -
"
349,YUM,"""Yield of 0%, a First at 3 -Month T-Bill Sale""
"
350,YUM,"As the article points out:
"
351,YUM,"""The result reflects diminishing expectations in financial markets that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term rates before year end after Friday's disappointing jobs report....""
"
352,YUM,"And so - the prospect of loading up the punch bowl with more 'Kool Aid' creates demand for 'riskier assets' and this sent both stocks and commodities higher......
"
353,YUM,"Technically speaking we can expect more volatility in the weeks ahead as we enter earnings season.... We have seen how analysts have slashed estimates and repositioned themselves ahead of what is likely to be a volatile couple of weeks.
"
354,YUM,"Last night we learned that Ellen Kullman - CEO at DuPont (DD) is the first casualty of this 'hurricane season'. News out last night that she is 'retiring' (convenient) just as her company slashed its profit forecast - (dollar strength, global weakness...blah, blah, blah) and the activist investor, Trian, boosted its stake in the company - citing Kullman's failure to meet her targets..... Remember that Trian - owned by Ed Garden and Nelson Peltz - wants to break up the company saying that the parts are worth more than the sum of its whole. The stock is trading UP $2 or 4% in pre-market trading.....
"
355,YUM,"This morning Pepsico (PEP) announces a surprise earnings report : $1.35 vs. exp of $1.26....which is contra to what the expectation was.... Revenues of $16.3 bil vs exp of $16.1 bil and they are on track to deliver $5 bil of productivity savings thru 2019 and return $9 bil to shareholders this year.....the stock is trading UP 3 pts (3%) at $98.57/sh.
"
356,YUM,"Later today we will hear from YUM Brands (YUM) - and on tomorrow afternoon - we will hear from AlcoaAA.
"
357,YUM,"On a side note Uncle Benny (Bernanke) took to the media circuit yesterday - announcing the publication of his new book - ""The Courage to Act"" . In this book - Benny discusses what went wrong and what went right during the GFC of 2007/2015 and counting......He points his finger at corporate executives saying that:
"
358,YUM,"""It would have been my preference to have more investigation of individual action, since obviously everything that went wrong or was illegal was done by some individual and not by an abstract firm.""
"
359,YUM,"He also acknowledges that so many were slow to realize just how serious the crisis would become and he 'faults himself for not doing more to explain to Americans why it was in their interest to rescue the financial firms that had helped cause it'.
"
360,YUM,"And finally he calls out a defective congress that 'failed to do its part' in helping to navigate the turmoil that engulfed this country - turmoil that caused untold hardships and crisis on so many Americans - The book is available today on Amazon and is a must read for anyone interested in how close the country was to financial Armageddon.
"
361,YUM,"Overnight Asian markets were mostly higher due to the news that the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) agreement seems to be finished. This trade deal among the US and 11 Pacific Rim countries has been called 'the biggest of its kind in a generation' and is supposed to yield global benefits of $300 bil. by the year 2025. This deal though - still needs final approval from Congress....HSBC analysts had this to say about the deal:
"
362,YUM,"""An accord among countries representing a large swath of the global economy sends a positive signal worldwide.....increased market openness via trade policy reform on this scale can promote growth in a manner that compounds"".
"
363,YUM,"We can only hope....Japan +1%, Hong Kong -0.1% and ASX +0.3%.
"
364,YUM,"In Europe - markets are now higher after being lower all morning. German Factory Orders fall 'unexpectedly' raising the risk that Europe's largest economy is vulnerable to a weakening China.....The rebound that we have seen of late has been on the back of the idea of more stimulus....vs. on an improving economic outlook. So - is the move really sustainable? I guess we are about to see.....as earnings season is about to begin in Europe as well....so the devil is in the details...FTSE -0.04%, CAC 40 + 0.72%, DAX + 0.81%, EUROSTOXX +0.65%, SPAIN +0.73% AND ITALY + 0.31%
"
365,YUM,"US Futures are off 4 pts.....that is after they were 10- pts lower earlier....this should not surprise anyone - after yesterday's rally to resistance at 1990ish. Expect the news to be about DD, PEP and YUM today as more of the details emerge over leadership and results. Banks begin next week and those will surely set the overall tone for the broader market. No eco reports to speak of, but there are two FED speakers that will hit the circuit today. Kansas Fed Ester George at 9:15 am and San Fran's John Williams at 3:30 pm.
"
366,YUM,"I suspect that the market will trade tight as it digests yesterday's move and dissects the DD, PEP and YUM news.....as it looks for the next catalyst to determine market direction. Look for resistance at the 50 dma at 2000 and support at 1950.

399,YUM," Chinese President Xi Jinping raised eyebrows, and more than a little skepticism, when he recently announced that his new slogan would be “supply-side structural reform” — or what we in the West call Reaganomics.If China really wants to embrace Reagan’s economic model, along with its prosperity, Xi will have to learn one of Reagan’s key principles: “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.”That means:China is run by its Communist Party, and like all communists, they think the government must micromanage all facets of the economy.As Bloomberg News writes, “Like Mao, Xi has established a broad view of his authority.  He’s thrown his office behind everything from censoring the Internet, to promoting national soccer skills to ordering artists to hew closely to Marxist ideology.  Even amid China’s recent tumult, he’s continued to widen his portfolio.”And one of those areas of wider involvement is the stock market.  The government encouraged its citizens to pour money into the market, helping to create a massive bubble that popped last August.The Chinese government intervened by buying stocks, and even trying to stop people from selling their stocks.  But the government’s efforts only exacerbated the panic.CNN Money opined, “China's Communist Party has taken extraordinary measures in an attempt to do what no one in the world has ever been able to do: stop market volatility.”You will recall that the U.S. stock market took a nose dive during Reagan’s tenure: Oct. 16, 1987, Black Monday.  After a near 10% decline the previous week, the Dow dropped 22% on Black Monday.  It rallied and fell several times during the week, finally closing down 13%.  But the Reagan government did nothing, nor should it have.Xi also needs to learn the supply-side principle that private-sector investment, not government pump-priming, is the key to economic growth.  And you achieve that goal by lowering corporate tax rates, reducing regulations and letting competition thrive.But as companies that try to compete in China well know, the government likes to tip the scale toward favored businesses.  Plus, the legal system is often biased against U.S. and many other foreign companies.The Wall Street Journal reports, “In China, where it isn’t uncommon for companies to become targets of media campaigns and state investigations, the standard reaction of companies has been to issue an apology followed by a marketing blitz and acts to restore good will.”That’s because fighting the government can cause even more problems, and yet some companies are fighting back.Yum Brands, Inc., runs KFC and Pizza Hut in China.  The company went on the offensive in 2012 after several Chinese-based companies began spreading what Yum said were false rumors that severely damaged the company’s sales.Foreign companies just don’t do that in China, and yet Yum won its case.  A court recently ordered the Chinese companies that spread the false rumors to pay Yum 600,000 yuan.Another food company, Illinois-based meat supplier OSI Group, was also apparently targeted.  Two new hires in 2014 turned out to be working for a government-connected broadcaster.The media plants claimed the company was selling expired meat — a claim that would, and did, benefit those companies with closer government relationships.  But instead of the usual apology, professed humility and perhaps a few, um, “tokens” of the company’s regrets, OSI is fighting the charges.It lost its first round in the courts in February, which wouldn’t surprise anyone in China’s legal system, but OSI is pressing on. That’s a start, but China’s record of corruption is so bad that rooting it out and changing the culture will take years of concerted effort.But Xi needs to understand that a country built on Communist Party control, phony statistics, cronyism and graft will never be able to fully transition to a supply-side model, which relies on individuals and companies seeking opportunities, assessing risks and investing their own assets in a level playing field.It will take much more than a supply-slide slogan if Xi really wants to recreate the Reagan economic miracle.

406,YUM,"Domino's Pizza (DPZ) shares gapped up 13% and hit a fresh intraday high Thursday, after the chain of delivery and take-out pizzerias handily beat consensus views and posted double-digit sales growth at domestic outlets open more than a year.Fourth-quarter earnings grew 26% to $1.15 per share, a nickel above forecasts. Revenue rose 15% to $741.2 million, marking the second straight quarter of accelerating growth and easily surpassing Wall Street estimates for $707 million.Shares advanced Thursday to end the regular session at 132.90, as the stock broke out of a consolidation that started in July. The stock had been hovering between 99 and 119.73 in that time frame. Shares reached an intraday high of 133.92 during the last hour of trading in the stock market today, and started to stake out further gains in after-hours action.Same-store sales grew 10% at domestic company-owned stores and 10.7% at domestic franchise stores for overall U.S. comp growth of 10.7%, well above consensus. International comps rose 8.6%. Domino's has more than 12,500 stores globally.Given the ""heightened competition in the quick-service segment,"" Domino's U.S. comps are ""evidence that the company’s ability to compete on more than just price is enabling it to gain market share more aggressively than any of its peers,"" Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said Thursday, noting that the company outperformed the recent 2% U.S. comp growth at Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut and 1.9% North American same-store sales rise at Papa John's (PZZA).On Wednesday, Domino's also declared a 22.6% dividend hike to 38 cents per share.While the pizza chain doesn't offer guidance for the year or quarter, it raised the top end of its long-range domestic comp growth outlook to 2%-5%, up from 2%-4%. Its international same-store outlook remains at 3%-6%.Currency woes may weigh on Domino's this fiscal year.""We believe the one Achilles’ heel for (Domino's Pizza) in 2016E is the potential impact from (foreign exchange), and management still expects an $8 million-$10 million hit to earnings from a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 (down from $18 million-$20 million in 2015),"" wrote Maxim's Anderson. ""Nevertheless, we were encouraged to see international franchise royalty revenue exceed our expectations.""Yum shares dipped 0.7% to close at 70.96, while Papa John's shares lost 0.9% to finish at 59.04.Papa John's turned in mixed results Tuesday, earning 62 cents a share in Q4 2015, a 19% rise from the previous year. Revenue dipped 2% to $416.8 million, falling short of views for $425.8 million.

407,YUM,"Pizza man John Schnatter admits that he’s a driven perfectionist. He’s tossed lots of executives who didn’t meet his demands.He’ll pop into one of his 4,700 stores and toss pizzas till they’re just right.He devotes 14 pages online to describing the “better ingredients” touted in his ads, like purified water, hand-tossed dough, Provolone cheese, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh mushrooms.Starting last year and into 2016, Papa John’s International (PZZA) — which Schnatter founded and now serves as CEO — is budgeting $100 million annually to upgrade its menu to more natural ingredients.“Years ago, we made it our mission to be the best, even when it costs us more,” Schnatter, 54, told IBD from the company’s headquarters in Jeffersontown, Ky. “We have a commitment to even better quality with our Clean Label Initiative that is eliminating artificial ingredients while working to retain taste and functionality.“When your foundation is rooted in quality, and you lead the category in that regard, you can’t ever stop building on that success. Customers really value this effort.”In June, the American Customer Satisfaction Index gave Papa John’s the highest rating among pizza chains for the 14th time in 16 years. Shareholders have rewarded Papa John’s by driving the stock up about 700% since 2009.Schnatter was born in Jeffersonville, Ind., in 1961 and grew up with parents who were entrepreneurs.His mom was a real estate agent and set a high bar for school grades and hard work. His father was a judge and entrepreneur. However, the patriarch’s wine distributing company, solar heating firm and cable TV business all went under, and sometimes the family’s electricity and water were turned off for unpaid bills.“That experience played a big part in my success because I was always driven by fear I might fail, even after Papa John’s was doing well,” said Schnatter. “I admired my dad for never giving up, but I also learned that if you take big risks, you’d better make them work.”As a sophomore in high school, he had two jobs. Daytimes, he stocked a liquor store. At night, he washed dishes at Rocky’s Sub Pub.When things got busy at the food spot, he’d help make the pizzas and became fascinated by how attention to detail made a big difference. “If we made them right, the plates would come back clean,” he said.He began talking to friends about his dream of opening a pizza shop. Plenty of them thought he was crazy, but he became obsessed with developing the perfect pizza — and created his own recipes at home.After working at another pizzeria in Muncie, Ind., while attending Ball State University, he saw an opportunity. He realized that while the national chains could deliver a pie to anyone’s door, it wouldn’t be as good as something served at a local restaurant.He knew he could do exactly that,  so he almost dropped out in 1982 to open a franchise pizza place.He was talked out of it, and after graduating in 1983, he moved home and followed up on this idea.First, with savings from jobs, he bought half-ownership in his dad’s tavern.Then he sold his 1972 Camaro Z28 for $2,800 for needed cash.Once things were stable, he ripped out the wall of a broom closet and installed used pizza-making equipment.After taking in $2,300 one night from tavern customers, he aimed to build a restaurant next door and took out a $30,000 loan.But before the restaurant opened in 1984, his dad had an aneurysm and died at 51, leaving Schnatter with $60,000 in debt.His response: Work harder.The pizzeria turned out to be a smash hit. Schnatter was soon taking in $9,000 a week, while chain stores were doing $6,000.“I began thinking that if we could beat them at one location, why not try it everywhere?” said Schnatter.Franchises were booming in the quick-service restaurant industry in 1985, so he expanded Papa John’s that way. “We’ve developed a successful franchisee model through years of learnings through burnings,” he quipped.He had picked the right business. The first U.S. pizzeria opened in New York City in 1905. After World War II, soldiers returning from Europe spurred growth to 20,000 pizza spots in 1956. According to the American Pizza Community, a coalition of pizza sellers, the country has 75,000 pizza stores with sales of $37 billion a year.For Schnatter, becoming the national spokesman for his company was a huge challenge in the beginning, since he was terrified of public speaking (the No. 1 fear of most people, even more than death).He overcame his fear by working with a coach and forcing himself to talk to groups until he became in the 1990s an in-demand motivational speaker. Today he’s the face of Papa John’s in TV ads.Schnatter was president until 1990, added the CEO title and oversaw the company’s IPO. By 1998, he was the National Ernst & Young Retail/Consumer Entrepreneur of the Year.After a sales slump in 1999, he straightened out the firm  with what are called mystery shoppers — who would anonymously taste-test Papa John’s stores.The system boosted quality by measuring a cross-sample of 4 million pizzas a week.In 2006, Schnatter stepped back from daily management for two years, serving as executive chairman. The change gave him more time for golf and his family.But after a half-baked performance by the new management, the board asked him to come back.He sat back in the CEO seat in late 2008, tried sharing the top spot in 2010, then took full charge a year later.According to industry news site PizzaToday.com, he’s the rare entrepreneur talented enough to found a firm and stay on as the long-term corporate leader.“We brought in a professional management team from outside twice (in 2006 and 2010), and they wanted good corporate governance, but we insist on world-class, and I wasn’t impressed,” said Schnatter. “I understand the business model and scaffolding that hold this place together, but a vision is worthless unless you bring people along. I recently promoted Steve Ritchie from chief operating officer to president, and he’s a prime example of someone who understands how we do things differently. You’ve got to have an entrepreneurial spirit, and he started as a customer service representative 17 years ago, ran a store at 21 and today is in charge of all of them.”In 2014, Papa John’s opened 54 locations in North America and 181 beyond, with the total today of 4,700.Meanwhile, the firm has 1,000 spots in the development pipeline.Revenue at Papa John's stood at $1.7 billion in 2015, third behind Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) and Pizza Hut, part of Yum Brands (YUM).Schnatter still owns more than a quarter of his firm’s stock, a major part of his net worth of $600 million, says CelebrityNetWorth.com.He owns a top-of-the-line jet and homes in Louisville, Deer Valley, Utah, and Naples, Fla.And in 2009 he bought back his Camaro for $273,000, which included a finder's fee to someone who tracked it down.Schnatter shares his money through philanthropy and his church.

409,YUM,"McDonald’s (MCD) took over the top spot from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as the favorite restaurant destination among U.S. teens and young adults in 2015, according to a new poll released Wednesday, with the burger giant benefiting from a rebound in the quick-service sector.Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) remained a pretty popular destination among female respondents -- though less so than in previous years -- while Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell was a hit with young males.William Blair’s annual Teen/Young Adult Survey found that restaurant sentiment “weakened somewhat” in 2015, with about 43% of respondents saying they ate out more often than a year earlier vs. 48% in 2014. Still, those numbers compared well to the apparel category, where only 31% of respondents said they spent more on apparel in 2015.“For those eating out less often, financial reasons were by far the main culprit (40%), while the response ‘too expensive’ jumped to roughly 25% from 18% last year, perhaps reflecting push-back to price increases taken by restaurants on structural government-mandated wage inflation,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia said in a report.She said the quick-service sector “had a quantum leap in popularity” in 2015. Eateries in this category accounted for 38% of total restaurant visits by respondents in 2015, up from 30% in 2014. This represented an all-time high for the survey, driven by strong share gains from McDonald’s and Taco Bell.Fast-casual visits fell to about 20% of total visits in 2015 from 28% the prior year, and Chipotle lost the biggest chunk of share. That was the case even though the survey was completed before the E. coli outbreak at Chipotle restaurants, which was first reported in the fall. Casual dining surpassed fast casual to become the second-most-frequented subsector in 2015.“In terms of frequency (of visits), McDonald’s topped the list across genders, while Chipotle fell to second among females (from first the prior year) and third among males (from second the prior year),” Zackfia said.Among female respondents, Panera Bread (PNRA) held the third spot behind McDonald’s and Chipotle for the second year in a row. Starbucks remained in fourth place, though the percentage of female respondents who said they ate there most often fell to 6.3% in 2015 from 7.2% in 2014. Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden rounded out the top five among females.“McDonald’s gained material share over the past year across both genders, with the second-highest share gains behind Olive Garden for females and Taco Bell for males,” Zackfia noted.Among male respondents, Taco Bell ranked second behind McDonald’s as the most-visited restaurant. It was followed by Chipotle, DineEquity’s (DIN) Applebee’s and Wendy’s (WEN).Shares of McDonald’s closed down 0.3% on the stock market today.Chipotle rose 3.1%, Starbucks lost 0.8%, Yum fell 1%, Panera fell fractionally, Darden and  Dinequity climbed 0.7%, and Wendy’s retreated 0.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

413,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) topped Wall Street's meek earnings expectations late Tuesday as the restaurant chain released its first quarterly report since being rocked food-safety scandals, but revenue still fell short and the trendy eatery warned that 2016 will be difficult.The company earned $2.17 per share, a 43.5% plummet but not as bad as analysts had feared. Wall Street had anticipated $1.85 per share, and Chipotle had recently guided for diluted EPS of $1.70-$1.90.Revenue fell almost 7% to $997.5 million, below views for $1.01 billion.Same-store sales fell 14.6%, in line with the expected decline Chipotle Mexican Grill had disclosed in a recent SEC filing. Chipotle also announced a $300 million stock buyback program.But  Chipotle warned on the post-earnings call that 2016 ""will be a very difficult year,"" predicting first-quarter EPS will be breakeven. Wall Street had expected $2.08 a share, down 46%. January same-store sales crashed 36%.Shares fell 3.6% to 458.21 on the stock market today in late morning trade.Chipotle's caution of a deeper and longer road to recovery surprised investors, but it follows a similar experience by Yum Brands (YUM). Yum Brands' China operations suffered a a series of food-safety scandals, and same-store sales remain under pressure several quarters later.For 2016, Chipotle expects 220-235 new restaurant openings and an effective full-year tax rate of about 39%. In a December filing, the company rescinded its previously announced 2016 outlook for same-restaurant sales growth.Chipotle's food-safety woes first came to light in early November, prompting the fast-casual burrito chain to temporarily close 43 locations in the Pacific Northwest. Over 50 people in nine states were hit with E. coli.But that wasn't the only scare. In December, over 140 people were struck with norovirus after visiting a single Chipotle restaurant in Boston, and the company was also served with a subpoena related to an earlier norovirus episode at a California location.The company also disclosed that on Jan. 28 it had been served with a subpoena ""broadening the scope of the previously-announced criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Central District of California.”""The new subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to company-wide food safety matters dating back to January 1, 2013, and supersedes the subpoena served in December 2015 that was limited to a single Chipotle restaurant in Simi Valley, California,” said the company. “We intend to fully cooperate in the investigation.""But the CDC declared on Monday that the outbreaks were over. Chipotle management had already predicted that margins and earnings this year would be ""messy,"" given the situation.It has since implemented a new food-safety program as it focuses on winning back customers, though young people don't appear to be fazed the restaurant's problems. A NPD Group study, released Monday, said that young adults increased their visits to Chipotle by double-digits last year.""We are pleased to have this behind us and can place our full energies to implementing our enhanced food safety plan that will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety,"" said co-CEO Steve Ells in a statement. ""We are extremely focused on executing this program, which designs layers of redundancy and enhanced safety measures to reduce the food safety risk to a level as near to zero as is possible.""Meanwhile, Buffalo Wild Wings tumbled 6.2% Wednesday intraday  as reports circulated of a Kansas location sickening several people.

414,YUM,"Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) said Wednesday that same-restaurant sales so far in Q1 have paled in comparison to those a year ago -- when diners packed its restaurants for college football's first-ever playoff -- while its Q4 results and 2016 guidance came up short of estimates.Meanwhile, Yum Brands' (YUM) Q4 China results pointed to a rebound from earlier food-safety issues.Buffalo Wild Wings said that same-store sales in the opening four weeks of the first quarter rose 0.3% at company-owned restaurants and slipped 1.5% at franchised locations. A year earlier, company comps jumped 12.7%, and franchise comps saw a 12.4% increase.The restaurant chain also said it will stop reporting quarter-to-date comps trends after this quarter, ""as a four-week trend is not predictive of quarterly same-store sales.""The chicken-wing purveyor targeted 2016 earnings per share of $5.95-$6.20, well below forecasts for $6.48.Q4 EPS climbed 23.4% to $1.32, but that was short of views for $1.48. Sales rose 19.9% to $490.2 million, missing estimates for $507.23 million.Shares were up 1% in after-hours trading, after initially falling 2% late and having closed 4.3% lower on reports of diners in Kansas getting sick.Overall comps rose 1.9% at company-owned restaurants and 0.1% at franchised locations during Q4, short of the company's own expectations.Buffalo Wild Wings said the sluggish performance was likely due to ""holiday shifts for Halloween and Christmas."" The company has also been dealing with higher labor costs, which jumped 20% from a year earlier.The results come as the company awaits the results of an investigation by health officials in Kansas into reports of gastrointestinal illness potentially linked to one of its restaurants there. At least 10 were reported sick, media outlets said, with the first reports coming Friday.Buffalo Wild Wings said it shut down the restaurant in question, had it cleaned, and then on Sunday reopened it, according to Bloomberg.The test results could come in a matter of days, potentially around the Super Bowl, possibly costing the chain one of its biggest sales days of the year. Last year, the company sold some 11 million chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday.The results follow Tuesday’s quarterly report from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), whose reputation, profits and stock price have all been battered by foodborne-illness outbreaks reported last year. Chipotle said Tuesday that 2016 will be ""very difficult"" and gave a break-even profit forecast for Q1. Sales aren't seen recovering until next year.Yum Brands, whose own food-handling issues in recent years preceded a planned spinoff of its China business, reported Q4 EPS Wednesday that topped views, though its sales missed.China sales rose 7%, with same-restaurant sales up 2%, marking the second straight gain and indicating a continued recovery from the food-safety issues.Overall, Yum's adjusted EPS rose 11% to 68 cents, beating by 2 cents. Revenue declined 1.2% to $3.95 billion, missing views of $4.02 billion.Yum shares slipped 1.4% in late trading.

"
436,YUM,"Following months of ranting and raving against Germany and the Troika (IMF, ECB and EU) - He rejected plan after plan then forced a referendum vote in his country, campaigned for his citizens to vote 'NO' - and when they 'overwhelmingly agreed' that last week's deal was a bad one - he then sold them down the river! He made such a dramatic reversal that it's almost laughable.....and to make it more ridiculous - the latest 'final offer' is far worse than ones he had turned down!

"
438,YUM,"""This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can't accept; but even so, it's a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.""

Who would have thought of using real names? Over the weekend - Xinhua - the state owned news outlet - reported that some brokerage houses were 'suspected of manipulating futures prices and other malicious practices.

Shoji Hirakawa, Chief equity strategist at Oksan Securities, did say that the fund looks like they still have another 4 or 5 trillion Yen left to put to work in the Japanese stock market - Ah…Hello??? 5 Trillion more Yen going into stocks....Anyone want to stand in front of that train?

Good for today - but if Tsipras can't deliver - then expect it to all fall apart mid-week. Even if he does deliver - and that is a big ""IF"" - will he be able to hold onto his position as PM? Relief- sure.....Greece now has 72 hours to vote in the reforms. There is already trouble brewing in Parliament - you can imagine the rage among those that supported Tsipras in his efforts and now feel like he turned his back on them.

452,YUM,"Stocks lost their grip on most of the day's gains Thursday as the indexes headed into the final hour of trade. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%, after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average held pops of 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running much slower than the previous session.Among widely held issues, AT&T (T) thrust about 2% higher in volume 55% above average. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down about 10% and 8% respectively so far this year, AT&T has held steady with a 1% gain.AT&T's dividend might be part of the reason. In an ugly market, dividend stocks start looking good to some investors. AT&T has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The current annualized yield is 5.6%.The stock price, though, has been rangebound for more than two years. AT&T stock has found repeated resistance at the 36-37 area and support at the 31-32 level. The stock is trading just under 35.In the IBD 50, a list of stocks with the best ratings via fundamentals and technicals, Carter's (CRI) gained 1% in volume a third faster than normal. The marketer of clothes for babies and children is working on a stage-two base. However, the stock needs to do more work on the right side. Carter's is 17% off its high.A stage-two base means the stock is forming its second consolidation since starting an advance. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from a later stage.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, coal and oil stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Funeral Services and book stocks took the hardest hits.Follow Paul Whitfield on Twitter @IBD_PWhitfield.

The authors then calculate that raising the average wage to $15 an hour would increase total staff compensation to $253,352.

504,YUM,"Domino’s Pizza is grabbing a bigger piece of the pie by investing in digital technology to dominate the world's pizza-delivery market.That’s right: world. Domino's (DPZ) opened its 1,000th store in India earlier this month. Last year, it entered Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Georgia, Portugal, Belarus and -- wait for it -- Italy.Fast food pizza ... in Italy? Domino's Chief Executive J. Patrick Doyle told IBD that, yes, Italy invented pizza, but he’s not intimidated.""We think there are some things we bring to the market that are terrific for customers,” Doyle said. That's true even in pizza’s holy land, he says.Domino’s does delivery like no neighborhood pizza shop. By boosting its e-commerce commitment, it’s expanding its franchise network and gaining market share in the U.S. and around the globe. It now has roughly 5,000 stores here and another 7,000 outside the U.S.“Domino’s tries to innovate in everything they do -- especially with technology and engagement with the brand -- you’re not going to find that with most other restaurant brands,” Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Christopher O’Cull told IBD. “I think it’s the best-managed company in the restaurant industry. Starbucks (SBUX) is up there, but Domino’s is one of the top two or three.”O’Cull rates the stock a hold, due to its run-up in valuation, though he says he's had a buy rating on it for a long time.Domino’s pizza chain competitors include Papa John’s (PZZA), Pizza Hut (part of Yum Brands (YUM)) and privately held Little Caesars.Domino’s has been “investing heavily for five years” in technology, said Doyle. Today, Domino’s customers can place orders on a computer or laptop, mobile phone app, through texts, on a smartwatch, from a car through Ford’s (F) onboard computer, using a Samsung Smart TV, and via Amazon’s (AMZN) new Echo, a voice command device. They can also tweet orders via their Twitter (TWTR) accounts, which advertises orders to their followers, an extra benefit for Domino’s.“They’re really at the forefront of pushing mobile technology and positioned to benefit from it,” said Alton Stump, a Longbow Research LLC analyst who spoke with IBD. Stump has a buy rating on the stock.Doyle says that in the U.S., more than 50% of Domino’s customers now order via digital platforms. Other chains are investing in technology too, but it’s hard for local pizza shops to fund such projects. Thus, Domino’s is “really gaining share over those local players,” said Stump.Last October, Domino’s also came out with ""DXP,"" a specially designed pizza delivery vehicle. It’s a version of the Chevrolet Spark that includes a warming oven, GPS navigation and a “puddle light” that projects the Domino’s logo on the ground. Doyle says that so far, 100 DXP’s are purveying pizzas in the U.S.In 2015's third quarter ended Sept. 6, Domino’s reported total revenue rose $38 million or 8.5% to $484.7 million from $446.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net income was up 6.2% to $37.8 million. And diluted earnings per share rose 4% to 67 cents from 63 cents in the year-earlier quarter.The company’s turnaround began back in 2010. Doyle came aboard and he knew the first issue Domino’s had to tackle was the quality of its pizza. The company’s test kitchen got to work and reformulated and improved its product. Then it launched an unusual rebranding campaign, blatantly telling the market that its pizza had been lousy, but it had made dramatic changes.Customers listened and growth took off. Domestic same-store sales for the third quarter of 2015 grew 10.5%, while international same-store sales rose 7.7%, the 87th consecutive quarter of growth in that category. Investors responded. Back on Jan. 1, 2010, Domino's closed at $11.30 a share. It hit an all-time intraday high of $119.73 a share on July 13, 2015. And despite a wobbly stock market, the stock still hovers around $115.“Domino’s has been able to put up really strong same-store sales,” Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle told IBD. He rates the stock a hold and says that “franchisees have seen 50% growth in profits since 2009.”And Domino’s has just been through the equivalent of its Black Friday: Super Bowl Sunday.“It is often our biggest day of the year, for sure the busiest two hours of the year,” said Doyle. From an hour before kickoff until halftime ends, “we have an order coming in almost every minute at every store, and those orders have typically more than one pizza.” Domino’s also sells chicken, hot sandwiches, bread, desserts and sodas.The profitability of Domino’s franchises makes them an attractive investment. Doyle says that in the U.S., adjusted per-store earnings are “north of $120,000, and the average cost of building a store is $300,000.” Thus a franchisee can “make back the investment in less than three years.”Domino’s had 4,722 U.S. franchises as of mid-June and 376 company-owned stores. The vast majority of the U.S. franchise owners came up through the Domino’s ranks, says Doyle.“We’re an entrepreneurial factory here,” he said.Outside the U.S., in India and elsewhere, Domino’s leverages a Master Franchisee model to expand rapidly.“(Through) Master Franchisees, who sell locations to smaller franchisees, Domino’s can generate a lot of growth and cash with a very asset-light model,” said O’Cull. Then Domino’s can “focus on just managing the brand.”Where will Domino’s deliver next? Africa is poised for pizza growth, says Doyle.“We’re in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa,” he said. “I’m excited about Sub-Saharan Africa. Everyone has a cell phone … and (countries) are going to cell-phone-based payment systems.”He added: “Gross domestic product per capita (in Africa) has been growing for the past decade, and you have a growing middle class. We think (Africa offers) opportunities.”

505,YUM,"Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) received a higher price target and earnings estimate Wednesday amid an upbeat outlook for sales growth and cost savings, though the company still isn’t getting as much love from Wall Street as chief rival McDonald’s (MCD).The higher estimates came a day after Restaurant Brands beat fourth-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, helped by a 6.3% same-store sales gain at its Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts chain. Burger King comps grew 3.9%.In a note published Wednesday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer raised his price target on Restaurant Brands to 38 from 36. Palmer also raised his 2016 per-share earnings estimate to $1.36 from $1.30 and his 2017 estimate to $1.60 from $1.53.“While (foreign-exchange) headwinds are likely to persist this year, we expect continued outperformance by Tim Hortons in Canada, slightly positive trends at BK U.S. and Canada, and more robust international growth for BK in 2016,” Palmer said. “Our model also reflects cost savings within the Tim Hortons distribution business, which we believe was a significant source of EPS upside vs. our estimates over the last two quarters.”Restaurant Brands is already one of the more efficient operators in the fast-food sector, Palmer said. He estimates that Restaurant Brands’ capital spending per restaurant this year will average about $7,600. That compares to $11,000 at Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and $21,500 at Wendy’s (WEN). McDonald’s has the highest overhead costs of any of the four, Palmer noted, though he didn’t provide 2016 capex estimates for the fast-food chain.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands’ top line should get a boost from an ever-widening market reach.“International unit growth has been accelerating, (and) the company’s domestic sales momentum seems to have improved in recent months,” Palmer said.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 2% on the stock market today. The stock is up 18% since hitting a three-and-a-half month low of 29.28 on Feb. 11, though it is still down about 24% from its 52-week high of 45.71 set last February.In contrast, McDonald’s set a record high earlier this month and is up about 24% over the last year. Shares have been on a sharp rise since October, when McDonald’s launched its successful all-day breakfast menu.Even so, McDonald’s shares fell 0.45% Wednesday. Yum rose 2.4%, while Wendy’s gained 1%.

560,YUM,"Recession-weary millennials haven't been as eager as previous generations to get saddled with possessions, a sentiment reflected in low home ownership rates and a thriving ""sharing economy."" But the newest generation of consumers likes having nice things. 
"
561,YUM,"Generation Z — those 17 and younger — is the latest demographic in the cross hairs of brands and retailers who have thus far been in hot pursuit of millennials. But teens and kids are markedly different from their older counterparts in want and how they spend, say experts.
"
562,YUM,"Their predecessors in the 18-to-34 set have a case of ""millennialism,"" a recession-induced mindset that translates to owning fewer things, said Jamie Gutfreund, chief marketing officer at digital marketing agency Deep Focus.
"
563,YUM,"Millennials, who graduated college during a recession and witnessed their parents struggle with layoffs, aren't attached to possessions, says Gutfreund, and they see property like cars and homes weighing them down. The travel-happy renters would rather take an Uber than buy a sedan, or resell items they no longer use.
"
564,YUM,"Have-Nots Vs. Aspiring Haves
"
565,YUM,"""If you've ever spent time with someone who's lived through the Depression, they don't go back (to their old ways),"" Gutfreund told IBD. Millennials ""essentially started the sharing economy,"" valuing experiences over products.
"
566,YUM,"Younger people, by comparison, dream of owning cars and homes. They're characterized as being entrepreneurial, well informed and socially conscious. If today's 20- and early-30-somethings are ""have-nots,"" Gen Z members definitely aspire to be ""haves.""
"
567,YUM,"Six out of 10 Gen Z youth would rather have a cool product than a cool experience, while 77% of Gen Ys (millennials) would opt for a cool experience over a cool product, according to the latest edition of the Cassandra Report, a Deep Focus survey of young consumers.
"
568,YUM,"Millennials, who were teenagers around the time the dot-com bubble burst, think that money doesn't make the man. When they were 14 to 18, only 28% of them viewed having lots of money as an indicator of success, said the report, vs. 51% of today's 14- to 18-year-olds.
"
569,YUM,"""Gen Z will be the landlords and Gen Y the renters,"" said Gutfreund. ""Gen Zs view larger, more significant purchases as a solid anchor, a direct investment toward building their future, while Ys view them as an anchor holding them back from experiences (like) traveling the world, and locking them into a lifetime of debt.""
"
570,YUM,"Ready To Drop Serious Dough
"
571,YUM,"What does this distinction mean for retailers and makers of consumer products?
"
572,YUM,"While both generations are budget buyers, today's teens look for ""investment value,"" not resale value, Gutfreund said. Young and still in school, they are nevertheless ""efficient and careful consumers"" who tend to do a lot of research online before making purchases, she added.
"
573,YUM,"Teens and kids are therefore more willing than their older peers to drop some serious dough (or their parents' dough ) on a product that they like, even if it means having less stuff overall. When it comes to purchases, 54% of 13- to 17-year-olds value quality over quantity, according to the Cassandra Report.
"
574,YUM,"""I do think they will spend more on individual purchases — buying less but better quality fits into their investment mentality,"" Gutfreund said.
"
575,YUM,"For example, Estee Lauder's (EL) upscale makeup brand Mac became the No. 1 favorite for teen girls across all income brackets for the first time, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey. Never mind that Mac foundation can run up to $35 a pop, about three times the price of drugstore brands and more than the average teen's weekly allowance.
"
576,YUM,"Dressing well is also a priority for Gen Z. But logo-heavy Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) — millennial favorites — won't cut it anymore.
"
577,YUM,"""When millennials were in junior high, a lot of the retail (selection) was about these big, bold logos,"" said Leah Swartz, content specialist for millennial research firm FutureCast.
"
578,YUM,"""Now we're seeing those logos take a back seat. (Gen Z wants) to define the brands they're wearing, rather than (let them) define who they are.""
"
579,YUM,"Fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21, Zara and H&M, which have put pressure on traditional apparel brands, aren't safe either.
"
580,YUM,"""Zs have already started to move away from fast fashion — they are highly aware of the labor practices and impact on the world,"" said Gutfreund.
"
581,YUM,"Millennials are the last group to grow up with analog communication, straddling the line between home landlines and Facebook (FB) messages. Millennials tend to look at two to three screens at a time, said Swartz, but Gen Zs multitask across five screens, texting friends and playing tablet games as they watch TV and surf the Web. As attention spans shorten, ""show, don't tell"" seems to be the strategy.
"
582,YUM,"That's why Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell announced a Cinco de Mayo giveaway of its new ""biscuit taco"" via Periscope, Twitter's (TWTR) new live video streaming service. Periscope is getting a lot of Gen Z love, said Swartz.
"
583,YUM,"And in an age of skipping past ads and not-so-subtle product placement, being obvious about the intention to sell things might create a sheen of authenticity.
"
584,YUM,"Gutfreund points to Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) as an example. The cruise line partnered with Google (GOOGL) YouTube channel AwesomenessTV (partly owned by DreamWorks Animation (DWA) to launch ""Royal Crush,"" a teen soap opera set entirely, unabashedly, on a Royal Caribbean ship. One of its latest episodes garnered over 614,000 views and 1,500 fan comments in less than three days.

And by the end of 2017, it plans to remove additional artificial preservatives and additives.These moves will affect more than 95% of Taco Bell core food items across its menu. Taco Bell will remove artificial dye Yellow No. 6 from its cheese sauce and dye Blue No.1 from its dressings and will use real black pepper in its beef instead of ""black pepper flavor,"" according to the AP. But the decision won't affect co-branded ingredients like its Doritos taco shells.""We're part of an exciting time — a food revolution,"" Liz Matthews, Taco Bell's chief food innovation officer, said in a release. ""Today's customers are more curious and interested about food than ever.""Yum's shares were flat at 91.41 in the stock market today.Pizza Hut, which is also owned by Yum Brands, said it would take out artificial colors and preservatives in its food by the end of July. Pizza Hut has already eliminated artificial trans fat and cut the sodium in its pizzas. Yum's KFC unit didn't make an announcement.Yum's move comes after Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which markets itself as serving ""food with integrity,"" said in April that it removed genetically modified ingredients from its food.In March, McDonald's (MCD) said that it would use only chickens raised without antibiotics important to human medicine. Panera Bread (PNRA) has announced it will remove artificial flavors, colors, preservatives and sweeteners from its menu by 2016.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

609,YUM,"Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI) is set to report its Q1 earnings in a market that is suddenly abuzz with the recent IPO of another Southern fried chicken chain and rumors that a burger chain will add a chicken concept.
"
610,YUM,"The IPO involved Bojangles (BOJA), a chicken-and-biscuits chain whose stock priced at 19 on May 8, finished its first day of trading up 25% from that and currently trades near 26.
"
611,YUM,"The burger chain, Shake Shack (SHAK), saw its shares soar more than 8% to a new high in heavy volume Thursday amid chatter that a recent trademark filing for Chicken Shack, first reported by CNBC, might mean that the company will add a new chicken concept.
"
612,YUM,"Into this stew steps Popeyes, which is due to report its first-quarter results after the close on May 27.
"
613,YUM,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to come in at 54 cents a share, up 17% from the prior year. Revenue is seen rising 16% to $81.4 million. If those results hold up, it would mark the fifth straight quarter of double-digit sales and earnings growth for Popeyes.
"
614,YUM,"Like Bojangles, Popeyes offers spicy Southern fried chicken as well as biscuits and familiar sides such as slaw, mashed potatoes, green beans and Cajun-style rice.

615,YUM,"Both companies are headquartered in the South: Popeyes in Atlanta and Bojangles in Charlotte, N.C. Both also compete against a brand you might have heard of: KFC, the fried chicken market's 800-pound gorilla, owned by Yum Brands (YUM).

"
619,YUM,"Papa John's (PZZA) operates more than 4,600 namesake restaurants worldwide. It has operations in all 50 states as well as in 36 countries and territories. The vast majority of its restaurants — more than 80% — are franchised.
"
620,YUM,"With $1.6 billion in annual revenue, a market value of roughly $2.7 billion and a stock price that touched a record high of 68.49 on Tuesday, Papa John's is one of the biggest pizza delivery chains in the world.
"
621,YUM,"Along with Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut, and Little Caesars, Papa John's is one of a small number of chains that dominate a highly fragmented market.
"
622,YUM,"In terms of the number of stores worldwide, Pizza Hut leads the way with more than 13,600. Domino's is next with about 11,700, followed by Papa John's. Privately held Little Caesars has just less than 4,000 units, according to the Pizza Today industry news website.

""We have only had the system in place for a short time, but many stores have already experienced improvement in order speed, accuracy, delivery service and team member training.""
"
636,YUM,"Advances in technology have helped Papa John's maintain steady if unspectacular financial growth in recent years. Another business boost has come from expansion internationally, where almost all of the company's units are franchised.
"
637,YUM,"During Q1, Papa John's international revenue came in at $25.4 million, up 7.6% year over year. The company opened a net total of 35 new international restaurants during the quarter.
"
638,YUM,"Same-store sales at international restaurants climbed 7.7% in Q1 from a year earlier, as opposed to 6.5% comp growth for North American units.
"
639,YUM,"""While domestic same-store sales was the big surprise in 1Q, we continue to get more excited about PZZA's international business, where it is rapidly growing its franchise base of stores, seeing strong same-store sales and improving margins as it repositions its co-owned China business,"" Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle noted in a recent research report.

688,YUM,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
689,YUM,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
690,YUM,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
691,YUM,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
692,YUM,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
693,YUM,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
694,YUM,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
695,YUM,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
696,YUM,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
697,YUM,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
698,YUM,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
699,YUM,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
700,YUM,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
701,YUM,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
702,YUM,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
703,YUM,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
704,YUM,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
705,YUM,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
706,YUM,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
707,YUM,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
708,YUM,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
709,YUM,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
710,YUM,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
711,YUM,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
712,YUM,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
713,YUM,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
714,YUM,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
715,YUM,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
716,YUM,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
717,YUM,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
718,YUM,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
719,YUM,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
720,YUM,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
721,YUM,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
722,YUM,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
723,YUM,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
724,YUM,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
725,YUM,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
726,YUM,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
727,YUM,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
728,YUM,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
729,YUM,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
730,YUM,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
731,YUM,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
732,YUM,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
733,YUM,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
734,YUM,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
735,YUM,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
736,YUM,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
737,YUM,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
738,YUM,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
739,YUM,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
740,YUM,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
741,YUM,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
742,YUM,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
743,YUM,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
744,YUM,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
745,YUM,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"
746,YUM,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance ReportThe $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%.

747,YUM,"How high can Starbucks (SBUX) go? Shares of the coffee-chain powerhouse are just 1% off their all-time high of 49.60 from March 19 and as of Monday afternoon were up more than 18% for the year.
"
748,YUM,"""Starbucks remains one of a shrinking group of consumer large-cap growth stories,"" said David Palmer, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in a research note on Monday, which came with an ""outperform"" rating.
"
749,YUM,"At $73 billion, Starbucks' market capitalization in the restaurant sector is second only to that of McDonald's (MCD), which has had a bumpier stock ride this year.
"
750,YUM,"Based on most recent 12-week channel data, Starbucks has gained share in both packaged coffee and single-serve, Palmer notes. Its share of packaged coffee and K-cups rose to 10.9% and 15.9% from last year's 10.4% and 13.7%, respectively.
"
751,YUM,"Meanwhile, favorable dairy prices and supply-chain efficiencies will likely boost earnings this year, while falling arabica coffee prices will provide a window for locking in lower prices for fiscal 2016, he added.
"
752,YUM,"Starbucks has forecast earnings for its September ending fiscal year of $1.55-$1.57 a share, up from $1.34 in 2014. The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is at the high end of that range, for a 17% gain over last year. They see next year's earnings rising by the same amount.
"
753,YUM,"Palmer sees annual EPS growth of 15%-20% over the next two to three years and revenue growth of at least 10% as Starbucks ""exploits multiple growth drivers.""
"
754,YUM,"Those drivers include expanded lunch offerings under the La Boulange sub-brand, ""handcrafted"" carbonated soft drinks and Teavana brewed teas.
"
755,YUM,"Palmer expects the coffee chain to continue to log ""industry-leading"" same-store sales growth in the Americas, its biggest by revenue and profit. His ""base"" forecast for this year is same-store sales growth of 5% in the U.S.
"
756,YUM,"Results for Starbucks' March ending Q2 will be released on April 23; analysts expect an 18% year-over-year gain to 33 cents per share.
"
757,YUM,"Starbucks is highly rated by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99. McDonald's has a Composite Rating of just 51. Yum Brands (YUM), the third-largest restaurant stock by market cap, has a 65.

Same-store sales grew 16.1% vs. forecasts for 16.3%.""Same-store sales were essentially in line with Street projections, but Chipotle's valuation had built in a same-store sales beat,"" Sterne Agee analyst Lynne Collier told IBD.Chipotle sees a low- to mid-single-digit comps gain for 2015, a big slowdown but in line with its prior guidance, Collier says.Restaurant-level operating margin widened by 100 basis points to 26.6%, but that was below consensus for 27.6%, Collier says.Food costs were 35% of revenue, an increase of 110 basis points, due primarily to higher dairy and beef costs. A menu price hike last summer partially offset that.Chipotle stock fell 7% in late trading. Ahead of results, shares rose 1.6% to 726.63, a record close.Same-store sales growth was driven primarily by an increase in customer visits, as well as the menu price increase.Chipotle Still 'Unmatched'Missing the Street's lofty expectations doesn't change Collier's view of Chipotle.""Their same-store sales numbers are unmatched by anyone in the industry,"" she said. ""They have an incredible opportunity for unit growth in the U.S. and internationally as well.""Chipotle expects 190 to 205 restaurant openings in 2015.Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, is also upbeat. As long as Yum Brands (YUM) and McDonald's (MCD) ""continue to struggle, it means that Chipotle is doing very well.""Diners who used to go to McDonald's and other fast-food chains, he adds, are ""obsessed with Chipotle.""Brand Image Key""There is a fundamental movement across the country toward health and wellness within the fast-food industry that's very much being spurred on by what Chipotle continues to do,"" he said. ""They have no genetically modified organisms (in the food) on their menu. They're way out in front of this social issue that's really a big deal and that nobody else has tackled yet. The ingredients that Chipotle uses are far superior than what you find in McDonald's, Burger King or Wendy's (WEN).""Chipotle recently pulled pork from some locations, saying some suppliers hadn't lived up to its standards for animal treatment. While that could hurt sales, it also bolsters its brand.Sozzi says Chipotle has strong traffic from lunch to dinner.""The lines never seem to ease until the doors are scheduled to close,"" he adds. ""There's no one in fast food that could around the clock have long lines and with people willing to spend $10 to $15 for lunch.""Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) reports Q4 financials Thursday. Super Bowl traffic and sales will not be included. But it was likely a super day for the sports bar and eatery, as both New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks fans gathered at Buffalo Wild Wings eateries to cheer on their teams and chow down on chicken wings, beer and other tasty fare.

"
792,YUM,"Anyone wondering why foreign direct investment in China keeps declining — down last year at the sharpest rate since the 2008 financial crisis, according to the Financial Times — needs to look no further than the Beijing government's invidious treatment of foreign companies trying to do business there.
"
793,YUM,"It's an issue that threatens to undercut what China desperately needs to pull out of its current economic doldrums (its premier, Li Keqiang, has set next year's growth rate at 7%, the lowest target in a decade and a half): more direct investment from successful and innovative non-Chinese firms, especially American firms.Indeed, China's growing hostility to American businesses represents a major stumbling block to further economic ties between the two countries. A survey last fall by the American Chamber of Commerce in China found that 60% of American businesses feel less welcome on the mainland, and 49% say that the Chinese government has been singling out foreign-owned firms for adverse treatment.The battle between Chinese authorities and Google, and the Chinese allegations that Apple has been price-gouging and spying on Chinese citizens using its iPhones, are well-known — as is the fact that Apple made the charges go away by agreeing to store data from its Chinese iPhone users in China, which will allow the government to spy on them instead.But not many are aware of the even more egregious case of OSI, a food-processing firm that spent $750 million building up its Husi Food unit over two decades to serve McDonald's and other fast-food restaurants in China.This is no fly-by-night operation. The American-based firm set up the first food processing plant in Beijing in 1991, followed by plants in Langfang and Shanghai. In 2008, it started to provide high-quality food products to Yum Brands, whose Chinese division services 4,800 KFCs and 1,600 Pizza Huts across the country.Then suddenly, last summer, the city's Food and Drug Administration arrested six workers in its Shanghai plant and closed the plant. A video on government-owned Dragon TV, showing workers making chicken nuggets and patties from expired meat, triggered the action.OSI officials, however, have a very different account of what happened. They argue that the ""workers"" were in fact Dragon TV reporters (according to Reuters, a worker at a Shanghai employment agency actually saw an undercover reporter trying to get a job at the Husi factory).The company further alleges that the reporters masquerading as employees even threw meat on the floor while Dragon's cameras recorded them picking it up and re-using it.In any case, six employees were arrested and remain in jail, even though no formal charges have been brought. Another 350 employees in the Shanghai plant were laid off.Meanwhile, OSI Group's stock took a severe hit, as did Yum Brands. So did Husi Food's reputation. Indeed, the McDonald's China division has dropped Husi as a supplier.OSI has been working hard to get itself back into what had been one of its most important growth markets, but Shanghai authorities are determined to play hardball.Although OSI Chairman Sheldon Lavin issued a public statement that what happened at the plant was ""terribly wrong, and I am appalled,"" the general feeling is that OSI and Husi Food have been railroaded.When Chinese authorities said in January that their investigation was leading them to order the destruction of ""questionable products"" recalled from Husi Food, OSI quickly pointed out that the recall had been entirely voluntary and that the products being destroyed never met the China Food and Drug Administration's definition of ""questionable products.""In short, the OSI battle is looking like the war of intimidation that foreign firms all too often face in doing business in China these days, from charges of price gouging to food tampering.Most give in and drop their prices or submit to the charges and pay a fine. They are aware that state-run regulatory agencies can trigger an avalanche of bad publicity that can wreck a foreign-owned business in a matter of days, as happened to Husi — and run up costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars, as happened to OSI.China law expert Dan Harris recently testified to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission on the increasingly chilly investment climate in China. He pointed out that many U.S. firms face unfair competition by following rules concerning employment and taxes that Chinese firms routinely ignore.In the end, however, the war on business is hurting China more than the U.S.From 2002 to 2012, China was the country where most international business executives wanted to do direct foreign investment. In 2013, it lost top place to the United States; in 2014, confidence in China slid even further.According to the South China Morning Post, nearly one in four American companies planning to invest $250 million or more in China have dropped or postponed plans, even though most still see the country as a future growth market and are eager to do business there.If China intends to grow out of its enormous debt problems, it will need foreign investment. Yet by biting the hand that feeds it, in OSI's case almost literally, it's only hurting its own future. Herman is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

836,YUM,"""Not all their consumers are that cost-conscious. They want the flavor and the convenience.""McDonald's didn't try to supersize its disappointing third-quarter results Tuesday, with its CEO saying the fast food giant must ""fundamentally change."" But winning over new diners without alienating its existing base won't be easy.The world's No. 1 restaurant operator earned $1.35 excluding a 26-cent tax-related charge for an unfavorable foreign court ruling. That's down 11% vs. a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.37.Revenue fell 4.6% to $6.99 billion, below views of $7.18 billion.U.S. and global same-store sales fell 3.3% vs. a year earlier, reflecting a decline in guest traffic, meat supplier issues in Asia and blowback from tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine. Slowing economies in China and Europe didn't help.McDonald's (MCD) stock fell 0.6% to 91.01 after hitting 89.70 intraday.President and CEO Don Thompson didn't attempt to spin the results, saying they ""reflect a significant decline from a year ago"" and promising ""decisive action to fundamentally change the way we approach our business.""More Local Tastes PlannedThompson stressed plans for more menu choices, more local autonomy in the U.S. to cater to customers' tastes, and modernizing decor and technology.McDonald's has introduced Apple (AAPL) Pay mobile payment technology at 14,000 U.S. locations and added self-order kiosks in France, Australia and elsewhere, he said.The burger giant also launched an advertising campaign letting people make fun of and ask what's in McDonald's food, which many young adults see as unhealthy compared to fast-casual fare from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA). (Chipotle shares fell 7% Tuesday despite reporting blowout earnings late Monday, mostly on concerns that growth must slow.)But raising the quality of McDonald's food would hit customers in their wallets.""It is very hard to do that without raising the prices,"" said Lynne Collier, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach. ""It's not going to be an easy fix.""McDonald's prices already rose 3% in the 12 months to June 30.Low-income consumers, a mainstay of fast-food eateries, were hit hard by the Great Recession and continue to struggle amid a sluggish recovery.Yum, Coke Also StruggleYum Brands (YUM), parent of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, earlier this month issued disappointing quarterly earnings and full-year guidance. Much of that reflects continued fallout from China's meat scandal on KFC there. But the fast-food operator also has struggled to win over U.S. customers with higher-quality fare.Coca-Cola (KO) shares suffered their biggest intraday loss since 2008, falling 6% to 40.68 after reporting soft Q3 earnings Tuesday. The soda king, like Yum and McDonald's, is coping with an economic slowdown overseas and health concerns at home.McDonald's remains a well-liked dividend stock with a long-track record as one of the great U.S. business success stories.""They are a powerful cash flow generator,"" said Efraim Levy, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ.

878,YUM,"The improved industry trends follow ""very weak and volatile"" same-store-sales trends of both June and July, Derrington noted.

994,YUM,"Although investors worry about less-robust growth in China, several U.S. corporate giants hailed Q1 demand in the world's second-largest economy.China has proven to be a strong engine for Apple (AAPL), with its new partner China Mobile (CHL) helping push fiscal Q2 iPhone sales to more than 43 million, far more than expected. The $9.2 billion that China added to Apple's coffers comprised nearly 25% of the company's total quarterly revenue, up 13% from a year earlier.Caterpillar (CAT), the giant construction-equipment manufacturer, has struggled with a global commodity slump that's hit mining-equipment demand. Overall sales were flat — actually ending a five-quarter decline.But China sales rose 30% vs. a year earlier. CEO Doug Oberhelman credits increased dealer deliveries and the favorable impact of dealer inventory changes.Economic growth in China of around 7.5% this year ""should support improvements in the machine industry and increase commodity demand.""Yum! Brands (YUM), parent of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurant chains, says that its China-division sales grew 17% year over year, with restaurant margins increasingly almost 7% and operating profit up 80%. Yum adds that it expects to open at least 700 restaurants in China this year.The company is seeing improvement from a year earlier, when a chicken health scare scared jittery diners and investors. CEO David Novak cited KFC in China as ""the most significant driver"" of Yum's strong bounce back in the first quarter.Global casino giant Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped Q1 forecasts Thursday, with strong growth in earnings and revenue driven in part by Sands Macau, its majority-owned unit in China's gaming mecca. Sands Macau revenue climbed 35%, and net income rose 66%. More than 17 million visits to its Macau facilities during Q1 delivered a record $939.8 million of adjusted property EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), said CEO Sheldon Adelson in a statement.Starbucks (SBUX) saw net revenues in its China/Asia-Pacific region grow 24% year over year to $265.3 million during its fiscal Q2, driven in part by nearly 700 stores opening over the past year. Comparable store sales were up 7%.United Technologies (UTX) says that new equipment orders at its Otis Elevator unit increased 9% from Q1 '13, led by 27% growth in China.McDonald's (MCD), which reports lackluster Q1 earnings — blamed on lower U.S. same-store sales and unusually severe winter weather throughout much of the United States — still reports solid sales in China.

RBC also raised its price target to $87 from $85, saying it expected sales in China to rise in the second half of the year as avian flu fears subsided.But Wells Fargo said in its client note Wednesday that recent reports indicated at least 95 cases of the H7N9 avian flu strain had been found in China this month vs. 144 for all of 2013.The note projected ""at least a modest avian flu head wind"" impacting Yum earnings results, but the analysts kept their market perform rating on the stock.The report may also raise red flags for McDonald's (MCD), which sells chicken products at outlets in China.Yum, which will release Q4 results Feb. 3, saw its shares drop 2.6% on the stock market today.

Its stock price hit an all-time high 44.01 on March 31 and has consolidated since in sync with a market correction.Among other large meat producers, highly rated Hormel Foods (HRL) was unchanged. Hormel sports a 92 IBD Composite Rating, which means it has outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Fresh and frozen chicken products-maker Sanderson Farms (SAFM) climbed more than 2%. It boasts a 97 Composite Rating.Prepared- and fresh-chicken company Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) jumped 6% on bullish comments by CEO Bill Lovette during an earnings call with analysts Thursday.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar

1067,YUM,"The expression ""you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink it"" illustrates a key point: Effective leadership is proportional to inspiring willing and engaged followers. ""As a leader, you'll never accomplish anything big if you try to do it alone. Your role is to unleash the power of people working together,"" David Novak, CEO of Yum Brands (YUM) and author of ""Taking People With You,"" told IBD."" Tips on doing just that:
"
1068,YUM,"• Share the outlook. Do your people know what success looks like for your business? So asks Erika Andersen, author of ""Leading So People Will Follow.""
"
1069,YUM,"Tell your people about your vision of success, she said: ""What will your business or group look, feel and act like two years from now, or three? What will you be focused on and accomplishing? People want leaders who can articulate and guide them toward a compelling and inclusive future.""
"
1070,YUM,"• Be resolute. No leader ""ever accomplishes much by starting out with the 'maybe' attitude,"" Novak said. ""Successful leaders recognize the first responsibility is to define reality and create a shared vision.""
"
1071,YUM,"• Provide tools. Novak, whose firm oversees Pizza Hut and KFC, says leaders must back their plan by putting the right resources in place.
"
1072,YUM,"""This says to your team you really care about getting it done vs. giving it lip service,"" he said.
"
1073,YUM,"• Be courageous. Ineffective leaders often evade or blame others rather than taking responsibility. ""When you make a mistake, do you apologize?,"" Andersen said. ""The next time you stumble, say you're sorry and what you'll do differently going forward."" This creates loyalty and followers.
"
1074,YUM,"• Demonstrate generosity. Do it with more than money.
"
1075,YUM,"Try giving others credit for a job well done, Andersen said: ""Reflect on how you handle those things, and think about specific ways you can share that wealth.""
"
1076,YUM,"• Show trust. ""Don't make promises you can't keep,"" Andersen said. ""Don't talk about one employee to others. Don't shade the truth. Remember that when you're the leader, people are watching everything you do to see if it lines up with what you say.""
"
1077,YUM,"• Listen and act. Novak said hearing those you lead is ""the most powerful way to motivate your people."" Take what they tell you seriously, or they will lack commitment.
"
1078,YUM,"• Know your people. By getting inside the heads of those you lead, ""you'll have the best chance of motivating them to help you achieve big things,"" Novak said. ""I always ask: 'What perceptions, habits and beliefs do I need to change, build or reinforce to take people with me?'""
"
1079,YUM,"• Define your culture. People want to work in organizations that inspire them, Novak says. How a leader conducts himself greatly influences that.
"
1080,YUM,"He asked: ""What sort of values are you projecting? What kind of atmosphere are you creating? Does it motivate your team to come to work every day feeling supported and appreciated?""
"
1081,YUM,"Novak said there's a ""tangible difference in results between people working toward a goal because they're being paid to do it vs. working toward a goal because it is a rewarding experience.""
"
1082,YUM,"• Be complete. Human beings are wired from ancient times to look for certain qualities in leaders, Andersen said: ""On an almost instinctive level, we still take that decision very seriously. We need to see those time-tested qualities in a leader before we'll fully sign up.""

The shift to refranchising substantially boosted the company’s operating margin and earnings per share and the trend is expected to continue.Total revenues of $1.58 billion were down 16.4% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.61 billion. The decline in total revenues was mainly due to decrease in company sales as an impact of its continued strategic refranchising initiative. The reduction in ownership through refranchising is an overhang on near-term revenues.Segmental PerformanceYum! Brands now reports under three segments – KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.KFC revenues were $814 million, down 11.8% on a year-over-year basis. Comps at the KFC division increased 3% compared with the year-ago quarter’s rise of 2% and the previous quarter’s increase of 4%.Segment operating margin was up 6% year over year owing to refranchising and same-store sales growth.At Pizza Hut, revenues were $234 million, down 24.3% on a year-over-year basis. Comps were up 1% against the year-ago quarter’s decline of 3% and preceding quarter’s increase of 1%.Segment operating margin was up 2.9% year over year, attributable to refranchising, offset by higher franchise and license costs.Taco Bell revenues were $531 million, down 18.8% from the year-ago quarter. Comps were up 2%, which compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter and prior-quarter growth of 3%.Segment operating margin was up 3.8% year over year, attributable to refranchising and same-store sales growth.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus  Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus | Yum! Brands, Inc.

1108,YUM,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) has been grappling with declining sales for quite some time. A challenging sales environment in the U.S. restaurant space has resulted in constant deceleration of comps whereas high costs associated with restaurant operations have been potential headwinds for the company.However, Jack in the Box recently reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings of $1.23 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16% and increased nearly 15% year over year on margin improvement, driven by refranchising.Notably, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past year. While the industry gained 13.1%, Jack in the Box’s shares fell 7.6%. Moreover, earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 have gone down 11.2% over the past two months, reflecting ongoing pessimism in the stock’s prospects.Declining Comps Pose ConcernOwing to soft consumer demand, the company’s sales have come under pressure. Comps at Jack in the Box company stores inched up 0.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s rise of 0.6%. Same-store sales at franchised stores dipped 0.3%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 3.9% in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, system-wide same-store sales fell 0.2% against a rise of 3.1% in the comparable period last year.Qdoba generated a net loss of $0.6 million in the quarter against net earnings of $1.4 million in the prior-year quarter.High Costs Amid Stiff Competition is ChallengingJack in the Box has been bearing the brunt of high costs associated with restaurant operations. Costs related to marketing initiatives, unit expansion and opening of catering call centers are keeping the company’s profits under pressure. Moreover, the company is also shouldering higher labor costs due to the implementation of The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which is expected to have an adverse impact on margins, going forward.Meanwhile, American dining brands are keen on expanding in the fast-growing emerging markets. While several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened outlets in the emerging markets; Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front.Thus, limited international presence might be a big disadvantage for the company and hurt its competitive position. Moreover, the company is experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.Franchise Business & Strategic Sell Out of Qdoba are RespitesJack in the Box restaurants are currently 89% franchised, which the company plans to increase to around 95% by the end of fiscal 2018. We believe, franchising a large chunk of its system will lower its general and administrative expenses and thereby boost earnings. Moreover, over the long term, it would generate a higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements. This would also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholder return.Also, given poor restaurant level execution at the company’s legendary Qdoba chain, management made a strategic decision to sell the brand. In the fiscal first quarter, the company signed an agreement to sell Qdoba to Apollo Global Management, LLC. The transaction, however, is expected to close by April 2018.We believe that by selling the brand, the company will free itself from the burden of operating under two business models, which have been more of a drag in the recent past.Zacks RankJack in the Box carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

1109,YUM,"Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 5. In the preceding quarter, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping for a positive earnings surprise from Costco in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $2.01, reflecting a year-over-year increase of over 13%. We observe that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $41,739 million, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.Model Predicts Lower ProbabilityOur proven model does not conclusively show that Costco is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Costco has an Earnings ESP of -0.73%. Notably, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Costco Wholesale Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Costco Wholesale Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayCostco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on its scale and quality of merchandise offered. A differentiated product range enables the company to ensure an upscale shopping experience for its members, resulting in market share gains. Moreover, Costco continues to maintain a healthy membership renewal rate. Further, it is gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, U.K., Mexico, Taiwan and Korea. We are also encouraged by the company’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. However, stiff competition and cautious consumer spending remain causes of concern.3 Stocks with High Probability to Beat EstimateHere are three stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Constellation Brands, Inc.

1110,YUM,"As New York and Paris Fashion Weeks have showcased the best fashion trends to look forward to next spring and summer, one of the most, ahem, interesting collections debuted in Los Angeles: fast fashion giant Forever 21 and fast food leader Taco Bell, owned by Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), are collaborating on a limited-edition fashion line.Set to launch in the U.S. on October 11, the Forever 21 x Taco Bell collection will demonstrate a ""unique spin on traditional fashion labelling,” and the line will include tops, bodysuits, and cropped hoodies for ladies, and sweatshirts, hoodies, and anorak jackets for guys. The clothes will feature some of Taco Bell’s iconic graphics, as well as pops of color inspired by both brands.Forever 21 x Taco Bell will be previewed the night before its launch in downtown LA’s fashion district; curious shoppers can also follow the hashtag #F21xTacoBell on social media. This is true fast fashion form, when design and production are expedited to bring emerging trends to the retail market as quickly—and cheaply—as possible. Other fast fashion houses include H&M and Zara.“Food, like fashion, is driven by trends and culture,” said Linda Chang, Forever 21 Vice President of Merchandising in a statement. “Merging fashion and food in this collection gives our customers a new way to experience both our brands.”Additionally, the collection will be available internationally through Forever 21’s website.Image Credit: Forever 21/Taco BellWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1111,YUM,"A small handful of multinational conglomerates seemingly own almost every major consumer packaged goods brand, food company, or restaurant chain—yet some big-name brands and firms have managed to survive, sometimes for decades, all on their own.Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Unilever (UN  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), and an array other firms dominate consumer-facing industries, snatching up brands left and right. The reach of these multibillion-dollar companies is greater than ever, especially as some of the largest companies begin to join forces in order to compete long-term on a grand scale.But there will always be companies that avoid being swallowed up by brands for various reasons, especially if their stocks are performing well and their bottom lines continue to grow.Now let’s look at four companies that are almost certainly household names throughout the U.S. that many people might find hard to believe are still their own publicly traded firms.Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. Little tiny Tootsie Rolls have been staples in Halloween baskets for decades. But the candy company’s success might make investors think it got scooped up by a candy giant, such as Mars, years ago. On the contrary, Tootsie Roll has turned into a bit of a powerhouse itself.The company now boasts an array of different candy brands—from Blow Pop and Caramel Apple Pops to Dots and even Junior Mints. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, shares of Tootsie Roll have climbed steadily in recent years. The candy power’s stock now sits just a few dollars below its all-time high of $40.44 per share and has popped from under $20 a share just over five years ago.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report)Like Tootsie Roll, Clorox has turned itself into a bit of a conglomerate. The cleaning company’s brands include Green Works, Pine-Sol, Glad, 409, and others. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, the company is certainly not small and wouldn’t be easily acquired, but with giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) out there lurking, it is a testament to the company’s strength that it still stands on its own.The company, which has been around for more than 100 years, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but earned an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. Shares of Clorox have soared over the last decade and have gained 9.40% since the start of the year.Nathan's Famous, Inc. The host of the famous 4th of July hot dog eating contest has been churning out cased-meats since 1916. Nathan’s Famous is a small cap company with a market cap of around $310 million, and it has seen its stock price do a 360-degree turn in just the last two years. Nathan’s stock sat at an all-time high of over $81 per share in 2015 before it sank to $30 a share. Shares then climbed back slowly and now rest at around $74.The company owns a line of grocery store dogs, burgers, fries, and pickles, as well as a chain of restaurants, yet it has not been scarfed up by big chains such as Yum! Brands.Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report)This iconic maker of Twinkies, Ho Hos, and others screams Americana. It is hard to believe that Hostess Brands has not been bought by a big CPG company, but, it in fact, just recently went public.Hostess Brands was almost bankrupt less than a decade ago, then two investment firms bought the company out of liquidation in 2013. The company then went public in 2016. With a market cap of $1.78 billion, the newly public snack maker’s stock price has fared well. Shares of the company that has been around since before the Great Depression gained a modest 6.15% since the start of the year, but Hostess Brands is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1112,YUM,"Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) has been losing sheen of late. Although other pizza bigwigs are gaining from a flourishing market, Papa John’s revenue trend has been showing a decline.The company’s unsatisfactory performance in the first quarter of 2018 further raised investors’ skepticism surrounding the company. A look at Papa John’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an unimpressive run on the bourses in the past year. Shares of the company have lost 29.6% compared with the industry’s collective decline of 0.4% in the same time frame. Moreover, over the past two months, earnings estimates for the current year have been revised downward by 5.3%, thereby reflecting analysts’ doubt surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.Sluggish Comps to Affect Overall Top LineDespite being a forerunner in the U.S. restaurant space, Papa John’s is unable to revive sales lately. Over the past couple of quarters, soft comps performance has been a major concern for investors. In first-quarter 2018, domestic company-owned restaurant comps fell 6.1%, following a decline of 4.7% in the preceding quarter. Moreover, comps at North America franchised restaurants were down 5%, after witnessing a decline of 3.5% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, for 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $1.7 billion, mirroring a decline of 4.4% from 2017.High Costs Likely to Continue Denting EarningsApart from high labor costs associated with restaurant operations, Papa John’s has been bearing the brunt of high delivery and insurance costs for the company-owned restaurants. Despite greater focus on franchising, the company’s earnings are still pressurized. Increased costs for technology and marketing investments might continue to hurt earnings of the company, going ahead.In the last reported quarter, Papa John’s earnings fell 35.1% year over year due to weak operating results. The company expects earnings to decline in the range of 4.5-12% for 2018. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for 2018 earnings is likely to fall 11.1% from 2017.Lackluster ROEPapa John’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. The company’s ROE of negative 90.3% compares unfavorably with ROE of 6.1% for the industry, reflecting the fact that it is less efficient in using shareholders’ funds.Competitive Environment Hurts Papa John’sA broader look at the pizza space reveals that it has been growing rapidly, overshadowing independent restaurants. Papa John’s, however, is unable to strategize its business and utilize the favorable industry scenario. Consequently, it continues to face competitive pressure from pizza bigwigs like Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut. Papa John’s profits are likely to remain pressurized, going ahead.Meanwhile the pizza space is growing by leaps and bounds. Per The Statistics Portal report, United States sees approximately $33 billion of consumer spending in the quick-service pizza category every year. Out of the total, roughly $15 billion constitutes take-out pizza services, followed by pizza delivery of around $10 billion. Notably, per unit sales for chain pizzerias are nearly 70% higher than that of the independent restaurants. According to Euromonitor, pizza chains grew 5.8% in 2017, while independent restaurants recorded a 2.7% sales increase. The PMQ Pizza Magazine estimates a total of $45.1 billion sales for 2018, out of which $26.6 billion will come from the top 50 chains in the country.Zacks Rank & A Restaurant Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Papa John’s carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). However, a better-ranked stock in the restaurant industry is Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Dine Brands’ earnings for 2018 are projected to increase 23.1% year over year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1113,YUM,"Yum China Holdings, Inc. (YUMC  -  Free Report), the largest restaurant company in China, is gaining solid momentum backed by a strong brand recognition. Following the separation from its parent company, Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), Yum China has been leveraging the power of its two most important brands — KFC and Pizza Hut — to drive long-term growth.The company’s shares have gained 0.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.3%.  Earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have also gone up 20.7% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the future earnings potential of the company. Also, Yum China surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 6.74%.However, increased costs from labor, rent and operational initiatives may hurt the company’s margins. Also, a limited franchised business model remains a concern.Initiatives to Drive the Top LineYum China is focused on relentless unit growth of its restaurants in order to drive incremental sales. In the first quarter of 2018, the company opened 203 new restaurants and remodeled 125. The company currently possesses five restaurants per one million people in China, which is expected to grow to 15 stores per million.Moreover, there is ample potential to grow the restaurant base to triple its current size, given the continued growth of the middle-class discretionary spending. In fact, the company increased its new store-opening target from the range of 550-600 to the band of 600-650 in 2018, reflecting 9% unit growth.Another riveting growth potential of Yum China resides in its continual menu innovation to encourage top-line growth. KFCs extraordinary performance is attributable to greater sales of menu offerings like crayfish burger, stuffed chicken wing and spicy chicken burger. Apart from such consumer-preferred food items, the company also offers signature menus for Chinese New Year.Yum China is also serving coffee across its restaurants and expanding the dessert category. In the first quarter of 2018, Matcha chocolate ice cream was launched and more new flavors are lined up for launch this year.Yum China holds a leadership position in the Chinese restaurant space when it comes to delivery, mobile order and pay, and loyalty membership. The company is increasingly shifting toward digital and content marketing to expand its customer base.In the first quarter of 2018, delivery represented 14% of the sales, up 39% year over year. More than 3,300 stores across 917 cities offer delivery services. The company also expanded its delivery for breakfast and late-night dayparts. Meanwhile, the KFC Prime delivery, launched in the fourth quarter of 2017, is expected to reap additional benefits. The service offers its members with unlimited free delivery for 30 days at a subscription fee of 18 yen.Coming to loyalty membership, Yum Brands created a robust loyalty program that has more than 120 million members combining both the brands. Backed by delivery and digital sales, the company’s loyalty membership increased at a high double digit year over year for both the brands in the first quarter of 2018.Increasing Costs & Lesser Focus on Franchising HurtYum China is facing structural high cost of labor and rentals. Apart from wage inflation, the company is also bearing additional costs stemming from promotion, menu innovation and technological novelty. In order to curb labor cost, the company is increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is again expected to curb its margins in the near term. Also, costs related to transactions and franchises are expected to gear up in the near future.Notably, in the first quarter of 2018, total costs and expenses increased 12% year over year, due to a 20% increase in restaurant expenses, 18% rise in general and administrative expenses and 12% hike in franchise expenses. Restaurant margin in the quarter came in at 17.9%, reflecting a 250-basis point decline from the year-ago quarter. The fall in restaurant margin was due to the investment in product upgrades, and promotions at Pizza Hut and its sales deleverage.Also, unlike its major peers like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report), the majority of Yum China restaurants are company owned. This makes the restaurants susceptible to increased expenses. Hence, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, by not signing enough franchise agreements, is unable to put the burden of costs onto the franchisees and is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.

1114,YUM,"Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) is currently one of the world's largest fast-food chains, with more than 14,800 stores in over 85 international markets. The company’s operational advantages, given its market share and scale, along with consistent focus on innovation, execution of growth strategy and digital initiatives should help the stock maintain its solid performance in the quarters ahead. Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add this stock to your portfolio.In a year’s time, Domino’s shares have gained 20.4%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 0.8%. Also, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of the trailing eight quarters. Additionally, Domino’s 2018 earnings estimates have moved up 0.2% over the past 30 days. This testifies the unwavering confidence of analysts in the company’s future earnings potential. The company’s revenues have also topped the consensus mark in seven out of the preceding eight quarters.Domino’s currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a growth score of A. Back-tested results show that stocks with Growth Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 handily outperform others. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sales-Building Efforts to Drive RevenuesDomino’s continues boosting sales through regular limited-time offers (LTO). Over the past few quarters, Domino’s remodeling efforts have gained momentum, leading to sales improvement. The company is on track to convert all its restaurants to the “Pizza Theater” prototype that offers a comfy lobby, open-area viewing of the food preparation process and the ability to track carryout orders electronically on a lobby screen. Domino’s remodeling initiative is thus expected to continue enhancing its potential as a brand and augment guest experience.In order to drive traffic and in turn revenues, this pizza giant has been ramping up investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering. In 2017, the company's AnyWare suite of ordering platforms that allows customers to order through apps such as Google Home, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) Messenger, Amazon Echo and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), and also via a Pizza emoji on text, grew significantly.The company is also committed toward maintaining investments and its lead in the digital arena, which should boost sales apart from enhancing its competitive position. In fact, Domino’s is expected to become the leading pizza company on digital advancement, overtaking Pizza Hut that operates under Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report).Moreover, the company reaffirmed its three-to-five-year outlook, which hints at global retail sales improvement between 8% and 12%, and domestic and international comps growth of 3% and 6%, respectively. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for 2018 sales is pegged at $3.5 billion, suggesting 24.5% year-over-year growth.Franchising Strategy Safeguards EarningsDomino’s has a wide franchise network, both domestically and internationally. Reducing its ownership of restaurants and focusing more on refranchising minimize the company’s capital requirements, and facilitate earnings per share growth. In addition, free cash flow continues to grow, thus allowing reinvestment for increasing its brand recognition and shareholders’ return.Moreover, Domino’s is less affected by food inflation as a result of franchising compared to other pizza companies with global operations. Meanwhile, the company’s recapitalization deal also makes cash available for potential special dividend and share repurchases, depending upon the board’s approval.For 2018, the consensus estimate for Domino's earnings shows an impressive year-over-year growth of 53.8%. The company’s earnings are also expected to grow at an annualized rate of 19.1% over the next three-to-five years.Solid International ExpansionSince Domino’s earns a chunk of its revenues from outside the United States, the company remains committed to accelerate its presence in the high-growth international markets to boost business. Meanwhile, the company’s international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets, driven by exceptional unit-level economics.Notably, the first quarter of 2018 marked the 97th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in its international business. It’s all four geographic regions reported positive comps, with Americas and Asia-Pacific gaining the most. Domino’s opened 829 net new stores in the international markets in 2017 and 79 in first-quarter 2018.Favorable Industry ScenarioThe U.S. quick-service pizza space is growing by leaps and bounds. Overshadowing independent restaurants, the pizza bigwigs are continuously strategizing to attract more customers. Per The Statistics Portal report, the United States sees approximately $33 billion of consumer spending in the quick-service pizza category every year. Out of the total, roughly $15 billion constitutes take-out pizza services, followed by pizza delivery of around $10 billion.Per unit sales for chain pizzerias are nearly 70% higher than that of the independent restaurants. According to Euromonitor, pizza chains grew 5.8% in 2017, while independent restaurants recorded a 2.7% sales rise. The PMQ Pizza Magazine estimates a total of $45.1 billion sales in 2018, out of which $26.6 billion will come from the top 50 chains in the country. Independent restaurants are likely to rake in around $18.5 billion.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The upside reflects stronger operating performance and G&A savings.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a positive impact of 4 cents per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, adjusted earnings exclude the impact of a net tax cost associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.McDonald’s plans to invest $2.4 billion in 2018, mostly toward accelerating deployment of its Experience of the Future in the United States, which focuses on adding technology to its eateries.Shares of McDonald’s have gained 42.5% over the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 22% rally.McDonald's Corporation Price McDonald's Corporation price | McDonald's Corporation QuoteRevenues Decline but Global Comps Improve Revenues of $5.34 billion beat the consensus mark of $5.26 billion by 1.5% but declined 11.4% year over year.

However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants increased 12.2% to $2.67 billion.Global comps grew 5.5%, supported by encouraging guest count across segments. This marked the tenth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Meanwhile, comps growth was slightly lower than the last quarter’s increase of 6%.Solid Comps Across SegmentsU.S.: Comps grew 4.5% in the fourth quarter driven by solid performance of core menu items under the McPick 2 platform and beverage value, as well as robust consumer response to new Buttermilk Crispy Tenders and delivery.

Continued momentum in the United Kingdom and Canada along with upbeat results across all other markets drove comps.Operating income was up 14%, including the impact of foreign currency translation.

1118,YUM,"BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of its sixth restaurant in Maryland. Located in Hagerstown, the restaurant seats roughly 230 guests and features wide-ranging menu. Notably, this is the second unit opening in 2018 and the company also has plans to open its third outlet in June at Albany.Notably, for quite some time now, BJ’s Restaurants is trying to fend off competition and a difficult sales environment by focusing more on sales-building initiatives. To this end, the company had decided to put off new openings for some time but did not completely refrain from it, as a slowdown in unit growth can potentially dent the restaurant’s sales.Slowdown in Unit Growth to Aid Margins but Dent RevenuesAfter reducing the number of restaurant openings to 10 in fiscal 2017 compared with 17 in fiscal 2016, the company plans to open just four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018. The reduction in new openings is due to the company’s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives.We believe that this particular strategy of slowing down its unit growth may turn out to be favorable for the company, as it would provide some margin momentum and maximize its free cash flow. These when combined with the company’s conservative balance sheet would provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases, going forward.However, the slowdown in the company’s development plan might somewhat dent its sales growth. As it is, the company’s expanse in the global market is limited. While several other restaurant bigwigs like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) are capitalizing on the emerging market potential, BJ’s Restaurants seems to be slow on this front. We believe that the company needs to spread its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cutthroat competition in the saturated domestic market.What's the Key Growth Driver?BJ’s Restaurants implemented several major sales building initiatives that have contributed positively to the company’s first-quarter sales. With increased focus on productivity and efficiency, along with a plan of balanced restaurant opening, the company is further heading toward near and long-term operating success.The company’s key needle-moving initiatives continued to drive substantial revenues in the first quarter of 2018. In 2017, the restaurant crew mastered advanced cooking methods and also became skillful in taking orders via hand-held ordering tablets. In fact, results from these initiatives have been positive so far.Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2017, off-premise sales increased to 7% of the company’s revenues compared with its industry average of nearly 10-11%. Further, in the first quarter of 2018, BJ’s Restaurants’ off-premise business grew more than 30%, constituting 7.5% of the company’s revenues and is 150 basis points (bps) higher than the prior-year quarter. Looking at this trend, management believes that there is a tremendous opportunity for further building the off-premise part of business.Meanwhile, BJ’s Restaurants’ extensive focus on refining and streamlining its menu is the key driver for improved traffic. The company’s slow-roasted menu, launched in 2017, has become a huge success. It has significantly boosted average check, with high incident rates.Owing to such efforts, BJ’s Restaurants’ shares have returned 13.7% over the past year, outpacing the industry’s rally of 1.5%.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1120,YUM,"Yum! Brands, Inc.’s (YUM  -  Free Report) board of directors recently approved a 20% rise in quarterly cash dividend to 36 cents per share of common stock from 30 cents. It will be distributed on Mar 9, to shareholders of record on the closing of business as on Feb 14.Shares of the company have rallied 31.2% in the past year, outpacing the industry’s gain of 22.3%.Dividend Hike to Lure ShareholdersNotably, Yum! Brands raised its quarterly dividend despite a 33% year-over-year decline in net income in the first nine months of 2017. This underscores management’s plan to lure investors with attractive returns. In fact, over the next three years, the company is committed to returning an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.Refranchising to Enhance Shareholders’ ValueThe company has adopted a de-risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising. This reduces capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Refranchising also boosts free cash flow, facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholders’ return.In third-quarter 2017, Yum! Brands increased its franchise ownership to 95% and is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised. In fact, it expects to possess less than 1,000 company-owned restaurants by the end of 2018.Management expects to cut capex to about $100 million by 2019, increase free cash flow conversion to 100% and also reduce General and Administrative (G&A) expenditure by approximately $300 million (or 1.7% of system sales). Resultantly, earnings are expected to be at least $3.75 in 2019.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderYum!

1121,YUM,"Leading fire-grilled chicken chain, El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report), currently has more than 470 restaurants in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. The company is looking to further expand its footprint in key markets through a mix of franchisee and company-owned stores.In fact, El Pollo Loco has opened 18 restaurants year to date, with another seven slated to open in the coming weeks.On Sep 21, the company opened its latest 2,660-square-foot outlet in Scottsdale, AZ. Located at 15255 N. 64th St., the resturant can accommodate about 60 guests.The outlet features the brand’s new Vision Design and has an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of its signature dish. Also, it marks El Pollo Loco’s third restaurant in Scottsdale and 24th in the greater Phoenix area.However, despite vigorous domestic expansion, El Pollo Loco loses out in terms of international presence. While other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) pursue aggressive global expansion policies, El Pollo Loco seems to be weak on this front.Additionally, shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date. The stock has been down 13.9%, as against the industry’s growth of 8.3%. Moreover, earnings estimates for current quarter and current year have moved down 5.3% and 2.9%, respectively, over the past 60 days.A challenging sales environment, given lower consumer spending in the U.S. restaurant space, remains a potent headwind to the company’s top line. Meanwhile, higher costs related to sales initiatives and wage rate increases may continue to hurt profits too.Nevertheless, this chicken chain's continuous expansion plans are anticipated to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Going forward, El Pollo Loco expects to drive growth through a number of initiatives such as its authentic advertising campaign, the recently launched mobile and online ordering app, loyalty program and delivery system.

1123,YUM,"Jack in the Box Inc.’s (JACK  -  Free Report) premium and value offerings, along with the increased focus on menu innovation, franchising and delivery are key growth drivers. The strategic sell-out of the Qdoba brand is also expected to reap benefits, going forward.However, decelerating comps growth, rising costs, along with the stiff competition in breakfast and lunch day parts raise caution. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company’s earnings and revenues not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined 7% and 21.1%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. Also, system wide comps declined 0.1% in the first quarter while franchise comps dipped 0.2%.Moreover, shares of Jack in the Box have declined 23.7% in the past year, widely underperforming the industry’s growth of 1.3%. Earnings estimates have also been revised downward over the past month, reflecting analysts’ concern surrounding the future earnings potential of the company.Innovation in Menu & Delivery Services to Drive SalesJack in the Box, being one of the largest hamburger chains, makes regular menu innovations and also provides limited period offers (LPO) to drive long-term customer loyalty. With focused menu inventions around premium products like Buttery Jack Burgers, the company witnessed increased comps in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. At its restaurants, the company continues to combat heightened competitive activity around breakfast day part, and carry out aggressive value deals across the industry by menu innovations and value offerings.The company is also increasingly focusing on delivery channels, which is a growing area for the industry. Given the high demand for this service, management has undertaken third-party delivery channels to boost transactions and sales. Currently, two-third of the restaurant system is served by major delivery companies like DoorDash and Grubhub. Jack in the Box is currently testing a mobile application in a few markets that support order-ahead functionality and payment. Management is reaping benefits in terms of higher ticket from the mobile orders.Gains From Franchising & Qdoba Sell-OutJack in the Box restaurants are currently 90% franchised and the company plans to increase the number to around 95% by the end of fiscal 2018. We believe, franchising a large chunk of its system will lower its general and administrative expenses, and thereby boost earnings. Moreover, over the long term, it would generate a higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements. This would also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing its shareholders’ return.  Notably, the company believes that the majority of Jack in the Box’s new unit growth will be through franchise restaurants. In fact, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company sold 53 Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees. Management has roughly 17 restaurants with signed LOIs, having a current 93% franchise mix.Also, with the strategic sell-out of the Qdoba brand, management is expecting to gradually witness a reduction in SG&A in the second half of the fiscal. The Qdoba brand had become more of a drag in the past few quarters, given the poor restaurant-level execution and a choppy sales environment. In fact, it generated a net loss of $0.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 against net earnings of $1.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Limited International Presence & Stiff Competition Raise ConcernsThe American dining brands are keen on expanding in the fast-growing emerging markets. While several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets; Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front. Thus, limited international presence might be a big disadvantage for the company and hurt its competitive position. Moreover, the company is experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts, as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.The company operates in the retail restaurant space that is highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending. Consumers’ propensity to spend largely depends on the overall macro-economic scenario. Although higher disposable income and increased wages are favoring the industry right now, it can change with the slightest disruption in the economy. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, therefore, is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending. If it does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains, it has high chances of fading out like many other restaurant retailers.

1124,YUM,"Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report)  is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 financial numbers on Sep 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.61%. In fact, Darden’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.54%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Darden Restaurants, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPositive comps growth and costs-saving initiatives are driving Darden’s bottom line and are expected to boost the fiscal first-quarter results as well. Notably, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last 11 consecutive quarters.Meanwhile, management has been focusing on improving core operating fundamentals with initiatives like simplifying kitchen systems, better in-restaurant execution to enhance guest experience, menu innovation, remodeling along with various technology-driven moves. In fact, most of Darden’s brands have been witnessing growth over the past few quarters backed by these initiatives. Thus, we expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, increased labor costs and a non-franchised business model may dent the company’s profits, while a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might restrict revenue growth.Notably, Darden completed its acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen on Apr 24. Now, it remains to be seen how the acquisition would impact the company’s performance in the fiscal first quarter as this would be the first full-quarterly result that includes Cheddar’s operations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Darden this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1126,YUM,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report) renewed marketing efforts and cost-cutting initiatives seem encouraging.However, rising labor costs amid a tepid sales environment along with limited geographical presence remain potent headwinds for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recently, Cracker Barrel posted mixed first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line lagging the same. Notably, the last reported quarter marked the 26th successive earnings beat for the company. However, the company reported lower-than-expected revenues in 10 of the last 11 quarters. Key Growth DriversIn order to mitigate the choppy sales e U.S. restaurant sales environment, Cracker Barrel has been taking up several initiatives to drive top-line growth. The company heavily relies on marketing efforts that include expansion of its long-standing brand’s footprint in new and developing markets. Currently, there are 647 Cracker Barrel locations in the United States and the company expects to add eight or nine more stores in fiscal 2018.In addition, the company’s flagship fast casual concept, Holler & Dash Biscuit House, continues to gain momentum. Currently, there are eight Holler & Dash Biscuit House outlets in the United States and the company plans to open three more in fiscal 2018.In order to attract customers and boost the top line, the company relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited period offers. In fact, in fiscal 2018, the company aims to meet consumers' needs for convenience via growth in off-premise business. Cracker Barrel plans to enhance its off-premise platform through the introduction of a catering menu and in-store training of hourly employees. In October, the company completed a system-wide rollout in all its off-premise platforms. Considering off-premise sales to be the primary component of full-year sales growth target, the company plans to support growth in off-premise through marketing efforts like social and digital messaging, geo-targeted consumer emails and in-store collateral.Coming to menu innovation, the company recently introduced a coffee platform in approximately 40 stores. Cracker Barrel believes that the platform will complement the strength of its offering, drive check favorability and promote guest perceptions of menu variety. The rollout of the crafted coffee program at all stores is expected to be complete by the end of fiscal third quarter.Apart from focusing on the top line, Cracker Barrel has adopted various cost-cutting initiatives to drive margins. Through a food management program and efficient cost saving in the utility front, the company has been able to drive cost favorability.In the beginning of fiscal 2017, the company planned to bring down annual operating costs by $15 million to $20 million. In fact, Cracker Barrel delivered 15% above the high end of its fiscal-year target and achieved its three-year strategic goal of reducing $50 million of annual costs by fiscal 2017-end. In fiscal 2018, the company expects to record $7 million to $8 million in annual cost savings.Notably, in order to enhance shareholder’s value, Cracker Barrel has been paying dividends since 2003 and has hiked it several times since then. Moreover, in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company declared additional special dividends of $3.50, $3.20 and $3.00 per share, respectively. A continuous increase in quarterly dividends and declaration of a special dividend affirm the company’s optimistic outlook and prospects.In fact, the company delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 35.1% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 6.9%. This supports its growth potential and also reinstates our faith in the company’s fundamentals and cash flow position.ConcernsDespite the company’s efficient cost-saving methods, higher labor costs and expenses related to various sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on margins. Subsequently, Cracker Barrel’s shares have declined 2.8% year to date, against 14.6% growth of the industry it belongs to.This performance is further aggravated by downward estimate revisions. Over the last 30 days, current-year earnings estimates have moved down by 0.2%, reflecting analysts’ pessimism surrounding the stock. Notably, despite its substantial domestic presence, Cracker Barrel loses out in terms of international presence. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion strategies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak on this front.Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic. Meanwhile, management notes that Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been affected by challenges in the retail industry, as a whole. Thus, given the persistent challenges in the restaurant and retail industry, the company’s top line is likely to remain under pressure.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1127,YUM,"Shares of both Papa John's (PZZA  -  Free Report) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) sunk on Wednesday after rival Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) announced that Pizza Hut will now deliver beer to its customers.On Tuesday, the Yum subsidiary began to test beer delivery in the Phoenix area, with the hopes to add wine to its booze delivery offerings as soon as January.Pizza Hut currently sells wine and beer at many in-store locations. Therefore, the next logical step was to offer adult beverage delivery, according to statements from Pizza Hut’s Director of Brand Marketing, Stacy Lynn Bourgeois.Phoenix-area Pizza Hut customers will be able to order six-packs of Shocktop, Bud Light, Budweiser and a local Arizona-based craft brew, Kilt Lifter, which will all cost a flat rate of $10.99. Drivers will check customers’ IDs to verify that they are over 21 and deliver the cold beer kept in a cooler.Yum plans to roll out Pizza Hut’s beer and wine delivery concept to more markets after its Phoenix trial.This beer delivery move comes after Yum poured $130 million into Pizza Hut in April in order to better compete with rivals Domino’s and Papa Johns. Since then, the company also made plans to hire 14,000 more delivery drivers by the end of the year.Shares of Yum, which also owns KFC and Taco Bell, were little changed after the announcement. However, rivals Domino’s and Papa John’s, saw their stock prices sink after the beer delivery announcement.Papa John’s stock tanked 5.43% on Wednesday, helping the now controversial pizza giant inch closer to its 52-week low. Papa John’s is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and scored an “F” for momentum in our Style Scores system.

1128,YUM,"In order to capitalize on rising demand for their products, quite a few restaurant operators are focusing on growing their off-premise, online-ordering business via delivery, carry-out, and catering.Particularly, restaurant operators are concentrating on the delivery channel, which is a growing area for the industry, driven by ease of access. By driving incremental sales at the companies, delivery services might turn out to be a strong revenue growth driver in the long term, given huge demand for the same.Meanwhile, many restaurants are seeing an increase in their take-out business as customers are more willing to relax at home while enjoying their meal. Notably, both take-out and delivery increase a restaurant’s business without significantly raising its operational expenses or demanding an expansion of facility.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers & Brew, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is one such company that is moving smartly on new revenue streams. Going forward, the company expects the off-premise orders to become a growth engine in the latter half of the year as it begins to actively promote the new offerings, reach out to more guests, thus driving improved profitability.In sync with this, the company plans to expand its service to 198 locations from 118, with its current three third-party service providers like Amazon, DoorDash and GrubHub. By fourth-quarter 2017, Red Robin expects to put all corporate restaurants on the call center and have designated in-store pickup areas. In addition, the company anticipates roughly two-thirds of its units to have curbside delivery.Red Robin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) is also planning to provide augmented convenience to customers through increased focus on delivery. In fact, this Zacks Rank #3 company’s delivery service has now expanded to almost 8,000 restaurants across 47 countries. In this regard, McDonald's is also experimenting with different delivery models including partnering with third-party operators, like UberEATS.Another restaurant operator, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), has deployed an off-premise strategy at all three of its iconic brands. Evidently, Pizza Hut has developed a delivery network algorithm (DNA), which is a multi-faceted technology system that improves the accuracy and reliability of deliveries.YUM! Brands’ KFC division is also aggressively pursuing its global delivery initiative as a strategic growth opportunity. Currently, the division offers delivery out of over 6,000 restaurants and given the fact that it is the fastest growing channel in the business, the brand anticipates expanding its services around the world.The Taco Bell division follows the same strategy as well. In fact, nearly 20,000 restaurants across the entire Yum! Brands system offer delivery, which is almost 50% of the company’s total restaurants. YUM! Brands carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Taking things one step further, BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) has launched a pilot alcohol delivery program in partnership with DoorDash. Markedly, this initiative is in addition to the door-to-door delivery service that was launched earlier as an effort to boost off-premise sales.Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) Olive Garden division and Brinker International, Inc.’s (EAT  -  Free Report) Chili’s segment are concentrating on their To-Go business. While Olive Garden’s To-Go business increased 16% year over year in the last reported quarter, Chili’s has partnered with Olo – a mobile and online food ordering service – for its To-Go platform. Chili’s has also launched a digital curbside platform to ensure simpler, faster, effortless experience to take-out guests, which should ultimately translate to higher check. Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #3.Further, Darden and Jack in the Box, Inc.’s (JACK  -  Free Report) Qdoba division have launched catering in the United States. In fact, catering remains a significant opportunity at Qdoba and the company plans to continue with this, which exceeded 11% of its sales in the fiscal third quarter. Moreover, the brand has prepared a new catering menu in a bid to expand this segment.Also, the company’s Jack in the Box segment has expanded its partnership with DoorDash, which is now delivering from roughly 37% of this division.Bottom LineIn addition to the ones mentioned above, there are many other restaurant operators like Starbucks, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cheesecake Factory, Dunkin’ Brands and Wendy’s that have indulged in growing their off-premise sales.Notably, the restaurant industry’s sales trends in recent quarters have been strained, given the soft consumer spending environment. Nevertheless, off-premise channels could be the tide that lifts all boats in the industry, moving it higher from its current position at the bottom 15% among more than 250 Zacks industries.On an average, off-premise sales represent about 10-11% of the industry’s total sales. Therefore, there lies a tremendous opportunity to grow the segment and earn good returns from it.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1129,YUM,"On Sep 14, we issued an updated research report on Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report).Notably, Cracker Barrel’s distinctiveness in the retail-restaurant space lies in the fact that apart from serving food, its restaurant establishments have old-country feel along with unique gift shops.This week, the company posted mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line lagged the same.Key Growth DriversIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, Cracker Barrel had launched its new fast casual concept, Holler & Dash Biscuit House, with operating hours limited to breakfast and lunch time. This new concept is expected to add considerably to the top line and boost shareholder value over the long term. Also, the company plans to expand its long-standing brand’s footprint in new and developing markets. In fact, continuous expansion plans of the company reinstate our belief in the brand’s demand across the country.We note that Cracker Barrel relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited time offers to boost its top-line performance because they are appealing to both regular users and less-frequent guests. Going forward, the company aims to continue investing in new product news that will drive business frequency.In fiscal 2018, the company aims to meet consumers' need for convenience via growth in its off-premise business. Moreover, it has also been testing an enhanced everybody value platform at breakfast, lunch and dinner to further engage as a value player in the restaurant space. Coming to menu innovation, Cracker Barrel plans to introduce a new coffee platform this year, which should further boost check averages.On the retail side, the company is likely to increase its emphasis on value to better compete in a very promotional environment, grow its sales gap and achieve its long-term business growth. Thus, in fiscal 2018, along with the affordability of its merchandise offerings, the company will also be working on the quality and exclusivity of its assortments, placing greater emphasis on price value relationship.Meanwhile, in a bid to address the challenges of the competitive restaurant industry, Cracker Barrel is undertaking extensive marketing efforts, mainly focused on the brand’s differentiation, menu offering and its value. In fact, the company expects its extensive advertising and marketing efforts to favor sales mix in the near term.This apart, Cracker Barrel also has an effective cost-cutting mechanism in place and undertakes various measures to keep costs under control. All these efforts coupled with ongoing commodity cost deflation helped it to achieve its target of removing $50 million in annual cost from the business by fiscal 2017-end as outlined in fiscal 2014. These initiatives are expected to aid the company in combating some of the wage inflation pressures as well.  Consequently, Cracker Barrel expects to deliver between $7 million and $8 million in annual cost savings for fiscal 2018.ChallengesCurrently, the company operates 645 Cracker Barrel outlets and five Holler & Dash Biscuit House locations across 44 states in the United States. In fiscal 2018, it expects to open eight or nine new Cracker Barrel stores and three or four new Holler & Dash Biscuit House restaurants.However, Cracker Barrel loses out in terms of international presence. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are following aggressive global expansion policies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak on this front.Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic. Meanwhile, management notes that Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been affected by the challenges faced by the retail industry, as a whole. Thus, given the continued challenges facing the restaurant and retail industry, the company’s top line is likely to remain under pressure.Additionally, higher labor costs along with expenses related to various sales boosting initiatives as well as opening of new units are anticipated to continue hurting margins.Resultantly, Cracker Barrel’s shares have declined 10.7% year to date, as against 6.5% growth of the industry it belongs to.Bottom LineGoing forward, we expect the company’s enhanced focus on convenience, value and menu innovation along with cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue and cost woes.Cracker Barrel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1130,YUM,"Shares of several restaurant chains—including Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report)—surged on Monday as investors began to dive into companies and industries that stand to benefit from a potential GOP tax plan.Both the Senate and House versions of the GOP tax plan call for the corporate tax rate to be cut from 35% to 20%. This massive reduction could lead to greater profits at almost every U.S. company.The U.S. Senate passed a tax bill over the weekend, helping Republicans inch closer to sending a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk—one he hopes to sign before Christmas.Now, after the Senate’s 51-49 vote across party lines—with just one Republican voting against it—the GOP’s plan to cut roughly $1.4 trillion in taxes has once again spurred market movement.Last week, Chipotle stock popped after the fast-casual burrito chain announced it would begin a search for a new CEO. On Monday, shares of Chipotle climbed over 5.5% as investors began to take into account how a new U.S. tax code could help bolster the Colorado-based chain’s bottom line.Investors jumped on Chipotle stock after the weekend Senate vote because the company currently pays one of the highest effective tax rates, according to a Credit Suisse report. This has many Chipotle investors cautiously optimistic about the possibility that a GOP tax overhaul could help raise the struggling company’s profits.Smaller companies with a lot of U.S. sales tend to pay higher effective tax rates than much bigger multinational firms.Investors began to buy shares of companies throughout the U.S. restaurant industry with the hopes that a Republican tax plan—if passed—could help boost profits. On top of that, a decreased tax burden could lead to further investments and strategic business initiatives amid the quickly shifting food industry landscape.Shares of domestic burger chain Shake Shack Inc. climbed over 2.55% to hit a new 52-week high. Yum! Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, and others, also saw its stock price touch a new high on Monday.The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) shares surged 3.78%, while shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) both jumped by around 1.75%.Shares of U.S. coffee powerhouse Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) also rose more than 3% to hit a new 52-week high. Fellow domestic and international coffee giant, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), saw its stock price climb over 3%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

"
1131,YUM,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the second-quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s results benefited from an improved performance in the Americas segment (mainly in the United States), the ongoing momentum in China (following the takeover of East China) and strongest comps growth in Japan in five quarters.However, Starbucks’ shares declined 2.2% in the after-hour trading session following the earnings release on Apr 26, possibly in response to stagnant comps growth in the Americas division that constitutes 70% of total revenues.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 53 cents met the consensus mark but grew 17.8% year over year.Total sales of $6.03 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $5.9 billion by 2.3% and increased 13.9% from the year-ago level. Notably, the acquisition of the East China business as well as other portfolio reshuffling activities lent a 3% net benefit to its top line. These activities include the closure of the Teavana mall store in the quarter, the Tazo divestiture in December, and the conversion of certain international retail operations from company-owned to licensed models. Meanwhile, currency translation had a 2% positive impact on revenues.The year-over-year performance was also driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,103 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher global comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 3%, better than the 2% increase in the fourth quarter. Transactions were down by 1% against no growth in the preceding quarter. The company opened 468 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,209 across 76 markets. It also closed 298 Teavana stores in the quarter.Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteMargin DownOperating margin decreased 490 basis points (bps) year over year to 12.8% in the quarter due to a product mix shift, largely toward food and restructuring costs associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations. Again, higher spending in its store partners (employees) along with the impact of its ownership change in East China added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 170 bps to 16.2%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 8% year over year to $4 billion.Comps rise of 2% in the quarter (same as the preceding quarter) comprised a 3% increase in average ticket. U.S. comps also grew 2% albeit less than the 3% increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Importantly, this is second consecutive quarter of 2% comps growth in Americas, mirroring concerns that its increased promotions somehow failed to attract a huge number of customers.Food comps were more than 1% and food has consistently contributed in the 1% to 2% comps range for many years now. This momentum continued in the quarter with food's share of total U.S. sales being 22%, up 100 bps from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, iced beverages contributed almost 40% to overall revenue growth.Membership increased 12% year over year to 14.9 million in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 12% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 8% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 220 bps to 20% as a strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of a food-related mix shift and higher spending in its store partners.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 54% to $1.2 billion on the back of higher revenues from the acquisition of east China operations, new store openings and comps growth.Comps grew 3%, higher than 1% in the previous quarter. China continued to post impressive comps growth, with 4% improvement in the quarter (softer than 6% in the preceding quarter). The softer sequential growth was attributed to a shift in the timing of the Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, Japan delivered its first quarter of positive comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2017, buoyed by a strong beverage lineup.However, operating margin at the CAP segment contracted 570 bps year over year to 17.2% in the quarter, owing to the impact of its ownership change in East China.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were up 15% year over year at $266.1 million in the segment. The improvement was prompted by higher revenues from the addition of new stores and a positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 1% (against a 2% decline in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 1,360 bps due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to the Switzerland retail business and sales deleverage on company-operated stores.Channel Development: Net revenues improved 8% to $500.2 million. The growth was driven by higher sales of premium single-serve products.Operating margin improved 100 bps to 43%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve Coffee and Roastery businesses, and Teavana-branded stores. Revenues at the segment decreased 32% to $75.6 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks expects global comps growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance of 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in in the high single digits.The company expects its GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32-$3.36.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, it excludes the impact of its previously announced plan to close more than 8,000 company-owned stores in the United States on May 29, 2018 to conduct racial-bias training for all partners (employees) in the United States.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1132,YUM,"The NFL Draft begins Thursday night, kicking off a three-day event that has transformed from a humble ballroom production into a big budget spectacle and the NFL’s most important offseason offering. But instead of more speculation about the top picks, let’s tackle the big business that fuels the 2018 NFL Draft.New York City played host to the NFL Draft for the first 50 years, moving from hotels to its long-time home, Radio City Music Hall. Then, in 2015, the NFL moved on from the 6,000 seat theater to Chicago, where it was held for two years.Last year, Philadelphia won the rights to host the event, building upon Chicago’s impressive outdoor fan festivities. Roughly 250,000 visitors spent an estimated $56 million on everything from hotels to food in Philadelphia.‘Everything's Bigger In Texas’ This year, the Dallas Cowboys play host to the 2018 NFL Draft at AT&T (T  -  Free Report) Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where roughly 400,000 people have registered to attend.

1133,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings surpassed analysts’ expectations while revenues were in line with the same.Adjusted earnings of $2.13 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 by 38.3%. Earnings also grew 33.1% from the year-ago quarter driven by higher revenues and lower food costs.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Quote Chipotle had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust.In order to chalk out a viable business strategy, Chipotle discarded its former co-CEO model and recently appointed former Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report) executive Brian Niccol as the CEO. Niccol’s expertise in restaurant operations, digital technologies and branding has significantly helped Chipotle in first-quarter earnings. Shares jumped 10.7% in after-hours trading on Apr 25. The company’s shares have also rallied 48.2% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5%. Let’s have a detailed look at the quarter’s results.Revenues and Comparable Restaurant SalesQuarterly revenues of $1.15 billion met the consensus estimate but grew 7.4% year over year. The revenue growth is primarily attributable to improvement in comps and restaurant openings. The company opened 35 new restaurants in the first quarter and closed two restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 2,441.Comps in the quarter increased 2.2%, which include an underlying comp sales growth of 2.7% and 50 basis points (bps) impact related to deferred revenues, recognized during the year-ago quarter due to the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comps were driven by an increase in average check, including 4.9% benefit from menu price increase, partially offset by fewer transactions and resistance that have been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers, adding queso to their orders, which added about 200 bps.Costs, Operating Highlights & Net IncomeFood costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 140 bps to 32.4% driven by cost savings in paper and packaging usage, as well as higher menu prices, partially offset by higher costs associated with preservative-free tortillas.General and administrative expenses came in at 6.7% of total revenues, reflecting an increase of 20 bps year over year, due to rise in headcount and higher bonus expenses. However, the increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of stock during the quarter. Restaurant-level operating margin was 19.5%, up 180 bps from 17.7% in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by lower marketing and promotional expenses, and comps growth, partially offset by wage inflation at the crew and manager level.Net income in the quarter was $59.4 million, up from $46.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $231.8 million, compared with $184.6 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Inventory totaled $17.4 million as of Mar 31, 2018, down from $19.9 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Goodwill, as a percentage of total assets, was 1.04% at the end of the first quarter compared with 1.07% at the end of 2017.During the first quarter, the company’s board of directors approved an investment of up to an additional $100 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock.2018 OutlookFor 2018, management continues to expect comps growth in low single digits and launch 130-150 restaurants.Effective tax rate is estimated in the range of 32.5-33.5% (up from the previously guided range of 30-31%), including an underlying effective tax rate of about 29% in the second and third quarters, and up to 38.5% high in the fourth quarter as a result of an additional anticipated write-off of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation awards.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesChipotle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Darden (DRI  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same.

1134,YUM,"Leading fire-grilled chicken chain, El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report), opened its latest outlet in Riverside, CA, on Sep 14. The 4,000-square-foot restaurant, located at Van Buren Blvd., can accommodate more than 60 guests.The outlet features the brand’s new Vision Design and has an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of its signature dish. Also, this marks El Pollo Loco’s seventh restaurant in Riverside.Currently, the company has more than 470 company-owned and franchised restaurants in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. Moreover, it is looking to expand its presence in key markets through franchisees and company-owned stores. To this end, El Pollo Loco has already opened about 17 restaurants year to date with another eight to open soon enough, in the coming weeks.However, this fire-grilled chicken chain loses out in terms of international presence. While other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) pursue aggressive global expansion policies, El Pollo Loco seems to be weak on this front.Additionally, shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date. The stock declined 6.9%, as against the industry’s growth of 6.4%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have moved down 5.3% and 2.9%, respectively, over the past 60 days.Furthermore, a challenging sales environment given lower consumer spending in the U.S. restaurant space remains a potent headwind to the company’s top line. Meanwhile, higher costs related to sales initiatives and wage rate increases may continue to hurt profits too.Nevertheless, continuous expansion plans are expected to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Going forward, El Pollo Loco further expects to drive growth through a number of initiatives such as its authentic advertising campaign, its recently launched mobile and online ordering app, loyalty program and delivery system.

1135,YUM,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of its latest location in Yuba City, CA.Owned and operated by the company’s franchise partner, V S Pollo King, Inc., the restaurant is located at 1212 Colusa Hwy. The 2,273-square foot restaurant can accommodate 66 guests.Continued Focus on ‘Vision Design’Notably, the new restaurant is part of El Pollo Loco’s ‘Vision Design’ initiative. Restaurants under this program offer an authentic, Mexican-inspired atmosphere, includes El Pollo Loco’s menu and brand identity, and has an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of its signature dish. The company believes that its vision model will position it better in the quick-service restaurant space. El Polo Loco is seeing encouraging results from the implementation of this model in various company-owned and franchised restaurants. The company also aims to reduce costs and drive sales through this initiative.For 2018, the company targets to complete 20 company-owned and 30 franchised remodels, all of which will feature the Vision Design.Sales-Boosting EffortsThe latest Yuba outlet reflects the company’s efforts to strengthen its franchise partnerships. V S Pollo, which has been El Pollo Loco’s franchise partner for over two decades, brought the company’s brand back to Yuba City. The latest launch is expected to boost the company’s franchise revenues, which have increase 1.6% year over year in the third quarter as well.Management is focused on maintaining its existing franchise relations as well as develop new ones. The franchise business model helps the company expand its footprint in various cities, which in turn is expected to drive traffic and overall sales.The company also expects to boost growth through advertising and providing excellent service at reasonable price. Banking on menu innovation, limited time offers and a strong brand position, the company witnessed traffic growth in the third quarter of 2017. Management believes that these sales-building efforts will pay off in the upcoming quarters as well.Limited Expansion & Macro WoesAlthough the latest move underscores the company’s rigorous expansion strategy, it also shows that the company is only expanding within its domestic periphery. While other restaurant operators like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion, El Pollo Loco is losing out in terms of international presence.Moreover, the U.S. restaurant space has been challenging for quite some time now. Soft consumer spending has led to declining traffic and sales. El Pollo Loco has also been bearing the brunt of a soft industry environment, where consumer preference toward spending on dine-out services has been volatile.Shares of the company have lost 23.1% in the past six months as against the industry’s gain of 7.2%.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1136,YUM,"Autonomous vehicles were all the rage last year, and this trend is set to continue in 2018 as the possibility of mass-produced self-driving cars inches closer to becoming a reality.Even though roads full of self-driving cars likely won’t be seen for some time, companies that are serious about thriving when drivers are no longer needed must spend money and focus on that future today.Technology giant Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and its autonomous car firm Waymo are helping lead this charge, along with ride sharing power Uber. Automotive companies including General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), Hyundai  and countless other carmakers are also heavily invested in self-driving vehicle technology.With this said, let’s take a look at three companies playing prominent roles in the autonomous vehicle revolution that are also looking like great buys right now:1.      Ford (F  -  Free Report)This U.S. automotive giant presented its vision of the future at CES on Tuesday. Ford’s “City of Tomorrow” plan includes a vision for connected cities, where vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights remain in constant contact in order to create a safer travel experience.Ford also announced partnerships with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Argo AI, Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report), Lyft, and Postmates to help improve its own self-driving business. The company already has more than 700,000 connected vehicles on the road and plans to sell nothing but connected vehicles in the U.S. by next year (also read: Buy Ford (F  -  Free Report) After 'City of Tomorrow' Unveil At CES).Currently, Ford is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM score. Ford’s 0.34 P/S and 1.57 P/B ratio mark substantial discounts compared to the “Automotive – Domestic” industry average. What’s more, the historic automaker, with its sights set on the future, is currently trading at just 8.53x earnings.2.       Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report)Nvidia just recently announced its new augmented reality, driverless car technology called “Nvidia Dive AR.” Nvidia has also announced partnerships with Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) and Uber that will see the chipmaker bring its AI tech to the auto companies’ respective self-driving car projects. Furthermore, this Wall Street A-Lister’s DRIVE PX AI car computer is designed to help a wide range of companies produce automated and autonomous vehicles.Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company’s stock price hit a new 52-week high on Monday after its CES presentation. Looking ahead, Nvidia is expected to see its sales jump 22.35% next quarter, while its earnings are projected to pop 16.16%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates (also read: Why Nvidia Has Already Won CES 2018).3.       Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report)Toyota just recently introduced its new e-Palette autonomous vehicle concept at CES. The vehicle is an all-electric, driverless shuttle for commercial use that is set to debut at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Pizza Hut (YUM  -  Free Report) have already partnered with Toyota’s e-Palette Alliance. This Japanese automotive power also unveiled a new Lexus autonomous test vehicle.Toyota is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and earned a “B” VGM grade, which was supported by its “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The company is currently trading at just 11.17x earnings, which marks a discount compared to the S&P 500’s average.What’s more, Toyota’s P/S ratio of 0.77 helps demonstrate its strong value, while its 1.17 P/B ratio marks a discount against the “Automotive – Foreign” industry average. Shares of Toyota jumped to close at a new 52-week high on Wednesday as it builds momentum from its recent self-driving announcements.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1137,YUM,"Starbucks’ (SBUX  -  Free Report) Americas segment, comprising 70% of its total revenues, is expected to witness softer comps growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, when it reports on Thursday, Apr 26.A Look at Starbucks’ Americas Performance in Q1Net revenues in this flagship segment (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America) were up 7% year over year to $4.3 billion in the preceding quarter. Comps grew 2% in the quarter, softer than 3% growth witnessed in Q4. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 2% increase in average ticket. In fiscal 2017, Starbucks’ Americas segment posted 3% comps growth, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period. In fact, transactions remained unchanged year over year and ticket grew 4%. This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and an increase of 1% in ticket in fiscal 2016.In Q1, membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks, and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 31% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 27% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 100 basis points to 23%, as strong sales leverage was more than offset by food-related mix shift.Q2 ExpectationsStarbucks’ Americas segment revenues (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America, comprising 70% of its total revenues) are expected to witness 6.9% growth year over year but 6.9% decline sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, the company expects the first half of the year in Americas comps to be a little below the average for the year, and the second half to be a little bit above.The company’s segment is likely to experience higher revenues year over year courtesy of additional store openings, Starbucks’ mobile order/pay along with significant innovation in beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty, and e-Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams to boost its top line.Apart from the Americas segment, Starbucks’ Channel Development business also needs special mention. Although the business is small (in terms of its revenue contribution), it generates impressive operating margins owing to its cost structure. Hence, the Channel Development segment represents a significant profitable growth opportunity. Channel Development is expected to report revenues of $479 million, higher than $461 million in the year-ago quarter but lower than $560 million in the preceding one.Revenues in the China-Asia-Pacific segment are likely to witness 47% year-over-year and 34.1% sequential growth. Additionally, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment revenues of $254 million indicates an increase from $232 million in the year-ago quarter but a decrease from $284 million in the prior quarter.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 53 cents reflects 17.8% growth from the prior-year quarter’s profit of 45 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $5.91 billion indicates a 11.5% increase on a year-over-year basis.Starbucks’ operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. Again, digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. Internationally, the company’s focus on China/Asia expansion is another positive.Meanwhile, change in the product mix (as food, tea and cold beverages will become an increasing part of the product mix), focus on the use of loyalty cards and mobile order, and pay technology to boost sales and profits are added tailwinds. Finally, Starbucks’ endeavor to boost its presence in premium coffee consumed at home through K-cups and with ready-to-drink beverages needs special attention.Overall, apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. That said, headwinds, especially in the labor front, are a cause of concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

1138,YUM,"Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) remains on track to achieve its target announced under the three-year strategic transformation plan, following the separation of the company’s China division.Notably, the company’s transformation and growth strategy involves greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands — KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, increasing its franchise ownership and creating a leaner, more efficient cost structure. Additionally, this restaurant operator is working on development of bold restaurants and unrivaled culture and talent to drive continued growth.Currently, Yum! Brands owns, operates and franchises over 44,000 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories. In fact, its brands — KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell — are regarded as the global leaders of the chicken, pizza and Mexican-style food categories.Details of the Growth PlanYum! Brands is trying hard to drive growth at its three iconic brands and thereby improve the key drivers of its business, comps and net new units.While the Pizza Hut brand’s international division has been largely doing well, Yum! Brands is working on a number of areas to get its fair share of growth in the U.S. market where results have been predominantly soft. To this end, the company entered into an agreement with the Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees and plans to invest roughly $130 million on improving brand marketing alignment as well as accelerate enhancements to operations and technology. This, in turn, is anticipated to increase convenience for customers leading to solid results in 2018 and beyond.Yum! Brands is particularly committed to offer a hot, fast and reliable Pizza Hut experience over the long term. In fact, furthering its delivery-centric strategy, the brand stated that it expects to hire 14,000 new delivery drivers by the end of 2017. Of late, the brand also announced the launch of — Hut Rewards — its national loyalty program.In the United States, Yum! Brands’ KFC division’s revamping of the restaurants, focus on its operational excellence and providing increased continence to customers is driving comps growth. At KFC International, management is aggressively pursuing its global delivery initiative, given the fact that the service is the fastest growing channel in the business and KFC product is ideal for the same. In fact, management believes that the brand has significant room for growth in both developed and emerging markets.Management seeks to continue developing the Taco Bell brand through continued focus on innovation and value, expanding its delivery program, inventive marketing strategies and extended line of breakfast offerings. Also, Yum! Brands’ continues to unlock the business model by driving cost out of the supply chain and building scale with new and existing franchises to make the brand sustainable internationally over the long term.The company’s digital efforts has increased manifold with all its three bands’ deploying technology to enhance guest experience. In the meantime, Yum! Brands’ seem to continue its transformation process toward a single point-of-sale system in the United States by 2017-end.Of late, Yum! Brands along with various companies in the restaurant space like Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR  -  Free Report), McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and others have adopted a de-risking strategy by reducing their ownership of restaurants through refranchising.Additionally, the company is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised and thus expects to become a pure play franchisor with more stable earnings, higher profit margins, lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion.Also, this restaurant operator is striving to revamp its financial profile and thereby improve the efficiency of its organization and cost structure, globally. To this end, management anticipates to cut capital expenditures to about $100 million by 2019, increase free cash flow conversion to 100% and also reduce General and Administrative (G&A) expenditure by approximately $300 million (or 1.7% of system sales). Over the next three years, the company is committed to return an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Resultantly, Yum! Brands’ expects EPS of at least $3.75 in 2019, which is first clean year post-transformation.Notably, Yum! Brands’ efforts have started to reap benefits as reflected by positive stock price movement. Evidently, post-separation, shares of the company have gained 30.6%, outperforming the 20% growth of the industry it belongs to. Moreover, earnings estimates for current year moved up slightly over the past 60 days, reflecting ongoing optimism in the stock. The bullish trend in price is thus anticipated to continue in the quarters ahead.ConcernsYum! Brands is highly exposed to various emerging nations in Latin America. In fact, these nations have been exhibiting decelerating growth for some time due to various macro headwinds, which might dent sales in the near term.Foreign exchange translation is also a concern for the company, given its significant international presence.In addition, the third quarter of 2017 marked the seventh-consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby stretching the somber mood. Thus, a continued choppy sales environment in the domestic space is likely to keep the top line under pressure.Yum! Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1139,YUM,"McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) is currently a well-performing restaurant stock. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run.Shares of the company have returned 44.1% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20.8%.The outperformance has been backed by upward revision in earnings estimates for 2018. This reflects analysts’ unwavering confidence in the stock. Over the past 60 days, consensus estimate for 2018 earnings rose 0.4%. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.21%.Per our VGM Score, which identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, McDonald’s has a Growth Score of B. This reflects robust growth rate and potential of the stock.Let us delve deeper into the other factors that make this stock a lucrative pick.Sales Building Efforts to Drive Traffic Amid CompetitionMcDonald’s has always been focused on driving guest traffic. Toward this end, the company is emphasizing on operational excellence, product innovation, offering value menu and rolling out more limited period offers. In fact, the company’s endeavors have started bearing fruit and the third quarter of 2017 marked the third consecutive quarter of comparable guest count growth.In addition, the company is undertaking digital initiatives to enhance customer experience, with nearly all of its U.S. restaurants now using digital menu boards. Meanwhile, to provide augmented convenience to customers, McDonald’s is increasingly focusing on delivery. In fact, it has already scaled this initiative by introducing delivery at more than 3,700 restaurants in the United States via its partnership with UberEATS.McDonald’s believes that consistent menu innovation can lend it a competitive edge over the likes of Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report). In line with this, the company started the year with the introduction of Dollar Menu.Franchised Model Safeguards EarningsConsidering that 91% of the company’s system-wide restaurants are franchised and is expected to reach 95%, the company gain from reduced ownership. Although re-franchising weighs on near-term revenues as it replaces company-operated sales with franchised sales, over the long term, it will reduce the company’s capital requirements and drive earnings.Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). In 2018, McDonald’s earnings per share are expected to grow 6.9%.Refranchising Drives Net MarginMcDonald’s refranchising and stringent spending makes the company optimistic about achieving approximately $500 million of net annual savings on SG&A expenses by 2018. Further, it expects to trim another 5 to 10% from its remaining cost base by the end of 2019.Despite high labor costs and expenses related with brand positioning and ongoing initiatives, the company has been able to achieve higher net margins. We note that McDonald’s trailing 12-month net margin is 24.2% as compared with the industry’s gain of 3.3%.Regular Returns to ShareholdersMcDonald’s has been regularly rewarding its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

1140,YUM,"El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report) started the year with the introduction of four ‘Under 500 Calories’ menu items.This is in line with the company’s aim to introduce a differentiated menu to counter intense competition in the fast food space. ‘Under 500 Calories’ items will feature nutrient-packed ingredients combined with El Pollo Loco’s signature flavors and are a healthier alternative to typical fast food.We observe that El Pollo Loco’s stock has lost 26.6% in the past six months as against the industry’s gain of 4.3%.Menu Innovation to Drive Traffic & CompsGiven a challenging sales environment, it is imperative for restaurants to understand customers’ tastes and preferences. With consumers opting for healthier alternatives, the ‘Under 500 Calories’ is expected to meet consumer needs and improve overall traffic. This in turn is likely to drive comps.El Pollo Loco expects to boost comps through continuous innovation of popular menu items. Reasonable pricing and excellent customer service are other positives. The U.S. restaurant industry has been under the weather over the past few quarters as continued softness in consumer spending on dining out has dented sales. Resultantly, comps growth has been weak. Foot traffic also declined, denting profits at many restaurants.Meanwhile, in order to keep up with food giants like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), it is important for El Pollo Loco to continue improvising the menu, re-imaging stores and offering loyalty programs.In fact, menu innovation and a strong brand position helped drive traffic for the company in the last two quarters.Other Initiatives to Drive SalesEl Pollo Loco is known for its sales-building initiatives. The company’s relentless focus on providing excellent service through advertising campaigns is expected to boost comps further.In addition, El Pollo Loco has made significant progress with various technology initiatives, designed to provide convenience to loyalty customers. In June 2017, the company had initiated a partnership with Olo's Dispatch Delivery service, which covers 40% of El Polo Loco’s system-wide locations. The company expects technological and delivery initiatives to be major sales drivers in the quarters ahead.To ConcludeDespite the company’s sales-boosting efforts, high labor costs, pre-opening costs of outlets and expenses related to the execution of various initiatives are expected to keep profits under pressure.Nonetheless, continual menu improvisation and aggressive marketing are likely to drive sales.El Pollo Loco has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1141,YUM,"Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s (DRI  -  Free Report) effective sales-boosting initiatives and synergies from Cheddar’s acquisition put the company on growth trajectory. However, high costs related to restaurant operations and stiff competition remain major concerns.Last month, the company reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Earnings and revenues not only surpassed analysts’ expectation but also grew 17.8% and 10.3%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by sales growth across every brand. Notably, the quarter marked the 15th consecutive earnings beat for the company.Darden’s shares have rallied 23.3% in the past year, outpacing its industry’s collective growth of 1%. Earnings estimates for the current fiscal have also climbed 2.4% over the past month. This reflects ongoing optimism in the stock. Given management’s progress on improving core operating fundamentals, the stock is anticipated to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Positive Synergies to be Realized From Cheddar’s IntegrationDarden’s acquisition of the small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's) in April 2017 added an undisputed casual dining value to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands. It also helped Darden to further enhance its scale. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, total sales were favored by 8.1% growth from the integration of Cheddar’s into the other segment.Apart from making significant progress with the integration of Cheddar’s, the company seems to gain more confidence of its outcome. In fiscal 2018, management realized roughly $10 million of cost synergies and expects to realize the same in the range of $22-$27 million by the end of fiscal 2019. Over the current fiscal, Darden plans to make significant non-guest facing changes that are expected to have an impact on restaurant-level execution. Moving forward, Darden expects Cheddar to bring in incredible opportunity for long-term growth. Given the brand is already delivering higher growth rate compared with Olive Garden, Darden expects Cheddar’s integration to add to the company’s overall growth.High Costs & Intense Competition HurtDarden’s non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs onto the franchisee. Total operating costs and expenses increased 7.9% year over year in the fourth quarter to $1.9 billion. This was caused by an overall increase in food, beverage and marketing costs, as well as restaurant labor and expenses. As a result, operating margin in the quarter contracted 198 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The retail restaurant space is highly competitive as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. Amid such stiff competition, Darden is missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing. We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Currently, Darden carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1142,YUM,"It has been a volatile year for the Retail-Food & Restaurants industry so far. Year to date, the industry has declined 4% against the S&P 500’s 1.7% gain. Under such circumstances, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL  -  Free Report), which has witnessed its shares rise more than 670% in the last 10 years, is trading sideways in 2018. Even though the company looks promising on its efficient cost-saving initiatives, higher labor costs and expenses related to various sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on its margins.Also, Cracker Barrel loses out on international front despite having a substantial domestic presence. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion strategies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak in this regard.Read on to find out the company’s strategic initiatives to revive its past glory.Menu Innovations & Expansion EffortsCracker Barrel is continuously focusing on rejuvenating its menu, which serves as the backbone of the company’s riveting growth potential. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s in-store menu featured Fried Chicken Benedict bowl, a Ham n' Maple Bacon bowl and a Sausage, Grits Cakes and Green Tomato Gravy bowl.  In April, Cracker Barrel also completed the rollout of crafted coffee. The company believes that the platform will complement the strength of its breakfast all day offering and will drive check favorability. By focusing on menu innovation, Cracker Barrel is trying to increase its traffic and in turn sales. Also, the company’s continuous expansion strategies act as a key catalyst. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Cracker Barrel opened four company-owned restaurants including the first California location. Again, it opened one Holler & Dash location in Charlotte, North Carolina. So far this year, the company has expanded its footprint by opening eight restaurants in total.Digitalization & Sales Building InitiativesIn a bid to offset the challenges of the competitive restaurant industry, Cracker Barrel has undertaken extensive marketing efforts that are mainly focused on the brand’s differentiation, menu offering and its value. Currently, it makes use of national cable along with local Spanish television for advertising. This, in turn, is increasing the company’s market coverage and brand awareness.Furthermore, Cracker Barrel relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited-time offers to boost its top-line performance as they are appealing to both regular users and less-frequent guests. In fiscal 2018, the company intends to meet consumers' needs for convenience via its off-premise business growth. Meanwhile, management will continue investing in its product line-up for improving guest experience and employee training to support long-term plans within this space. Multiple delivery options will also be tested this fiscal year. In the third quarter, the company made significant progress with its To Go sales by offering a new range of menu.Cost Saving InitiativesCracker Barrel has an effective cost-cutting mechanism in place. Impressively, it undertakes various measures to keep costs under control. For fiscal 2018, the company expects to deliver annual cost savings in the $7-$8 million range. Currently, the company is carrying out its cost savings plan through its two prime initiatives — food waste and labor management.Additionally, the company changed the structure in its retail sales and service functions, and now cross-trains its retail sales associate and cashier positions. This system-wide change allows it to deploy fewer associates during the outlet’s low volume hours, thus reducing store hourly labor by 25-30 hours per week. Cracker Barrel believes that this initiative will be a significant contributor to its cost savings.Cracker Barrel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1143,YUM,"Since Brian Niccol became the CEO of Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) in March, Chipotle’s stock price has only gone up. According to CNBC, Chipotle’s stock move has been based solely on Niccol’s reputation. Prior to Chipotle, Niccol was the CEO at Taco Bell, owned by Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), where he changed the image of the restaurant for better.From introducing mobile order and pay to opening restaurants around the globe, Niccol transformed Taco Bell into a lifestyle brand. Similarly, Niccol plans to do the same at Chipotle with his prior success to make it more of a youthful and culturally relevant brand.Niccol’s Past Success In the past three years, Chipotle was not doing so well. The stock fell to its lowest level following food safety concerns, and this was a day before Niccol was to be named CEO. The stock price was at $251.33 per share. As of today, Chipotle’s stock is sitting at $459.35 per share.In a press release by Yum! Brands, the CEO, Greg Creed, thanked Niccol on his success of always keeping Taco Bell culturally relevant, innovative and accessible for customers. Along with changing the restaurants slogan and introducing creative new food items, Taco Bell’s sales were up 5% last year, growing nearly $500 million according to CNBC. With Niccol’s optimistic qualities, he is known for encouraging employees to pitch any ideas they might have in return for creating an inclusive workplace. And, his past experience in consumer-focused businesses and relevant skill sets in areas like marketing and operations, Niccol can help address any of Chipotle’s primary issues, like from the food safety incidents, says David Tarantino, an analyst at Baird.What Does the Future of Chipotle Look Like? Currently, CMG is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘B’. After its Q1 report with Niccol as CEO, Chipotle’s earnings surged over 33% year-over-year to $2.13 per share. Total revenue climbed as well by 7.4% to $1.15 billion. With a new CEO who is experienced and dedicated as ever, consumers and investors alike can finally start to see Chipotle on a steady profitable trail. Recently, they also announced the addition of a few new menu items at their test kitchen in NYC, which could be a potential asset to the future success of the company as well.With Niccol’s vision of rebranding Chipotle to be more young and fun, it could potentially become a go to spot, more than it already is for many food consumers.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1146,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) increased focus on food safety, and various sales-building and strategic initiatives are major positives amid a tough economic environment characterized by high costs and stiff competition. Recently, the company reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed analysts’ expectations while revenues were in line with the same. Adjusted earnings of $2.13 grew 33.1% from the year-ago quarter driven by higher revenues and lower food costs.Chipotle had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust. To this end, Chipotle discarded its earlier co-CEO model and recently appointed former Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report) executive, Brian Niccol as the new CEO. Niccol’s expertise in restaurant operations, digital technologies and branding has significantly helped Chipotle in first-quarter earnings.Also, Chipotle’s shares have gained 49.8% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.9%. Earnings estimates for the current year have also increased 2.3% over the past month, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.Increased Focus on Safety & Cleanliness to Drive CustomersAs part of its revival strategy and efforts to regain consumer trust, Chipotle fulfilled its pledge of using no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in all its ingredients. In fact, the company now makes use of only 51 real ingredients to prepare its food, which is in stark contrast to most other fast food chains. Chipotle is also focusing on developing new food-safety protocols that include DNA-based testing of several ingredients, coupled with changes in food preparation and food-handling practices. The company is also undertaking noteworthy steps to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste to be disposed in landfills and has increased its diversion rate from 31% in 2015 to 40% in 2017. Recently as announced, Chipotle is implementing practices like minimal food-waste disposal during the preparation process, recycling as well as compost programs for food packages, use of reusable lids replacing plastic wraps and participation in the Harvest Program to donate its leftover food to local communities.Enhancing Digital Capabilities to Drive SalesChipotle is prioritizing its e-commerce program to appeal a greater number of customers and drive sales. To this end, the company has redesigned and simplified its online ordering site, enabled online payment for catering, online meal customizations and collaborated with several well-known third-party providers for delivery. In the first quarter, the company hit new records as digital sales mix was 8.8% of the total sales and grew 20% year over year. Also, since the rollout of its “Smarter Pickup Times” technology, there has been a significant increase in digital orders and higher guest satisfaction. As the company’s digital orders are made on a second make-line, it allows the company to deliver excellent throughput and enhance the experience of customers who are increasingly shifting to digital ordering.In 2018, the company plans to accelerate the rollout of second make-lines, which will enable a faster, more accurate experience for digital customers and allow the restaurant crews to support higher sales volumes. The company expects at least 30% of its restaurants to be endowed with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018.High Costs and Stiff Competition Remain ConcernsChipotle’s continued efforts to connect with its customers in order to retrieve their trust and loyalty, as well as bring them back to its stores on the back of high marketing and promo expenses, have been hurting its profitability. Moreover, the company is incurring additional costs to support its newly-designed food safety program. In addition to wages, Chipotle is also facing high labor costs from training its workers to aptly implement food-safety practices.Also, competition from fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining restaurateurs like BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report) is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, food quality, service, location and concept, which may impact Chipotle’s operating margins and profits, going forward.Chipotle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1147,YUM,"The restaurant industry has been lacking zing over the past few quarters. Negative comps resulting from sluggish traffic, along with rising costs, continue to take the shine out of restaurant stocks.Nevertheless, some of the big names like McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) have done well on the back of strong fundamentals and innovative offerings.In fact, McDonald's and Yum! Brands are two companies that have adopted a de-risking strategy, dropping their ownership of restaurants through refranchising. This reduces capital requirements, boosts earnings per share growth and makes them less vulnerable to food inflation.In addition, growing free cash flow allows both the companies to make investments for increasing brand recognition and shareholder returns.With both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let’s find out which company is placed better with respect to some key parameters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Share Price MovementYear to date, McDonald's has had a more impressive run on the bourse with a return of 41.2% while Yum! Brands has gained 30.3% in the last year. Notably, both have outperformed the industry that has rallied 14.4% in the same time frame.Projected Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. Earnings growth is definitely necessary and it along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Both McDonald's and Yum! brands have their own initiatives in place to boost earnings. While McDonald's is keen on operational excellence, product innovation, offering a value menu and rolling out more limited-time offerings, Yum! Brands is working on a strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands. It is also shifting toward a single point-of-sale system in the United States.Yum! Brands is expected to see higher earnings growth than McDonald's in 2018. Its EPS is projected to grow 13.1% while that of McDonald's is expected to increase 6.8%.  So, Yum! Brands has an edge over McDonald's in this respect.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Both McDonald's and Yum! Brands have outperformed the industry year to date, which has a net margin TTM of 15.8%. However, McDonald's has a lead since its TTM net margin is higher at 22.4%, compared with Yum! Brands 16.1.Valuation The EV/EBITDA ratio offers a clear picture of a company’s valuation and its earnings potential. Typically, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. This signals that a stock is undervalued.Both McDonald's and Yum! Brands are overvalued relative to their broader industry that has an EV/EBIDA value of 13.8. However, McDonald's holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 16.1, compared to Yum! Brands’ 19.8.Earnings History, ESP and EstimatesBoth McDonald's and Yum! Brands have delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the prior four quarters. While McDonald's has an average earnings surprise of 5.2%, Yum! stands out with an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.However, McDonald's Earnings ESPof +0.54% lends it an edge over Yum! Brands, which has an Earnings ESP of -7.04%.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's full year has increased 0.15% over the last 30 days, it has remained unchanged in case of Yum! Brands over the same time frame.To ConcludeOur comparative analysis reveals that McDonald's has an edge over Yum! Brands in terms of share price movement, net margin, EV/EBITA ratio, Earnings ESP and estimate revisions. Yum! Brands, on the other hand, is better poised than McDonald's in terms of projected EPS and boasts a solid earnings surprise track record.So, with a lead in most of the evaluated metrics, McDonald's, appears to take precedence at the moment.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1148,YUM,"Like most U.S. restaurant chains, BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) is facing the brunt of soft consumer spending. The company believes that greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives will help it counter the challenging sales environment.         Although the company slowed down its expansion plans for 2017 and 2018, it has not entirely refrained from unit growth in the year.In regard to this, BJ’s Restaurants recently announced the opening of its first restaurant in Taylor, MI. Located at the Southland Center, the 7,500-square feet BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse seats approximately 230 guests and features a wide-ranging menu.The Taylor restaurant is the last store to be opened by the company this year, reaching the current-year restaurant count to 10.Efforts to Counter Challenging SalesThe company plans to open only four to six restaurants in 2018. The curtailment in openings might further dent the company’s sales in a space that is dominated by big names like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), among others.Notably, BJ’s Restaurants shares have lost 8.8% year to date, while its industry grew 14.3%.The company’s decision to slow down openings for some time and instead focus more on enterprise resources to drive sales might turn out to be favorable providing momentum to margins and free cash flow. When combined with the company’s conservative balance sheet, these measures are likely to provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases.BJ’s Restaurants is focused on sales building strategies that can help drive the top line. By implementing these strategies, the company aims to differentiate its food quality and uniqueness, improve speed of service and redefine its brand messaging and media strategies.Menu innovation continues to be the restaurant’s major traffic-building strategy. The company has developed a robust pipeline of menu items, including several new items focused on its EnLIGHTened menu category, featuring new super food options. Its slow roast menu also continues to drive healthy check growth.Moreover, given the fact that off-premise sales represent a considerable revenue growth opportunity, the company has been undertaking various efforts to enhance delivery and take-out services. In fact, it intends to leverage its high rated mobile app and website, along with new third-party delivery partners to drive growth in off-premise sales. Resultantly, off-premise sales grew roughly 17% in the third quarter and is further increasing on incremental sales and traffic.The company expanded its daily Brewhouse specials, which showcase several of its popular signature menu items at attractive prices.This is likely to drive traffic further for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

Consequently, Red Robin has slowed down on its unit growth plan for 2017 and 2018. However, it has not completely refrained from it.Recently, the company announced its plan to open a Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brew restaurant in Clarksville, IN, on Nov 27.The latest outlet will include its signature items like Royal Red Robin Burger, Bottomless Steak Fries, Smoke & Pepper Burger, and Red's Tavern Double on the menu along with Freckled Lemonade. Additionally, it will serve Black & Bleu Burger, The Marco Pollo, the Southern Charm Burger along with a variety of salads, entrees, soups and wraps.Currently, there are 570 Red Robin restaurants across the United States and Canada.Yet, the company loses out in terms of international presence. While several other restaurant chains including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Red Robin seems to be weak on this front.Additionally, higher labor, remodeling, restaurant maintenance and pre-opening costs may continue to hurt margins. Also, Red Robin is investing heavily in several sales building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades, which will result in elevated costs.In fact, the company’s shares have declined 12.2% year to date, as against the industry’s growth of 10.4%. Given an uncertain sales environment along with rising costs, we find the stock’s upside potential to be limited.  Nevertheless, Red Robin’s efforts to improve sales and regain market share via efficient menu innovation, operational improvement, effective marketing strategy and remodeling programs are encouraging.Particularly, its focus on value offerings along with a growing off-premise, online ordering business is expected to ensure that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company remains affordable for dine-in and carry-out guests alike.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1150,YUM,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Apart from the earnings release, Starbucks made other major announcements. First, Starbucks lowered long-term financial targets, cutting the annual earnings growth forecast to 12% versus the prior guidance for 15%-20%. The company expects global same-store sales or comps of 3-5% and high single-digit net revenue growth (versus prior expectation of 10% or greater).Second, the premium coffee giant has entered into an agreement to sell Tazo tea to Unilever for $384 million. The deal includes the Tazo brand, signature recipes, intellectual property and inventory and allows Starbucks to focus its tea strategy on Teavana.Starbucks shares dipped more than 3% following the news release on Nov 2, possibly in response to the lowered long-term targets and weak fourth-quarter results.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 55 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but grew 10% year over year.Total fourth-quarter sales of $5.7 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion by 0.6% and remained unchanged from the year-ago level. The underperformance was due to the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey, which affected the company’s overall top line as well as U.S. comp growth by 1%. This was because more than 1,000 stores had to be temporarily closed due to storm-related reasons.Global same-store sales increased 2%, lower than 4% growth in the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter compared with 4% in the previous quarter. Transactions increased 1%.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 360 basis points (bps) year over year to 17.9% in the quarter due to higher partner investments, primarily in the Americas segment, and the lapping of the 53rd week in the year ago quarter. Again, product mix shift, largely towards food, a higher donation to The Starbucks Foundation, and restructuring and impairments cost added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 90 bps to 20%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were down 0.5% year over year to $3.9 billion.Comps rise of 3% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 5% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 1% increase in average ticket.The company's core espresso, tea and refreshment beverages contributed 2% to comps growth in the U.S. Food sales contributed 2%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the U.S. are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase of from 25% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 390 bps to 24% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by hurricanes, higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 2.5% to $859.9 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 2%, higher than 1% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth delivering 8% in the quarter, its strongest in nine quarters. Japan’s comp growth improved sequentially. Store and market profitability in Japan were robust, with comp growth in core food, tea, and espresso categories.Starbucks' licensed joint venture markets, including East China and South Korea, continue to contribute to CAP's performance in the quarter. Again, South Korea marks its fifth-largest global market, with system sales exceeding $1 billion in fiscal 2017, with double-digit comp growth in the year, underscoring the broad success Starbucks is having across the region.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 60 bps year over year to 23.5% in the quarter buoyed by strong sales leverage and higher JV income. These are partly offset by an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were down 0.1% year over year at $269.9 million in the segment as higher revenues from addition of new stores were offset by an extra week in the year-ago period.That said, comps grew 1% (against 2% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 330 bps to 12.9% due to softer performance in its company-owned markets and a 210-basis-point impact from a tax settlement in the quarter.Channel Development (CPG): This segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo teas, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages (like Frappuccino and Starbucks Refreshers) and Starbucks and Tazo-branded K-Cup packs sold through channels such as grocery, specialty retailers, and foodservice, to name a few.Channel Development's net revenues declined 0.7% to $514.9 million.Operating margin expanded 80 bps to 47.9%.All-Other: The segment comprises emerging brands like Teavana (acquired in Dec 2012), Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 9.2% to $104.6 million.Fiscal 2017 HighlightsThe company’s non-GAAP earnings came in at $2.06 per share, increasing 11.4% year over year. Net revenues were $22.4 billion, up 5% on 3% global comps growth.The company’s non-GAAP operating income increased 7.8% to $4.4 billion in the year and corresponding margin expanded 10 bps.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks projected global comp growth at 3-5% based on the addition of approximately 2,300 net new stores globally.Consolidated operating margin is likely to be slightly up, excluding the impact of the change in ownership structure in East China on operating margin.The company expects its GAAP EPS to grow more than 40%.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS growth of 12-13%, or $2.30-$2.33 per share in fiscal 2018 with growth in the second half to be a shade higher than the first half.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1152,YUM,"Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.’s (PLAY  -  Free Report) unique business model, rigorous sales-building initiatives and relentless expansion plans are encouraging. However, high cost of operations and the company’s limited international presence raise concerns.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company reported better-than-expected results, wherein both the top and bottom lines increased year over year. Results were aided by solid revenues generated from the Food and Beverage, as well as the Amusement and Other segments.Dave & Buster’s continues to perform well on the back of unique customizable experience that it offers across four platforms, “Eat, Drink, Play and Watch”. Backed by this exclusive experience, shares of the company have gained 22.8% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 3.8%.Distinct Business Model Favors RevenuesDave & Buster’s exclusive business model focuses on entertainment business, alongside food and beverage offerings. This dual model helps the company generate favorable store economics and strong return.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, amusement and other revenues accounted for 57.9% of total revenues, proving a major reason for its success. In fact, the segment’s revenues grew 10.4% year over year. This is because, increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company from the headwinds of consumer-discretionary spending that characterizes the restaurant industry, and is in turn driving market share and comps. Also, the shift toward increased focus on amusement is driving Dave & Buster’s earnings, given its higher-margin business. In fact, this unique model sets it apart and we expect the company’s entertainment business to carry the growth story forward.Rapid Store Openings Bode WellDave & Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined store-growth strategy in both new and existing markets, given the broad appeal of its brand. Management believes that it can roll out the concept to more than 200 units in North America over time. In the first quarter of 2018, the company opened 6 stores. Also, out of the 112 stores it currently operates, 26 stores are new. So far this year, the company already opened nine stores and has five under construction. It plans to further ride on new store growth in 2019 and early 2020.In fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to open 14-15 new stores, including two latest 17-K format stores, a combination of eight stores in the new markets for D&B, with the remaining located in markets where the brand is already established. With these new store openings, it intends to achieve a 13-14% annual unit growth rate.Meanwhile, in addition to North America’s growth potential, management is positive about the brand’s significant appeal in certain international markets. Notably, the company’s first international opening outside Canada is anticipated in 2018.High Costs Amid a Competitive Industry Hurt Dave & Buster’sHigher labor costs due to increased wages and those incurred due to implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure. This means that restaurant operators such as Dave & Buster’s that has numerous company-owned units and laborers will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs, which in turn will hurt margins.Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster’s, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs onto the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Moreover, the retail restaurant space is highly competitive, as numerous restaurant operators are adopting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. Amid such stiff competition, Dave & Buster’s is missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing.We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Currently, Dave & Buster’s carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1153,YUM,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is YUM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Yum! Brands Q1 Earnings & Revenues Surpass EstimatesYum! Brands delivered better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2018. Adjusted earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. Further, earnings surged 38% year over year. The shift to refranchising substantially bolstered the company’s operating margin and earnings per share. Further, the trend is expected to continue.Total revenues of $1,371 million were down 3% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,082 million. The decline in total revenues was mainly due to decrease in company sales as an impact of its continued strategic refranchising initiative.Segmental PerformanceYum! Brands reports under three segments — KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.KFC revenues were $658 million, down 10% on a year-over-year basis. Comps at the KFC division dipped 2% compared with the year-ago quarter’s rise of 2% and the previous quarter’s increase of 3%.Segment operating margin was up 5.3% to 33.6% year over year owing to refranchising and same-store sales growth.At Pizza Hut, revenues were $251 million, up 8% on a year-over-year basis. Comps were up 1% against the year-ago quarter’s decline of 3% and preceding quarter’s increase of 1%. Segment operating margin was down 0.6% year over year to 35%.Taco Bell revenues were $462 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Comps were up 1%, which compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter growth of 8%. Segment operating margin was down 2.7% to 28.5% year over year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to six lower.Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus | Yum! Brands, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, YUM has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, YUM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1154,YUM,"With Chipotle’s (CMG  -  Free Report) new CEO Brian Niccol at the helm, the first quarter could mark the start of a better era for the embattled fast casual chain. But before investors get too caught up in what Niccol might change long-term, they should look at what to expect from Chipotle’s upcoming first quarter financial results.Chipotle’s new chief executive, and the former head of Yum Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Taco Bell didn’t officially take over until early March. This means that any business innovations Niccol might have already implemented won’t have much impact on Chipotle’s Q1 earnings results.Furthermore, amid this volatile market, investors should focus on finding stocks that are expected to post strong earnings results and avoid ones that aren’t.With that said, let’s take a look at what to expect from Chipotle as we inch closer to its first quarter earnings report.Outlook & ValuationChipotle’s Q1 revenues are projected to climb by 7.4% to reach $1.15 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the restaurant chain is expected to report quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share, which would mark a 4.4% decline from the year-ago period.Investors should also note that Chipotle has earned four earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the downside, all within the last 60 days. However, the company’s Most Accurate Estimate is $1.55 per share. This means that estimates have come in higher as we get closer to Chipotle’s Q1 earnings.Chipotle is currently trading with a Forward P/E of 36.1, which marks a substantial premium to the “Retail – Restaurants” industry’s average of 22.4.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important factor that investors might want to consider ahead of Chipotle’s Q1 earnings report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteWe can see that Chipotle’s earnings surprise history has been up and down over the last few years, which is to be expected amid a rough time for the company. It is also worth noting that Chipotle’s stock price has been highly volatile immediately following the release of its quarterly earnings results. In fact, over the last six periods, Chipotle stock has sunk in the near-term four times.With that said, past performance does not necessarily indicate future success or failure, and we will have a better idea of where Chipotle stands closer to its report date, which is scheduled for April 25.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1155,YUM,"Shares of Papa John's (PZZA  -  Free Report) dipped 1.63% on Monday just one day before the company is set to report its first quarter financial results, which could signal that investors are nervous about the pizza giant. Let’s take a quick look to see if they should be.Before Monday’s dive, Papa John’s had seen its stock price tank 26% over the last year and nearly 4% during the last four weeks as investors assess how and if the company can transform itself going forward after a turbulent six months.Papa John’s grabbed headlines at the tail end of 2017 when it blamed the NFL for slumping sales. Since then, its founder stepped down as CEO and Yum Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut took over as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL—a gig that Papa John’s once pointed to as a huge reason for the company’s growth and success.With that said, a strong quarter could turn things around, which means investors need to understand what to expect from Papa John’s upcoming earnings report.Papa John's Q1 OutlookPapa John's is projected to see its quarterly revenues sink 1.6% from the year-ago period to hit $441.95 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On the other end of the income statement, the pizza chain’s quarterly earnings are expected to plummet by 16.2% to $0.62 per share.Meanwhile, Papa John's has also earned one earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the downside, within the last 30 days. Still, investors need to know a little more in order to understand if Papa John's is actually expected to beat or miss our current earnings estimate. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Papa John's Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.61 per share, which falls 1 cent below our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of -1.61%.This means that Papa John's is a stock that could fall short of earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Tuesday. Therefore, investors might want to stay away from Papa John’s stock until they see how the first quarter plays out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1156,YUM,"In a bid to drive customer loyalty and engagement, El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report) partnered with one of the largest independently-owned digital, customer relationship management and channel marketing agencies in the United States — Ansira, LLC.The U.S. restaurant industry has been under the weather over the past few quarters as continued soft consumer spending on dining out has dented sales. Resultantly, same-store sales growth has been weak. Foot traffic also declined lowering profits at many restaurants.Given the challenging sales environment, it is imperative for restaurants to understand their customers and what motivates them to drive profits. Ansira will help El Pollo Loco, by analyzing data, to improve customer insights and individual customer engagement.Ansira’s data analysis approach will allow El Pollo Loco to better acquire, retain and engage customers as the company continues to grow and invest in its Loco Rewards program.Meanwhile, in order to survive in a challenging sales environment, restaurant operators like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are continuously improvising the menu, re-imaging stores and offering loyalty programs. In this era consumers are increasingly looking for technological convenience, which has shaped the U.S. restaurant space as well, as an increasing number of chains are deploying technology to enhance guest experience.El Pollo Loco has been keeping up on this front as well. The company announced the launch of several digital initiatives to boost sales, like the loyalty program called Loco Rewards. The company will continue to invest in loyalty program, which it believes will drive frequency and in turn sales in 2018 and beyond.We note that shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date. The stock lost 14% against the industry’s growth of 12.1%.

1157,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) had a good share of negative publicity throughout 2016 due to an issue of food-borne illnesses that surfaced toward 2015-end. As a safety measure, the company was forced to close several outlets. Ever since then, this fast-casual Mexican chain has been undertaking aggressive efforts to restore its economic model as well as regain customer trust.However, high costs associated with restaurant operations and stiff competition in the fast-casual restaurant space continue to remain potent headwinds.Notably, shares of the company have lost 25.6% in the past year, widely underperforming its industry’s growth of 10.2%. Will the Appointment of New CEO Bring Any Change?In order to chalk out a viable business strategy, Chipotle discarded its former co-CEO model and appointed Steve Ells as the company’s sole CEO in 2016. However, the company did not refrain from enhancing its board. Toward this end, Chipotle recently appointed former Yum! Brands' (YUM  -  Free Report) executive Brian Niccol to replace Ells. Chipotle aims to make use of Brian Niccol's expertise in restaurant operations, digital technologies, and branding to augment guest experience.Although the appointment of the new CEO might help in Chipotle’s turnaround, it is yet to be seen if he can bring about remarkable positive changes for the company. This is because strategies followed at a quick-service restaurant like Taco Bell are not likely to work for Chipotle, which is more of a healthier fast-casual option.High Costs and Stiff Competition Remain ConcernsChipotle’s continued efforts to connect with its customers in order to retrieve their trust and loyalty, as well as bring them back to its stores on the back of high marketing and promo expenses have been hurting its profitability. Moreover, the company is incurring additional costs to support its newly designed food safety program. In addition to wages, Chipotle is also facing high labor costs from training its workers to aptly implement food safety practices.Also, competition from fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining restaurateurs like BJ’s Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO  -  Free Report) is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, food quality, service, location and concept, which may adversely impact Chipotle’s operating margins and profits.Sales Building Efforts a RespiteChipotle’s strong marketing initiatives, ongoing improvements in customer experience, improved digital ordering channels, along with increased focus on menu innovation are the key growth drivers. Owing to these efforts, Chipotle somewhat managed to witness 7.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. By focusing extensively on digital innovation, the company hit new records as its digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales in the last reported quarter.Furthermore, adoption of new food safety protocols is expected to reap results in the long term. In March 2017, Chipotle fulfilled its pledge to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in any of its ingredients. In fact, the company now makes use of only 51 real ingredients to prepare all of its food, in stark contrast to most other fast food chains.Chipotle’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone should thus aid in driving traffic and sales.Zacks Rank Chipotle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1158,YUM,"El Pollo Loco, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of its latest restaurant.  Located at 1400 E. Beltline Rd., this marks the first restaurant to be opened in Richardson.The 2,660 square foot restaurant will be accommodating roughly 64 guests and serve the company’s signature Mexican-inspired entrees.Notably, shares of the company have lost 19.4% in the past six months against the industry’s gain of 9.3%.Continued Focus on ‘Vision Design’The new restaurant is part of El Pollo Loco’s ‘Vision Design’ initiative. Restaurants under this program offer authentic Mexican-inspired atmosphere that includes El Pollo Loco’s menu and brand identity. The restaurants also have an open kitchen layout to display the preparation of the signature dish. The company believes that its vision model will position it better in the quick-service restaurant space. According to El Polo Loco, it is witnessing encouraging results from the implementation of this model in various company-owned and franchised restaurants. The company also aims to reduce costs and drive sales through this initiative.For 2018, the El Polo Loco targets to open six to eight company-owned restaurants and six to eight new franchise locations, all of which will feature the Vision Design.Limited Expansion Poses ConcernAlthough the latest move emphasizes the company’s rigorous expansion strategy, it also shows that the company is only expanding within its domestic periphery. While other restaurant operators like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion, El Pollo Loco is losing out in terms of international presence.Wrapping UpThe move underscores El Pollo Loco’s strategies for reaching out to a greater number of customers. The distinguished menu that is served in the restaurant also shows the company’s focus on enriching guest experience to drive foot traffic and sales.El Pollo Loco’s aggressive sales building efforts like relentless focus on providing excellent service, reasonable pricing and advertising campaigns are encouraging. However, high costs related to the execution of various sales-building initiatives have kept profits under pressure.Zacks RankEl Pollo Loco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1159,YUM,"Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR  -  Free Report) has been undertaking various sales-boosting initiatives that should continue to drive the company’s top line.However, intense competition and tricky consumer demand continue to be potential headwinds. The company’s shares have lost 7% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 1.8%. Moreover, downward estimate revisions for the current quarter reflect ongoing pessimism in the stock’s prospects. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have gone down 6% over the past month.Sales-Building Efforts to Drive Top-Line GrowthRestaurant Brands continues to focus on improving its level of service through comprehensive training, improved restaurant operations, reimaging efforts and attractive menu options to enhance overall guest satisfaction, and thereby drive comps. It believes that new product development is a key driver of long-term success for its brands, and will continue to be in focus in 2018 and beyond.This is expected to drive traffic of the company by expanding its customer base, spreading out into new dayparts, and continuing to build brand leadership in food quality and taste.The company has unwavering focus on its goal to drive traffic and revenues at its restaurants through core product platforms, continual focus on a balanced menu design, expansion of delivery business, promotional offerings, efforts to grow breakfast daypart and product launches. Growth across each of its breakfast, lunch and dinner dayparts, supported by new products, is driving incremental sales at Tim Hortons restaurants. Its coffee, cold beverage, wraps and breakfast sandwich platforms, particularly continue to reflect strength.In 2017, the company launched espresso-based beverages in all Tim Hortons restaurants across Canada. Management expects this platform to continue growing, given the meaningful innovation it can introduce around its base products.Restaurant Brands is also taking initiatives to re-image its restaurants to a more modern décor. In March 2018, Restaurant Brands announced a new Tim Hortons restaurant design called the welcome image, which entails a redesign of Tim Hortons restaurants. The company plans to re-image a majority of its restaurants across Canada over the next four years.Franchised Model Safeguards Earnings but Limits OperationsGiven that almost 100% of Restaurant Brands’ current system-wide restaurants are franchised, its expenses are considerably low. Since the company signs franchise agreements for all its restaurants instead of operating them itself, this puts the cost burden on the franchisees that operate the businesses.Thus, the reduced capital requirements are expected to facilitate earnings growth and ROE expansion for the company. Notably, Restaurant Brands have witnessed year-over-year earnings growth in each of the trailing four quarters.However, despite such positives, a fully-franchised model has its share of drawbacks and risks. Under this business model, the company’s prospects depend on its ability to attract new franchisees for all its brands, and the willingness of the franchisees to open restaurants in the existing and new markets. The company has a limited influence over its franchisees, as a result of which its ability to control its restaurants’ operations, and implement operational initiatives and business strategies is restricted.Cutthroat Competition Remains a HeadwindIntense competition among fast-casual, quick-service and casual dining segments of the restaurant industry is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, food quality, service, location and concept, which may in turn impact Restaurant Brands’ revenues. The company is increasingly facing competitive pressure from restaurant bigwigs like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino's (DPZ  -  Free Report) and YUM! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report).If this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company does not make pragmatic use of advanced technologies to innovate across value chains, it has high chances of fading out like many other restaurant retailers.

1160,YUM,"YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) looks promising on the back of its effort to drive growth by developing its three iconic global brands and creating a more efficient cost structure. In the past year, shares of the company have rallied 22.2%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 4.8%. However, the stock recently came under pressure after the company’s comps growth came in below the analyst expectations. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystIn the first quarter of 2018, Yum Brands’ completed the second year of its transformation journey. By relying extensively on the four key drivers of growth — distinctive, relevant and easy brands; unmatched franchise operating capability; bold restaurant developments; and unrivaled culture and talent — the company remains on track to achieve its target.Additionally, the digital wave has hit the U.S. fast casual restaurant sector. More and more restaurants are deploying technology to enhance guest experience. Yum! Brands is also not far behind in this race as the company seems to continue with its transformation process toward a single point-of-sale system in the United States. Evidently, in fourth-quarter 2017, Yum! Brands announced a partnership with online food delivery platform, Grubhub, to enhance online sales and delivery from its restaurants. The company has started integrating all KFC and Taco Bell restaurants with Grubhub in the first quarter.Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has adopted a de-risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising. In first-quarter 2018, Yum Brands’ had franchise ownership of 97% and is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised. It expects to possess less than 1,000 company-owned restaurants by the end of 2018.We believe that refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company’s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Additionally, free cash flow will continue to grow, facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return.Remarkably, this shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company’s operating margin over the years. Also, it has helped Yum Brands’ to post year-over-year growth in earnings over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing six quarters.ConcernsDespite reporting better-than-expected results in the first-quarter 2018 the company’s shares recently came under pressure after its comps growth of 1% came in below the analyst expectations.Additionally, the company is highly exposed to various macroeconomic headwinds due to continual expansion in international markets. Therefore, Yum Brands’ earnings remain highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. Also, an increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance as well as other operating costs, such as rent and energy costs remain concerns for the company.  A competitive retail environment might hurt the restaurants’ costs as well.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report), Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (TACO  -  Free Report) and Denny's Corp. (DENN  -  Free Report). All these stocks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1162,YUM,"Leading global pizza delivery company Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) has recently extended benefit to its loyalty members. The company is granting reward points to loyalty customers irrespective of their mode of placing orders.Good news is that with this move, Domino’s becomes the first and only national pizza delivery chain to offer such an incentive for orders placed online, via its AnyWare ordering channels, phone or in-store.Domino’s initially used to lend its loyalty members with Piece of the Pie Rewards points for making online purchases. However, in order to benefit all loyalty customers, the company has undertaken such a pervasive measure.Launched in 2015, the company’s digital loyalty program — Piece of the Pie Rewards — now includes millions of members. Through point accumulation, customers win free orders from the company on buying over a certain limit. In fact, the program continues to significantly contribute to traffic gains.It is important to note that the company has been increasingly focusing on technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales and navigate the soft trend in consumer-spending, currently faced by the U.S. restaurant space.The company’s world-class digital ordering platforms include Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and also ordering via a Pizza emoji. The extended ways to order a pizza has thus positioned the company in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience, leaving behind peers like Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands, Inc.’s (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut.In fact, this emphasis on technology innovation had helped Domino’s reach an estimated $5.6 billion in global digital sales in 2016.Evidently, Domino’s shares have outperformed the industry over a year. The stock has rallied 24.2% compared with the 7.4% gain of the industry. Additionally, over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter as well as yearly estimates have gone up 5.1% and 4.5%, respectively, reflecting analysts’ optimism.The latest move to extend benefits to loyalty members should further drive traffic and keep this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in a competitively advantageous position.

1163,YUM,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 19. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this home furnishings retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 12.1% in the last reported quarter. Further, the company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.1% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 95 cents, reflecting a year-over year decline of 14.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. On the positive side, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.01 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayBed Bath & Beyond has been reeling under sluggish mall traffic, which has been hurting performance for quite some time. Also, increased net direct-to-consumer shipping costs along with higher coupon and advertising costs are hurting results.Consequently, the company has put up a dismal show for the last several quarters. Evidently, the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last 10 quarters. Moreover, the top line has lagged the consensus mark in nine of the trailing 11 quarters. In fact, the trend continued in first-quarter fiscal 2017 too, wherein both the top and bottom line lagged estimates.Moreover, management retained previously issued dismal bottom-line outlook for fiscal 2017, as it expects better visibility after the fiscal second quarter. Thus, the company continues to envision current-year earnings per share to decline in the range of low-single digits percentage to 10%. However, it continues to anticipate gross margin decline in fiscal 2017, alongside SG&A deleverage due to payroll and payroll-related expenses as well as technology expenses.Notably, Bed Bath & Beyond has underperformed the broader industry in the past month, reflecting a negative investor sentiment ahead of earnings. The company’s shares have plunged 5%, compared with the industry’s dip of 0.9%.Nevertheless, the company’s focus on strategic initiatives like e-Commerce enhancement and improvement of customer services bode well. This is evident from its recent store realignment plan. Further, comps from customer-facing digital networks grew over 20% in the last reported quarter. These along with capital initiatives and constant shareholder-friendly moves should draw investors’ attention.Though Bed Bath & Beyond is striving hard to spark a turnaround, the current dismal trends cannot simply be overlooked. So, let’s see what is in store for the company in the upcoming release.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bed Bath & Beyond to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1164,YUM,"Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) has been grappling with declining sales for quite some time.   Despite economic growth, consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out, which resulted in low consumption and decreased demand in the U.S. restaurant space.The company’s shares have lost 2% in the last six months as against the industry’s gain of 4.3%.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has moved down 10.6% and 7.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and full year 2018, respectively. This reflects bearish analyst sentiments.Let’s delve deeper into the company’s pressing concerns —Declining Sales Pose ConcernThe U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing for investors over the past few quarters as continued softness in consumer spending on dining out has dented sales. Resultantly, comps growth has been weak. Foot traffic also declined lowering profits at many restaurants. Resultantly, Jack in the Box’s sales are under pressure.The company recorded total revenues of $1.55 billion in fiscal 2017 as compared with $1.6 billion in fiscal 2016. Moreover, comps at the company-owned stores were down 1.1% in fiscal 2017, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year’s flat comps. Comps at company-owned Qdoba restaurants were down 3%, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year rise of 1.7%.We note that the consensus estimate for fiscal 2018 revenues is pegged at $1.3 billion, reflecting a 14.9% year-over-year decline.Sales Deleverage & Other ExpensesNotably, persistent decline in comps has dented Jack in the Box’s sales. Capital expenditure has also been high. Moreover, rise in labor wages and commodity inflation are also adding to the woes. This has reduced the company’s restaurant operating margin by 210 basis points (bps) in fiscal 2017.In order to drive margins, the company plans on shifting to a less capital-intensive business model and focus more on core operations to pay off debt under term loan. Toward this end, Jack in the Box recently sold its Qdoba subsidiary to a private equity firm. The company believes that the sale will help strengthen liquidity.However, sales deleverage from negative comps are expected to weigh on profits.Refranchising Yet to Pay OffIn order to drive margins, the company’s Jack in the Box brand has been refranchising company-owned restaurants for quite some time now. Jack in the Box restaurants are currently 88% franchised, which the company plans to increase to around 95%. The company believes that the refranchising will considerably lower the general and administrative expenses and in turn boost earnings. Moreover, over the long term, such measures will generate a higher return on equity (ROE) by lowering capital requirements. This will also boost free cash flow, thereby enhancing shareholders’ return. However, contrary to the desirable effects of refranchising, we note that the company’s trailing 12-month ROE is -30.5% as against the industry’s 6.9%. This reflects management’s inability to reinvest shareholder’s money effectively.Limited International Presence, Stiff CompetitionAmerican dining brands are keen on expanding in the fast-growing emerging markets. While several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report)and Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened outlets in emerging markets; Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front. Thus, limited international presence might be a big drag for the company and hurt its competitive position. Moreover, the company is experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.To conclude, we believe that a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the above reasons underscore the fact why you should steer clear of Jack in the Box.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Further, earnings surged 38% year over year. The shift to refranchising substantially bolstered the company’s operating margin and earnings per share. Further, the trend is expected to continue.Total revenues of $1,371 million were down 3% year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,082 million. The decline in total revenues was mainly due to decrease in company sales as an impact of its continued strategic refranchising initiative.Despite reporting better-than-expected results the company’s shares are down nearly 5% in pre-market trading session after its comps growth of 1% came in below the analyst expectations.  Nevertheless, shares of Yum!

1167,YUM,"Despite strong quarterly earnings results from industry heavyweights last week, stocks fell by midday Monday. With that said, this week once again features some big-name companies that might have to really impress in order to move the needle.Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) all posted strong quarterly earnings results last week. Yet none of them have been able to sustain any real post-earnings momentum. This week,  Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) are all scheduled to report their quarterly financials (also read: Upcoming Earnings Reports to Watch: MCD, AAPL, TSLA).Yet while these industry giants are set to grab a lot of attention, other recognizable companies are also scheduled to report their quarterly earnings results. Therefore, investors should look for stocks that are expected to report better-than-expected earnings while avoiding any companies that could disappoint.  Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these weak stocks in order to help them identify the high-risk companies ahead of their upcoming earnings reports.Check them out now:1.      Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report)Fitbit stock surged on Monday after the company announced a new healthcare-focused partnership with Alphabet's (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google. Prior to today’s gains, shares of Fitbit had climbed nearly 4% over the last month in a sign that investors might expect the struggling fitness wearable giant to turn things around. Our current consensus estimates don’t support this optimism. Fitbit’s quarterly revenues are expected to fall by over 17.5% to hit $246.08 million. The company is also projected to report an adjusted quarterly loss of $0.20 per share, which would mark a 33.3% decline.Meanwhile, Fitbit’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for an adjusted loss $0.21 per share, which is 1 cent worse than our current consensus estimate. Fitbit is also currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and sports an Earnings ESP of -6.33%. This means Fitbit is a stock that could fall short of earnings estimates when it reports after market close on Wednesday, May 2.2.       Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report)Shares of Yum Brands have climbed nearly 32% over the last year and have managed to experience gains over the last few months while many other stocks have experienced at least a marginal decline. Looking ahead, Yum’s quarterly earnings are expected to pop by 4.6% to reach $0.68 per share.However, investors will be disappointed to note that the owner of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken is projected to see its Q1 revenues sink by 23.9% to hit $1.08 billion. Yum is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an Earnings ESP of -1.18%. Yum’s negative ESP figure comes from the fact that its Most Accurate Estimate falls 1 cent below our current consensus estimates. Therefore, investors might want to avoid Yum before it reports its Q1 earnings on Wednesday morning.  3.       Square (SQ  -  Free Report)Square stock sunk 2.8% through early afternoon trading on Monday just two days before it is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results, which might mean that investors are apprehensive. Square's Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 35.1% to reach $623.75 million. On the other end of the income statement, Square is expected to report quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share, which is exactly the same figure it posted in the year-ago period. With that said, Square is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that rocks an Earnings ESP of -0.44%. This means that Square might be poised to miss earnings estimates, meaning investors should be cautious about the stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1168,YUM,"On Sep 11, we issued an updated research report on the world's largest restaurant company in terms of system units, Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report).Currently, the company owns, operates and franchises nearly 44,000 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories. In fact, its brands — KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell — are regarded as the global leaders of the chicken, pizza and Mexican-style food categories.Key Growth DriversFollowing China business spin-off, we are positive on Yum! Brands’ endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner, more efficient cost structure. In addition, the company is focusing on bold restaurant development as well as unrivaled culture and talent to drive continued growth.While the Pizza Hut brand’s international division has been largely doing well, Yum! Brands is working on a number of areas to get its fair share of growth in the U.S. market and mark a turnaround. To this end, the company entered into an agreement with the Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees. Per the agreement, Yum! Brands will invest roughly $130 million to improve brand marketing alignment as well as accelerate enhancements to operations and technology. This is expected to increase convenience for customers and the company expects to see the results pay off in 2018 and beyond.Moreover, Pizza Hut recently announced the launch of — Hut Rewards — its national loyalty program. Furthering its delivery-centric strategy, the brand also announced its plans to hire 14,000 drivers by the end of 2017.At KFC, management is focused on convenience and expects to further increase brand engagement. Also, the brand expects to boost sales through a big push on the digital front in 2017 with self-ordering kiosks and a mobile site. Meanwhile, at KFC International, the company is aggressively pursuing its global delivery initiative, given the fact that the service is considered to be the fastest growing channel in the business.In fact, nearly 20,000 restaurants across the entire Yum! Brands system offer delivery, which is almost 50% of the company’s total restaurants.Markedly, management seeks to continue developing the Taco Bell brand through continued focus on innovation and value, expanding its delivery program, inventive marketing strategies and extended line of breakfast offerings. On international front too, Taco Bell continues to build momentum with new restaurant openings in various markets, given the growing enthusiasm for the brand and its improving economics.The company’s digital efforts has increased manifold with all its three bands’ deploying technology to enhance guest experience. Also, the company is continuing its transformation process toward a single point-of-sale system in the United States by 2017-end.Notably, the China division’s spin-off has largely made Yum! Brands a more asset-light company as many company-owned restaurants have been in the Chinese market. Moreover, Yum! Brands is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised by the end of 2018. Thus, it expects to become a ""pure play"" franchisor with more stable earnings, higher profit margins, lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion,Going forward, Yum! Brands aims to revamp its financial profile and thereby improve the efficiency of its organization and cost structure, globally. To this end, management anticipates to cut capital expenditures to about $100 million by 2019, increase free cash flow conversion to 100% and also reduce General and Administrative (G&A) expenditure by approximately $300 million (or 1.7% of system sales).Over the next three years, the company is also committed to return an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Resultantly, Yum! Brands expects an EPS of $3.75 or more in 2019, which is first clean year post-transformation.In fact, the company’s efforts have already started to reap benefits as reflected by the positive stock price movement. Evidently, post-separation, shares of Yum! Brands have gained 28.2%, outperforming the 14.1% growth of the industry it belongs to.Also, the current quarter and year’s earnings estimates moved up 3.2% and 1.1%, respectively, over the past 60 days, reflecting the ongoing optimism in the stock.ConcernsYum! Brands is highly exposed to various emerging nations in Latin America. In fact, these nations have been exhibiting decelerating growth for some time due to various macro headwinds, which might dent sales in the near term.Foreign exchange translation is also a concern for the company, given its significant international presence.Meanwhile, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood. Thus, a continued choppy sales environment in the domestic space is likely to keep the top line under pressure.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderYum! Brands has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1169,YUM,"A challenging industry backdrop has been hampering the performance of most restaurant chains and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) is no exception.In fact, as the operating environment remains increasingly challenging, the decline in sales volume has begun to impact the returns on the company’s new restaurant openings. Also, management noted that 2016 class of new restaurant openings generated below-expectation revenues, limiting overall revenue growth for the company.Nevertheless, at the last quarterly conference call, the company stated that the recent performance has been encouraging as the locations opened in 2017 have seen better revenue trends, more in line with past standards.Consequently, though Red Robin has slowed down on its unit growth plan for 2017 and 2018, it has not completely refrained from it.Recently, the completely announced its plan to open a new Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brew restaurant at Cedar Park, TX, on Sep 18.Apart from the signature items like Royal Red Robin Burger, Bottomless Steak Fries, Smoke & Pepper Burger, and Red's Tavern Double the menu will also feature Freckled Lemonade.

While several other restaurant chains including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Red Robin seems to be weak on this front.Nevertheless, shares of the company have gained 16.5% in a year, outperforming its industry’s growth of 7%.This performance can be attributed to rising investor confidence as the company undertakes various initiatives to improve sales and regain market share as the year progresses. To this end, Red Robin’s efforts to reinvigorate the brands through menu innovation, operational improvement, and remodeling programs are impressive.Further, Red Robin plans to grow its off-premise, online-ordering business via carry-out, delivery and catering, thus moving smartly on new revenue streams.In fact, the company expects off-premise orders to become growth engine in the second half of the year as it begins to actively promote the new offerings, reach more guests often, thus driving improved profitability.Currently, Red Robin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1172,YUM,"BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) opened its latest outlet in Columbia, SC, on Sep 4. The 7,500 square feet restaurant can accommodate nearly 230 guests.In fact, this restaurant marks the brand’s debut in the state of South Carolina. Moreover, the company is looking forward to expand its presence in the state over the next few years.The outlet also features BJ’s Restaurants’ extensive menu, including its signature deep-dish pizza, award-winning hand-crafted beer and the famous Pizookie dessert.Currently, the company operates 195 casual dining restaurants across 25 states in the United States, under its brand names like BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse, BJ’s Restaurant & Brewery, BJ’s Pizza & Grill and BJ’s Grill.Moreover, BJ’s Restaurants has opened eight new restaurants year to date and is slated to open two more this year, one each in Maryland and Michigan. This will mark the brand’s debut in the state of Michigan as well.Notably, the company has reduced the number of planned restaurant openings to 10 in 2017 compared with 17 restaurant openings in 2016. This is because it continues to believe that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic as well as revenue building initiatives.However, the slowdown in company’s 2017 development plan may somewhat dent sales growth. Also, continued weakening consumer spending in the restaurants space, might hamper the company’s traffic and sales.While several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are capitalizing on the emerging market potential, BJ’s Restaurants loses out in terms of international presence.The recent share price movement of the company – down 24.4% year to date – also compares unfavorably with its industry, which was up 6.6% in the said period.Nevertheless, the four strategic sales-building initiatives undertaken by the company to navigate through the challenging macro environment are likely to boost sales, moving ahead. A deep pipeline of new menu items, loyalty program enhancements and other productivity as well as technology-driven initiatives are also expected to boost performance. Launch of on-demand delivery and alcohol delivery too bode well for the brand’s long-term sales growth.Moreover, BJ’s Restaurants’ decision to slow down new openings for some time and instead focus even more of its enterprise resources on building sales may turn out to be favorable as it would provide some margin momentum and boost free cash flow. When combined with the company’s conservative balance sheet, these measures may provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases, going forward.BJ’s Restaurants currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1173,YUM,"On Sep 5, we issued an updated research report on quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains operator, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report).Throughout 2016 Chipotle’s results continued to be affected by the negative publicity related to the food-borne illnesses, which had surfaced toward 2015-end. Chipotle is thus leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing.Turnaround EffortsTo regain lost ground, Chipotle’s board of directors have discarded the co-CEO model and made Steve Ells the company’s sole Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in order to deal with the ongoing challenges in a better way. Ells particularly aims to focus on simplifying restaurant operations so as to offer improved service and healthier food to enhance guest experience and attract customers. Further, the company added four new members to rejuvenate its board.In addition, Chipotle aspires to strengthen its brand and recover sales by shifting strategies from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, simplification of restaurant operations, upgrade of guest experience, better operations including faster throughput and more aggressive brand marketing.The company strongly believes that there exists an opportunity to excite current customers and attract new ones through thoughtful menu development. In fact, given the early operational success it found with the queso offering, the company has expanded the test to more than 350 restaurants, in order to evaluate customer acceptance. If the results are positive, the company may even start with a national rollout as early as mid-September.The company is also likely to implement a menu price rise in the fourth quarter that should boost comps. Also, an increased focus on catering and delivery services might continue to augment the top line, going forward.Also, Chipotle is consistently attempting to make digital ordering more appealing to customers and more efficient for its restaurants with an objective to drive digital sales. Additionally, the company is on track to launch a new mobile app this year, comprising substantial improvements, to provide customers with a better quality digital experience. Though the developments are still in early days, the company is convinced to emerge a leader in digital ordering, given the momentum and positive customer reactions witnessed so far.Earlier in March, Chipotle had fulfilled its pledge of refraining from using colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in any of its ingredients. Improvement in food handling, testing and food preparation procedures remains the company’s top priority. The company’s enhanced focus on making fresh, wholesome food accessible to everyone should also aid in bringing back health-conscious clients.HeadwindsChipotle started 2017 on a positive note, marking a turnaround as its sales finally began to bounce back from the massive food safety scandal that resulted in massive sales drop and denting of reputation.However, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Presence of rodents was detected at a Dallas outlet, further adding to the woes. These might possibly hamper same-store sales, going forward.Also, Steve Ells’ qualms about the company’s ability to reach its previously announced guidance of high single digits rise in same-store sales and adjusted earnings per share of $10.00 in 2017, raises concerns.Additionally, high labor costs, rising avocado prices along with elevated marketing and promo expenses are expected to pose a threat to the restaurant chain’s profitability, while a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might limit revenue growth.Additionally, the company currently faces stiff competition from the likes of Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) owned Taco Bell and Jack in the Box Inc.’s (JACK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Qdoba. This in turn lowers the brand’s ability to easily recover and return to its peak levels of 2014.Bottom LineDespite a strong start to the year, a fresh round of food-safety fright has once again gripped the company in dilemma.  As a result, alarming questions have been raised over the company’s turnaround.Chipotle’s shares have evidently sunk 32.3% in the last three months compared with the industry’s fall of 6.3%.Nevertheless, the company’s continued focus on food safety, simplification of restaurant operations, menu innovation, improved digital offerings and increased brand marketing bode well for growth.Thus, though Chipotle is on the road to recovery, we believe, it will take some time for the company to completely restore its economic model as well as customers’ trust and return to its former glory.Chipotle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in this industry is Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the trailing four quarters, Papa John’s delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.10%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1175,YUM,"Leading global pizza delivery company Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report), in conjunction with Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report), has initiated a research on consumers’ responses to pizza delivery using self-driven vehicles.As part of the initiative, researchers from both the companies will be analyzing customer reactions from their interactions with a self-driving vehicle delivering their food. This research will help the companies understand consumers’ perspective on technologically-advanced methods of food delivery.Over the next few weeks, randomly picked Domino’s customers in Ann Arbor, MI, will have the opportunity to receive their orders through a Ford Fusion Hybrid Autonomous Research Vehicle, driven by a Ford safety engineer and staffed with researchers. Customers will also have the facility to track the delivery vehicle through an advanced version of Domino’s Tracker. Also, customers will be provided with a unique code through a text message which will allow them to receive the delivery.Notably, Domino’s has been heavily investing in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. In the pizza space, by beating competitors like Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), Domino’s has been the first to launch ordering services through social media with an efficient order tracking system.Domino's world-class digital ordering platforms like Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and ordering via a Pizza emoji has placed the company in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience.Moreover, this digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas.

1176,YUM,"Per a research note from Credit Suisse, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.’s (CMG  -  Free Report) profitability might be severely affected in the near-term, given a recent surge in avocado prices.Though the investment firm maintained its neutral rating on this quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chain operator, it lowered its price target by 4.5% to $320 from $335.Moreover, Credit Suisse slashed its estimates for Chipotle’s 2017 and 2018 earnings per share (EPS) to $6.38 and $9.57, respectively, down from $6.95 and $9.71. Also, for the third quarter, the firm expects adjusted earnings per share to come in at $1.15. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 per share is pegged well above the guidance.What’s the Fuss About?Notably, avocado is the central ingredient in guacamole. Credit Suisse analysts Jason West and Jordy Winslow note that avocado prices have amplified about 75% since mid-July and are up about 50% year over year, given shortages in Mexico and a weaker harvest in California, which are two of the largest suppliers of the green fruit.Per the analysts’ estimates, avocados make up nearly 10% of Chipotle’s cost of goods sold. Therefore, they are of the view that every 10% increase in avocado prices impacts Chipotle’s restaurant margins by 30 basis points and EPS by about 30 cents, or 4%. The spike thus puts pressure on Chipotle’s food costs, which in turn, is likely to dent profits.Earlier, at its second-quarter conference call, management anticipated avocado prices to moderate in the rest of the year, besides expecting a 20% drop in prices moving into the second half of 2017.However, as per the firm, the avocado prices are now likely be up 10% and 25% in the third and fourth quarter, respectively, which could potentially cut off 25 cents, or 13%, of the third-quarter consensus earnings per share estimates, and 35 cents, or 20%, in the fourth quarter.Though Chipotle is possibly the biggest fast-food chain to feel the heat of the rising avocado prices, other restaurants serving guacamole, including Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) owned Taco Bell and Moe's Southwest Grill have also come under the scanner.Bottom LineChipotle started 2017 on a positive note, marking a turnaround as its sales finally started bouncing back from the massive food safety scandal related to the E.coli and norovirus outbreak, which surfaced toward 2015 end, and resulted in sales plunging and hurting its reputation.Additionally, the company’s continued focus on food safety, simplification of restaurant operations, menu innovation (possible roll out of queso), improved digital offerings and increased brand marketing bode well for growth.However, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare. Evidence of rodents was found at a Dallas outlet, further adding to the woes. These might possibly dent same-store sales, going forward. Alongside, rising avocado prices also pose a threat to the restaurant chain's profitability.Evidently, Chipotle shares have declined 35.7% in the last three months compared with the industry’s fall of 5.1%.Thus, given potentially soft comps along with material implications on margins and earnings from higher avocado prices, we would like to remain on the sidelines in the near term. This is because it seems that the company will certainly take some time to completely restore its economic model as well as customers’ trust and return to its former glory.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderChipotle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in this sector include Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) and Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Papa John’s 2017 earnings climbed 1.4%, over the past 60 days. Moreover, the company’s trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a positive 5.10%.Domino’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.75%. Meanwhile, for 2017, EPS is projected to witness a rise of 33.8%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1177,YUM,"Following the heaviest inflow of Q3 earnings reports of the entire quarter yesterday after the closing bell, we see new economic data reads and news from across the pond. There will also be a long-awaited unveiling of the GOP tax reform plan today. And this is all aside from a new group of Q3 earnings reports coming out before the opening bell this morning.Initial Jobless Claims fell again, to 229K last week from a slightly upwardly revised 234K the previous week. Continuing claims have sunk to multi-quarter lows beneath 1.9 million to 1.884 million specifically. This is more positive news, following yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) strong 235K new private-sector jobs results for October. Tomorrow’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report is expected to bring in north of 300K new jobs last month. All of these numbers speak to an unwaveringly strong U.S. labor market.Productivity and Labor Costs reads were also released early today. Preliminary productivity hit 3.0%, a bit higher than the 2.8% analysts had been expecting. The last time this metric registered this high was back in 2014. Labor costs were close to in-line with expectations at 0.5%, following a 0.3% read last time around. A surge in productivity with slight wage increases would seem to be music to the ears of economists and market participants alike; solid growth without unruly inflation creating headwinds is likely as Goldilocks as it gets.Which brings us to the tax reform proposal key to the Republican-run Congress today and its success in next year’s mid-term elections, and my question is one that is almost never asked by market analysts these days: with 3% growth, still-cheap borrowing costs and solid employment numbers, what do we need a tax cut for?These types of measures are typically used to pry an economy out of being stuck in the mud; if we’re already at or near our goals currently, wouldn’t a tax cut at this stage be simply borrowing against future gains, with the possible additional problems of blowing a hole the the national deficit, which would create longer-term economic issues?This aside for now, the Bank of England today has decided to ratchet up its interest rates 0.5%, amounting to its first rate hike in 10 years. This announcement comes as inflation in the U.K. remains at 3% while economic growth is slowing, not speeding up.The Bank also stayed pat with an asset buyback program worth U.S. $574 million. It’s far from a typical move for a central bank to raise rates while the country’s economy slows; starting new businesses, obtaining mortgages, etc. will now be more difficult. Perhaps the logic is that giving commercial and investment bank in England a leg up will spur the economy indirectly in the months ahead.Q3 Earnings RoundupWe will hear from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) after the closing bell. Yesterday afternoon we saw a big beat from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) augmented by remarks from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that security measures will add to costs at the social media leader at the expense of future profits. Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), on the other hand, missed expectations on a Model 3 “bottleneck,” but future projections for auto deliveries in 2018 remained hopefully robust.Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) shares have tumbled more than 20% this morning following its disappointing Q3 earnings results, where by the consumer plastics maker missed the 92 cent Zacks consensus and posted just 86 cents per share. This was still 10% growth year over year. Revenues in the quarter narrowly missed the 3.7 billion expected, and the company lowered earnings estimates for full-year 2017.Global quick-service restaurant major Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat estimates by 2 cents per share to 68 cents in its most recent quarter, with $1.44 billion in revenues topping the $1.40 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Comps at KFC of +4% assisted the positive results in the quarter. Shares are trading up 2% in today’s pre-market.Hyatt Hotels (H  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations greatly on the bottom line, posting earnings of 26 cents per share compared with the 17 cents expected. Revenues of $1.12 billion topped the $1.09 billion we had been looking for. RevPAR rose 1.6% quarter over quarter, slightly offset by adjusted EBITDA down year over year.
"
1178,YUM,"We are in the thick of the Q1 earnings season with 267 S&P 500 members having already released their quarterly numbers and multiple reports scheduled for release this week. More than 900 companies, including 142 S&P 500 members, will report earnings this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates while 73.8% beat revenue estimates and 61.4% outpaced both the counts. Further, total earnings of these companies increased 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues.The report projects an 22.6% year-over-year rise in total earnings for S&P 500 companies, with revenues likely to increase 8.4%. This compares favorably with the year-over-year earnings growth of 13.4% but unfavorably with 8.6% year-over-year revenue growth in the last report.Here’s What the Restaurant Space is Cooking UpAfter surviving the seven-quarter spell of comps decline, the U.S. restaurant industry was pleasantly surprised in the fourth quarter of 2017. According to TDn2K’s The Restaurant Industry Snapshot, fourth-quarter comps were up 0.4%, comparing favorably with the third-quarter’s comps decline of 1%. March shone bright on the industry as it recorded the highest sales growth since October 2017, with comps growing 0.8%. Comps in the first quarter, however, ticked up only 0.1% year over year. Nonetheless, the industry has posted two successive quarters of positive comps, which reflect slow yet steady growth.Moreover, the restaurant industry saw sales growth in the last four of the past six months. This indicates that the soft performance during the first two months was primarily due to external factors like bad weather.The turnaround for most restaurants, starting November 2017, was backed by a rise in consumer demand and discretionary spending. This is evident from the fact that guest check growth has been accelerating in recent quarters. Average of guest check growth in the first two quarters of 2017 was 2.1%, while that of the last two quarters was 2.3%. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2018, average guest check rose year over year to 2.8%.Moreover, most of the restaurants are adopting aggressive sales-building strategies to drive demand. The fourth quarter bore the fruits of these efforts. We believe that the first quarter might have also witnessed an overall improvement in restaurant sales given the operational efficiencies of restaurant bigwigs.However, the Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry has gained 6.7% in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 11.8%.Q1 Earnings Expectations EncourageNotably, majority of the Zacks broad sectors (14 out of 16) are expected to be in the positive territory in the first quarter of 2018. Restaurants in the wider Retail wholesale sector seem to have a solid footing as well. The latest earnings outlook calls for a 17.8% rise in the sector’s earnings compared with 3% growth in the last reported quarter. Revenues in the first quarter are expected to rise 7.8% (a little lower than 9.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017). Margins in the quarter are anticipated to increase 0.4%, comparing favorably with the prior quarter’s decline of 0.3%.Restaurant Stocks to Report Earnings on May 1Yum China Holdings, Inc. (YUMC  -  Free Report) is a licensee of Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), primarily in mainland China. The company has rights to KFC, China's quick-service restaurant concept, Pizza Hut, casual dining restaurant brand and Taco Bell. Over the past year, the company has gained 21.6%, outperforming the industry.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings is pegged at 45 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2.3%. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.37 billion, suggesting an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.Yum China carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that does not indicate a beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Another pizza giant, Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) is likely to witness year-over-year decline in both the top and the bottom line. The company has been grappling with declining comparable sales in domestic market for quite some time. In the third and fourth quarter of 2017, domestic company-owned restaurant comps declined 1.4% and 4.7%, respectively. Further, comps for North America franchised restaurants fell 3.5% in the last reported quarter, comparing unfavorably with comps growth of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comps at system-wide North American restaurants were down 3.9%, comparing unfavorably with 3.8% growth in the year-ago quarter. The company’s shares have also lost 20.8% in the past year. (Read More: Factors Setting the Tone for Papa John's Q1 Earnings).The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Papa John’s International will be able to deliver a beat in the first quarter of 2018. The consensus estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 62 cents, lower than 74 cents in the year-ago quarter. In the past 30 days, the company’s earnings have witnessed downward revisions, reflecting analysts’ concern surrounding the stock. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $442 million, down 1.6% from the prior-year quarter.The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that does not indicate a beat.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +0.69%, indicating a beat in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Brinker is expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.03, indicating 9.6% growth over the year-ago quarter. Revenues however are projected to decline 0.9% from a year ago. Notably, shares of the company have gained 1.3% in a year’s time.Another leading restaurant operator, Denny's Corporation (DENN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter numbers after market close.The consensus estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $155.7 million, reflecting 21.7% year-over-year growth. Moreover, the consensus estimate calls for earnings of 13 cents, suggesting 8.3% year-over-year growth.Denny’s carries a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that dims the possibilities of a beat. However, the company has rallied 35.2% in the past year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1179,YUM,"Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 2, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20%. Also, it outpaced earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.7%.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Yum! Brands’ will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 68 cents, higher than 65 cents in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $1,078 million, down more than 23.9% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayYum! Brands revenues in the first quarter might continue to be impacted by strategic refranchising initiative. Also, reduction in ownership through refranchising is expected to weigh on near-term revenues. In addition, the company remains highly exposed to various emerging nations in Latin America. These nations have been exhibiting decelerating growth for some time due to various macro headwinds, which may dent sales going ahead.Meanwhile, Yum! Brands is focusing on building a superlative loyalty program with a large and growing database to help drive future sales. We believe that these initiatives should drive traffic and comps in the quarter to be reported. In the fourth quarter, the company implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms across all its brand segments to enhance guest experience. Furthermore, the initial trends in foot traffic owing to the hot rewards royalty programs launched in August have been encouraging.However, the strategic refranchising initiative is expected to reduce the company’s capital requirements, and facilitate earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. In the meantime, free cash flow is likely to continue growing, thus facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return. Remarkably, this shift to refranchising has been substantially benefiting the company’s operating margin over the years.Yum! Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Yum! Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Yum! Brands, Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Yum! Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1180,YUM,"McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) last-reported results were encouraging with the company bettering our expectations on both top and bottom lines. Shares are also trending up as seen in the chart below:But to understand whether this was just a one-time thing or part of a broader recovery, let’s look for a moment at what was bothering the company in the first place.The way I see it, there were two main problems that led to the decline in its share of the market from 17.5% five years ago to 15.1% last year, according to Euromonitor. The first was an inability to capture an equal share of millennial traffic as it had of earlier generations. The second is related to the persistent weakness in Asian markets, particularly China.Of course, strategic refranchising makes headline numbers erratic and comparisons difficult because closing down company-owned stores is a big hit to revenues that can’t be offset by the 6% commission on sales from franchised stores. But at the end of the day, it makes sense, because both capital and operational expenses are thus taken out, with a resultant positive impact on profitability.In this respect, other fast food chains have already moved to a model where around 95% of the stores are franchised; so McDonald’s, being slightly late to react, will continue to enjoy some near-term positive impact that may not be seen in the others.Targeting MillennialsMillennials are generally more concerned about health, convenience, responsible sourcing and freshness of ingredients. And these are areas the company is doubling down on.In what is a complete reversal of earlier policy, management announced the intention to use fresh beef instead of frozen patties. Being somewhat more difficult to handle, this increases the risk of microbe buildup and food borne disease, but the strategy has given Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) an advantage so it’s worth trying out. McDonald’s isn’t taking this to all products at once, which sounds like a good idea.  Other menu changes include a reduction in the use of artificial preservatives, colors and flavors, HFCS-free buns and antibiotics-free chicken, in addition to the Premium Salads refresh, the margarine replacement with butter in Egg McMuffins, milk products from growth hormone-free cows and localized menu options that were announced earlier. In the pipeline is 100% cage-free eggs by 2025 in the U.S. and Canada.On the convenience side, the company is working on putting up digital sign boards, facilitating mobile ordering, tables with serving staff as in fast casual restaurants in some places, curbside service and delivery options both by its own staff and through partnerships with companies like GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report). It will also have 2,500 Experience of the Future (EOTF) stores by year-end, meaning that that’s the number of stores that will have Samsung tablets on the table or in kiosks that customers can use to order or communicate with staff.Stealing from the CompetitionMcDonald’s figures that not everyone is that health conscious however, so it seeks to lure in the diet cheaters as well. Not to mention those that would otherwise have gone to a Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) or a Dunkin’ (DNKN  -  Free Report) outlet instead. In the 2-5 PM timeframe that has always been quiet for quick service restaurants, McDonald’s is laying out croissants, muffin tops and a new sundae-topping station for ice cream lovers. It also has special offers on drinks that can be purchased for as low as $1-2.Plus there are seasonal-themed coffees and environmentally friendly coffee beans (a page out of Starbucks). For this purpose, McDonald’s is getting 12,000 new espresso machines, store redesigns and stepping up marketing efforts. The goal is clear: McDonald’s may be looking out for the health conscious, but it isn’t about to dump those wanting to indulge.Looking for Growth in ChinaChina is part of McDonald's “fast growing” segment, but it hasn’t been growing too fast of late. Changing customer perceptions following the stale meat scandal had a notable impact on not only McDonald’s but also on Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report). Chinese fast food chains in the meantime have gained some ground. Families in particular have moved on from Brand America to other things like food quality, so they are frequenting the fast casual segment these days. But office goers are reportedly coming back.McDonald’s isn’t taking chances. Just as it has done in other Asian markets like Japan (3,000 outlets), South Korea (600) and Taiwan (400), the company is transferring an 80% interest in 2,000 Chinese outlets to CITIC Limited, CITIC Capital Partners and The Carlyle Group for 10 years. In return, it’s getting a cool $2.08 billion from the largest franchisee outside the U.S.There are ambitious plans afoot, with the group targeting double-digit growth in each of the next five years by increasing the number of restaurants from 2,500 to 4,500. By 2022, it also intends to bring delivery hub coverage to over 75% of restaurants. This therefore looks like a very good deal by which McDonald’s is refranchising the business, acquiring local talent and catering to local preferences in a highly profitable way.  Last WordsTo ensure that all goes smoothly, McDonald’s has brought in Morgan Flatley (formerly CMO of Global Nutrition at Pepsico, responsible for getting Gatorade back to sustained growth), as U.S. Chief Marketing Officer; Farhan Siddiqi, as Head of U.S. Digital (formerly worked at Bank of America, Target and GE); and Linda Van Gosen (formerly VP at Startbucks, responsible for Starbucks Evenings, VP of Brand Strategy, Insights and Menu Innovation at TGI Friday’s and VP of Product Innovation at Chili’s Grill & Bar) as new Head of U.S. Menu.Given the above and the possibility of President Trump’s tax reforms kicking in, Mc Donald’s is set for a rebound. So if results are beginning to look up at McDonald’s it’s very likely an indication of more to come.McDonald’s shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1181,YUM,"Another big morning for Q2 earnings posts, with mostly positive results. We also see new Initial Jobless Claims numbers ahead of tomorrow’s big non-farm payroll report and unemployment rate headline. After yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll report that was consistent with good news we’ve mostly been experiencing of late, expectations are for roughly 180K new jobs created. The unemployment rate last read was 4.4%.Initial Jobless Claims fell 5000 to 240K last week, as the previous week had been revised up 1000. Again we see results range-bound between 225K-250K week to week, with very few outliers, over the past year or more. The 4-week moving average is currently 241,750, down 2500 week over week. Continuing claims again remained below 2 million, at 1.968 million.And the Bank of England is taking steps to brace for its coming Brexit — the separation of Great Britain from the European Union, which was voted on last year (and cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job, pretty much) to the greater world’s surprise. BOE Governor Mark Carney is quoted as having said, “the assumption of a smooth transition to a new economic relationship with the EU will be tested.” As such, the Monetary Policy Committee will be keeping rates unchanged, and the BOE has lowered economic growth projections. The British Pound is down today.Ahead of the bell, medical insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) blasted past earnings estimates of $2.34 per share to post $3.42 ahead of this morning’s open. This represents 46% growth year over year. Membership was actually down year over year by 1.6%, but revenues also easily topped forecasts: $15.50 billion versus $15.35 billion expected. Shares are up over 4% in the pre-market.Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat projections on both top and bottom lines this morning, posting 68 cents per share on sales of $1.45 billion in the quarter. The Zacks consensus had been looking for 61 cents per share and $1.41 billion in revenues, respectively. Comps at both KFC and Taco Bell were up: 3% and 4%, respectively.Avon Products (AVP  -  Free Report), however, has faired badly ahead of this morning’s open, down 10% in early trading on missed earnings and sales. A loss of 3 cents per share was lower than the gain of 5 cents expected, and revenues of $1.35 billion failed to reach the $1.44 billion in our Zacks consenus. Further, CEO Sheri McCoy has announced she will be stepping down from her post. Reports are that board pressure is the main reason.Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report) posted narrow beats on top and bottom lines this morning. Earnings of $1.53 per share and revenues of $1.65 billion outperformed the $1.49 per share and $1.64 billion we had been looking for. Earnings grew 21% year over year, and the company’s fiscal year 2017 guidance was upped 9%. It’s Clorox’s third-straight earnings beat, as its Cleaning, Household, Lifestyle and International segments were all up in the quarter.

1182,YUM,"Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.’s (PLAY  -  Free Report) unique business model, rigorous sales building initiatives and relentless expansion plans are encouraging. However, high costs, a tricky consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with the company’s limited international presence raise concerns.Recently, the company posted decent results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues met the same. Adjusted earnings of 61 cents surpassed the consensus estimate of 59 cents by 3.4%. Earnings, however, declined 3.2% year over year.Although Dave & Buster’s continues to perform well on the back of unique customizable experience that it offers across its four platforms, “Eat, Drink, Play and Watch”, high operating costs might have led earnings to fall in the past few quarters.The company’s shares have also lost 30.3% in the past year against its industry’s growth of 10.8%.Distinct Business Model Favors Revenues Dave & Buster’s exclusive business model focuses on the company’s entertainment business, alongside its food and beverage offerings. This dual model helps the company generate favorable store economics and strong return.In fiscal 2017, amusement and other revenues accounted for 56.6% of total revenues and grew 16.6% year over year. This is because, increased dependence on gaming has cushioned the company from the headwinds of consumer discretionary spending that characterizes the restaurant industry and is in turn driving market share and comps. Also, the shift toward increased focus on amusement is driving Dave & Buster’s earnings, given its higher-margin business.In fact, the company has a proven track record of identifying operational efficiencies for the past five fiscal years and adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 720 bps in the same time period. It is in fact this unique model that sets it apart and we expect the company’s entertainment business to carry the growth story forward.Rapid Store Openings Bode WellDave & Buster's continues to pursue a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets, given the broad appeal of its brand. Management believes that it can grow the concept to more than 200 units in North America over time. Currently, the company has eight stores under construction, and plans to further ride on new store growth in 2019 and early 2020.In fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to open 14 to 15 new stores, including two of the latest 17-K format stores, and achieve 13-14% annual unit growth rate, including the combination of eight stores in new markets for D&B, with the remaining stores located in markets where the brand is already established.Meanwhile, in addition to the growth potential that exists in North America, management is positive about the brand’s significant appeal in certain international markets. Notably, the first international opening outside of Canada is anticipated in 2018.High Costs Amid a Competitive Industry Hurt Dave & Buster’sHigher labor costs due to increased wages and those incurred due to implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure. This means that restaurant operators such as Dave & Buster’s that has numerous company-owned units and laborers will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs, which in turn will hurt margins.Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses. Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Dave & Buster’s, instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs onto the franchisee, the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business.Moreover, the retail restaurant space is highly competitive, as numerous restaurant operators are adapting advanced and prudent strategies to increase their sales. These initiatives involve high costs. Dave & Buster’s is also bearing the brunt of higher operating cost from these sales building initiatives. In fact, in fiscal 2017, total operating costs increased 14% from the prior-year quarter.Amid such stiff competition, Dave & Buster’s is also missing out on international presence that other restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report), Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are aggressively pursuing.We believe that the company needs to expand its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cut-throat competition in the saturated domestic market.Zacks RankDave & Buster’s carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1183,YUM,"GrubHub Inc. (GRUB  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Last quarter, earnings of 37 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and surged 61% year over year. The company has a mixed record of earning surprises in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 14.21%.GrubHub has also surpassed the consensus mark for revenues in the trailing four quarters. Revenues surged 49.2% year over year to $205.1 million.For first-quarter 2018, GrubHub forecasts revenues between $224 million and $232 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within $54-$60 million. GrubHub Inc. Price and EPS Surprise GrubHub Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GrubHub Inc. Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings and revenues is currently pegged at 36 cents and $229 million, respectively.Partnerships & Acquisitions Boost PenetrationNotably, shares of GrubHub have gained 33.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 18.8% rally. Strong growth can be attributed to the company’s rapidly growing active diner base and strengthening delivery business.   Grubhub’s partnerships with the likes of Yelp (YELP  -  Free Report) and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) are anticipated to help it rapidly penetrate the expanding food takeout market in the United States. Moreover, collaborations with American Express and Foursquare are expected to smoothen up customer experience.The partnerships along with acquisitions like Eat24, OrderUp and Boston-based Foodler are helping the company acquire new diners. This was evident in the fourth quarter as active diners increased to 14.5 million from 8.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Of these approximately 4 million diners were acquired through the Eat24 (acquired from Yelp) and Yelp platforms. The addition of Eat24 strengthens its position across Tier 1 markets and almost doubles business in a large number of Tier 2 markets.However, increasing expenses due to planned expansion into new delivery markets is likely to keep margins under pressure. As these markets will take some time to generate volumes, higher upfront cost will hurt profitability.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.GrubHub has a Zacks Rank #2 and its Earnings ESP is -9.72%.

1184,YUM,"A soft industry backdrop has been hampering the performance of most restaurant chains and BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) is no exception.In fact, the company, the company continues to believe that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives. Consequently, though BJ’s Restaurants’ has slowed down on its unit growth plan for 2017 and 2018, it has not completely refrained from it.Recently, the company announced the opening of its latest restaurant in Bowie, MD, on Nov 20. This 7,500 square feet restaurant is located on a free standing pad in front of Bowie Town Center and can accommodate nearly 230 guests.The outlet features BJ’s Restaurants’ extensive menu including its signature deep-dish pizza, award-winning hand-crafted beer and the famous Pizookie dessert. In addition, BJ’s unique contemporary décor creates an ideal environment for dining.In fact, this new outlet marks the brand’s fifth restaurant in the state of Maryland. Currently, the company operates 196 casual dining restaurants across 25 states in the United States, under its brand names — BJ’s Restaurant & Brewhouse, BJ’s Restaurant & Brewery, BJ’s Pizza & Grill and BJ’s Grill.The company has opened nine new restaurants year to date and is slated to open one more outlet this year, in line with its plans. The next opening in Taylor, MI, in mid-December, will mark the brand’s entry in the state. Also, it plans to open just four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018.Thus, the slowdown in company’s development plan may somewhat dent sales growth. Also, continued weakening consumer spending in the restaurant space, might hamper the company’s traffic and sales.Furthermore, we note that while several other restaurant chains including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) are capitalizing on the emerging market potential, BJ’s Restaurants loses out in terms of international presence.Additionally, BJ’s Restaurants shares have declined 26.2% over the last six months, as against the industry’s growth of 0.6%.Nevertheless, the four strategic sales-building initiatives undertaken by the company are expected to boost the top line. Also, a deep pipeline of new menu items, loyalty program enhancements and other productivity and digital initiatives are likely to improve performance.Additionally, BJ’s Restaurants’ decision to slow down new openings for some time and instead focus even more of its enterprise resources on building sales might turn out to be favorable as it would provide some margin momentum and boost free cash flow. When combined with the company’s conservative balance sheet, these measures are likely to provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases, going forward.BJ’s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1185,YUM,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we take a look at the multibillion-dollar business that drives NCAA March Madness after a wild opening weekend for the college basketball tournament.A No. 1 seed lost to a No. 16 seed for the first time ever, big brand name schools busted brackets early, and ratings jumped accordingly. But what might be more fascinating than the craziness on the court is the mind-boggling money that is generated during the event.CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner’s  Turner bet big on the long-term viability of March Madness, committing billions of dollars to broadcast the tournament through 2032. The two media companies broadcast and stream all of the games across an array of networks, and the deal will see them retain the broadcasting rights no matter how fans consume games in the future.On top of these broadcast fees, the NCAA makes millions from tickets and marketing deals. Capital One (COF  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) remain the tournament’s biggest sponsors this year. Meanwhile, companies like Pizza Hut (YUM  -  Free Report) and Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) will be ever present over the next few weeks, while Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) debuted the first advertising campaign for its cloud computing products as part of a new multiyear NCAA partnership.The players themselves will also act as walking, talking, and dunking billboards for Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report).

1186,YUM,"Welcome to a Super Bowl LII edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business behind the big game, looking specifically at which companies took advantage of the Super Bowl’s massive television reach.Last night, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in an epic game that wasn’t decided until the final whistle. But while the teams battled it out on the field, some of the biggest companies in the world spent millions of dollars on advertisements designed to become the talk of offices, bars, and living rooms around the country over the next few weeks.NBC’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage of Super Bowl 52 was officially brought to us by Pizza Hut YUM, Kraft KHC, U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), Sprint (S  -  Free Report), Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) new Solo: A Star Wars Story movie, and a few others.On top of ads from these companies, Toyota (TM  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) showed off multiple campaigns and sponsored halftime, where Justin Timberlake helped Nike NKE subtly sell exclusive new Jordan Brand sneakers.Some of the biggest Super Bowl ad spenders over the last 20 years, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), all poured money into ads once again.Familiar names also presented some unfamiliar messages. Peyton and Eli Manning stole a little Super Bowl spotlight, while Procter and Gamble’s PG Tide ads, featuring Stranger Things star David Harbour, might just have stolen the show.Tech giants were also some of last night’s big winners. Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) star-packed Alexa spot—which featured CEO Jeff Bezos—is sure to be seen all over the internet, social media, and television for months to come. Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV sponsored NBC’s pre-game show—and might have just inspired some to cut their cords following the game.Another linear-television competitor, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), spent millions on a Super Bowl LII commercial for its Cloverfield Paradox movie, which users could watch on-demand right after the game.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1187,YUM,"Per a recent Reuters report, McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) intends to close all 169 outlets in India’s northern and eastern regions due to a dispute with the concerned franchise partner — Connaught Plaza Restaurants Pvt Ltd.Reportedly, the franchise violated certain terms of the agreement, including the payment of royalties. Therefore, all the outlets under this franchisee will no longer be allowed to use McDonald's name, trademarks, designs, recipes, and branding within 15 days of termination notice. Further, it will lead to about 6,500 job losses.The move also follows the company’s prolonged legal squabble with Connaught Plaza that led to the shutdown of more than 40 restaurants in June.Meanwhile, shares of McDonald’s have widely outperformed its industry year to date. While the company’s shares have rallied 30.1%, the industry gained 5.7%.Ever since the company’s CEO, Steve Easterbrook, announced a turnaround plan a string of changes has been implemented on the restaurant chain as well as on its menu. This was done in an effort to rejuvenate the brand. The company since then, has reported better sales and profits by trimming costs, simplifying menus, offering value meals and rolling out digital initiatives.Currently, McDonald’s operates over 37,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries, of which about 85% are franchised. With less than 500 outlets, India forms relatively small part of the chain. However, as the country is one of the world’s leading emerging markets, disruption in operations here will not bode well for the brand's long-term growth. Shutting down stores here compromises McDonald’s share in the country’s booming quick-service restaurants space where the company is already facing stiff competition from contenders such as Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) as well as YUM! Brands Inc.’s (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut and KFC brands.Nevertheless, the company has already started looking out for another partner to fill the gap in the region.McDonald’s presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked restaurant stock from the same space is Dave & Buster’s Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report) that has surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 30.5%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1188,YUM,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on leading quick-service hamburger restaurant chain Jack in the Box, Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report).Jack in the Box’s shares have widely underperformed its industry year to date. The company’s shares have declined 13.3% against the industry’s gain of 5.6% in the same period.Additionally, Jack in the Box has been witnessing an unflattering movement in its earnings estimates trend, reflecting ongoing pessimism in the stock’s prospects. Over the last month, current quarter earnings estimates have moved down 7.1% due to seven downward revisions versus none upward. Meanwhile, current year consensus estimates have revised 3.8% downward due to eight negative revisions versus none in the opposite direction.A Soft Industry Backdrop Pressurizing the Top lineOver the past few quarters, the U.S. restaurants space has not been too enticing. Despite economic growth, somewhat lower energy prices and higher income, consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out, which resulted in low consumption.Moreover, as consumers demand high-quality products at lower prices, it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive. This, in turn, is resulting in a bigger gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home indices.Consequently, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the second quarter of calendar 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood.Resultantly, Jack in the Box’s sales has come under pressure. Comps at the Jack in the Box company stores were down 1.6% in second-quarter fiscal 2017, while comps at company-owned Qdoba restaurants declined 1.1%.Furthermore, the company lowered its comps outlook for 2017 and now anticipates the same to decline 2-2.5% at Qdoba company restaurants but inch up 0.5% at Jack in the Box system restaurants.Higher Costs & Heightened CompetitionJack in the Box reported a year-over-year decline in earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2017 as its margins were pressurized. Margins were negatively impacted by costs related to the 31 restaurants that were franchised, wage rate increases, commodity cost inflation, particularly in beef as well as higher repairs and maintenance costs.Going forward, nationwide wage increases and higher healthcare costs under the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue hurting this restaurant operator’s margins. However, commodity cost inflation is anticipated to prevail, in addition to expenses related to the company’s remodeling initiative as well as unit expansion. Meanwhile, widespread marketing schemes are projected to increase overall expenses.While all these expenses are likely to weigh down margins and thereby earnings, the company’s revenues are expected to be pressurized by heightened competition.In fact, Jack in the Box has been experiencing increased competitive pressure in breakfast and lunch day parts as many other restaurateurs have introduced aggressive value offers.While other restaurant chains including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Jack in the Box seems to be slow on this front. Thus, limited international presence might be a big disadvantage for the company and hurt its competitive positioning.Sales-building Initiatives Offer Some RespiteDespite the prevailing headwinds, Jack in the Box’s several initiatives offer some respite.The company makes regular menu innovations and provides limited period offers (LPO) at both its brands to drive long-term customer loyalty. Its premium and value offerings, along with increased focus on breakfast menu to combat competition bode well.Apart from menu innovation and remodeling efforts, Jack in the Box expects catering, marketing initiatives and delivery to boost comps at the Qdoba brand.Qdoba is also developing a mobile app which will enable online ordering and mobile payment. The company is also redesigning its affinity program to bring back guests more often and to provide them with better control over reward points.Meanwhile, Jack in the Box restaurants are currently 85% franchised. The company plans to increase its franchise restaurants to around 90% by fiscal 2018. We believe, franchising a large chunk of its system will lower general and administrative expenses, and thereby boost earnings.Strategic Review of Qdoba Brand Could Prove BeneficialThe Qdoba brand has become more of a drag in recent quarters given poor restaurant level execution and a choppy sales environment.Keeping in mind the recent performance of the brand, and given that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models, management has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. This was done in order to assist the board in its assessment of possible alternatives with respect to the brand, coupled with other ways to boost shareholder value.Though management continues to believe in the brand’s potential, this strategic review by Morgan Stanley should aid in taking the requisite steps in better managing the company.However, it is to be noted that there is no guarantee that the evaluation process will result in a transaction. Also, the company has not set a timetable for conclusion of the process.Currently, Jack in the Box carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1189,YUM,"Thursday, August 3rd, 2017Another big morning for Q2 earnings posts, with mostly positive results. We also see new Initial Jobless Claims numbers ahead of tomorrow’s big non-farm payroll report and unemployment rate headline. After yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll report that was consistent with good news we’ve mostly been experiencing of late, expectations are for roughly 180K new jobs created. The unemployment rate last read was 4.4%.Initial Jobless Claims fell 5000 to 240K last week, as the previous week had been revised up 1000. Again we see results range-bound between 225K-250K week to week, with very few outliers, over the past year or more. The 4-week moving average is currently 241,750, down 2500 week over week. Continuing claims again remained below 2 million, at 1.968 million.And the Bank of England is taking steps to brace for its coming Brexit — the separation of Great Britain from the European Union, which was voted on last year (and cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job, pretty much) to the greater world’s surprise. BOE Governor Mark Carney is quoted as having said, “the assumption of a smooth transition to a new economic relationship with the EU will be tested.” As such, the Monetary Policy Committee will be keeping rates unchanged, and the BOE has lowered economic growth projections. The British Pound is down today.Ahead of the bell, medical insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) blasted past earnings estimates of $2.34 per share to post $3.42 ahead of this morning’s open. This represents 46% growth year over year. Membership was actually down year over year by 1.6%, but revenues also easily topped forecasts: $15.50 billion versus $15.35 billion expected. Shares are up over 4% in the pre-market.Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat projections on both top and bottom lines this morning, posting 68 cents per share on sales of $1.45 billion in the quarter. The Zacks consensus had been looking for 61 cents per share and $1.41 billion in revenues, respectively. Comps at both KFC and Taco Bell were up: 3% and 4%, respectively.Avon Products (AVP  -  Free Report), however, has faired badly ahead of this morning’s open, down 10% in early trading on missed earnings and sales. A loss of 3 cents per share was lower than the gain of 5 cents expected, and revenues of $1.35 billion failed to reach the $1.44 billion in our Zacks consenus. Further, CEO Sheri McCoy has announced she will be stepping down from her post. Reports are that board pressure is the main reason.Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report) posted narrow beats on top and bottom lines this morning. Earnings of $1.53 per share and revenues of $1.65 billion outperformed the $1.49 per share and $1.64 billion we had been looking for. Earnings grew 21% year over year, and the company’s fiscal year 2017 guidance was upped 9%. It’s Clorox’s third-straight earnings beat, as its Cleaning, Household, Lifestyle and International segments were all up in the quarter.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Further, earnings increased 21% year over year owing to lower share count.Meanwhile, total revenues of $1.45 billion were down over 4% year over year primarily due to lower company sales. However, revenues came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion by nearly 3%.Yum! Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Yum! Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Yum!

1191,YUM,"The U.S. quick-service pizza space is growing by leaps and bounds. Overshadowing independent restaurants, the pizza bigwigs are continuously strategizing to attract customers. Per The Statistics Portal report, the United States sees approximately $33 billion of consumer spending in the quick-service pizza category every year. Out of the total, roughly $15 billion constitutes take-out pizza services, followed by pizza delivery of around $10 billion.Notably, per unit sales for chain pizzerias are nearly 70% higher than that of independent restaurants. According to Euromonitor, pizza chains saw 5.8% growth in 2017, while independent restaurants recorded a 2.7% sales rise.The PMQ Pizza Magazine estimates a total of $45.1 billion sales in 2018, out of which $26.6 billion will come from the top 50 chains in the country. Independent restaurants are likely to rake in around $18.5 billion.What Do Consumers Expect From Pizzerias?To keep pace with the changing dynamics of the space, pizza chains are continuously investing in digital capabilities. Per a recent study by Consumer Reports, spending on dining-out has increased nominally, with demand for high-quality food with easier accessibility. Incorporation of better technologies has been a key sales-driving strategy of large pizza chains in the United States.Consumers are not only particular about the quality and taste of food but also demand efficient and prompt services. They are also conscious about the affordability factor.Thus, even with advanced digital facilities and great delivery systems, expensive pizza chains might fail to draw customers. Thus, in order to boost sales, leading U.S. pizza giants like Domino’s, Papa John’s and Pizza Hut focus on providing efficient service through digital facilities. They are also trying to keep prices low.How Are Pizza Giants Strategizing?Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest fast-food chains, with more than 14,800 stores in over 85 international markets.The company recently reaffirmed its three-to-five-year outlook, which hints at global retail sales growth between 8% and 12%, and domestic and international comps growth of 3% and 6%, respectively.In order to drive traffic and in turn revenues, this pizza giant has been ramping up investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering. In 2017, the company’s AnyWare suite of ordering platforms that allow customers to order through apps such as Google Home, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) Messenger, Amazon Echo, Twitter and via a Pizza emoji on text, grew significantly. The company is also committed toward maintaining investments and its lead in the digital arena, which should boost sales apart from enhancing its competitive position.In order to drive earnings, the company is focusing on refranchising which minimizes capital requirement and boosts shareholders’ return. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Domino’s earnings shows an impressive year-over-year growth of 48.5%. The company is also expected to see earnings grow at an annualized rate of 15.2% over the next three-to-five years.Meanwhile, in six months’ time, Domino’s shares have rallied 19.9%, outperforming 5.2% gain of the industry it belongs to. Investors should also note that the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an A grade for Growth as per our Style Scores system. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Domino’s is also expected to become the leading pizza company on digital advancement, overtaking Pizza Hut, which operates under Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report). Carrying a Zacks Rank #3, Yum! Brands is also trying to keep up with Domino’s with respect to digital initiatives.Recently, Pizza Hut collaborated with Toyota to facilitate delivery via driverless vehicles. Also, the company announced a partnership with online food delivery platform, Grubhub, to drive online sales and delivery from restaurants.Additionally, the company is working toward a cost-efficient business structure. Management expects to cut capex to about $100 million by 2019, increase free cash flow conversion to 100% and reduce general and administrative (G&A) expenditure by around $300 million (or 1.7% of system sales). In addition, the company aims to maintain an optimized capital structure with leverage of five times EBITDA. Over the next three years, it is committed to return an additional $6.5-$7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.Subsequently, the consensus estimate shows earnings growth of 10.8% and 17.2% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Also, the company’s shares have gained 6.8% in the past six months, outperforming the industry.Notably, Pizza Hut had overthrown Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL.Meanwhile, Papa John’s is grappling with high costs and declining sales. The company’s shares have lost 13% in the past six months, the growth of its industry. Considering this, earnings estimates for 2018 have been revised 3.8% downward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ concern. The consensus estimate also hints at 1.2% year-over-year decline in 2018 earnings.However, to safeguard its industry-leading position, Papa John’s aims to redesign its digital platform and digital solutions capabilities, leveraging on enhanced data analytics. The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Last WordsEven though all pizza bigwigs are continuously vying for market traction, we believe Domino’s enjoys an edge in the space buoyed by its sales-building efforts, digital innovation, cost management and stellar earnings growth expectation.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1192,YUM,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. (RRGB  -  Free Report) has been bearing the brunt of high costs and soft consumer demand that is currently characterizing the U.S. restaurant space. In order to counter these challenges, the company has undertaken various sales driving and cost cutting initiatives that seem encouraging.Recently, this burger giant reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, where adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents by 41.8% and jumped a significant 122.9% year over year. The company has a good track record of earnings surprises in the recent past, wherein reported earnings have beat/met consensus estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 23.17%.Also, Red Robin’s shares have increased 18.6% in the past year, outpacing the industry’s gain of 11.9%. Given its prudent growth initiatives, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company should keep performing well in the quarters ahead. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Initiatives to Increase Traffic & Sales EncouragingWith a viable business strategy, Red Robin has seen an uptick in revenues over the past few years. Despite a sluggish economic environment, the company has been posting year-over-year revenue growth since 2013.This is attributable to the company’s various traffic and sales building efforts, which also include consistent digital initiatives. In fact, owing to menu innovation, value offerings, increasing service speed, effective marketing strategy, remodeling programs and online ordering business, the company witnessed 17.5% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. To drive traffic and sales, Red Robin has improved its seating efficiency and lowered guests’ waiting times. Moreover, it has rolled out its Kitchen Display System (KDS) that is linked to table management software. This is expected to result in annual sales growth of approximately $50 million as kitchens can handle higher peak volumes.The company’s remodeling initiatives are expected to boost its potential as a brand as well as improve guest experience, which in turn should drive revenues. Among the brand revitalization initiatives, the company is focused on menu innovation, operational improvement and making a better customer service platform.In addition, Red Robin focuses on promotional and limited-time offers to increase revenues. Moreover, key long-term growth driver for the company is its guest loyalty program — Red Robin Royalty — initiated in 2011 with a goal to increase guest count. The company engages its guests through this program with offers designed to increase frequency of visits.Furthermore, the company is set to grow its off-premise, online-ordering business via carry-out, delivery and catering. The growing demand for off-premise orders are resulting in higher traffic. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Red Robin delivered 8.3% mix in off-premise, up 45% year over year.On the delivery front, the company has partnerships with Amazon, DoorDash and GrubHub. In fact, it is working with each provider to better integrate into its POS and KDS systems and ease the intricacy in operations teams. Also, curbside delivery is now available at more than 60% of its locations. The company is thus moving smartly on new revenue streams and expects off-premise orders to become growth engine in the long run as it begins to actively promote the new offerings, reach more guests, thereby driving improved profitability.Strategic Moves to Counter High CostsRed Robin witnessed rising costs and expenses throughout the majority of 2017, mainly due to higher labor costs. The company is also investing heavily in several sales building initiatives like advertising and technical upgrades, which will result in elevated costs. Remodeling and restaurant maintenance also add to the already rising expenses.In order to cut these high costs and improve margins, Red Robin outlined a go-forward plan known as RED2. The primary objective of this initiative is doubling the company’s EBITDA by 2020. The company is focusing on new supply chain management software, replacing its older manual system. This would result in improved control of waste and cost of goods, significantly reducing inventory levels at the restaurants.Notably, in the last reported quarter, restaurant-level operating profit margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) to 20.5% due to controlled expenses under the company’s strategic plans.Limited International Presence & Domestic Contraction Pose ConcernsAmerican dining brands are keen to expand in the fast-growing emerging markets outside the United States. While several other restaurateurs, including Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report), have opened their outlets in the emerging markets; Red Robin seems to be weak on this front. Also, due to insufficient profit generation, the company has given up on its Burger Works fast-casual concept, a small non-traditional prototype with limited menu and services.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1193,YUM,"A challenging industry backdrop has been hampering the performance of most restaurant chains, The Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE  -  Free Report) being no exception.Nonetheless, Cheesecake Factory has been expanding in the domestic as well as international markets despite a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space. The company is focused on opening restaurants at high grade sites to meet the targeted returns.Recently, the company announced the opening of a restaurant in Minnetonka, MN.Featuring more than 250 menu options, including nearly 50 lower calorie dishes and more than 50 signature desserts and cheesecakes, the company constantly introduces changes to its menu. Moreover, in keeping with consumer preference for healthy food, the company introduced a category called Super Foods in 2015. The new restaurant will also be featuring Super Foods section.Notably, Cheesecake Factory currently operates 209 full-service, casual dining restaurants. In addition to the domestic market, the company of late has been foraying into international markets. This is in line with the company’s strategy to keep up with industry giants like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report). In 2017, the company plans to open eight company-owned restaurants along with four international restaurants under licensing agreements.Notably, over the past few quarters, the U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing for investors. Consequently, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic has also been weak. In fact, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby making the mood somber.Cheesecake Factory’s sales have also come under pressure. In fact, after posting 29 consecutive quarters of positive comps at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants, the company posted a comps decline in second-quarter 2017.Continued consumer spending uncertainty might continue to weigh on the company’s comps and in turn sales. Nevertheless, increased focus on improving its speed of service and training its servers so that they render higher level of service along with various technology-enabled initiatives to boost comps bode well.Meanwhile, despite various cost-saving efforts, high labor costs, pre-opening costs of outlets given the company’s unit expansion plans and expenses related to sales initiatives are raising expenses and are likely to hurt profits. In fact, the company expects a year-over-year decline in operating margins in 2017 given the labor cost pressure and a less favorable commodity environment.Even so, we expect the company’s continuous expansion plans to add to the top line and boost its overall performance.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1194,YUM,"Shares of Papa John's (PZZA  -  Free Report) surged on Wednesday following the company’s announcement that it ended its partnership as the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. At the same time, the league’s new pizza partner, Yum Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Pizza Hut, saw its stock price pop as well.Papa John’s also topped our revenue estimates after it reported $467.6 million in Q4 sales on Tuesday. Yet, the company fell short of fourth quarter earnings estimates and saw its North American comparable store sales dip by 3.9%—which is a trend the company expects to continue (also read: Papa John's Stock Dips As Q4 Domestic Sales Sink).Meanwhile, Pizza Hut has been a drag on Yum in recent years, with some suggesting that the company divest the pizza chain. Its new partnership, amid slumping NFL television ratings, might be Yum’s final effort to boost sales.Yet, with all of this talk about two pizza chains that are currently facing significant headwinds, investors might want to consider another pizza chain that is poised to expand both its top and bottom lines.Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report)Domino’s has become one of the world’s largest fast-food chains, now boasting more than 14,800 stores in over 85 international markets. Last week, Domino’s posted 4.2% domestic same-store sales growth, which led to 7.7% growth for the full year. The company, which opened 829 new locations outside of North America in 2017, saw its international comp-store sales climb by 3.4% for the year. This marked the 24th straight year of positive international same-store sales growth for Domino’s.The pizza chain has become an international powerhouse while also maintaining strong domestic sales. Domino’s recently reaffirmed its three-to-five year outlook that calls for global retail sales growth of 8% to 12% and domestic and international same-store sales growth of 3% and 6%.Domino’s has also been on top of consumers trends. The company has built up its mobile and online ordering platforms to accommodate for customers that crave this ability. In order to expand its reach in other ways, Domino’s also upped its in-store, carry-out deals and began to revamp restaurants.The pizza chain also recently partnered with Ford (F) to test new self-driving car technology, which could one day become a large part of Domino’s business model (also read: Ford Teams With Domino's and Postmates on Self-Driving Car Project).Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018, Domino’s is projected to see its earnings soar by over 40% to hit $1.77 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Domino’s sales are projected to climb by 10% to hit $3.07 billion for the full year, while its earnings are expected to skyrocket 48.50%.What’s more, Domino’s has met or topped earnings estimates in the trailing seven periods and is expected to see its earnings climb at an annualized rate of 15.17% over the next three to five years.Investors should also be happy to note that Domino’s is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1195,YUM,"Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) announced on Tuesday afternoon that former Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) executive Brian Niccol will replace founder Steve Ells as the company’s chief executive. Shares of the struggling fast-casual burrito chain surged over 11% in after-hours trading following the announcement.Chipotle began its search for a CEO to replace Ells, who will become the company’s executive chairman, in late November. The hope was to find someone who could help the brand innovate and build better customer relations as it tries to navigate through a series of public relations nightmares, most of which stem from foodborne sicknesses.Niccol, who most recently served as the CEO of Taco Bell, will take over as chief executive officer on March 5. As the head of Taco Bell, Niccol helped oversee numerous product launches, including some of its new breakfast initiatives.The company also credited Niccol with helping transform the fast-food taco chain into a social media leader, along with leading Taco Bell’s big push into mobile ordering and payment.""His expertise in digital technologies, restaurant operations and branding make him a perfect fit for Chipotle as we seek to enhance our customer experience, drive sales growth and make our brand more relevant,” Ells said in a statement.Niccol helped worldwide system sales climb by 7% at Taco Bell in 2017. But Taco Bell’s constant menu changes and crazy food pairings aren’t likely to work at Chipotle, which is billed as a healthier and hearty, fast-casual option.""At Chipotle's core is delicious food, which I will look to pair up with consistently great customer experiences,” Niccol said. “I will also focus on dialing up Chipotle's cultural relevance through innovation in menu and digital communications.”Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1196,YUM,"Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) posted decent fourth-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings but missing the same on revenues.Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Further, earnings increased 21.5% year over year. The shift to refranchising substantially boosted the company’s operating margin and earnings per share and the trend is expected to continue.Total revenues of $1.58 billion were down 16.4% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.61 billion. The decline in total revenues was mainly due to decrease in company sales as an impact of its continued strategic refranchising initiative. The reduction in ownership through refranchising is an overhang on near-term revenues. Yum! Brands, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Yum! Brands, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Yum! Brands, Inc. Quote Just before the earnings announcement, Yum! Brands announced a partnership with online food delivery platform Grubhub to enhance online sales and delivery from its restaurants. As part of the deal, Yum! Brands will acquire $200 million of Grubhub stock. The proceeds will be used by Grubhub to speed up expansion of its delivery capacity.Shares of Yum! Brands have gained 6.3% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 3.9% rally.  Segmental Performance Yum! Brands now reports under three segments – KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.KFC revenues were $814 million, down 11.8% on a year-over-year basis. Comps at the KFC division increased 3% compared with the year-ago quarter’s rise of 2% and the previous quarter’s increase of 4%.Segment operating margin was up 6% year over year owing to refranchising and same-store sales growth.At Pizza Hut, revenues were $234 million, down 24.3% on a year-over-year basis. Comps were up 1% against the year-ago quarter’s decline of 3% and preceding quarter’s increase of 1%.Segment operating margin was up 2.9% year over year, attributable to refranchising, offset by higher franchise and license costs.Taco Bell revenues were $531 million, down 18.8% from the year-ago quarter. Comps were up 2%, which compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter and prior-quarter growth of 3%.Segment operating margin was up 3.8% year over year, attributable to refranchising and same-store sales growth.Yum!

The upside reflects strong operating performance and G&A savings.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents.  Earnings, however, stayed flat year over year, as a decline in adjusted net income was offset by decline in shares outstanding.Chipotle Mexican Grill’s(CMG  -  Free Report) adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.34, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.32.

In fact, it outpaced earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 7.77%.We expect Yum!’s refranchising efforts to continue weighing on its revenues, while boosting its operating performance and eventually the bottom line, in the to-be-reported quarter.The company’s stock has rallied 20.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 13.5%Let’s delve deeper into what we have anticipated.Refranchising to Keep Top Line SofterYum!

The reduction in ownership through refranchising weighs on near-term revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is pegged at $1.6 billion.

1198,YUM,"Thursday, November 2, 2017Following the heaviest inflow of Q3 earnings reports of the entire quarter yesterday after the closing bell, we see new economic data reads and news from across the pond. There will also be a long-awaited unveiling of the GOP tax reform plan today. And this is all aside from a new group of Q3 earnings reports coming out before the opening bell this morning.Initial Jobless Claims fell again, to 229K last week from a slightly upwardly revised 234K the previous week. Continuing claims have sunk to multi-quarter lows beneath 1.9 million to 1.884 million specifically. This is more positive news, following yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) strong 235K new private-sector jobs results for October. Tomorrow’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report is expected to bring in north of 300K new jobs last month. All of these numbers speak to an unwaveringly strong U.S. labor market.Productivity and Labor Costs reads were also released early today. Preliminary productivity hit 3.0%, a bit higher than the 2.8% analysts had been expecting. The last time this metric registered this high was back in 2014. Labor costs were close to in-line with expectations at 0.5%, following a 0.3% read last time around. A surge in productivity with slight wage increases would seem to be music to the ears of economists and market participants alike; solid growth without unruly inflation creating headwinds is likely as Goldilocks as it gets.Which brings us to the tax reform proposal key to the Republican-run Congress today and its success in next year’s mid-term elections, and my question is one that is almost never asked by market analysts these days: with 3% growth, still-cheap borrowing costs and solid employment numbers, what do we need a tax cut for? These types of measures are typically used to pry an economy out of being stuck in the mud; if we’re already at or near our goals currently, wouldn’t a tax cut at this stage be simply borrowing against future gains, with the possible additional problems of blowing a hole the the national deficit, which would create longer-term economic issues?This aside for now, the Bank of England today has decided to ratchet up its interest rates 0.5%, amounting to its first rate hike in 10 years. This announcement comes as inflation in the U.K. remains at 3% while economic growth is slowing, not speeding up. The Bank also stayed pat with an asset buyback program worth U.S. $574 million. It’s far from a typical move for a central bank to raise rates while the country’s economy slows; starting new businesses, obtaining mortgages, etc. will now be more difficult. Perhaps the logic is that giving commercial and investment bank in England a leg up will spur the economy indirectly in the months ahead.Q3 Earnings RoundupWe will hear from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) after the closing bell. Yesterday afternoon we saw a big beat from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) augmented by remarks from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that security measures will add to costs at the social media leader at the expense of future profits. Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), on the other hand, missed expectations on a Model 3 “bottleneck,” but future projections for auto deliveries in 2018 remained hopefully robust.Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) shares have tumbled more than 20% this morning following its disappointing Q3 earnings results, where by the consumer plastics maker missed the 92 cent Zacks consensus and posted just 86 cents per share. This was still 10% growth year over year. Revenues in the quarter narrowly missed the 3.7 billion expected, and the company lowered earnings estimates for full-year 2017.Global quick-service restaurant major Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat estimates by 2 cents per share to 68 cents in its most recent quarter, with $1.44 billion in revenues topping the $1.40 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Comps at KFC of +4% assisted the positive results in the quarter. Shares are trading up 2% in today’s pre-market.Hyatt Hotels (H  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations greatly on the bottom line, posting earnings of 26 cents per share compared with the 17 cents expected. Revenues of $1.12 billion topped the $1.09 billion we had been looking for. RevPAR rose 1.6% quarter over quarter, slightly offset by adjusted EBITDA down year over year.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Because once I know which ‘90s romantic comedy leading man is my soulmate, I need to know which one is my best friend’s (and where I went wrong in my answers to get Joe from You’ve Got Mail and not Will from Notting Hill).The site also creates content that people talk about, such as the popular 2015 debate over what color this dress is. Or how cute this baby and giant dog’s friendship is.The site launched the Community section in 2013, where BuzzFeed users can submit posts to be published online. Members can first submit up to one post a day, and community editors can decide to feature the post if they like it. Over time, community members can create and recommend posts, and BuzzFeed can publish more fun, entertaining content that people will want to share.Because of BuzzFeed’s success, other media sources are beginning to publish content that mirrors BuzzFeed’s style. This has led to newspapers and other media sites to create listicles to attract readers, just as I did when I wrote “7 Fun Facts about Starbucks in Honor of its IPO’s 25th Anniversary.”Changing News WritingWhile it has achieved fame writing listicles and sharing quizzes, BuzzFeed doesn’t ignore contemporary news. In June of 2016, BuzzFeed split itself into news and entertainment divisions in order to help create a balance between the content the site produces.According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans now receive their news from social media platforms, primarily Facebook. This gives BuzzFeed a unique position to optimize on the audience they already have on social media to promote their news coverage.But the site doesn’t work like a typical newspaper. While newspapers typically have a comprehensive look at almost everything, BuzzFeed can choose to focus only on the stories that will be popularly shared. This has allowed the site to do a lot of writing on politics, but ignore more banal topics, like the weather, that typical newspapers publish.Because BuzzFeed is often shared on social media platforms, the site has been working to address the social bubbles people find themselves in. Often, friends on Facebook possess similar ideas and opinions on stories, preventing them from being exposed to different viewpoints.To address this, BuzzFeed launched the “Outside your Bubble” feature this past February. This effort by BuzzFeed News works to bring a diversity of thought and opinions to a news story being shared. It provides a list of different, summarized viewpoints on the topic at the end of the story. Then, if someone wants to know more about one viewpoint, they can click an arrow to read more. Thus, BuzzFeed’s famous listicle has evolved to sharing different points of views with readers.A Different Approach to AdvertisingBuzzFeed doesn’t have just any type of advertising; it has branded content. Instead of banner or pop-up ads on the webpage, Buzzfeed offers companies the chance to sponsor content that people will organically choose to look at and share.For example, the post 10 Childhood Obsessions That We Never Got Over was created by Taco Bell, a subsidiary of Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report). By being a brand publisher, Taco Bell’s logo and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) feed are on BuzzFeed’s webpage without being distracting. And when someone decides to share this post, Taco Bell will achieve better success at reaching potential customers.This strategy has proven successful. Taco Bell participated in a case study, which showed that “those who discovered Taco Bell’s sponsored BuzzFeed content through social channels were 195.9% more likely to indicate they would consider trying, can’t wait to try, or had already tried their product.”This advertisement strategy has allowed BuzzFeed to avoid having to sell subscriptions to their site, unlike other media and news sites like The New York Times (NYT  -  Free Report).The Bottom LineMedia companies have taken notice of BuzzFeed’s success. This past November, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) invested an additional $200 million in the media company, increasing their total investment to $400 million and BuzzFeed’s valuation to about $1.7 billion.While BuzzFeed currently isn’t public, the company is reportedly preparing to IPO in 2018. However, the recent IPO of Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), the parent company of Snapchat, and its shares falling 23.5% from its IPO price in five months, seems to be a tale of warning for the popular websiteAnd yet, because of the massive changes BuzzFeed has had on the media landscape in the last ten years, the company could find success if it decides to go public.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

1202,YUM,"Potbelly Corporation (PBPB  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 4, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.00%. In fact, this Chicago-based casual-dining restaurant’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 46.07%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Potbelly Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Potbelly Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Potbelly Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderPotbelly had been reporting positive comps over the last few quarters. But the challenging operating environment in the U.S. restaurants space led to a decline in comps in first-quarter fiscal 2017. In fact, this difficult industry backdrop continues to persist and is expected to affect the to-be-reported quarter’s results too.Nevertheless, Potbelly persists to undertake several initiatives that can aid in navigating through the tough environment. Evidently, it continues to develop a pipeline that will complement its core menu, while maintaining its operational efficiency. Further, the company has been using catering coordinators to manage its back-line operations and canvas business outside to drive sales. Notably, Potbelly’s continuous expansions add greatly to the top line and are also expected to do so in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company’s investment in technology like its new app, which was launched in the fiscal first quarter, is also expected to boost growth across its business through increased convenience. Additionally, the recent launch of its customer engagement program – Potbelly Perks –should drive traffic as it enhances consumer loyalty.However, increased labor expenses due to minimum wage increases across some of the markets in which the company operates, might prove to be a headwind. We note that the company’s rising cost structure is likely to hurt margins in the fiscal second quarter.Potbelly also expects the recent shut down of its MidwayInternationalAirport outlet to pose a large threat to its business in the quarter, as it was the highest volume location.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Potbelly this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Potbelly has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 12 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Potbelly has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the broader Retail-Wholesale sector to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1203,YUM,"We are in the thick of the Q3 earnings season with results seemingly on solid ground given the positive momentum on the revenue front. Apart from maintaining the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises, the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is quite palpable.According to our latest Earnings Preview, 64.2% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 is already out. As of Oct 27, 2017, total earnings for the 272 S&P 500 members are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues. Of these, 75.7% surpassed earnings estimates, while 66.2% beat revenue expectations.A Look at the Restaurant IndustryWe note that the performance of the restaurant industry, under the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, has been mixed so far this earnings season. Among the restaurant stocks that have reported, Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust results, beating earnings and revenue estimates.McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results. While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same. However, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lagged on both fronts.Soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains. Also, the recent hurricanes seem to have negatively impacted results of a number of restaurant companies this earnings season, which includes the likes of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report)    that reported lower-than-expected results in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment.Let’s have a sneak peek at two major restaurant stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping before the announcement.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.We expect Starbucks’ revenues to increase on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth. Starbucks also projected global comps growth at 3-4% for the quarter. Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes, Seared Steak and Egg Wrap.Starbucks’ digital offering, Mobile Order and Pay, is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in 2017. Again, growth in Starbucks reward members is expected to contribute to its revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States. Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $5.73 billion, implying 0.4% year-over-year growth.With respect to the company’s bottom line, Starbucks’ EPS is likely to witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores. Hence, despite a revenue-growth expectation, the coffee giant’s margins are likely to narrow due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation. These headwinds, however, are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative (G&A) expenses.That said, a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share, reflecting a decrease of 2.5% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%. Starbucks currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making an earnings prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for a likely earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.(Read: Will Higher Costs Impact Starbucks' Q4 Earnings?) Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteYum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers before the opening bell.Post China business separation, Yum! Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure bodes well. This, in turn, is likely to bolster third-quarter results.Particularly, augmented pace of unit development along with increased investments in technology-driven initiatives is anticipated to somewhat drive top-line growth in the quarter.Coming to the Pizza Hut brand, while the international division might continue doing well, Pizza Hut U.S. is expected to post soft results for the quarter despite numerous strategic efforts similar to the last few quarters. Notably, a soft consumer-spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is likely to continue restricting revenue growth.Meanwhile, KFC’s efforts to revamp outlets, focus on its operational excellence, delivery services, innovation and convenience, are expected to continue boosting comps.However, Yum! Brands is likely to witness a decline in company sales due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative, which, in turn, will lower the company’s revenues in the third quarter. A slowdown in emerging markets is likely to further hamper the quarter’s performance.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 66 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 39.5%. The same for revenues is pegged at $1.39 billion, 58.2% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Yum! Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -1.37%.

Brands have delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters. However, Yum! Brands’ average beat of 7.01% steers past Starbucks’ level of 0.46%.From the sales growth perspective, Starbucks is well positioned to report better quarterly results.Meanwhile, both the companies are expected to report a decline in earnings.

The same for revenues is pegged at $1.39 billion, 58.2% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Also, our quantitative model predicts that Yum! Brands does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Yum! Brands has an Earnings ESP of -0.46%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Yum!

However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Influence Q3 ResultsPost China business separation, Yum! Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure bodes well.

1205,YUM,"We expect pizza giant, Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report), to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 12, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Domino's pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 8.20%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.75%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Domino's Pizza Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Domino's Pizza Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Domino's is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Domino’s has an Earnings ESP of +2.12% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.24 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.22. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Domino's currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Domino's favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Notably, the second quarter of 2017 marked the 25th and 94th consecutive quarter of positive same-store-sales domestically and internationally, respectively, for Domino’s. We expect the company’s digital ordering system, focus on re-imaging and other sales initiatives to help sustain the momentum in the third quarter as well.Particularly, the extended ways to order a pizza has kept Domino’s at the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience, and is expected to be biggest driver of comps growth.Meanwhile, the company’s solid brand positioning along with its efforts to accelerate its presence in high-growth international markets is likely to drive top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.However, negative currency translation might dent the quarter’s profits given Domino’s significant international presence. Furthermore, higher costs are likely to hurt margins while a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space may restrict quarterly sales.Other Stocks to ConsiderDomino's is not the only company looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies to consider in the Zacks Restaurant Industry as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1206,YUM,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company also lifted its full-year profit outlook considering the new U.S. corporate tax cut.However, Starbucks’ shares declined 4.3% in the after-hour trading session following the news release on Jan 25, possibly in response to the weak comparable store sale or comps performance that overshadowed the raised profit guidance expected from a U.S. corporate tax cut. ""Holiday (limited-time offers) and merchandise did not resonate with our customers as planned,"" chief executive Kevin Johnson said on a conference call.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 65 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 14.5% and grew 25% year over year.Total sales of $6.07 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.14 billion by a small percentage but increased 6% from the year-ago level. Notably, Q1 revenues mark Starbucks’ first ever $6 billion quarterly revenues. The year-over-year performance was driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,305 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter, same as the previous quarter. Transactions were even during the quarter against 1% growth in the preceding quarter. The company opened 700 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,039 across 76 markets.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.4% in the quarter due to product mix shift, largely toward food and restructuring cost associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 80 bps to 19.2%.Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteQuarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 7% year over year to $4.3 billion.Comps rise of 2% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 3% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 2% increase in average ticket.Food comps were 2% and the company’s core beverage comp (excluding holiday limited time offerings) was 1%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 31% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 27% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 100 bps to 23% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of food-related mix shift.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 9% to $843.7 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 1%, softer than 2% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth, delivering 6% in the quarter (softer than 8% in the preceding quarter). Japan’s comp growth continues to be negatively impacted by softness in limited time offerings and Frappuccino limited-time offerings, in particular.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 210 bps year over year to 23.3% in the quarter, buoyed by strong sales leverage and positive currency effect.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were up 8% year over year at $283.9 million in the segment, as higher revenues from addition of new stores and positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 2% (against 1% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 300 bps to 13.8% due to softer performance in its company-owned stores.Channel Development (CPG): Channel Development's net revenues improved 1% to $560.3 million. The growth was driven by its foodservice, international and packaged coffee channels.Operating margin contracted 50 bps to 43.4%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 22% to $120 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks now expects global comp growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance at 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in in the high single digits.The company expects its GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.32-$3.36.Starbucks now expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, the raised view reflects net impact of the new U.S. tax law's federal statutory tax rate and related reinvestments.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1207,YUM,"Starbucks’ (SBUX  -  Free Report) Americas segment revenues, comprising 70% of its total revenues, are expected to witness improvement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This could aid the company in reporting higher quarterly revenues when it reports on Thursday, Jan 25.A Look at Starbucks’ Americas Performance in Q4Net revenues in this flagship segment (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America) were down 0.5% year over year to $3.9 billion in the preceding quarter. Comps grew 3% in the quarter, softer than the 5% growth witnessed in Q3. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 1% increase in average ticket. In fiscal 2017, Starbucks’ Americas segment posted 3% comps growth, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period. In fact, transactions remained unchanged year over year and ticket grew 4%. This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and an increase of 1% in ticket in fiscal 2016.In Q4, membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 25% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 390 basis points to 24%, as strong sales leverage was more than offset by hurricanes, higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.Q1 ExpectationThe company’s segment is likely to experience higher revenues with comps growth in the mid-single digits or more. The improvement is expected to be driven by additional store openings, Starbucks’ mobile order/pay along with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty, and e-Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams to boost its top line.Overall, Starbucks’ Americas segment revenues are expected to witness 8.3% growth year over year and 9.4% sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Again, operating margin will be driven by strong sales leverage that will be partly offset by higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.Apart from the Americas segment, Starbucks’ Channel Development business needs special mention. Although the business is small (in terms of its revenue contribution), it generates impressive operating margins, owing to its cost structure. Hence, the Channel Development segment represents a significant profitable growth opportunity.Overall Earnings & Revenues ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 57 cents reflects a 9.6% growth from the prior-year quarter profit of 52 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $6.15 billion indicates a 7.2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Starbucks’s operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. Again, digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. Internationally, the company’s focus on China/Asia expansion is another positive.Meanwhile, change in the product mix (as food, tea and cold beverages will become an increasing part of the product mix), focus on the use of loyalty cards and mobile order and pay technology to boost sales and profits are added tailwinds. Finally, Starbucks’ endeavor to boost its presence in premium coffee consumed at home through K-cups and with ready-to-drink beverages needs special attention.Overall, apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. That said, headwinds, especially in the labor front is a cause for concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

1208,YUM,"El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (LOCO  -  Free Report) has recently expanded its delivery partnership with privately held restaurant delivery service, DoorDash.In September 2017, the partnership began with the duo launching a pilot program in El Pollo Loco’s 98 restaurants in Nevada, Las Vegas and Orange County, CA. Following the expansion, delivery is now available from over 280 of El Pollo Loco’s restaurants, which is more than half of the total number of restaurants operated by the company.Notably, the new participating markets include Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, Dallas, Ariziona, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Sacramento. While ordering is available at El Pollo Loco’s website and app, DoorDash will take care of delivery only.We observe that El Pollo Loco shares have lost 18.2% in a year’s time against the industry’s 11.9% gain.Delayed Entry Into DeliveryThough relatively late, El Pollo Loco’s entry in to delivery makes sense. This is because delivery is considered to be the fastest growing channel in the business and an effective way of addressing changing needs of customers.Moreover, the move should help the company better compete with the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report), YUM! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) Taco Bell and Rubio’s Coastal Grill that offer delivery directly through apps like DoorDash and Postmates.El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Net Income (TTM) El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. QuoteTargeting MillennialsWith millennials getting more concerned about convenience and seeking speedier options, enhancing delivery has become crucial for quick-service industry players.Per market research firm The NPD Group, delivery currently represents 1.7 billion foodservice visits annually and young adults represent 56% of foodservice delivery orders.We believe that with increased focus on delivery, El Pollo Loco will be in a better position to capture a bigger share of millennial traffic.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEl Pollo Loco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1209,YUM,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.’s (CBRL  -  Free Report) multiple sales boosting and cost-cutting initiatives are impressive. However, rising labor costs amid a tepid sales environment along with limited geographical presence remain potent headwinds for the company.Recently, Cracker Barrel posted strong second-quarter fiscal 2018 results wherein both the top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this quarter marked the 27th successive earnings beat. However, the company reported lower-than-expected revenues in 11 of the last 12 quarters.Sales Boosting and Cost-Cutting Initiatives are Major TailwindsCracker Barrel uses seasonal promotions and limited time offers to boost its top-line performance by attracting both regular users and less-frequent guests. Moving ahead, the company aims to continue investing in new product news that will drive business frequency.In fiscal 2018, Cracker Barrel aims to meet consumers' needs for convenience via growth in its off-premise business. Also, the company plans to enhance its off-premise platform by introducing new catering menu offering and the in-store training of hourly employees. In fiscal 2017, Cracker Barrel tested and enhanced off-premise platform in roughly 100 stores and completed its system-wide rollout of the off-premise platform by fiscal first-quarter of 2018. Apart from new product offering, the test featured value messaging across four weeks of local television and in-store advertising. Further, it intends to extend the test with additional markets and television weeks from January to March.Coming to menu innovation, the company recently introduced a coffee platform in approximately 40 stores. It believes that the platform will complement the strength of its breakfast all day offering, drive check favorability and promote guest perceptions of menu variety. The rollout of the crafted coffee program at all stores is expected to be complete by the end of fiscal third quarter.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. Quote Additionally, Cracker Barrel has an effective cost-cutting mechanism in place. In fact, the company undertakes various measures to keep costs under control. In the beginning of fiscal 2017, the company targeted to reduce annual operating cost by $15 million to $20 million. It delivered 15% above the high end of its fiscal-year target and achieved its three-year strategic goal of removing $50 million in annual cost from the business by fiscal 2017-end. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to deliver between $7 million and $8 million in annual cost savings.Rising Cost and Limited Geographic Diversity Remain OverhangsDespite the company’s efficient cost-saving methods, higher labor costs and expenses related to various sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on its margins. Subsequently, Cracker Barrel’s shares have gained just 1.2% in a year’s time, significantly underperforming the 11.5% gain of the industry it belongs to. Although Cracker Barrel has a substantial domestic presence, it loses out on international front. While the other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s (PZZA  -  Free Report) are pursuing aggressive global expansion strategies, Cracker Barrel seems to be weak on this front.Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic. Also, Cracker Barrel’s retail business has been negatively impacted by challenges in the retail industry. Thus, the company’s top line is likely to remain under pressure.Cracker Barrel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

1210,YUM,"Yum! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) robust efforts to enhance digital capabilities, refranchising attempts and transformation strategies continue to be encouraging. However, higher costs continue to hurt the company’s profits. Also, macroeconomic headwinds and unfavorable currency translation might limit the company’s revenue growth.Last month, Yum! Brands reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings but missing the same on revenues.Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Further, earnings increased 21.5% year over year. The shift to refranchising substantially boosted the company’s operating margin and earnings per share, and the trend is expected to continue.Notably, the company’s shares have gained 22.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.7%.Let’s look into the strengths and risks associated with the company.Digital Initiatives Drive Top-Line GrowthYum! Brands had undertaken a three-year strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands that involve employing greater focus on the development ofits three iconic global brands. To build traffic through greater consumer satisfaction, the company is continuously developing digital and technological capabilities.Advanced technological implementations to improve guest experience are also proving to be fruitful for the company’s international business. Yum! Brands believes in maximizing consumer satisfaction to drive revenues.To this end,the company is focusing on building a superlative loyalty program with a large and growing database to help drive future sales. We believe that these initiatives will drive traffic and comps in the coming quarters.In fourth-quarter 2017, Yum! Brands announced a partnership with online food-delivery platform Grubhub to enhance online sales and delivery from its restaurants. Additionally, the company implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms in the fourth quarter across all its brand segments to improve guest experience. To enhance its delivery services, the company announced Pizza Hut’s partnership with Toyota that will facilitate delivery of pizzas via driverless vehicles, showcasing innovation for both the companies.Refranchising Aids EarningsYum! Brands has adopted a de-risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company increased its franchise ownership to 97%. It is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised and to possess less than 1,000 company-owned restaurants by the end of 2018.Refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company’s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and higher Return on Equity (ROE). Alongside, free cash flow will continue to grow, facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return. Remarkably, this shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company’s operating margin over the years. High Costs & Unfavorable Currency as Potential HeadwindsDue to continual expansion in international markets, the company is highly exposed to various macroeconomic headwinds. Thus, the company’s earnings remain highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Also, an increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs have led to a significant pressure on the company’s margins.  A competitive retail environment also puts pressure on the restaurants’ costs.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderYum! Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the U.S. restaurant space include BJ's Restaurants (BJRI  -  Free Report), Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.BJ’s, Brinker and Darden’s earnings for 2018 are expected to increase 27%, 6.6% and 18.4%, respectively.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks’ has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

1211,YUM,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Buffalo Wild Wings Inc. .The company reported lower-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. This bleak performance was mainly due to the increased costs of traditional chicken wings coupled with higher promotional activity, lower-than-expected same-store sales as well as greater labor and operating expenses.ConcernsBuffalo Wild Wings’ earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine of the last 11 quarters due to higher costs. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues have also been lagging the same for the last 10 quarters. Such persistent top- and bottom-line miss raises concerns. In fact, comps have been much under pressure so far in 2017, adding to the woes.Furthermore, the menu price increases made by the company along with a choppy sales environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to affect traffic trends in the near term, thereby weighing on the comps.Additionally, fluctuation in price of chicken – a key ingredient for the company – might hurt the company’s profitability. Notably, the company expects traditional chicken wing prices to rise in the range of 8% to 10% in 2017, which is likely to dampen profits. Also, Buffalo Wild Wings’ promotion of Half-Price Wing Tuesdays puts pressure on its cost of sales as the high priced wings items are offered at lower prices.The costs related to company’s other sales boosting initiatives like unit expansion and higher labor costs due to the competitive labor market are also estimated to continue to hurt profits in the near-term.Moreover, while other restaurant chains like Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonalds Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) pursue aggressive global expansion policies, Buffalo Wild Wings seems to be slow on this front. This is because it has just started to expand its reach in international markets and thus lags severely.Some RespiteVarious sales initiatives undertaken by the company like menu innovation and promotional offerings, increased focus on take-out and delivery services, enhancing digital capabilities, roll out of loyalty program, investing in Guest Experience, along with better food presentation and operational efficiency are expected to boost comps. Meanwhile, the company’s cost-saving efforts are likely to drive margins.Additionally, Buffalo Wild Wings has decided to give something new a shot this summer and started testing small-format stores in the Minneapolis metro area.Given consumers' increasing shift toward to-go and in-home dining experiences, the company is experimenting with these small, fast food style stores. We believe these options are sure to improve its reach as well as market share potential in the near term.Bottom LineDespite various strategic initiatives, the uncertain sales environment and a rising costs scenario could continue weighing on the company’s performance, going forward. It would thus be prudent for investors to remain on the sidelines for some time now.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars. But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

1212,YUM,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on the casual dining restaurant chain, Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report).Cheddar’s Acquisition a Key PositiveIn Apr 2017, Darden completed the acquisition of small restaurant chain, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen (Cheddar's), in an all-cash deal worth $780 million. Excluding certain expenses, it anticipates the transaction to be accretive to its adjusted per share in fiscal 2018 by roughly 12 cents per share.Darden believes that this addition will allow it to further fortify two of its most vital competitive advantages – considerable scale as well as wide-ranging data and insights – going ahead.In fact, as the company progresses with the integration of Cheddar’s, it gains more confidence in its synergy estimates. Management now expects to realize synergies of $22 million to $27 million by the end of fiscal 2019 (up from previously projected range of $20 million to $25 million).Efforts Taken at Other Brands to Boost SalesIn order to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand, the company has implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan. These include simplifying kitchen systems, improving sales planning and scheduling, operational excellence to improve guest experience, developing new core menu items, allowing customization and making smarter promotional investments.Also, the brand is focusing on remodeling, bar refreshes as well as technology-driven initiatives. These initiatives include the system wide rollout of tablets, launch of mobile ordering, the To Go business as well as catering in the U.S, and are expected to add to its top line.At LongHorn, Darden strives to attract guests by focusing on core menu, culinary innovation and providing regional flavors. It is also working on its marketing strategy to improve execution; customer relationship management and digital advertising as well as a strong promotional pipeline that leverages the segment’s expertise.Cost Saving Endeavors Bode WellThe company is focusing on an aggressive cost management plan, under which it has been able to significantly cut operating costs. This would help it boost profits and gain financial flexibility amid a soft consumer spending environment.In fact, for fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings.Moreover, Darden plans to reinvest any incremental savings into pricing and long-term growth drivers for the business, particularly emphasizing on enhancing quality to drive market share gains.Some Headwinds Still PersistOver the last few quarters, the U.S. restaurant space has not been too enticing. Evidently, same-store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment. Traffic too has been weak. In fact, the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood. As a result, the company’s sales have come under pressure.It should also be noted that while several other restaurateurs including Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) have opened their outlets in the emerging markets, Darden seems to be slow on this front.In addition, the collapse of the Republican-led bill, which was intended to replace Obamacare, means that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay. This implies that the restaurant operator will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs, which in turn will hurt margins. Further, the non-franchised model makes the company susceptible to increased expenses.Bottom LineDespite the prevalent headwinds, most of Darden’s brands have been witnessing growth for the last few quarters, given various sales initiatives like operational excellence, menu innovation along with technology-driven moves.Moreover, the acquisition of Cheddar's has added an undisputed casual dining value leader to the company’s portfolio of differentiated brands, which might further drive comps and resultantly sales.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1214,YUM,"Shares of Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) skyrocketed over 15% on Wednesday after making a massive after-hours move yesterday, as investors seem to be more than happy with the company’s choice of former Taco Bell head Brian Niccol as its new CEO.Chipotle’s recent struggles have been well documented. This prompted founder and former CEO Steve Ells to announce the company was in search of a replacement in late November. After months of searching, the fast-casual burrito chain surprised many investors when it decided to hire the head of Yum! Brands’ (YUM  -  Free Report) eccentric taco chain.Niccol’s selection might seem unconventional considering the fact that Chipotle currently runs nearly the exact opposite type of restaurant chain. However, before today’s gains, shares of Chipotle had plummeted 40% over the last year and 23% in the last four weeks alone. The company needed to take a risk with its new CEO to spark a big change and inspire investor and company-wide confidence.The former head of Taco Bell helped transform the fast-food taco chain into a brand with an identity. From its whacky advertisements and strong social media presence to the constant new food fusions and a successful push into the breakfast market, Niccol seems to know how to grow a restaurant chain.Niccol helped worldwide system sales climb by 7% at Taco Bell in 2017. And even though customers aren’t likely to see crunchy Doritos-infused burritos at Chipotle, big changes are in order.Customers around the U.S. have lost their faith in Chipotle, and their trust won’t be regained overnight, but brands can be rebuilt—and that process needs to start as soon as possible.""At Chipotle's core is delicious food, which I will look to pair up with consistently great customer experiences,” Niccol said. “I will also focus on dialing up Chipotle's cultural relevance through innovation in menu and digital communications.”A big push in digital and social media-based advertising is likely on the horizon, and a menu shake-up beyond its widely-panned queso is due. Only time will tell what the brain behind Taco Bell ends up doing, but his background in out-of-the-box thinking is needed. And for now, investors seem more than pleased with this choice.Niccol is set to officially take over as chief executive officer on March 5, and don’t be surprised if changes happen on his first day.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

1215,YUM,"We expect Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.33%. In fact, it outpaced/met earnings estimates in each of the trailing four-quarters with an average beat of 4.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Yum! Brands, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Yum! Brands is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Yum! Brands has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% as the Most Accurate estimate is 62 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 61 cents. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Yum! Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Yum! Brands favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What is Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings?Following China business separation, Yum! Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner, more efficient cost structure, should bolster second-quarter results.Particularly, augmented pace of unit development, along with increased investments in technology-driven initiatives should drive top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.At Taco Bell, the brand’s value-driven, innovation-focused model, inventive marketing strategies, expanded line of breakfast offerings and expansion of delivery program should drive comps.Coming to the Pizza Hut brand, while the international division is expected to continue doing well, Pizza Hut U.S. might post soft results for the quarter despite numerous strategic efforts similar to the last few quarters.Meanwhile, KFC’s efforts to revamp its outlets, focus on its operational excellence, delivery services, innovation and convenience are expected to continue boosting comps. In fact, the launch of the Zinger spicy chicken sandwich in the U.S. in the quarter should further propel sales.However, slowdown in emerging markets along with negative currency translation may hamper the quarter’s performance. Further, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to restrict revenue growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderYum! Brands is not the only company looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies to consider in the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1216,YUM,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because YUM! Brands is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for YUM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 62 cents per share for YUM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for YUM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.64% heading into earnings season.Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Yum! Brands, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Yum! Brands, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that YUM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

1217,YUM,"World’s third largest pizza delivery company, Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), is expected to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 1, after market closes.Last quarter, Papa John’s came up with a positive earnings surprise of 2.67%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 8.55%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Papa John's International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Papa John's International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Papa John's International, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsPapa John's has been delivering positive comps in both domestic and international markets over the last several quarters on the back of various sales building initiatives such as menu innovation and provision of value offers. We expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Furthermore, this pizza delivery company’s strategic partnerships along with continued international expansion bode well. Also, its shift to a healthy menu and commitment to provide quality food should appeal to health conscious customers and boost traffic.Additionally, the company’s extensive investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering, applications development and launch of digital pizza tracker are expected to attract customers and drive growth as well as efficiency in the second quarter.Nevertheless, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might limit the to-be-reported quarter’s revenue growth. Meanwhile, negative currency translation could hamper the quarter’s results, given Papa John's substantial international exposure. Notably, rising labor costs and expenses incurred to execute the initiatives might also dent the quarter’s profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Papa John’s this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Papa John’s has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 63 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Papa John’s has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Whole Foods Market, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1218,YUM,"The Habit Restaurants, Inc. (HABT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market close.Last quarter, this casual restaurant company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 12.50%. Moreover, the trailing four-quarter average earning surprise is at a positive 15.21%.Let’s see what is in store this quarter.The Habit Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  The Habit Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | The Habit Restaurants, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayHabit Restaurants offers specialty sandwiches, fresh salads, shakes and malts. Notably, the previous quarter marked its 53rd consecutive year-over-year growth in comps. The company expects its differentiated brand positioning, successful marketing and culinary innovations, excellent operational execution, high quality limited time offers, targeted digital strategies and innovative media partnerships to help in retaining brand loyalty and thereby drive comps in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, Habit Restaurants recently updated its menu with three new items, which are likely to drive sales.Meanwhile, though the company is looking to expand its presence via new unit openings, an increase in expenses related to pre-opening costs and the development and management of new units might dent the quarter’s profits.Incremental investments in marketing programs and promotional activity as well as consistently higher labor expenses are also expected to weigh on margins. Furthermore, at its first-quarter conference call, management noted that commodity costs, particularly beef and produce were starting to trend upwards and might remain elevated in the short term. This, in turn, could pressurize margins in the second quarter.Moreover, a choppy sales environment in the overall restaurant space might limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Habit Restaurants this quarter.

However, prior to that, the company beat/met estimates in each of the trailing three quarters, thereby resulting in an average positive surprise of 6.20% in the last four quarters.The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayFor the fiscal second quarter, Cheesecake Factory expects earnings per share in 85 cents to 88 cents range on the back of expected comps growth in the band of 1%-2% at its restaurants. This comps sales range assumes a roughly 50 bps positive impact because of the shift in Easter and the allied spring break vacations into the quarter from the first quarter of fiscal 2016.Notably, the company has posted positive comps for 29 consecutive quarters backed by various sales and digital initiatives. Menu innovation, increased focus on home and office delivery, the rollout of an improved server training program and the launch of a mobile payment app should help in keeping up the trend.However, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is likely to hurt traffic and in turn comps in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, we believe that Cheesecake Factory’s profits might continue to remain under stress due to a rising wage rates scenario. Moreover, pre-opening costs of outlets, a little less favorable commodity environment and expenses related to sales initiatives might further dent the quarter’s profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Cheesecake Factory this quarter.

1220,YUM,"Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc. (HVT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 31. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this retailer of full-service home furnishings will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. It should be noted that the company has posted positive earnings surprises in eight out the last 10 quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average of 17.4%.A look into Haverty Furniture’s stock performance, reveals that its shares have been underperforming the industry for the last six months. In the said time frame, the stock has increased 3.9%, compared with the industry’s growth of 23.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors at Play On Jul 10, the company reported second-quarter sales figures, wherein it recorded improved sales of 1.1% year over year. Though growth was backed by higher average ticket and custom upholstery and accessories sales along with increased internet traffic, it was offset by the sluggish consumer traffic. However, second-quarter sales growth was also much weaker than the preceding quarter’s recorded figure of 3%.Comparable store sales were down 0.2% for the second quarter, weaker than the comparable store sales growth of 1.6% in the first quarter. The company believes that the quarter’s sales were hurt due to a delay in Easter. Haverty Furniture stores remained closed for Easter, which was in April this year versus March last year.Post the adjustment in Easter shift, written comparable store sales for the second quarter were down 0.7%, lower than the 4.5% growth reported last year for full second-quarter 2016. Written sales for the second quarter were up 0.6%, compared with preceding quarter’s written sales growth of 1.0%.Despite sluggish written comparable sales, the company remains encouraged by new merchandises that are expected to flourish stores over the coming weeks through summer. The company believes that business will benefit as housing strengthens in the region and the general economy improves. We also remain encouraged by the solid fundamentals of the company and its solid store expansion plans to strengthen its presence in key markets with additional or repositioned stores. Moreover, the company is making innovations with respect to its technology developments. Also, its shareholder-friendly moves are noteworthy.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining for the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents per share and $1.23 for the second quarter and full-year 2017 reflect a year-over-year decline of 20.8% and 5.8%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $191.8 million for the said quarter, down 1.5% from the year-ago period. For 2017, Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at $843.2 million, reflecting a 2.6% year-over-year increase.Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc.

In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last eight quarters, with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 7.41%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Restaurant Brands International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Restaurant Brands International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Restaurant Brands International Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsThe company acquired Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen on Mar 27 for $1.8 billion. This is likely to lead to accelerated global unit development and consequently propel the top line. It should also aid in cutting costs, hence proving accretive to the quarter’s earnings.Meanwhile, various sales-boosting initiatives undertaken like menu innovation, improved restaurant operations, re-imaging and promotional offerings at Tim Hortons and Burger King are expected to drive comps growth at both the brands. Moreover, Restaurant Brands’ efforts to grow global restaurant footprint at both its iconic brands should further boost the quarter’s performance.Also, we are encouraged by the company’s augmented focus on enhancing guest experience and increasing franchisee profitability to create value for all of its stakeholders.However, higher labor costs along with costs related to various sales boosting initiatives are likely to hurt margins. Negative currency translation may further dent the quarter’s profitability given the company’s considerable international presence. Meanwhile, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might continue to limit revenue growth and hurt comps.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Restaurant Brands this quarter.

In fact, the company has surpassed earnings in two of the trailing four quarters, recording an average beat of 1.73%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayAfter 21 consecutive quarters of positive comps, El Pollo Loco witnessed a decline in comps in the last two reported quarters. The downtrend was due to the persistent choppiness in the restaurant space that might continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, we expect this fire-roasted chicken specialist’s fresh handcrafted Mexican inspired cuisine to continue driving its popularity and ensuring steady traffic. In fact, El Pollo Loco’s various sales-building initiatives, relentless focus on providing excellent service, reasonable pricing and its advertising campaign should aid in further boosting comps.Additionally, menu innovation and limited time offers are likely to boost traffic while solid unit development should drive the top line.Meanwhile, El Pollo launched an entirely redesigned mobile app with more convenient features in the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, is expected to drive convenience and loyalty, thereby boosting revenues. El Pollo Loco’s Loco Rewards and its partnership with Olo to enhance delivery services might further propel results.However, increasing labor costs, pre-opening and remodeling costs of outlets as well as investments in sales-boosting initiatives might dent the quarter’s profits. In fact, in the first-quarter conference call management noted that the company is experiencing higher produce costs, especially with regard to avocado prices, which might continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, the rise in expenses combined with the challenging retail environment in the U.S. restaurants space makes us anxious about the company’s overall performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for El Pollo Loco this quarter.

1223,YUM,"Herbalife Ltd.

Notably, its earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 straight quarters now, with a trailing four-quarter average of 18.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Herbalife this quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. QuoteHerbalife has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.10. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP but we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.Estimate RevisionsLet’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 and $4.50 for the second quarter and 2017 has remained stable in the last 30 days and this reflects a year-over-year decline of 14.7% and 7.2%, respectively.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.14 billion for the second quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period. However, revenues of $4.59 billion are anticipated for the full year, which is up 2.2% from 2016.Factors at PlayHerbalife has recently come under the scanner after some law firms like Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP and Lundin Law PC declared investigation related to possible violations of federal securities laws against the company. It should also be noted that on Jun 4, this California-based company, slashed its sales guidance, which was raised during first-quarter 2017 conference call. This was due to the new tougher Federal Trade Commission rules in the U.S. that are expected to hurt company’s business more than anticipated. Also, softness in its Mexico operations and distributors adopting the latest protocols are expected to dent sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The company now expects sales to decline in the range of 2–6% from 0.5–4.5%, guided earlier. Also, volumes are anticipated to decrease 4–8% compared with previous range of 1–5% for the second quarter. Management too expects the quarter to be a challenging one in 2017 compared with the year-ago quarter. Currency is also likely to hurt its results.Notably, Herbalife has been battling with billionaire investor Bill Ackman since Dec 2012, when Ackman made a $1 billion bet against the nutrition company, accusing it of being a pyramid scheme i.e. it employs deceptive marketing practices for improving business. Also, it received a civil investigative demand in 2014 from the FTC related to its marketing practices.Though the company resolved the probe with the FTC and paid $200 million through fines and settlements without being named a pyramid scheme, it was forced to prove that 80% of its annual sales come from documented consumer purchases. Interestingly, the company outpaced the key threshold of 80% under its agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. It announced that 90% of the U.S. sales in May were documented purchases, which consisted of over three million receipted retail transactions.In fact, Herbalife has remained upbeat about its prospects, which is evitable in its impressive earnings history and stock price performance. Shares of Herbalife have surged 41.3% on a year-to-date basis against its industry’s decline of 5.9%. Also, the stock has outperformed the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that has gained 17.1%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1224,YUM,"Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust second-quarter 2017 results, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, shares of the company have declined more than 10% in yesterday’s trading session as strength in domestic markets was overshadowed by weak international comps growth. Although the international segment posted positive comps, the figure came in much below expectations, due to softness in European markets.Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Domino's Pizza Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Domino's Pizza Inc QuotePerformance in DetailAdjusted earnings of $1.32 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 by 8.2%.

The improvement was backed by higher supply chain revenues as well as increased same store sales and store count growth at both domestic and international markets.CompsGlobal retail sales (including total sales of franchise and company-owned units) were up 11.8% year over year. The uptick was primarily owing to strong comps from domestic stores. Excluding foreign currency impact, global retail sales increased 14.1%.During the quarter, the company’s domestic stores (including company-owned and franchise stores) comps increased 9.5%. This compared unfavorably with 9.7% growth in the year-ago quarter and 10.2% growth in the previous quarter.The company experienced year-over-year comps growth of 11.2% at domestic company-owned stores, higher than 9.1% comps growth in the year-ago quarter but lower than 14.1% growth in the last quarter.

The figure also increased significantly from the prior-year quarter earnings of 87 cents, given a substantial rise in revenues.Total revenue rose 17.1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.17 billion driven by new restaurant openings and solid comps growth. However, revenues missed the consensus mark of $1.18 billion by over 1%.Notably, the company’s shares rallied nearly 2% in afterhours trading on Jul 25, in response to the solid bottom-line performance and improved comps.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteBehind the Headline NumbersComps grew 8.1% in the quarter. The increase was mainly on the back of improved customer traffic, along with an increase in average check given reduced promotional activity. However, the comps rise was lower than the prior-quarter growth of 17.8%.Meanwhile, food costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 10 bps to 34.1% given reduction in food waste, improvements in the company’s food safety procedures, lower paper and packaging costs as well as benefit of menu price increases in select restaurants, somewhat offset by higher avocado prices.General and administrative expenses comprised 6% of the total revenue, reflecting a decrease of 110 bps year over year, chiefly due to sales leverage.Restaurant level operating margin was 18.8%, up 330 bps from 15.5% recorded in the year-ago quarter. The upside was primarily driven by sales leverage coupled with more efficient scheduling and deployment of the company’s managers and crew.Marketing and promotional expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 70 bps to 3.7% due to lower promotional costs and sales leverage.Guidance for 2017Chipotle reiterated its previously announced guidance for full-year 2017 as comps are still projected to increase in high single digits. Meanwhile, new restaurant openings are anticipated in the range of 195–210.Currently, the company expects G&A to be in the $290 million range for the year, slightly lower than previous guidance of $300 million.It is also working toward its stretch goal of achieving adjusted earnings per share of $10.00 and restaurant level operating margin of 20% for the year.Our Take2017 has been sort of a turnaround year for the company so far. Finally, sales have started bouncing back from the massive food safety scandal related to the E.coli and norovirus outbreak, which surfaced toward 2015-end and resulted in sales plunging and hurting its reputation.Continued focus on food safety, simplification of restaurant operations, menu innovation, enhancing digital orders and increased brand marketing should drive growth, going forward.However, the recent closure of a Washington-area outlet due to an apparent norovirus alert has started a fresh round of food-safety scare.

(MCD  -  Free Report) posted robust results in the second quarter of 2017, wherein both the bottom and the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.73 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 by 6.8% and improved 19% from the year-ago quarter. The upside reflects stronger operating performance and G&A savings across all the segments.

Notably, at constant currency, earnings grew 21% year over year.Revenues of $6.05 billion declined 3% year over year, mainly due to the impact of the company’s strategic refranchising initiative. At constant currency, the figure declined 2%. However, the same surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of nearly $6 billion by nearly 1%.McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McDonald's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteBehind the Headlines NumbersIn the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 8.9% to $3.57 billion. But revenues at franchise-operated restaurants increased 5.6% to $2.48 billion.Global comps grew 6.6%, supported by positive guest counts across all the segments. This marked the eighth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Moreover, comps growth was higher than the last quarter’s increase of 4%.Segment DetailsEffective Jul 1, 2015, McDonald's began reporting results under four segments: U.S. (the company's largest segment), International Lead Markets (mature markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K.), High-Growth Markets (markets that have high restaurant expansion and franchising potential such as China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands) and Foundational Markets (the remaining markets in McDonald's system).U.S.: Comps grew 3.9% in the second quarter, given the expansion of the national cold beverage value promotion and the launch of the Signature Crafted premium sandwich platform. Notably, this segment continues to build momentum as it executes strategic menu, value and convenience initiatives to attract customers. Moreover, comps growth was better than the prior quarter rise of 1.7%.Segment operating income also increased 5% on the back of higher sales-driven franchised margin dollars, G&A savings and higher gains on sales of restaurants.International Lead Markets: Comps at this segment grew 6.3%, higher than the 2.8% rise witnessed in the last quarter. Continued momentum in the U.K., robust performance in Canada and Germany, and upbeat results across all other markets, drove comps.Operating income was up 8%, including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. At constant currency, the figure was up 13%, primarily on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars.High-Growth Markets: Comps grew 7%, much better than the prior-quarter’s 3.8% increase, led by strong performance in China as well as positive results across the entire segment.The segment's operating income rose 28% (in constant currencies as well). Notably, about half of the increase came on the back of lower depreciation expense due to the accounting treatment associated with the pending sale of the China and the Hong Kong businesses.Foundational Markets: Comps in Foundational Markets grew 13%, faring better than the 10.7% growth in the last quarter. Operating income rose considerably primarily owing to strong results in Japan, along with solid performance across the segment's other geographic regions.

1227,YUM,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27, after the closing bell.The coffee chain giant’s earnings were in line with the analysts’ expectations in the last reported quarter. Starbucks met expectation in three of the trailing four quarters and delivered a positive earnings surprise in the quarter ending Sep 2016, with an average beat of 0.46%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderStarbucks’s operating fundamentals remain strong with solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings. Particularly, Starbucks is strengthening its portfolio with significant innovation in beverages and core food offerings.We expect Starbucks’ global comparable store sales or simply comps in the fiscal third quarter to be driven by significant menu innovations like introduction of a new fresh food concept, Mercato, in Chicago in April. The launch of the Midnight Mint Mocha Frappuccino, Emerald City Mule, Unicorn Frappuccino, and Cascara Lemon Sour is also likely to boost its revenue.Starbucks’ digital offering, Mobile Order and Pay, is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in 2017. Again, Starbucks introduced a new digital order manager or DOM in order to reduce traffic congestion during peak time. Addition of new restaurants, along with growth in Starbucks reward members, is expected to contribute to Starbucks’s revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in the U.S.The company remains focused on growing total G&A below the rate of revenue growth and core G&A at half the rate of revenue growth in the long run. In the last reported quarter, Starbucks had already achieved both targets. The trend is expected to follow in the fiscal third quarter as well.However, a challenging environment in the U.S. restaurant space might be a cause of worry for investors in the near term.That said, sales leverage from positive comps growth, with lower selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) and depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses, is expected to boost Starbucks’s operating margins, thereby driving EPS growth.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 12.2% year over year, while the consensus for revenues stands at $5.74 billion, implying 9.7% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.82%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 54 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 55 cents.Zacks Rank: Starbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider from the Retail-Wholesale sector, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Tempur Sealy International, Inc.

1228,YUM,"Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 27, before market opens.Last quarter, Dunkin’ Brands delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.50%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average beat being 6.10%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsDunkin' Brands operates through the Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands. Various sales and digital initiatives undertaken by the company such as faster and improved product innovation, targeted values and smart pricing, improving the restaurant-like experience, breakfast menu optimization, the loyalty program and mobile ordering service are expected to boost the quarter’s results.Moreover, increased focus on establishing itself as a beverage leader provides the company a great opportunity for growth. In keeping with this strategy, the company’s Dunkin’ Donuts division has launched a variety of products including ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, frozen coffee and fruited iced teas, which might enhance its top line in the to-be-reported quarter. We anticipate Dunkin' Brands robust unit expansion as well as its recent deal with Amtrak to further drive revenues.Meanwhile, the company continues undertaking various initiatives to improve customer experience, expand convenience, and increase transactions. Evidently, Baskin-Robbins has expanded its delivery program in Saudi Arabia to include more than 30 delivery hubs, which should positively impact the brand’s sales.Nevertheless, like other restaurant chains, Dunkin' Brands' upcoming results are also likely to be hurt by high labor expenses. Also, the Breakfast segment, historically one of the company’s most profitable divisions, is facing immense competition with more companies grabbing the market share. It should be noted that this might continue to hurt the company’s top line.Additionally, challenging comps growth in international markets at both its divisions might hamper revenue growth. Also, a downward trend in the U.S. restaurant space might hurt traffic and in turn comps in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Dunkin’ Brands this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Notably, it surpassed earnings in two of the trailing four quarters, bringing the average positive surprise to 13.26%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BJ's Restaurants, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsIn order to navigate through the challenging macro environment, BJ’s Restaurants has been undertaking several major sales building initiatives. Through these, the company aims to differentiate its food quality, improve speed of service as well as leverage its broad menu in the takeout and delivery channel. This should bolster the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarterIn fact, menu innovation, promotional offerings and aggressive marketing and operational strategies have remained strong points for BJ’s Restaurants in the past, and should drive sales in the second quarter as well.Meanwhile, it has also invested heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering that are expected to boost sales in the quarter. Furthermore, the company is committed toward raising its operating margins through cost-containment initiatives.Nevertheless, higher labor costs and expenses incurred to execute the initiatives are expected to keep profits under pressure. In fact, per BJ’s Restaurants’ first-quarter 2017 conference call, management expects increased food and labor costs in the to-be-reported quarter resulting in cost of sales to be around 26% or below.Also, labor cost is expected to be about 35% of sales. Moreover, a higher marketing spend is anticipated while G&A expenses for the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $14.8 million to $15 million.Additionally, we believe that the ongoing challenging retail environment in the U.S. restaurants space and a slowdown in the company’s unit growth plan might pressurize the company’s sales.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that BJ's Restaurants is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Moreover, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 10.69%.Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayAfter four consecutive quarters of comps decline, Buffalo Wild Wings finally witnessed marginal comps growth in the last reported quarter. This upside was driven by the company’s strong market position, new menu launches and investing in guest experience, among other initiatives.In fact, Buffalo Wild Wings’ efforts to revive comps growth via promotional offerings, better food presentation, along with various digital initiatives including the revamp of its mobile app is expected to boost second-quarter results too.Meanwhile, increased focus on better staffing in the take-out area and improving operational execution is likely to further boost take-out sales, a growing segment of the company’s overall revenue stream. Additionally, the variety and convenience of its FastBreak program is expected to have improved lunch-time sales in the quarter.However, Buffalo Wild Wings has been witnessing declining traffic trends, of late. In fact, we believe that the menu price increases made by the company, along with a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might affect traffic trends further, thereby putting the quarter’s comps under pressure.Furthermore, fluctuation in the price of chicken – a key ingredient for the company – might hurt the quarter’s profitability and remains a major cause of concern. Also, the company’s promotion of Half-Price Wing Tuesdays further puts pressure on its cost of sales as the high priced wings items are offered at lower prices. In fact, the increase in this promotion mix last quarter had an adverse impact of 37 cents on the company’s earnings per share. This trend might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, as well.Meanwhile, costs related to company’s sales boosting initiatives like unit expansion and higher labor costs due to the competitive labor market are estimated to continue denting profits in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Buffalo Wild Wings this quarter.

1231,YUM,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 73.1%.In fact, Boston Beer has reported positive surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 30.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Boston Beer will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.28, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 37.6%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been going down ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $228.9 million, down 12.4% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 4.9%, while the industry grew 3.1%.Factors at PlayBoston Beer has been reeling under soft depletion trends of late, evident from its dismal stock performance. This softness can primarily be attributed to soft depletion trends that stemmed from weakness in Samuel Adams, soft craft beer and cider categories, alongside a troubled retail backdrop. Moreover, the competition in the craft beer segment has intensified as new craft brewers are entering the market and existing ones are expanding distribution and tapping capacities, providing more options for drinkers.Notably, the aforementioned factors significantly weighed on the company’s performance in last reported quarter. The company posted year-over-year decline in earnings and sales in first-quarter 2017. Moreover, it has been witnessing contraction in the gross margin for five straight quarters now. Additionally, the company observes that the soft depletion trends have continued into second-quarter 2017. Depletions through the 15 weeks ended Apr 15, 2017 have declined nearly 13% from the comparable year-ago period in 2016. Based on these trends, the company remains uncertain about volumes and profitability for 2017.However, we remain encouraged by Boston Beer’s three point growth plan which focuses on revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. Further, the company’s focus on pricing, product innovation and brand development are likely to boost operational performance and its market position.  Its practice of acquiring assets to expand geographically, along with brand-building efforts and initiatives to add new products remain key revenue drivers.The company is keen on reviving the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Moreover, its cost savings plans are likely to boost gross margin by 1% every year over the next three years.Given the ongoing troubles as well as the company’s efforts to overcome the same, we remain uncertain about the upcoming results. While the near-term outlook indicates a dismal performance in the fiscal second quarter, we would wait and see if its growth efforts make any difference.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Boston Beer is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1232,YUM,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.4%.In fact, Whirlpool has reported negative surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.56, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been declining ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.4 billion, up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized Consumer Discretionary sector in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 5.7%, while the sector grew 2.4%.Factors at PlayThough Whirlpool’s surprise history is not very impressive, its stock performance remains solid backed by the cost productivity initiatives, solid innovations and robust product pipeline. The company remains focused on its innovation strategy that aids in tapping additional sales and significant market share gains. Moreover, its solid integration and cost-productivity activities have been enhancing performance. These factors, along with a robust brands portfolio have been catalysts for the stock.These initiatives keep the company on track to deliver upon its long-term goals, which include EBIT margin growth of over 10% by 2020, organic sales growth of 3–5% every year, annualized earnings per share growth of 10–15% and generating free cash flows at 5–6% of revenues by 2018.Further, the company’s cost productivity programs are in place to deliver improved margins in 2017 and ahead. Evidently, the company delivered solid top-line growth in first-quarter 2017 driven by strength in North America and Latin America.However, the company’s results in the last reported quarter were impacted by raw material inflation and temporary integration challenges in Europe. Further, the company anticipates the integration related challenges to continue in the near term. Consequently, the company trimmed earnings forecasts for 2017.While Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid brands portfolio reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

This appears to be the result of the company’s strategic efforts to boost sales.In sync with these efforts, the company has been focusing on operational excellence, product innovation, undertaking efficient marketing and promotions, offering a value menu, and rolling out more limited-time offerings to improve guest count – which remains the company’s top priority – and drive the top line.Moreover, efforts to enhance digital capabilities, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the U.S. might further propel the quarter’s results.However, a slowdown in emerging markets and the prevailing challenging restaurant environment in the domestic space are likely to hurt sales. Meanwhile, higher labor costs along with currency headwinds might dent the quarter’s profits.Other Stocks to ConsiderMcDonald's is not the only company looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1234,YUM,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25%. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 8.59%.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsChipotle’s new brand-management efforts, along with various sales-building initiatives like menu innovation, simplification of restaurant operations and increased brand marketing should aid in improving guest experience and reinstate customer affinity for the Chipotle brand. This, in turn, might drive its top- and bottom–line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, Chipotle claims to be the only national restaurant brand to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives of any kind in its ingredients. The company’s enhanced focus on making better food accessible to everyone is thus expected to aid in bringing back health-conscious customers and improving sales in the quarter.Meanwhile, the rollout of “Smarter Pickup Times” technology in all its restaurants that offer digital ordering is anticipated to further drive sales as it improves the digital ordering experience.However, costs associated with marketing and promotional initiatives to connect with its customers, implementation of food safety measures and higher labor expenses are likely to continue thwarting the quarter’s profitability.In fact, during the first-quarter conference call, management declared that they expect a short supply environment for avocados that will add 40 basis points (bps) to the company’s food costs in the to-be-reported quarter. Furthermore, marketing and promotional activities are expected to total about 3.6% to 3.7% of sales in the quarter, due to the brand’s national TV campaign.Additionally, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is expected to limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Chipotle this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Chipotle has an Earnings ESP of -2.74%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.13, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $2.19.
