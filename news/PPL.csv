0,PPL,"U.S. stock indexes slouched in early afternoon trading, reversing from early gains of 1% or now to session lows.The market pullback that began after Jan. 26's peak, and turned more aggressive this week, has damaged the bulls' confidence.X The Nasdaq fell 1.2%, while the S&P 500 lost 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average subtracted 1.3%.Volume in the stock market today was up vs. the previous session's pace.If individual investors are looking for a stock that is defying the market's pullback, they might settle on chicken restaurant chain Wingstop (WING). The stock's relative strength line — which measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 — is at a new high. Wingstop is about 3% off its high and has moved sideways during the market's dive, in tight trading that may result in a new pattern.The small-cap company's pretax margin was 29.5% in 2016, the highest in five years. After-tax margin has been running at 19% to 25% in the past three quarters.Wingstop will report Q4 and full-year 2017 results after the close Feb. 22.The Street expects earnings to grow 7% in Q4 and 26% for the full year. Estimates for revenue growth run at 11% for Q4 and 14% for the full year.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.Nursing facilities operator Ensign Group (ENSG) provided one of the few breakout attempts. The small-cap stock surged 8% in the first 25 minutes of trade and then pulled back to a near-6%% gain. Ensign was just above a 24.88 buy point, but a poor market makes any stock purchases extra risky.Ensign is thinly traded, but Wasatch Core Growth Fund (WGROX), which is A-rated by IBD, owns the stock.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the day's winners were a mixed bunch. Chip designers and apparel manufacturers rose. But defensive issues also attracted buying, including food, tobacco and electric utility stocks.The electric utilities group is about 15% off its early December high. Southern Company (SO) is 17% off its high, a decline that has boosted its annualized dividend yield to 5.3%. PPL Corp. (PPL) is 25% off its high, lifting the yield to 5.4%.Losers for the day included travel bookers and automakers.Meanwhile, Congress ended a brief government shutdown and President Trump signed legislation that approved a two-year spending plan. This is expected to end the usual cycles of threats of a government shutdown.RELATED:Amazon Ready To Move On UPS And FedExStrategic Oil Reserves To Fall As Part Of Budget DealMarket Outlook Changes Again

2,PPL,"Sometimes it's been hard to tell with socialist filmmaker Michael Moore whether he's trolling you or really serious when he says certain things. Case in point: An old tweet on Venezuela, vintage 2013, in which Moore celebrated the nationalization of that nation's oil company, PDVSA. It's been an unmitigated tragedy.""Hugo Chavez declared the oil belonged 2 the ppl. He used the oil $ 2 eliminate 75% of extreme poverty, provide free health & education 4 all,"" Moore tweeted nearly four years ago.Time hasn't been kind to Moore, in many ways. This tweet in particular now seems like little more than rank ignorance by someone who actually seems to believe that socialism — a system that has never succeeded anywhere it's been tried on earth — is superior to the free market.But we shouldn't be surprised. After all, Moore's ""documentary"" ""Sicko"" paid glowing tribute to the Stalinesque, two-tier Potemkin village that is the Cuban health care system. Moore was used by Cuba's communist rulers, who let him film scenes of ""typical"" Cuban health care in clean and well-stocked medical centers that were used exclusively by VIPs, communist officials and cash-only foreigners.He didn't film what the average people are subjected to: filthy clinics, bloody and bug-ridden hospital beds, medicine shortages and substandard care.So you wouldn't expect Moore to get Venezuela's oil disaster right, either.We mention this old tweet now because in a piece this week in Forbes, Johns Hopkins University economist and energy expert Steve Hanke shows just how wrong Moore was, calling Venezuela's PDVSA ""the world's worst oil company."" It's not hard to see why.After socialist Hugo Chavez took Venezuela over in 1999, oil output for the newly nationalized oil company immediately began to slide, along with the nation's proved reserves. In 2003, faced with growing unrest and resistance to his heavy-handed rule, Chavez purged the company's management and replaced them with his socialist cronies.The result has been an utter disaster. Venezuela used the oil company as a national cash cow, draining its coffers for short-term social spending projects that came to nothing. PDVSA, meanwhile, is a company in collapse.Chavez died in 2013, which is what prompted Moore's tweet. But he was replaced by Nicolas Maduro, another deluded socialist. The country's decline has continued apace, and so has PDVSA's.Hanke notes that the giant oil company owes just over $10 billion this year in debt payments but, after being raided repeatedly for its cash, is desperately short of financing for badly needed investment. Citing unnamed sources, Hanke says PDVSA has just $2 billion in cash on hand, while the government's foreign exchange reserves — all it really has to stave off mass starvation, since Venezuela imports most of its food — stand at just $10.5 billion.Oil output is off 23% since Chavez came to power.PDVSA, says Hanke, is in a ""death spiral."" So is the entire country.Venezuela's devastated oil company, which sits on one of the world's largest pools of oil, is emblematic of the entire deeply troubled country. Because of the imposition of socialism, Venezuela's economy is collapsing. The once-prosperous nation is now ranked 179th in the world on the Heritage Foundation's respected Index of Economic Freedom, just ahead of another socialist paradise: North Korea.Today, Venezuela suffers from endemic corruption, 800% inflation, a -19% annual GDP growth rate, and interest rates of over 20%. Rampant food shortages are causing malnutrition, and all the diseases that come from that. One area of improvement: Income inequality. Now, most of the country is equally poor, with the exception of those in power.Maduro, of course, blames his country's woes on ""capitalism."" It's a bad joke, but it doesn't hurt capitalists. It hurts average Venezuelans. Children die for lack of decent food and medicine. Jobs are scarce, and families are being destroyed. Crime is rampant: The murder rate is now the highest in the world, a dubious honor that makes it safer to live in downtown Damascus or Tripoli than in Venezuela's capital of Caracas.Just like the Castros in Cuba, Venezuela's older socialist twin, Chavez, Maduro and their allies have turned a country once known for baseball and beauty pageants into a living hell. Michael Moore and the many other celebrity fools who have held out Venezuela as a shining example of enlightened socialism should be ashamed.Today, in the U.S., more than a third of college students in recent polls give a big thumbs up to socialism, preferring it to U.S. style capitalism. So here's an antidote to this Moore-inspired foolishness: Rather than continue to waste money on their kids' obviously useless left-wing indoctrination at college, parents would be wiser to fork over their money instead for their precious progressive snowflake to spend a year studying in that socialist paradise, Venezuela. That would be a real education, one that would last a lifetime.RELATED:Venezuelans Now On A Forced Starvation Diet — Thanks, Socialism!Venezuela: Why Can't The Left Take Voters' 'No' For An Answer?Socialism Is Dying Everywhere — Except For The U.S.

13,PPL,"U.S. stocks kept to a narrow range Wednesday as the Federal Reserve's latest minutes revealed increasing support for an interest-rake hike.The Nasdaq eased 0.1%, while staying near its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1% each. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow are stuck under their 50-day lines.Volume in the stock market today fell on both major exchanges. Recently, losses have come in rising volume, while gains have come in declining volume. That's the opposite of what bulls like to see.The Dow Jones utility average was a top performer Wednesday, rising 1%. Given the chatter about an interest rate hike, the gain in the utility average was unexpected. (Higher interest rates make dividend-paying utilities less attractive.) From a wider perspective, some kind of rebound was no surprise. The utility average has retreated about 11% since its July 6 high.Consolidated Edison (ED) has dropped 11% off its high. The stock rose almost 1%, after falling in 12 of the previous 13 sessions. PPL (PPL) also bounced 1% higher, but it remains 18% off its high. The electric utility has skidded in 10 of the previous 11 sessions.Banks, which are likely to benefit from higher rates, made no dramatic moves Wednesday. Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were nearly flat. Citigroup (C) trimmed 0.5%. Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a Phoenix-based midcap, advanced 0.6%.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, dairy products and gold and silver miners booked the best gains for the day, according to preliminary data. Biotechs took the hardest hit.Blue chips were almost even between winners and losers. Dow components Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) led with gains of about 1%.In the S&P 500, Kroger (KR) grabbed the pole position with a 3% pop. A recent Morgan Stanley report said Kroger's alternative formats have not been fully priced into the stock. Rumors also have swirled over a possible merger with Whole Foods Market (WFM).The Fed minutes from the September meeting showed three members favoring an immediate rate hike. They lost the argument, but may have set the tone for a rate hike in December.IBD'S TAKE: An uptrend under pressure makes buying stocks more risky than ideal, but some stocks could be setting up for breakouts.Railway CSX (CSX) reported quarterly results after the close. CSX fell 1% in regular trading Wednesday, its fourth daily loss in a row, and was slightly higher in extended trading. The Street's consensus estimate was for earnings of 45 cents a share, but the number came in at 48 cents.

14,PPL,"Apprehension that Britons will vote to secede from the European Union is exerting influence great and small in disparate corners of the U.S. equity market. Here's a map to where.A YouGov poll for the Times newspaper published late Monday showed ""Leave"" at 44% and 42% for ""Remain,"" while a survey by ORB for the Daily Telegraph had ""Remain"" at 53% and ""Leave"" at 46% once ""don't knows"" were stripped out. JPMorgan published a list last month of stocks with the highest sensitivity to the Brexit outcome, and that group has been trailing the market of late.The 22 stocks on the list, which encompasses companies from PPL Corp. (PPL) to Invesco (IVZ), have lagged behind the S&P 500 by an average of 2.2 percentage points in June, with Penske Automotive Group (PAG) and PRA Health (PRAH) trailing by as much as 9.1 percentage points.To be sure, the potential impact on U.S. companies is diluted by distance, and it won't be the end of the world for these shares if Brexit goes through, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients last month.""U.K. subsidiaries of U.S. companies are relatively insulated from potential disruptions"" because they ""tend to focus more on domestic end markets rather than trade or export out of the U.K."" Lakos-Bujas wrote. ""We therefore see the fallout from potential disruptions in trade agreements as less significant for their fundamentals.""Among companies with the highest revenue exposure in the U.K., there's still time to hedge risks ahead of Thursday's vote, according to Katherine Fogertey, a derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs. ""The options market is not pricing in strong incremental downside to the stocks with the largest exposure to the region,"" she wrote in a note to clients last week. ""It is still attractive to buy puts for many stocks with high U.K. sales exposure.""Among 18 stocks with liquid options and more than 15% of sales from the U.K., the top two candidates are Penske Automotive and PPL, Fogertey wrote. She recommends buying puts of Penske as insurance related to the company's scheduled earnings on July 28 and its U.K. exposure. Similarly, for PPL, a strategy known in the options market as a straddle can be used to hedge for its earnings scheduled for July 28 and the company's large foreign-exchange exposure.Within U.S.-domiciled companies, there's a lack of consistency when reporting international sales, particularly by region. With the caveat that such reporting is ""poor,"" Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, last week compiled a list of 20 companies in the S&P 500 Index with a high proportion of foreign sales in the U.K. Topping that list are Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX), Ford Motor (F), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Beyond the U.S., Bloomberg has compiled an equally-weighted index of 10 stocks -- including Rolls-Royce Holdings, Barclays (BCS) and Berkeley Group Holdings -- to track British exposure to the EU across multiple industries. The Bloomberg Brexit Equity Index is down 16% in the past 12 months and is on track for its worst year of performance since 2008.Most visibly, bookmaker odds tracking prospects for the referendum's defeat have converged with the direction of the broader stock market in recent days.Odds on the U.K. remaining in the EU have fluctuated from as low as almost 63% a week ago to 79% currently, according to Oddschecker calculations based on bookmakers' quotes. That's more or less aligned directionally with fluctuations in the S&P 500 this month.

Proper maintenance and upgrade of the vital infrastructure lowers possibility of outages and ensures uninterrupted supply of electricity to customers. Proper maintenance of electric poles and lines that pass through vegetation require regular investment for maintenance.FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $10 billion in regulated business through 2021 to strengthen and upgrade existing infrastructure. This strategic investment will help the company to serve a six million customer base more efficiently. Recently, the company’s subsidiaries completed the inspections of transmission lines. We believe that these kinds of steps provide comfort to customers and faith on the company, which attracts more customers and ensures retention of existing ones. Modernization PlansSince 2014, the company has upgraded or replaced existing power lines and incorporated smart technology in the grid. The company has initiated a modernization drive plan — Energizing the Future. The new substation will also have smart technology installed to detect irregular conditions.FirstEnergy is using drones as advanced technology to inspect the infrastructure. Usage of drones is gradually becoming popular among the utility service providers in the United States. Xcel Energy Inc (XEL  -  Free Report), CMS Energy Corp (CMS  -  Free Report) and PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) have already started to utilize drones to maintain their infrastructure.

However, the acquisition is not expected to make a meaningful contribution to the company’s earnings per share till 2020.Acquisition Synergy & Future PlanWith the buyout of Safari Energy, the company would be able to avail of low-risk opportunity in renewable & clean energy segment. The acquisition would enable it to diversify its revenue components and the customer base. The transaction would help PPL Corporation gain expertise in turnkey projects for serving clients, who need support right from the project’s seed funding till its construction and completion.The company planned to replace its Kentucky’s coal fired generation plant over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas.

Of 55% of the total energy generated, nearly 21 gigawatt (GW) added in the United States during 2017, was from a renewable source. Also, 22% of the total electricity generation in the United States comes from a renewable source as of Feb 2018.In 2017, electricity generation from solar resources touched nearly 77 million megawatthours (MWH) in the United States and by 2018 end, EIA expects an additional 5,067 MW of solar power to come online. According to the forecast, solar capacity is anticipated to grow by 127 gigawatt (GW) from 2020 to 2050. Also, electricity generation will likely account for nearly 14% of the total energy output to be generated during the same period.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the consistent growth over the years across some of the renewable energy sources is attributable to U.S. federal policies. Electricity generation from solar enjoys a special Federal Solar Tax Credit, scheduled to expire by 2022. This tax credit has enabled the growth of solar power generation companies as the credit allowed to power generators is transferred to end users via lower solar prices.Price MovementSince the release of the news, shares of PPL Corporation have lost 1.3% compared with its industry’s decline of 1.9%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPPL Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are as follows:CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The decline was primarily due to lower volumes and impact from share dilution.Kentucky Regulated: Adjusted earnings were 19 cents, up 35.7% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates effective Jul 1, 2017 and rise in sales volumes due to favorable weather.Pennsylvania Regulated: Adjusted earnings in the quarter were 21 cents, up 75.0% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to higher transmission earnings due to additional capital investments.Corporate and Other: It includes unallocated corporate-level financing and other costs.

34,PPL,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27. Going by the positive trends, the first quarter is poised to record the strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the S&P 500 members that have already reported are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% beat EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassed revenue expectations.Per our latest Earnings Preview report, overall earnings in the first quarter for all the S&P 500 members are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s concentrate on the domestic-focused matured Zacks Utility sector. This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Auto, Tires and Trucks sector is likely to register an earnings decline.Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generation plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and encouraging investors for efficient usage of electricity.  Rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks have also accommodated the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed has now raised rates six times (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at some Utility stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 3 and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.58% in the last reported quarter.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.55%.Why is a Positive Surprise Likely?A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. Per our model, American Water is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses these components.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +2.44%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 56 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 55 cents.American Water Works Price and EPS Surprise American Water Works Price and EPS Surprise | American Water Works QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the possibility of a beat when combined with a positive Earnings ESP.However, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Water Works continues to benefit from its geographical diversity which reduces the weather and regulatory risks of earnings. The company will gain from new water rates, approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, effective Jan 1, 2018, and will increase annual revenues by $62 million.Through infrastructure investments and acquisitions, American Water Works will continue to strengthen customer base and expand its service area. The acquisition of Village of Fisher’s water and wastewater systems in the first quarter added 850 customers to its existing customer base. It is expected to boost the company’s earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues and earnings per share is pegged at $787 million and 55 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.1% and 5.8%, respectively.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a few other companies from the Zacks Utilities Sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.

36,PPL,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 8.70% in the last reported quarter. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 11.76%.Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise | Pacific Gas & Electric Co. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPG&E incurred costs of $219 million in 2017 for service restoration and repairs to its facilities due to widespread wildfires that ravaged major parts of Northern California in October. These costs are likely to weigh on the company’s first-quarter 2018 results, if the company’s requests for cost recovery are not approved.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E’s first-quarter earnings of $1.03 per share reflects a year-over-year decline of 2.8%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.23 billion, reflecting a 0.8% year-over-year decrease.The company anticipates reducing revenue requirement by $500 million in 2018 stemming from the lower corporate tax rate. This is expected to effectively impact its results from this year. To that end, we may expect its first-quarter results to reflect a partial impact of the reduced revenue requirement.Warmer-than-normal winter in PG&E’s service territory is expected to reduce electricity demand which in turn is likely to hurt the company’s quarterly revenues.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that PG&E is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But this is not the case here as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP:  PG&E has an Earnings ESP of -1.86%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.01 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 per share.Zacks Rank: PG&E has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the Utility space that you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in their upcoming release.PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.

38,PPL,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) received the approval from Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to use drones beyond the operators’ vision and utilize them to survey the transmission lines and perform other operations that require consistent monitoring.Over the past three years, Xcel Energy is using drones in their coal-fired plants to inspect equipments. In 2017, the company got the approval from FAA to use them for power lines inspection, within the operator’s vision. Following the approval, Xcel Energy will deploy the drones for the survey of their transmission line in Denver area. The company plans to seek further permission from FAA to inspect its 320,000 miles of electricity and natural gas infrastructure located in different regions.Technology to Boost Operations    Xcel Energy operates in eight Western and Midwestern States. Half of the states are tornado prone areas. The electric transmission and distribution lines as well as natural gas pipelines are expected to be weather resistant. Proper maintenance and repair of infrastructure enables the company to provide 24x7 services amid difficult climatic conditions. Drones ensure early detection of faults and damages of the electric transmission and distribution lines, which lower chances of outages and increase reliability of services.However, the drones will not replace previous modes of inspection and detection. The company believes that drones have advantages over trucks, helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft.  The inspection of lines will be completed at a faster pace and lower related costs, which will benefit consumers.Drone used by PeersUtility companies are investing regularly to provide safe, clean and reliable service to customers. Additionally, the companies are adopting new technologies to maintain and inspect their expansive infrastructure. Usages of drones are yet to become common among all utility service providers in the United States. However, we have seen FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) and PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) among others to use drones for the maintenance of infrastructure.Considering the advantage of drones over traditional methods of inspection and maintenance of essential electrical infrastructure, we expect to witness increasing usage of the same among other providers as well.    Price MovementIn the last 12 months, shares of Xcel Energy have returned 4.7% compared with its industry’s rise of 2.3%. Zacks Rank & Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can consider CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) from the same space, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PPL Corp. Beats Q4 Earnings Estimates, Gives '18 ViewPPL Corporation reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 55 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents by 14.6%. However, earnings declined 8.3% year over year, primarily due to lower contribution from U.K. Regulated segment.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings per share of 11 cents in the quarter compared with 68 cents a year ago. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings in the reported quarter was due to one-time charge of 44 cents primarily to the impact of U.S. tax reforms.Total RevenuesPPL Corp.’s total revenues were $1,926 million in the fourth quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,855 million by 3.8%. Revenues also improved 5.1% year over year.Segment ResultsU.K. Regulated: Adjusted earnings decreased 27.5% from the prior-year quarter to 29 cents per share. The decline was primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 and lower sales volumes.Kentucky Regulated: Adjusted earnings were 14 cents, up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter. The earnings are primarily driven by higher base electricity and gas rates effective Jul 1, 2017, and higher sales volumes due to favorable weather, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.   Pennsylvania Regulated: Adjusted earnings in the quarter were 14 cents, up 27.3% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses, and higher transmission earnings due to additional capital investments.Corporate and Other: It includes unallocated corporate-level financing and other costs.

44,PPL,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) follows a disciplined capital spending program to maintain and upgrade the reliability of its electric utility systems with $6.5-billion investment planned over the next 10 years. Notably, DTE Electric’s total investment is expected to be $18 billion over the next 10 years.Moreover, the company is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to withdraw a portion of its coal-fired generation and boost the natural gas-fired generation and renewables mix.Further, the company aims at constructing natural gas turbine plants to provide approximately 1,100 megawatts of energy from the beginning of 2022. Apart from natural gas, the company plans to continue investing in wind and solar to maintain a balanced portfolio. In September 2016, MPSC approved DTE Energy’s two 150 megawatt wind projects. These projects are expected to come online during 2018-2020.Coming to its earnings performance, DTE Energy delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. Notably, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings per share is $5.54, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.9%.Meanwhile, DTE Energy operates in Michigan, which has witnessed a gradual economic recovery due to an improvement in employment rates and housing and auto markets. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, which in turn is expected to bolster the company’s growth.The company’s focus on improving its cost structure and directing capital investments toward renewable generation, utility infrastructure and environmental compliance assets have led it to outperform its broader market. Evidently, DTE Energy’s share price increased 9.8% over a year compared with the industry’s 6.4% growth.  On the flip side, despite investing substantially in renewable projects, increasingly stringent government regulations for curbing emissions remains a major cause of concern for DTE Energy.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksDTE Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same space are NextEra Energy, Inc.

45,PPL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PPL Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts PPL Corporation’s current PE ratio tad below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PPL Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.3, which is roughly in line with the current level. Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company’s current share price.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PPL Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 2.9, which is lower than its industry’s average of 7.5 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PPL Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PPL Corporation a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio of PPL Corporation (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.9, which is lower than the industry average of 9. Clearly, PPL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though PPL Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D. This gives PPL a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher or lower in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.The current quarter consensus estimate has increased 2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:PPL Corporation Price and Consensus PPL Corporation Price and Consensus | PPL Corporation QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePPL Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among bottom 27%) it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, its industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

46,PPL,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) recently unveiled capital expenditure plan for 2018-2022 time period, wherein the energy provider plans to invest $8.3 billion. Notably, this represents 18% growth from the prior five-year plan (2017-2021).Details of the Capex PlanCenterPoint Energy aims to spend $1.66 billion in 2018, and almost the same amount in each of the following four years.Per management, solid growth, reliability and grid strengthening duly witnessed in operations enhanced the capital expenditure.The projected capital plan incorporates the Freeport transmission project worth $250 million that has been approved by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, last month. CenterPoint Energy expects a decision from the Texas Public Utility Commission on the project in 2019.How Will CenterPoint Energy Benefit?The Utility sector is a fundamentally capital-intensive sector, where in service providers need to focus on strengthening their transmission and distribution lines. Since Center point Energy provides both electricity as well as natural gas, the company has to spend a lot for upgrading and strengthening its existing infrastructure, like replacing old distribution lines and repairing old gas pipelines.To withstand severe weather conditions as well utilities have to keep their transmission and distribution systems upgraded. During third-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company hinted at increasing its next five-year capital expenditure for both electric as well as gas distribution businesses. The latest investment plan worth $8.3 billion duly reflects the company’s commitment toward offering improved and safe utility services to customers.With increasing demand for utility services, we believe this enhanced capital spending plan will attract more customers to take up the utility services those CenterPoint Energy provides, which in turn will add on to the company’s profitability.Moreover, last week the company issued an updated 2017 guidance hinting at an improvement in its full-year earnings. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the solid capital investments that CenterPoint Energy has made so far got duly payed off in terms of the company’s improved bottom-line guidance. The latest investment plan can also be expected to provide further impetus to CenterPoint Energy’s bottom-line growth.Price MovementCenterPoint Energy’s stock has moved up about 12% over a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 5.4%. This outperformance must have been led by significant customer growth as well as investments to upgrade infrastructure.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the same space can consider some better-ranked stocks such as FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report), PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) and DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) , all of which carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

50,PPL,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) recently provided an updated 2017 guidance, which hints at an improvement in full-year earnings. The company currently expects earnings per share to exceed the range of $1.25-$1.33 in 2017, compared to its prior guidance of earnings at or near the high end of this range.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.31, higher than the mid-point of the company-provided range.Details of the Updated OutlookPer management, recent adjustments made in CenterPoint Energy’s bottom line, including a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and a credit to income tax expenses, primarily led to the raised earnings projection. This updated guidance also takes into account the company’s midstream investments as well as amortization of CenterPoint Energy's basis difference in Enable Midstream.The guidance is also takes factors like Enable Midstream's most recent public outlook for 2017 provided on Nov 1, 2017, and projected effective tax rates. However, it excludes potential impacts such as any change in accounting standards or Enable Midstream's unusual items. The outlook also excluded one-time items like changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and related stocks, or the timing effects of market-to-market accounting in the company's Energy Services business.What Led to the Upbeat Guidance?The recently passed $1.5-trillion tax bill by the U.S. Senate, which includes a deep tax cut for corporates, seems to have played a major role in the lifting of the guidance. In fact, during the third-quarter earnings call, the company did give an indication that a favorable tax reform might result in a lower tax rate for CenterPoint Energy. So, shelling out less in form of tax will boost the bottom line.Moreover, the company had earlier projected income tax rate at 36% for 2017 despite witnessing a slightly higher rate of 37% in the third quarter. The latest tax reform might have pulled down the rate further for the company, thereby leading to the raised outlook.Moreover, CenterPoint Energy’s venture in Enable Midstream has been consistently boosting the bottom line. Considering the fact that Enable Midstream continues to see a strong level of activity on their system with 40, it must have also contributed to this raised bottom line guidance.What Lies Ahead?CenterPoint Energy has been investing substantially to expand its operations to cope with increasing utility demand. The company is currently focused on upgrading infrastructure and improving reliability. Toward this end, the company maintains its capital outlay of $7 billion from 2017 through 2021. With respect to bottom-line growth, CenterPoint Energy expects to witness 4-6% annual EPS growth or exceeding the high end of the range through 2018, inclusive of Midstream Investments.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.41 for 2018, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 7.8%.Price MovementCenterPoint Energy’s stock has moved up about 10.4% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 4.7%. This outperformance must have been led by significant customer growth as well as investments to upgrade infrastructure.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksCenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

51,PPL,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Duke Energy Florida, has filed an application with the Florida Public Service Commission (“FPSC”) to recoup the expenses incurred by it to restore normalcy of utility services in the state post Hurricane Irma.Hurricane Irma hit Florida on Sep 11, with wind speed of more than 100 miles and knocked out power of 64% or 6.7 million electricity customers in the state, per a date provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Thanks to the continuous hard work of the line and field workers, Duke Energy could restore power to nearly 99% of users in Florida.The company will ask for a restoration cost recovery of $381 million and an additional $132 million to replenish its storm reserve account.Increase in Monthly BillIf approved by the FPSC, the monthly bill of a residential customer consuming 1,000 kWh of electricity will increase $5.20 per month for the expected recovery period of three years. The utility bills of commercial and industrial customers are expected to rise in the range of 2.5% to 6.6%, subject to certain conditions.The storm restoration charge is expected to begin from March 2018 as the commission is expected to provide its decision on the same within next 60 days.Investments Help in RestorationDuke Energy has invested more than $5 billion in Florida since 2004 to strengthen its power delivery system in the Southeast.  These investments helped the company in strengthening its distribution lines, vegetation management and automation of the grid.Another utility, NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) through its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) invested nearly $3 billion to strengthen its electricity transmission and distribution capabilities in the state since 2006. FPL already filed with the FPSC to recoup its $1.3 billion expenses in restoration work.All investments made by these companies gave them an opportunity to provide initial resistance against the destruction of Irma. However, the companies had to incur an additional expenditure to restore operation.We expect the recovery of the storm related expenditure to help the utility continue with further investment to strengthen the existing infrastructure and focus more on renewable source to produce electricity.Price MovementDuke Energy has returned 8.2% in the last 12 months, outperforming Zacks Electric Power industry’s rally of 6.6%.The company’s focus on core domestic regulated and highly-contracted renewable business, its stable financial position and streamlining of portfolio will help it deliver a strong performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

52,PPL,"Markets have enjoyed a strong and enduring rally for nearly all of 2017. Benchmarks have broken several milestones on multiple occasions and are on course to create new annual records. Year to date, the S&P 500 is up more than 20% and is on course to registering its highest gains in four years. Successively strong earnings numbers and robust economic growth have been the primary factors powering these gains.However, this extended market rally was not without its occasional losses. Lingering fears about inflated valuations have dogged stocks for some time now. Geopolitical concerns, particularly those related to North Korea also threatened to spoil the party on more than one occasion. Also, there was much hand wringing over the likelihood of tax cuts receiving legislative approval before they were finally signed into law last week.However, it is increasingly likely that the actions of the new administration will boost stocks further in the days ahead. In such a scenario, S&P 500 stocks which have failed to chalk up gains this year should also stand a chance. This is particularly true for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank, which are well placed to ride the continuing market rally in 2018.Factors which Acted as a Drag on 2017’s RallyEven though benchmarks are now close to notching up annual records, a variety of factors have threatened to end their long running rally. Concerns about inflated valuations, particularly relating to tech stocks, have had investors worried on more than one occasion. Even though such fears have yet to come true, they continue to persist to this day. Further, geopolitical concerns have also clouded market sentiment at times. Such worries were especially heightened during North Korea’s recent nuclear tests. Both South Korea and the U.S. government warned of a strong response during these events, leading to losses for stocks.Coming to specific sectors, energy stocks remained depressed over the year with the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) down 3.6% year to date. During the year, the OPEC and other major oil producers successfully adhered to an output control agreement which lent some support to oil prices. However, a step up in production by U.S. shale producers has led to the persistence of oversupply conditions.Further, traditional safe haven sectors have been largely ignored during the year, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) up only 7.4% year to date. Instead, investors have favored high growth sectors such as technology in the quest for superlative gains. Industrywide changes have also acted as drags for specific stocks. For instance, the tendency to shop online has caused numerous store closures and created a near brick and mortar apocalypse.Can Tax Cuts, Infrastructure Spending Boost Gains in 2018?On last Friday, President Trump finally signed the much anticipated tax Bill into law.  The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation is yet to become clear, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.8%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation. (Read: What Will the Q4 Earnings Season Bring?)And now that President Trump has scored his first major legislative victory, it is likely that he will press forward with another major issue on his agenda, infrastructure reforms. It is now widely expected that the Trump administration will announce a new infrastructure package in 2018.During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised to implement a $1 trillion infrastructure package. This plan was intended to improve the state of roads, airports and bridges as well as other public works across the country.Recently Trump has commented that his attempt to improve the country’s infrastructure will easily garner bipartisan support. The major obstacle to be overcome is related to funding and if that does happen, markets could receive yet another boost in the year ahead.5 Losers Set to Gain in 2018Even though stocks have notched up strong gains this year, some factors have acted as impediments to gains on several occasions. However, the projected impact of tax cuts and heightened prospects of a new infrastructure package are likely to sustain markets’ rally well into next year.This is why it makes good sense to bet on those S&P 500 stocks which have taken a beating this year but stand a good chance of notching up gains in 2018. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark. This led the stock to take a huge leap and outpace the industry in a month.
