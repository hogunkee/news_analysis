17,JEF,"Once you've encouraged an investor to back your business, the relationship is just beginning. Investors can generate assets through contacts and expertise, so keep them informed. ""You need to distribute accurate and synthesized information to set and manage expectations over the life of the relationship,"" said Ed McGovern, managing director for Security Properties, an apartment operator and investor. Whether your investors are friends or pros such as venture capitalists, keep them in the loop to maximize the relationship:
"
18,JEF,"• Know the investor. ""Fundraising is still a very personal, relationship-based business,"" McGovern told IBD. While technology has a role to play, ""it's important to resist the temptation to overuse digital communications when cultivating relationships with your investors.""
"
19,JEF,"Strike a healthy balance with investor contact. ""We definitely leverage Web-based tools to distribute information quickly and efficiently, but we don't let that interfere with the client that has an atypical question or needs a simple issue addressed,"" he said.
"
20,JEF,"• Target material. McGovern suggests giving investors information they can consume on their own time, such as newsletters. He also advises companies keep their website updated with research studies, news releases, and links to company and industry press coverage.
"
21,JEF,"• Be upfront. That includes dishing out bad news, which is crucial.
"
22,JEF,"That's from Nick Lazaris, CEO of Coravin, which designs and markets products to pour wine from a bottle without pulling the cork.
"
23,JEF,"""Investors will appreciate that the leader is not only honest and straightforward, but is dealing with the issues at hand,"" he said.
"
24,JEF,"Greg Lambrecht, the founder of Coravin, said the simple act of keeping investors up-to-date ""eliminates unnecessary surprises.""
"
25,JEF,"• Staff appropriately. Ensure you have the infrastructure in place to disseminate information to investors. McGovern shares that ""today's investor wants to know you have an array of competent and responsive people who are exposed to industry trends, communicate well internally and really understand their responsibilities.""
"
26,JEF,"• Pick your audience. Select the right investors — those who can invest in future rounds and who have ""the industry knowledge and connections in your field that may lead to important hires and solutions to strategic problems.""
"
27,JEF,"• Network.Putting into practice methods to keep investors up-to-date lays the groundwork to finding new ones too. Since raising capital can take hours a day, ""it's important to spend your time finding investors who share your thesis about your market and vision instead of trying to change the minds of those who don't.""
"
28,JEF,"So said Jef Holove, CEO of Basis, which makes advanced health trackers: ""Consider raising money even when you don't need to be. Your negotiating position will be better, and you are likely going to need more than you think.""
"
29,JEF,"• Use investor expertise.Give applicable ones board positions and engage them in problem solving, suggests Daniel DeMeo, CEO of Capital Access Network , which helps small businesses find capital.

128,JEF,"Value investing is always a very popular strategy, and for good reason. After all, who doesn’t want to find stocks that have low PEs, solid outlooks, and decent dividends?Fortunately for investors looking for this combination, we have identified a strong candidate which may be an impressive value; Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF  -  Free Report).Jefferiesin FocusJEF may be an interesting play thanks to its forward PE of 14.4 its P/S ratio of 0.7 and its decent dividend yield of 1.7%. These factors suggest that Jefferies is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings, and that JEF has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings.Leucadia National Corporation PE Ratio (TTM) Leucadia National Corporation PE Ratio (TTM) | Leucadia National Corporation QuoteBut before you think that Jefferies is just a pure value play, it is important to note that it has been seeing solid activity on the earnings estimate front as well. For current year earnings, the consensus has gone up by 270.2% in the past 30 days, thanks to one upward revisions in the past one month compared to none lower.This estimate strength is actually enough to push JEF to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggesting it is poised to outperform. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.So really, Jefferies is looking great from a number of angles thanks to its PE below 20, a P/S ratio below one, and a strong Zacks Rank, meaning that this company could be a great choice for value investors at this time.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

"
129,JEF,"Which valuation metric is better: the PEG ratio or the P/E ratio?Before we answer that question, let's first start with some basics.DefinitionsThe P/E ratio is simply: Price / EarningsEssentially, this tells you how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit (year) of earnings. If a stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 30, it is said to be trading at 30x times its annual earnings.In general, the lower the P/E ratio the better. A common threshold for many investors is a P/E of 20 or less. (For the record, at the time of this writing, the S&P 500 Index was trading at a P/E (using F1 Estimates) of 15.33.)A PEG ratio is the: P/E Ratio divided by the Growth RateConventional wisdom says a value of 1 or less is considered good (at par or undervalued to its growth rate), while a value of greater than 1, in general, is not as good (overvalued to its growth rate).Many believe the PEG ratio tells a more complete story than just the P/E ratio. (The S&P at the time of this writing had a PEG ratio of 1.93.)ComparisonLet's take a look at both of these in action.For example: a company with a P/E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20% would have a PEG ratio of 1.25 (25 / 20= 1.25).While a company with a P/E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50% would have a PEG Ratio of 0.80 (40 / 50= 0.80).Traditionally, investors would look at the stock with the lower P/E ratio and deem it a bargain (undervalued). But looking at it closer, you can see it doesn't have the growth rate to justify its P/E.The stock with the P/E of 40, however, is actually the better bargain since its PEG ratio is lower (0.80) and is trading at a discount to its growth rate.In other words, the lower the PEG ratio, the better the value. That's because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth.So which one is better?They both have their usefulness. I do like how the PEG positions the P/E ratio in relation to its growth rate to put everything into perspective.Quite frankly, I use both, so I'm going to say it's a tie. Plus, you couldn't even create the PEG ratio without the P/E.But, you don't have to choose one or the other. You can use both. And that's how we're using it in this week's screen.Screen ParametersLet's first start with:• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2(Only stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy or #2 Buy can get thru.)• Projected One Year Growth Rate greater than S&P 500(Market outperformers are what we're looking for. The 1 year projected growth rate for the S&P is currently 7.94%. So only those above that will qualify.)• P/E Ratio (using F1) less than or equal to 20 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median (Not only do we want our P/Es to be below their classic valuation threshold, but we want them to be below the median for their industry as well.)• PEG Ratio less than or equal to 1 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median (P/E divided by its (F1) projected growth rate. This one also has to be below its classic valuation marker and have a PEG ratio below the median for its industry. This ensures that they are considered undervalued on an absolute basis as well as undervalued relative to its group of peers.)• Price greater than or equal to $5• Avg. 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000This screen will find stocks with market beating growth rates, yet still be considered undervalued on two of the most effective valuation markers. And of course, with the Zacks Rank added to it, each one of these picks will be experiencing upward earnings estimate revisions, which provides a timely catalyst for the stock to move.ResultsHere are 5 stocks from this week's list, along with their P/E ratio (using F1 Estimates) and their PEG ratio (using F1 Projected Growth Rates):(ACLS  -  Free Report) Axcelis Technologies(P/E: 10.18, PEG: 0.45)(CZZ  -  Free Report) Cosan Limited(P/E: 5.51, PEG: 0.34)LUK Leucadia National(P/E: 16.85, PEG: 0.94)(ON  -  Free Report) ON Semiconductor(P/E: 12.27, PEG: 0.83)(TECD  -  Free Report) Tech Data(P/E: 10.18, PEG: 0.45)Sign up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and get the rest of the stocks on this list and start using this screen in your own trading.

131,JEF," Leading the market out of the gate on Election Day, financials certainly had their day in the sun. The fundamental driving forces behind the move higher were interest rates on the rise and small business optimism. The hope was that Trump’s infrastructure spending and tax plans would provide a huge boost to the domestic economy. Companies in the lending business would be positioned to benefit greatly from these policies.One of those financials is today’s Bull of the Day Leucadia National LUK. Leucadia is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Leucadia Leucadia National Corporation operates as a diversified holding company that focuses on financial service businesses and investments in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Its services include equities research, sales, and trading; financing, securities lending, and other brokerage; wealth management; fixed income sales and trading; futures; equity capital markets, debt capital markets, and financial advisory; and asset management services. The company also provides online foreign exchange trading, contract for difference trading, spread betting, and related services.In addition to the favorable Zacks Rank, Leucadia has Value and Momentum Style Scores of B to go along with a Growth Style Score of B. A big reason for the rank is an analyst has increased their EPS estimate from $1.32 to $1.56 for the current year. The company is also coming off a big quarter where their earnings came in at 37 cents versus expectations for 23 cents per share.Shares of LUK leapfrogged the 50-day moving average shortly after Election Day. Since then, the stock has rallied from $18 to new highs over $27. The initial surge in price stalled out just over $24. LUK retraced back to the 50-day moving average then found support from buyers. It rallied off that level , broke to new highs, then retested the 50-day again before pushing on through to new highs. Now the Commodity Channel Index is showing the stock is well oversold with the CCI at -177. Traders looking to jump in should wait for the CCI to cross up through the zero line to give a fresh “Buy” signal before loading up.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

134,JEF,"With earnings season officially set to begin in two weeks (when Alcoa reports earnings after the close on 4/24), this is a good screen to use both before and after a company reports.Like any earnings season, we're going to see both positive surprises and negative surprises.This screen however focuses on more than just earnings surprises, but instead goes over the importance of both earnings surprises and sales surprises, and why as an investor you should care so much about them.As you know, if a company reports earnings above expectations, that's a positive surprise, and the price in general should go up.If the company reports earnings below expectations, that's a negative surprise, and the price in general should go down.But a surprise is more than just a snapshot of an extra few dollars and cents a company made or lost in that one period. Instead, it's a glimpse into what a company's earnings could be, or should be, in the future.And when these surprises occur, the market tries to quickly re-price that stock to reflect these changes.Not All Surprises Are Created EqualSome earnings surprises are due to revenue increases, and other earnings surprises are due to cost cutting measures.Top line growth (or sales growth) usually produces the biggest price reaction over cost-cutting, because an increase in sales is generally thought of as more sustainable. Once you've cut costs, where’s the future growth going to come from? You can only cut costs so much. You need sales to drive long term growth.There's also guidance. What the company sees down the road is important.If you've got a positive surprise on one hand, but then downward guidance on the other, that'll usually produce a negative reaction. Why? Because they've taken away the hope generated from the surprise by saying the future outlook will likely be weaker than expected.There's also the idea that some surprises aren't really surprises -- either because a company has a history of continuously beating their estimates or the stock has already priced in a 'surprise' by running up or going down prior to the announcement; therefore, the 'surprise' in that direction really wasn't a surprise at all. That's where you'll sometimes see an opposite reaction to an earnings surprise - a ""buy the rumor sell the fact"" type event.But while predicting which companies will surprise or not can be difficult, the benefit of an earnings surprise will typically last for one to three months after a surprise is reported.So you can get in after a company reports a surprise, or you can try and find companies that are more likely to report a surprise, and get in ahead of time.Screening ParametersThe screen I'm running today starts off with:• Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 5%(Stocks posting positive surprises have a tendency of surprising again.)• Last Sales Surprise greater than or equal to 5%(A positive sales surprise shows top line strength. And once again, a company that has surprised in the past is more likely to surprise again in the future.)• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2(Only Zacks Rank 1 and 2 Strong Buys and Buys can get thru.)• Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000Just these few criteria narrows down the universe from over 8,800 stocks to just over 20.Here are 5 stocks that meet this criteria:(CGNX  -  Free Report) Cognex(reports on 5/1)(BCC  -  Free Report) Boise Cascade(reports on 5/2)LUK Leucadia National(reports on 5/3) Walker & Dunlop(reports on 5/3)(ORA  -  Free Report) Ormat Technologies(reports on 5/8)All of these companies reported both earnings surprises and sales surprises their last time out. A great combination.

137,JEF,"It commonly happens in stock investing that investors miss the chance of buying winning stocks that they knew would stand out. Before they take the plunge, others get to know the hidden potential and enter into these stocks, pushing them out of reach.So, instead of repenting, spotting the off-the-radar potential winners and immediately investing in them could be a smart decision.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Leucadia National Corporation (JEF  -  Free Report). This Financial - Miscellaneous Services stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current year significantly. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock gained only 2.7% over the same time frame.Leucadia National Corporation Price and Consensus Leucadia National Corporation Price and Consensus | Leucadia National Corporation QuoteYou should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward. This year’s expected earnings growth over the prior year is 88.5%, which should ultimately translate into price appreciation.And if this isn’t enough, JEF currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which further underscores the potential for its outperformance (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here: About Zacks Performance). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.So if you are looking for a stock flying under-the-radar that is well-equipped to bounce down the road, make sure to consider Leucadia National.

138,JEF,"This week, I'm going to focus on the Price to Sales ratio for finding great stocks at great values.The Price to Sales ratio is a great valuation metric. And given the recent run-up in stocks, value, to me, is becoming more and more important.In fact, aside from the Zacks Rank, if I could only use one item to screen and pick stocks with, this item would be the one.DefinitionLet's first start with a definition.The Price to Sales ratio is simply: Price divided by SalesIf the Price to Sales ratio is 1, that means you're paying $1 for every $1 of sales the company makes.A price to sales ratio of 2 means you're paying $2 for every $1 of sales the company makes.As you might have guessed, the lower the Price the Sales ratio, the better.A price to Sales ratio of .5 means you're paying 50 cents for every $1 of sales the company makes.And paying less than a dollar for a dollar's worth of something is a good bargain.One of the reasons I like the Price to Sales ratio is because it looks at sales rather than earnings, like the P/E ratio does.And sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement than earnings.Secondly, I'd be hard pressed to find a screen where adding the Price to Sales ratio didn't improve it.Price to Sales StudyFor me, I prefer to look for stocks with a Price to Sales ratio under 1. Although, I'm willing to go up to 4, depending on the industry.But in my testing, as the illustration below shows, those with a Price to Sales ratio of 1 or less produced the best returns. Between 1 and 2 also outperformed pretty significantly. But once you got over 4, the odds were against you. P/S range greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1:Average Annual Return: 17.8% P/S range greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2: Average Annual Return: 11.1% P/S range greater than 2 and less than or equal to 3: Average Annual Return: 7.3% P/S range greater than 3 and less than or equal to 4: Average Annual Return: 3.8% P/S range greater than 4: Average Annual Return: -7.9% But the best way to use it, I've found, is to find stocks with a Price to Sales ratio below the median for its Industry.And that's what we'll be focusing on in this week's screen.Screen Parameters• Projected Growth Rate greater than or equal to Projected Growth Rate for the S&P(Above market growth rates.)• Last Earnings Surprise greater than 0(Positive EPS Surprise)• Last Sales Surprise greater than 0(Positive Sales Surprise)• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2(Only stocks with a Zacks Rank of a Strong Buy or Buy get through.)• Price to Sales less than or equal to Median Price to Sales for its Industry(Valuations that are lower than their Industry.)• Price greater than or equal to $5• Avg. 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000Stock SelectionsHere are 5 stocks from this week's list:(KBH  -  Free Report) KB Home(LPX  -  Free Report) Louisiana-PacificLUK Leucadia National(UCTT  -  Free Report) Ultra Clean Holdings(XCRA  -  Free Report) Steel DynamicsSign up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and get the rest of the stocks on this list.

141,JEF,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Leucadia National Corporation (JEF  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in JEF.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate move down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.25 a share a month ago to its current level of 84 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Leucadia National has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 17 cents a share from earnings of 24 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 7.8% in the past month.Leucadia National Corporation Price and Consensus Leucadia National Corporation Price and Consensus | Leucadia National Corporation QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Diversified Operations industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Safety, Income and Growth, Inc.

151,JEF,"We've all heard the old adage that 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in.In fact, studies have shown that just getting into an average stock in a strong industry is likely to outperform a great stock in a poor industry.Of course, this does not mean that you can just pick any stock in a top group and expect to make money. But, it does underscore the importance of sticking with the best industries.If your last losing stock was in a poorly performing industry, the odds of success were against you the entire time.But identifying the best stocks in the best industries is easy to do. And the Zacks Industry Rank is the ideal way to do that so you can put the odds of success in your favor on your very next trade.Zacks Industry RankAs you know, since 1988, the Zacks #1 Rank stocks have generated an average annual return of over 26% per year. That's nearly 3 times the S&P 500. And it's beaten the market in 23 of the last 26 years.That's because the Zacks Rank is based on the most powerful force impacting stock prices, which is earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank is also one of the best ways to rank industries. And this is done with the Zacks Industry Rank. After all, since an industry is nothing more than a group of stocks in a similar business, this is the perfect way to size up an industry.The Zacks Industry Rank is determined by calculating the average Zacks Rank for all of the stocks in the industry and then assigning an ordinal rank to it. For example, an industry with an average Zacks Rank of 1.6 is better than an industry with an average Zacks Rank of 2.3. So the industry with the better average Zacks Rank would get a better Zacks Industry Rank.Zacks classifies all stocks into 1 of 265 expanded (aka 'X') Industries. The average Zacks Rank is calculated for every industry every day. So, if an industry has the best average Zacks Rank, it would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Rank Industries.The top 132 Zacks Ranked industries would be in the top 50% of industries, whereas the bottom 133 Zacks Ranked Industries would be in the bottom 50% of industries.If an industry had a poor average Zacks Rank, it might be ranked 220th out of 265 industries, thus placing it in the bottom 17% of Zacks Rank Industries.Putting the Zacks Industry Rank to the TestTo further illustrate the importance of picking stocks in the best industries, and how the Zacks Industry Rank is one of the best ways to do this, take a look at the test results and chart below.We put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The top blue line is the performance of the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The orange line below is the performance for the bottom 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The maroon line is the S&P 500.Keep in mind that even the worst industries had some Zacks Rank #1s in them. And even the best industries had some Zacks Rank #5s in them. That goes to show the power of simply being in the best group.The next chart shows what would happen if only the Zacks Rank #1s were applied to the top Zacks Ranked Industries.The results were even better, adding to the already impressive returns by an additional factor of more than 1.5x the top industry. The top orange line is the performance of the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries with just the Zacks Rank #1s. The blue line below is the performance for the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries with all Zacks Ranks included. Once again, the maroon line is the S&P.It's clear that selecting the best stocks in the best groups can give your stock picking a decided advantage, increasing your portfolio's returns like never before.Using the Zacks Industry RankOnce again, the Zacks Industry Rank is calculated by averaging the Zacks Rank for all stocks within a specific industry. The industry with the lowest average Zacks Rank will be considered the top Zacks Ranked Industry (1 out of 265) while the industry with the highest average Zacks Rank will be ranked at the bottom of the Zacks Ranked Industries.Remember, the Zacks Rank is a score of 1 thru 5 with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) being the best, and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) being the worst.If there were 10 stocks in an industry and five had a Zacks Rank #1, and the other five a Zacks Rank #2, the average Zacks Rank would be 1.5. That industry would receive a top Zacks Industry Rank.An industry that had five stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), and the other five a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), would have an average Zacks Rank of 4.5. That industry would receive a low Zacks Industry Rank. Since you always want a diversified portfolio, don't select all of your stocks from the top Zacks Ranked Industry. You should populate your portfolio with stocks from groups in the top 50% of Zacks Rank Industries (top 133 industries).5 Stocks from 5 Top Zacks Rank IndustriesBelow are 5 stocks within 5 of the top Zacks Ranked Industries.I also included some of my other personal favorite stock picking items, including: 'Increasing Net Margins', 'increasing ROE', and a 'Low Price to Sales Ratio'.Parameters• Zacks Rank equal to 1• Top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries• Price to Sales less than or equal to 1• ROE (recent) greater than ROE (from 1 Quarter ago)• Net Margin (recent) greater than Net Margin (from 1 Quarter ago)Stocks(ARLP  -  Free Report) Alliance Resource Partners(CZZ  -  Free Report) Cosan Ltd.LUK Leucadia National(PHM  -  Free Report) PulteGroup(XPO  -  Free Report) XPO LogisticsSummaryWe said it before, but it's worth saying it again: 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. So it's of the utmost importance to make sure your stocks are within the top industries -- specifically the top Zacks Ranked industries.If you find yourself considering a stock that happens to be in one of the bottom 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, move on. Sure, it may still go up, in spite of the drag the low industry rank has placed on it. But, why put yourself in a position where the odds are against you? And if you get in, against your better judgment, and it does go down, you'll be wondering why you ever did that in the first place. Instead, put the odds of success in your favor.Remember, a top Zacks Industry Rank means more stocks within that group are receiving upward earnings estimate revisions. That means something positive is happening to that group. Not just that stock, but for the bulk of those stocks within that industry's business. If it has a poor Industry Rank, that means more companies within that industry are receiving downward earnings estimate revisions. In other words, conditions are tough for that industry's business right now, causing the analysts following that group to lower their estimates.Simply put, your most profitable stocks will be those with upward earnings estimate revisions in the industries enjoying the same.And there's no better way to increase your odds of success than by combining the Zacks Rank and the Zacks Industry together.Sign up now for your free trial to the Research Wizard and start using the Zacks Industry Rank today.Click here for your free trial to the Research Wizard.Want more articles from this author?
