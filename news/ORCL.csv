0,ORCL,"It's hard to think of LogMeIn (LOGM) as an underdog anymore.This scrappy tech firm took on the likes of Cisco (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Citrix (CTXS) and pioneered remote access to desktop and handheld devices via cloud computing. Now it's turning its guns on targets like Salesforce.com (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and Zendesk (ZEN).XEarly this year, it tripled in size overnight to become one of the world's top 10 Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, companies based on revenue, thanks to its $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's GoTo business.""The company is well on its way to its three-year, post-acquisition targets, and we believe the cash flow opportunity still justifies a much higher stock price,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a recent note to clients, after LogMeIn disclosed financial results for the third quarter. JPMorgan is a market maker in LogMeIn shares.Based in Boston, LogMeIn offers software tools for cloud connectivity and collaboration, secure device access, and remote customer support. For an increasingly mobile and global workforce, it offers products such as Join.me, for online meetings; GoToWebinar, for online seminars; GoToAssist, for online assistance; and LastPass, for online password management.Now LogMeIn is at that point where it's an established tech player, yet small enough with around $1 billion in annual sales to generate powerful growth.Thanks in part to a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% annual return on equity, LogMeIn ranks No. 1 out of 56 companies in IBD's enterprise software group. ServiceNow (NOW), Paycom Software (PAYC), Blackbaud (BLKB) and Salesforce round out the top five.Within its core markets, LogMeIn is growing fastest in what is known as the identity business. LastPass, a product that offers simple and secure access to apps, devices and data, is doing especially well.In an email interview with Investor's Business Daily, LogMeIn Chief Executive Bill Wagner described his company as a leader in serving small and medium businesses. LogMeIn also counts millions of individuals among its customers, as well as the largest technology providers such as Dell Technologies (DVMT) and HP Inc. (HPQ); the world's biggest telcos like Verizon (VZ) and Australia's Telstra; and familiar Silicon Valley growth names like Evernote and Dropbox.A key market where LogMeIn sees long-term growth opportunity is a realm known as Unified Communications and Collaboration. It's one that has emerged as traditional enterprise collaboration vendors such as Microsoft and IBM (IBM), as well as traditional enterprise communication vendors like Cisco, have made inroads into each other's turfs.""Prior to the (GoTo) merger, our popular Join.me product was a high growth disrupter in the collaboration market,"" Wagner said. ""Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.""JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a ""larger opportunity"" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged triple-digit earnings and revenue gains, while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at ""big ambitions"" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks and cloud players have a strong presence in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, where you can find new ideas for your investing watchlist.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents ""more human"" for hundreds of companies across the world, including Intuit (INTU), FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service — one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.""We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,"" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the fastest-growing web-conferencing product less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution. Plus, upstarts like Splashtop and TeamViewer are moving into remote access, support and monitoring.Competition in this increasingly crowded space is expected to drive down prices, with only the strongest players likely to survive.Still, analyst expectations for future growth have marched up, notwithstanding LogMeIn's formidable annual 45% earnings growth rate and 46% sales growth rate over the past three years.Consensus estimates call for annual earnings of $3.28 per share in 2017, up from $2.03 in 2016 and from $1.66 in 2015. Earnings are seen climbing to $4.10 a share in 2018, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is forecast at $1.02 billion in 2017, ballooning from $336 million in 2016 and from $272 million in 2015. It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.""We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,"" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a ""favorite idea"" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.RELATED:Could This IBD 50 Software Stock Be The Next Cloud-Transition Star After Adobe?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

1,ORCL,"Oracle shares fell Friday after the enterprise software company delivered quarterly earnings late Thursday that topped estimates but gave guidance for the current quarter that fell short.Following the second-quarter earnings report after the market close Thursday, Oracle shares initially hit a record high of 53.14 then reversed as guidance was revealed, with cloud-computing estimates below forecasts. On Friday, Oracle shares closed down 7.7% at 48.74 on the stock market today.XFor the period ended Aug. 31, Oracle reported revenue of $9.2 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter, with adjusted earnings of 62 cents, up 13%, and both beating the consensus estimate for the third straight quarter.""Most of the key metrics came in at least a bit better than expected,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis in a research note to clients. ""But the cloud growth guidance, even adjusting for currency, was a bit less than some hoped, so the stock traded off.""Davis maintained a buy rating on Oracle and raised his price target to 57 from 56.""Our view remains unchanged, which is that Oracle is a logical and relatively safer port in a storm that some fear will arrive. We believe Oracle is sufficiently inexpensive that it should remain a buy,"" Davis wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Oracle said total cloud revenue in the quarter rose 51% from the year-ago quarter to $1.5 billion. For the current quarter, Oracle said it expects cloud-computing revenue to grow in the range of 39% to 43% from the year-ago quarter, a deceleration from the 51% growth in its first quarter and short of the consensus of 48% growth.Cloud-computing guidance fell below expectations due partly to the timing in the recognition of some bookings, which are dependent on customer deployment. Growth was also affected by the timing of software contract renewals, Oracle said.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White maintained a buy rating on Oracle and price target of 62.""Although Oracle's transition to the cloud has proven to be an arduous journey over the past three-plus years, we believe the worst is over,"" White wrote.RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan maintained an outperform rating on Oracle and a price target of 56.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk maintained a buy rating and price target of 58.Oracle received a string of encouraging reports just ahead of earnings.RELATED:Oracle Soars As Cloud Revenue Skyrockets 58%These Five Tech Firms Are Corporate America's Biggest Cash Hoarders

3,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) reported quarterly results after the market close Thursday that edged out analyst views and initially lifted shares of the enterprise software maker, but the stock fell after hours once the company gave its guidance for the current quarter.Oracle reported revenue of $9.2 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $9.02 billion, for its fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31 and up 7% from the year-ago quarter.

7,ORCL,"The coalition of companies jockeying with Amazon.com (AMZN) for a lucrative Pentagon computing contract is far bigger than previously reported, signaling added heft behind efforts to keep the work from going exclusively to the world's largest cloud services provider.SAP America (SAP), General Dynamics' (GD) CSRA unit, Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among at least nine companies that have coordinated their opposition to the government awarding the contract to a single provider, according to emails obtained by Bloomberg News. The Amazon cloud services business leads the market and is widely perceived to be the front-runner.The most active members of the coalition trying to fend off an Amazon cloud win are Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and International Business Machines (IBM), according to two people familiar with the matter. Other companies involved include Dell Technologies (DVMT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Bloomberg has reported.SAP and the others aren't considered top contenders for the contract. But the companies are banding together to fight the Pentagon's plans to award it to a single bidder. They're concerned it could disrupt their established business model for obtaining military contracts.The Pentagon announced a winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar cloud services contract in March.It has since paused the bidding process for the project. The reason is it would transition massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. The government has said it still plans to award the contract by September.Representatives for SAP, Red Hat, CSRA and VMware declined to comment.The interest is widespread among technology companies in pressing the Pentagon to change its procurement approach. For one, it indicates the importance of the lucrative contract. Providers are struggling to catch up to Amazon cloud. The same is true for firms that sell software and other technology to federal agencies.Companies have begun conversations about jointly bidding for the contract known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, sources say.The Pentagon has tapped Dana Deasy to be its new chief information officer to oversee the contract. Members of the coalition welcome the move, sources say.""Dana Deasy is a highly professional, seasoned, transformational CIO who will lead the DoD's technology efforts with distinction,"" Oracle's Senior Vice President Ken Glueck said in a statement.Deasy's comments before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in May pleased the coalition, sources say. While he didn't address the JEDI contract specifically, he talked about the importance of using multiple cloud providers.Deasy previously worked as global chief information officer for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) at a time when the company made major investments to transition to a public cloud. He held similar positions at the North American unit of General Motors (GM), Tyco International and Siemens' (SIEGY) North American operation.""Under Deasy's leadership, the department will gradually consolidate its disparate networks, data centers and cloud efforts to manage them at the enterprise level,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement Monday.To advance their agenda, the tech allies have been strategizing by email and phone. They've courted trade and mainstream media and lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House, Bloomberg has reported.The competitive cloud coalition has notched some wins. The House committee in charge of federal spending approved a Defense Department funding bill this month. It would halt funding for the contract until the Pentagon submits a strategy to sustain competition and use multiple cloud-service providers.It is the third attempt by lawmakers to influence the process. The full House is scheduled to take up the spending measure this week.

The bank set the rate, which links the yuan to the dollar, at 6.4586. The surprise move halted the yuan's steep, two-day slide. It also eased global concerns that China might devalue the yuan and allow its stock markets to suffer the consequences in response to the country's trade standoff with the U.S.China's stock markets responded by kicking up out of mixed trade to a solid finish.

That lifted the total value of 50% cash/50% stock deal to $71.8 billion. Fox agreed to the deal, which would give Fox shareholders 19% of Disney ownership following the transaction.  Fox shares ended Tuesday 15% above a flat base buy point at 38.66. Disney shares were up 0.7% in early action. The stock is mired in a 13-month consolidation.Comcast (CMSA), who's earlier bid was topped by Disney's new offer, rose 0.7% in early trade.Winnebago hitched up an 10% opening gain, after reporting above-forecast earnings and revenue for its fiscal third quarter.

Winnebago shares remained below their 40-week moving average, aiming to start up the right side of a six-month consolidation.FedEx (FDX) slipped 2.2% after its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Oracle dropped 4.1% after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results.Netflix powered up 1.4% at the start of trade.

9,ORCL,"With Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google dominating the cloud-computing platform battle, those companies will seek to strengthen their respective positions through alliances with other major tech firms next year, market researcher IDC predicts.""I think we'll see those top three make some very interesting alliances and maybe even some acquisitions,"" IDC Chief Analyst Frank Gens told Investor's Business Daily, adding that ""2018 will be a really interesting year.""Gens says he looks forward to seeing how companies like IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) position themselves as the trio of major cloud players scale up, he said.Using the ""cloud,"" or employing third-party digital services via the internet, is the next major computing platform in the wake of the client-server age. And the major cloud infrastructure providers have amassed computing resources and Big Data capabilities that other companies can't match, Gens said.Competition among those big three will create opportunities for other major tech companies to extract favorable terms for cloud resources, Gens said. The deal-making likely will lead to partnerships where one cloud firm is named a preferred provider, such as the arrangement Adobe Systems (ADBE) has with Microsoft.Gens likened next year's expected cloud market activity to a game of musical chairs.""By the end of 2018, everyone will have found their seat in this new marketplace,"" he said. ""It feels like the entire industry is realigning around the fact that those three companies want to beat each other so badly.""IBD'S TAKE: The FANG group of closely watched internet stocks is made up of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. For the latest news on the group, visit IBD's page on FANG stocks.One of the driving factors behind the realignment is that cloud-computing infrastructure providers are becoming platforms for artificial intelligence as a service, Gens said.On Tuesday, IDC released its annual predictions for the year ahead and beyond for information technology.IDC predicts that an ""AI war"" is looming as the major public cloud service providers offer an ever-expanding variety of AI-powered services.The research group forecast that 40% of enterprise digital transformation initiatives will use artificial-intelligence services by 2019.IDC also predicted that enterprise spending on cloud services and infrastructure will be more than $530 billion by 2021 and in excess of 90% of enterprises will use multiple cloud services and platforms.RELATED:Microsoft Talks Up Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, Quantum ComputingOracle's Cloud-Computing Guidance Raises Concerns About GrowthWhy Cisco Is Good Fit For Google's Push In Cloud Computing

Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) are among tech companies with the most cash overseas.The budget's passage could keep Republicans on track to approve a tax package late this year or early in 2018.

11,ORCL,"Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) gets most of its revenue from selling processors for video game consoles and gaming PCs, but it has huge opportunities in data centers, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence applications, investment bank Needham said Friday.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised his price target on Nvidia stock to 250 from 200 and reiterated his buy rating.Nvidia shares rose 1.9% to 194.59 on the stock market today.

The cartel will increase the official production target by 1 million barrels per day. The actual boost will likely be around 600,000 bpd as some members like Venezuela are unable to ramp up. Oil prices and stocks, which had trended lower ahead of the meeting, rebounded Friday. Crude futures rose more than 5% for the week to $68.58 a barrel, with the most of the gains coming Friday. OPEC and Russia agreed in late 2016 to cut production by 1.8 million bpd.Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit will take a 1% stake in JD.com (JD), China's No. 2 e-commerce company behind Alibaba (BABA).

The stock tumbled to a 15-month low.Challenging a late 2017 Disney deal for 21st Century Fox's entertainment and studio assets, Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash bid. But Disney followed with a $38-a-share offer of $71 billion in cash and stock, up from an all-stock bid of $28 a share. Comcast is expected to counter again. Separately, Comcast and Fox are in the midst of a bidding war for European broadcaster Sky. Fox stock soared.Shares of Darden Restaurants (DRI) shot up 15% on Thursday, blowing by a 100.21 buy point.

Martin Tripp , who worked at the Nevada Gigafactory as a process technician, claims he is a whistleblower. The discovery of what CEO Elon Musk described as a saboteur comes as Tesla is trying hard to meet the oft-delayed production goal of 5,000 Model 3s a week in the third quarter. Tesla stock hit a nine-month high Monday but reversed to lose 6.85% for the week.

That should provide a GDP boost near term. But existing-home sales unexpectedly slipped 0.4% in May, and 3% from a year ago amid tight supply and higher mortgage rates. Rising mortgage rates have hit affordability and seem to have slowed the increase in home prices. The FHFA house price index edged up just 0.1% in April and 6.4% from a year ago, slowing from 7.4% earlier this year. A Housing Market Index dipped in June, but still shows builders are upbeat.PayPal Holdings (PYPL) agreed to buy Hyperwallet Systems for $400 million, expanding its global payments platform.

27,ORCL,"The breadth of industries that feature stocks hitting new highs continues to be wide. On Tuesday, Salesforce.com (CRM), Five Below (FIVE) and Dillard's (DDS) are giving investors opportunities to add new positions to their portfolios.Salesforce, a June 2004 IPO, is up more than 2% for the week as shares continue to drive past a 128.97 buy point in a seven-week cup pattern.The 5% buy zone extends up to 135.42. Thus, the stock remains in the permissible buy range.Notice on a daily chart how the RS line, painted in blue, continues to pump into new high ground. Good. It confirms that the enterprise software play is beating the S&P 500. Since its February 2017 breakout from a first-stage base at 80.47, Salesforce has rallied more than 65%.The San Francisco-based firm has emerged as a real force of change within its field. CEO Marc Benioff, who left Oracle (ORCL) to start Salesforce, pushed for a new business model in which customers could download customer relationship management (CRM) software straight from the internet onto their computers — with no stacks of CDs to upload into their desktops. Salesforce sought to make its products affordable and easy to use.Today, the company has excelled in going beyond the CRM space and into service, marketing, data analytics, collaboration and AI. It continues to win multiple large contracts.In its April-ended first quarter, Salesforce achieved another milestone. Revenue grew 25% to $3.01 billion, marking the first time it logged $3 billion in quarterly sales. Salesforce had a total $3.05 billion in revenue for the entire fiscal year ended in January 2013.On a quarterly basis, revenue has grown 25%, 27%, 25%, 25%, 27%, 25%, 27%, 26%, 25% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past 10 periods.Five Below has cleared a 78.38 entry in a six-week flat base. The Philadelphia-based retail innovator, popular among kids who can spend their allowances on items priced at $5 or less, reports fiscal Q1 results after the close on Wednesday.The Street sees earnings up 120% to 33 cents a share on a 25% rise in sales to $291.4 million. That would mark the biggest year-over-year profit increase since a 175% leap in the quarter ended July 2013.Five Below joined IBD Leaderboard as an earnings-related call option play on Wednesday.Dillard's rose more than 5% and reached as high as 93.58 intraday. At that price, shares stood more than 5% past the 88.61 buy point in a 12-week cup. Disciplined buying means grabbing shares when they are no more than 5% past the proper entry.While on a daily chart Dillard's may have showed handle-type action from May 21 to June 1, such a handle is invisible on the weekly chart. Treat that shakeout period as more attempts by the stock to build the right side of the cup.Dillard's has posted big earnings growth in the past two quarters (up 52% to $2.82 a share and up 36% to $2.89 on an adjusted basis) as the Little Rock, Ark., company ended a nine-quarter drought in sales growth with top-line gains of 6% in fiscal Q4 and 3% in Q1. The Street sees sales inching up 1% to $1.47 billion in the July-ending second quarter.Dillard's joins Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) as new emerging leaders within the retail sector. All three belong to IBD's Retail-Department Store industry group, which as of Monday's close ranked No. 23 among 197 industry groups in six-month price performance.RELATED:Why iQiyi Hit A New High And Triggered A Sell Signal, But Not As A Climax Run The Latest Inside Investor's CornerWhy Even In a Bull Market, The 5% Rule Matters For Stock Investors

28,ORCL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 fell significantly Thursday morning after the major averages reversed lower Wednesday following the Fed rate hike. Investors overnight were still digesting the Fed's outlook for the economy, inflation and rates, girding themselves for President Trump's big China tariffs and resuming the selling in Facebook (FB) after CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally said he's ""sorry"" for the Cambridge Analytica furor that has rocked the company this week.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.5% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures lost 0.55% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 lost 0.9%.The Fed on Wednesday stuck to its plan for 3 rate hikes in 2018, but upgraded its economic forecasts and upped its prediction for 2019 rate increases. Meanwhile, Trump is likely to impose at least $30 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports for China's handling of U.S. intellectual property.And then there's Facebook, which offers a broader lesson for investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOver the past week or so, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and China Lodging Group (HTHT) sold off sharply after setting up in bases with proper buy points. These are great examples of why investors should wait for a proper breakout and resist the temptation to buy shares early.Oracle, Tencent and China Lodging all sold off recently on earnings reports, always a high risk/high reward situation.Facebook tumbled this week on news that a third party had data on 50 million users, with Facebook's long-term policies and its short-term response coming under fire. Alphabet retreated along with Facebook, as investors worried about the potential fallout on U.S. consumer internet giants from consumers, advertisers and regulators.Facebook and Alphabet had just finished cup-with-handle bases last Friday, when the Cambridge Analytica reports hit that evening and over the weekend. Facebook fell 9% over Monday-Tuesday, crashing through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages before rising slightly Wednesday. But shares were down 2% early Thursday, following Zuckerberg's Wednesday night interview with CNN in which he expressed his regret for the breach of trust.Alphabet has retreated 3.5% through Wednesday, below its 50-day line.Oracle topped a 53.24 last week, but never closed above that level. Shares were still close when Oracle reported better-than-expected earnings Monday night. But investors focused on weaker-than-expected cloud revenue growth, which slowed from the prior quarter, and guidance for continued deceleration in cloud revenue gains. Oracle plunged 9.4% on Tuesday.The Chinese internet giant topped earnings estimates early Thursday, but revenue growth came in a little light. Tencent, which had been 3% off a cup base buy point, sold off 3%. Tencent did hold above its 50-day line and the messaging and gaming titan could soon form a handle, creating a lower buy point. But buying now would simply recreate the same potential risk.China Lodging was working on a late-stage cup-with-handle base last week. Shares closed March 14 below the 50-day line, which was not a great sign. Then China Lodging came up short with its earnings report, sending the stock tumbling 10% the next session.Watching a top-rated stock move up in a base, waiting for it to clear a proper buy point can make investors restless. You might think to yourself that you can save a percentage point or two by buying a stock just below a buy point. But that's literally penny wise, pound foolish. If a stock is going to blast out of a base and run up sharply, the fractional additional gain won't matter. But if the stock falls back, you're can be stuck with a loss.A breakout maximizes your chances of winning, winning now and winning big. With the stock at or near a new high, essentially every investor is happy. No one is desperate to sell. To add shares, mutual funds have to bid up the price.Conversely, if you buy just below a buy point, that's when weak holders are deciding whether or not to bow out. Weak holders may have bought the stock at the prior high. After holding on and finally seeing a stock get back to break-even, they may start to sell. That's a reason why handles will often form in stocks before breaking out, and those modest pullbacks also encourage further selling.Ideally, selling is modest, and the stock can then power ahead. But sometimes a stock near a breakout and then pull back significantly over the short- or long-term.Obviously, bad news, whether stock-specific, industrywide and the broader market, can strike at any time. But with a breakout, if the stock performs poorly, there are clear technical signals. If a stock has run up some, you'll have a cushion so you can weather the sell-off or take profits, usually avoiding a loss.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: 4 Reasons Why The Market Reversal Wasn't So BadSee Which Stocks Just Got Added To – Or Cut From – IBD's Top Stock Lists Fed Rate Hike Is No Surprise, But Stock Market Weakens On Powell, 2019 Outlook

29,ORCL,"Stocks remained dull in afternoon trading, as weakness in Oracle (ORCL) and Facebook (FB) hurt the Nasdaq while the Dow showed a decent increase.The Nasdaq was up a fraction. The composite touched its 50-day moving average in Monday's market rout and bounced off that key level. Continued gains above the line would be a good sign as the market tries to shake off weakness.Oracle plunged 10% after the database giant said the transition to cloud applications is going slow. Also, Facebook continued to sink deeper below its 50-day moving average and has hit its lowest price since Sept. 25. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated rules on privacy following news that user data made its way to a Trump campaign analysis firm.The Dow led with a 0.4% gain thanks to a half-dozen components that rose about 1%. Those included Boeing (BA), which is the highest-priced Dow member and has a larger influence on the price-weighted index. Boeing accounted for more than 37 of the Dow's 88-point gain in today's market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOf the other Dow components, one to watch is Visa (V). The payment card company is forming a cup-with-handle base and is quite near the 125.40 buy point.The S&P 500 was up a fraction also, thanks in part to an energy sector that was leading the market. Crude prices rose $1.37 to $63.43, touching a three-week high Tuesday. Exploration & production industry groups plus refining, drilling and oilfield services were in the top 15 of 197 groups.But the pipeline group continued to plummet. The industry lost an important tax allowance last week when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission made a tax ruling on pipelines held by limited master partnerships, Wells Fargo Investment Institute noted in a research report. The decision is expected to be appealed. The group topped well before then, in late January.Even while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were sluggish, leading stocks were performing generally well.The IBD 50 climbed 1.3% as nearly all members of the list rose. HealthEquity (HQY) surged 11% to a new high after the health-savings-account administrator beat profit expectations.  It was the biggest winner in the IBD 50.Several Chinese stocks were up in heavy trading, despite word that the U.S. plans new tariffs on a range of Chinese imports. But the stocks rising were internet and other types of companies that are not in manufacturing.Those included Weibo (WB), which is rising from a pullback to the 50-day moving average; 58.com (WUBA), which is forming the right side of a base; and YY Inc.

If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also understand that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one.Earnings growth increased last quarter from 13% to 15%.

42,ORCL,"In the cup with handle or double bottom, success of the breakout depends on the way a stock rises and falls within the base.A third pattern shows that a stock can choose to take neither path before its big move north.Rather than go on an uptrend or downtrend, the stock moves sideways for weeks or months. This action — or lack of it — becomes what's called the flat base.This pattern often forms after a stock breaks out of a cup or other base, gains ground for a few weeks, then stalls. Why? The market might not be ready to rally strongly, or is still weak.A flat base reflects unusual strength. Instead of bending lower, it holds steady in price. This action tells you the stock wants to run higher.When the market finally begins to rally, the stock explodes out of its crouch position.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA flat base must be at least five weeks in length. It can last much longer than that. Within the base, the percentage decline from the stock's high to low usually ranges within 10% to 15%. When the stock drops within the base, institutional investors step in to shore up the stock. The stock doesn't fall much more because investors overall feel comfortable with the stock's current price.When should you buy? Wait until the stock rises 10 cents above the highest price in the flat base. Sometimes the price high is found on the left end of the base. In other cases, the high is in the middle of the base or on the right. Just add 10 cents to that price to find the pivot. Buy it as close as possible to that price point. Don't chase it if it's already more than 5% above the pivot.Oracle (ORCL), the database and e-commerce software giant, muscled out of a seven-month cup with handle on Sept. 3, 1999 (1). In five sessions, the stock rose 18% and hit new highs. A fine start.The market suffered choppy action. From Sept. 13 the Nasdaq tumbled 7% over the next two weeks, yet held up above its 50-day moving average. Two weeks later, it strode to a new high. But the next two weeks saw the Nasdaq fall 10%, and briefly below the 50-day.Oracle dug in its heels. Growth stocks tend to fall 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the correction in the major indexes. Not Oracle. The stock held up above 40 during most of its seven-week flat base (2). On an intraday basis, it was no more than 15% below its high.The high on the left side of the flat base was 46.94. Add a dime to get the buy point. Oracle briefly poked above the flat base's 47.04 buy point during the week ended Oct. 15, 1999, but stumbled. A week later, Oracle dropped more than 8% below the prime entry, ushering the golden rule of investing. Some breakouts turn out to be fakeouts.However, one day after the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day on Oct. 28, Oracle broke out for real. It rallied on heavy volume for seven straight sessions (3). A follow-though is a critical signal that the market has possibly bottomed and is ready for a significant turn higher.At the time, Oracle scored an excellent 95 Earnings Per Share Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and an A for SMR (Sales + Margins + Return on equity). The stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in every IBD daily and weekly chart, shoved into new high ground. The enterprise software group was ranked third among 197 groups.Oracle gained 273% through its March 2000 peak.Here are three more good flat bases that formed in 2016 and 2017 and yielded strong breakouts:Align Technology (ALGN), breakout on Feb. 21, 2017: The nine-week flat base began on Dec. 19, 2016, when the invisible braces marketer peaked at 102.10. Total decline within the base: 13%. Heavy volume was largely absent as Align cleared the 102.20 buy point, yet check out the strong gain on Feb. 1 following quarterly results.Align gapped up 6% and turnover boomed 272% above average. That was a clear sign of strong institutional buying.You can see historical charts of Align and all other U.S. stocks by going to MarketSmith, IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.Control4 (CTRL), breakout on July 12, 2017: Volume powered 305% above the 50-day moving average on breakout day. In small-cap stocks, volume often rockets double or triple average levels. Total decline within the base: 13.5%.Notice on a weekly chart how as the base formed, the 10-week moving average contained the stock's move.The 10-week line is drawn in red on both an IBD chart and in MarketSmith.Arista Networks (ANET), breakouts on Nov. 14, 2016, and on Feb. 17, 2017: In the first flat base, Arista took the minimum five weeks to complete the base, which sat on top of a much larger first-stage construction. The proper buy point was 87.72. Total decline within the base: 10%.In the second flat base, Arista vaulted out of the base in a breakaway gap past 103.10. On Feb. 17, the data center networking play opened at 111, 7.7% above the proper buy point. Given the huge opening move and strong fundamentals, it would have been perfectly acceptable to buy right at the open. Arista finished the session at 119.06.

Volume was tracking well-above average.Meanwhile, Square (SQ) gave up 0.6% after Thursday's strong breakout above a 28.07 cup-shaped base entry.

47,ORCL,"Stocks launched in a tight, flat mix Friday as weaker-than-forecast August retail sales and industrial production, a possible U.K. terror attack and a North Korean missile test kept investors in a cautious mood.The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%, pressing to another new high as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Verizon (VZ) and Caterpillar (CAT) showed strength in opening trade. The S&P 500 futures turned narrowly positive, while the Nasdaq Composite trimmed its thin, early gains as Apple (AAPL) and three of four FANG stocks stuck close to their starting levels in early trade.Global markets paused, but showed little response to a missile fired out of North Korea and over Japan early Friday. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 recovered to a 0.5% advance on Friday, leaving it up 3.3% for the week and marking its first weekly close above its 50-day moving average since July.

The FTSE 100 in London dropped 1.2% — taking an early fall after Britain's pound leaped to its highest level vs. the dollar since the U.K.'s June 2016 Brexit vote, then coming under additional pressure after a bomb exploded on a London subway, reportedly injuring 22 people in what police there were treating as a terrorist attack. For the week, the DAX and CAC-40 are tracking toward gains of around 2%, while the FTSE 100 is down more than 2%.Caterpillar rose 0.8% to take an early lead among the Dow Jones industrials. The stock is rattling off new highs, and extended after a July rebound from 10-week support.Boeing (BA) climbed 0.8%, clearing a flat base buy point at 246.59.Apple gained 0.3%, preparing to cap its seventh week of trade since edging above a 156.75 buy point. The tight, incremental gains are technically positive, but fundamentally maddening for investors who bought in as the stock cleared the entry point. Apple has now given up ground in six of the past seven sessions, despite this week's launch of the iPhone X and a passel of device updates, and is potentially heading for a test of support at its 50-day moving average.Nvidia (NVDA) rose 2.5% in powerful volume to lead the IBD 50 list. The gain put the chip developer at a new high, and just above a 174.66 buy point in a flat base.Oracle (ORCL) dropped 5.9%, the worst early hit among S&P 500 stocks. Better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results reported after Thursday's close weren't enough to encourage investors, who focused on second-quarter guidance below consensus targets. The loss sent shares back below a 51.95 buy point as well as the stock's 50-day moving average, triggering a sell signal.Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar (FSLR) grabbed an early 5% gain to lead the S&P 500. The company is still projected to see two years of profit declines, but shares are up 90% from an April low and looking for volume on a rebound from 10-week support. The heavy-volume leap lifted the stock above a 50.31 buy point in a six-week flat base.In economic news, retail sales took an unexpected dip in August, down 0.2%, according to the Commerce Department. That reversed July's 0.3% increase and disappointed consensus views for a 0.1% gain. Minus autos and gas, sales dipped 0.1%, vs. July's 0.5% gain and estimates for a 0.3% increase.Manufacturing activity in the New York region slowed less than expected in September, putting the New York Federal Reserve's September Empire State Manufacturing Survey at 24.4 for the month. That was just below August's 25.2 reading, but better than the drop to 19 forecast by economists.Industrial output slipped 0.9% in August, the Federal Reserve reported, down from a 0.4% gain in July and missing economists targets for a slowdown to growth of 0.1%. Capacity utilization decreased to 76.1%, also below estimates for a steady-as-she-goes reading of 76.7%.Commerce Department business inventories estimates for July and the University of Michigan's preliminary reading on September consumer sentiment come out at 10 a.m. ET.At 1 p.m., Baker Hughes (BHGE) delivers its weekly report of oil and gas drilling rig activity.

48,ORCL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Friday morning despite weak guidance from Oracle (ORCL) and a new North Korean missile launch. That follows a mixed Thursday session for the major averages, but leading stocks were more upbeat: Tesla (TSLA) and Square (SQ) broke out. Boeing (BA) closed just below a buy point, offsetting another dip by fellow Dow titan Apple (AAPL), which is still in buy range.XS&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.1% vs. fair value.

The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting after recently approving a slight increase in sanctions vs. North Korea.Kim Jung-un, the latest ruler in the Kim dynasty, has stepped up the country's weapons tests in recent months.Meanwhile, Oracle reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue, with growth continuing to gradually accelerate on the top and bottom lines as its cloud business booms. But the software giant's guidance was weaker than expected.Oracle fell 3.6% to 50.90 in late trading on the stock market today, though it found support near its 50-day moving average around the 50 level. That would suggest a drop below a 51.95 flat-base buy point cleared on Monday.During the regular session, the S&P 500 index fell 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite slid 0.5%. But the Dow rose 0.2%, hitting yet another all-time high.Leading the way for the Dow was Boeing, rising 1.4% to 245.23. That's less than 1% below a 246.59 flat-base entry.Boeing has been the top-performing Dow stock in 2017, easily outperforming Apple. Boeing rose a fraction in late trade as concerns about North Korea could spark demand for defense and aerospace stocks.Apple dipped 0.9% to 158.28, its third straight modest decline since unveiling its next-generation iPhones, with the top-of-the-line iPhone X not available until Nov. 3. Apple remains in a buy range from a 165.75 entry.Tesla jumped 3.1% to 377.64, clearing a 377.10 cup-with-handle buy point. Tesla has surged nearly 10% so far this week.

Elon Musk late Wednesday teased the likely unveiling of a semi truck next month.Meanwhile, payment processor Square jumped 4.2% to 28.64 on Thursday, clearing a 28.07 buy point from a cup base.Tesla and Square both show the importance of industry trends. Ferrari (RACE), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and General Motors (GM) are all rallying, extended from their own buy points.

50,ORCL,"Major indexes traded mixed in late afternoon trading Thursday, but remained in good shape overall.XMeanwhile, Square (SQ) showed a solid breakout from a second-stage base with a 28.07 entry. The electronic payments facilitator rose more than 4% to 28.77 and is still in buy range.As noted in IBD's premium stock-picking service, Leaderboard, the stock is in buy range. Don't buy shares more than 5% past the proper entry, or in this case 29.47.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was off nearly 0.5% but remains up for the week with a 1.1% weekly gain. Plus, the Nasdaq's intraday range is narrow, suggesting that large players in the market — from mutual funds and hedge funds to banks, insurers and pension managers — are reluctant to sell with vigor.The S&P 500 was off just 0.1% and is within arm's length of its recent new all-time high of 2498. The S&P SmallCap 600 was down nearly 0.2%.Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups are up 1% or more; they include the solar, automaker, water utility, hospital, leisure product and semiconductor equipment names. Applied Materials (AMAT) is leading the chip gear names with a 2% gain to 47.19 in slightly above-average turnover.Watch for a potential breakout by the tech giant past a 47.96 base entry. Aggressive traders could act if the stock breaches the 47.59 near-term high.There doesn't seem to be too much hoopla about the possibility of the S&P 500 breaking the 2500 barrier. In fact, as seen in IBD's Psychological Market Indicators section, bullishness among stock newsletter editors tracked by Investors Intelligence has actually fallen to 47.1%, the lowest since the aftermath of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio recently notched a high of 1.18 on Aug. 17, meaning that among options traders, pessimism is still rampant. And that's good for equities. Why? Pessimistic investors have generally sold stocks and raised cash, thinking that equities are due to fall. But if they don't, these pessimists could potentially become new buyers of stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.2% as four of the 30 components, including United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), rose 1 point or more.United Tech is trying to reclaim its key long-term support level, the 200-day moving average, which is near 116. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is now trending lower. The manufacturer of aircraft engines, elevators and security systems triggered a sell signal for short-term investors when shares pierced the 50-day moving average near 122 during a high-volume sell-off on July 25.On that day, United Tech reported a 2% jump in Q2 profit to $1.85 a share. Earnings growth has been stuck in the low- to mid-single digits for four straight quarters, unlike the bigger EPS increases seen among members of IBD Big Cap 20, IBD's screen for premier growth companies with a market value of $15 billion or more.Like Apple (AAPL) in earlier years, when Steve Jobs reassumed the CEO post, then spurred a series of game-changing consumer electronic devices and digital services, San Francisco-based Square has made a big hit with its easy-to-use hardware and software for small shops and individual sole proprietors (think plumbers, taxi drivers and the like) to enable fast, secure transactions at the point of sale.IBD's TAKE: Notice how, on a daily chart, Square is showing two bullish traits. First, the stock found buyers near the 50-day moving average (painted in red on an IBD daily chart), a common occurrence among stocks that get strong institutional support. Second, the relative strength line, drawn in blue in both IBD charts and in IBD's professional-grade stock screening and charting service MarketSmith, has rocketed into new high ground. This means that Square is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.Square lost money from 2012 to 2015, but last year it notched earnings of 4 cents a share. Wall Street now expects profit to catapult 500% higher this year to 24 cents a share and another 79% to 43 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 35% to $1.71 billion in 2016, up from $203 million in 2012. The Street sees the top line sliding 45% to $942 million this year, but then rebounding 25% to $1.17 billion in 2018.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Square gets a commanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the stock's fundamental, technical and fund sponsorship attributes place it in the top 2% of all companies in IBD's database.As noted in IBD Leaderboard, the current new base is second stage.Apple shares, meanwhile, continue to hold on to a thin gain following an Aug. 2 breakout from a second-stage flat base at 156.75. The stock was featured heavily in IBD's Stock Market Today column back in early January when the iPhone giant broke out of a first-stage bottoming base at 118.12. Shares have since climbed more than 39%.Apple is expected to post a third quarter in a row of double-digit EPS growth, up 13% to $1.88 a share in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter.Apple's earnings rose 2% in the fiscal first quarter ended in December 2016, snapping a three-quarter streak of falling profits, then grew 11% and 18% in the next two quarters.In FY 2018, earnings are accelerating 21% to $10.91 a share, up from an 8% jump in the current fiscal year.Elsewhere, Oracle (ORCL) is hanging tight ahead of its fiscal first-quarter results due after the close. The stock, nearly flat at 52.74, holds a 12% cushion of gains after it gapped up powerfully on June 22 on improved Q4 results. That move sent shares past a 47.09 entry in a solid flat-base pattern.The database and cloud-based enterprise software giant is mimicking Apple's latest trend of slowly reaccelerating its growth. In the November-ended fiscal second quarter, Oracle's earnings slumped 3%, but then rebounded 8% and 10% in the past two quarters. Analysts see Q1 profit rising 9% to 60 cents a share on a 5% increase in revenue to $9.03 billion.In fiscal Q4, Oracle's net margin improved by 220 basis points to 34.5%.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures surged nearly 2% and reached as high as $50.50 a barrel intraday, while natural gas futures eclipsed the $3/million BTU level and hit its highest levels since May of last year. Futures got as high as $3.10.The sell-off in U.S. government bonds remained in place; the yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year bond returned to the 2.20% level.The spread between the 3-month note (1.05% yield) and the 10-year bond remains healthy at 115 basis points.RELATED:When To Sell A Stock: Take Many Gains When The Profit Reaches This LevelHow To Invest: How To See If It's The Right Time To Buy StocksInvesting For Kids: How To Make A Million Dollars

59,ORCL,"If the Trump administration pushes through a tax reform package in 2018 that includes relief on foreign profits brought into the U.S., Goldman Sachs has a new way to look at the biggest potential gainers.Proposed changes on ""repatriated"" overseas cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Oracle (ORCL). Many Wall Street analysts have speculated that cash brought back into the U.S. could be used for stock buybacks or acquisitions.Goldman Sachs in a report focuses on stocks with the highest overseas cash-to-equity cap ratio. The top seven companies, Goldman Sachs says, would be Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Qualcomm (QCOM), Apple, Amgen (AMGN), Oracle and Microsoft.A bit further down would be Western Digital (WDC), Citrix Systems (CTXS), General Electric (GE) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).Goldman Sachs forecasts that U.S. firms would repatriate $250 billion of their overseas cash in 2018, if a tax reform package is approved.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8.

64,ORCL,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

67,ORCL,"Stocks punched higher at Monday's open, launching a spirited rebound from what was the Dow's worst week in eight years.X The Dow Jones industrial average opened up 1.1%, with the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 ahead 0.9% each.The market last week slipped into a technical correction, down more than 10% from recent highs, as the Dow booked its worst weekly loss since February 2009. The S&P 500's drop was its largest since May 2010.  The last time the Nasdaq took this large a loss was at the end of January 2016.On global markets, China's markets were mixed as they prepared to head into their weeklong Lunar New Year holiday later this week. The Shanghai Composite jumped 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.2%. In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for a national holiday.In Europe, stocks hammered out considerable gains in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX led with a 1.4% advance.A quiet day of economic news and a slow start to the week's earnings calendar leaves Monday's unveiling of President Trump's infrastructure in sharp focus. Trump has previously said he aims to leverage $200 billion in federal funds into a $1.5 trillion building program.Infrastructure stocks likely to move on the news could include a wide array of construction names and materials suppliers. Among the most pure-play infrastructure stocks are the big engineering names such as Jacobs Engineering (JEC), Mastec (MTZ) and Quanta Services (PWR), as well as aggregates suppliers including Martin Marietta (MLM), Vulcan (VMC) and Summit Materials (SUM).Oil and commodities could also factor into Monday's trade. Crude posted an early rebound, as U.S. benchmark oil jumped 1.2% to trade just below the $60 per barrel mark. Silver and copper both rose more than 1% in early action.IBD'S TAKE: A correcting market is not a time to buy growth stocks, but it is the perfect time to build a watch list of leading stocks, near buy points in valid bases. The market will eventually post a follow-through day and launch a fresh uptrend. When it does, you want to have your shopping list of well-vetted stocks ready to go.Nearly all 30 Dow components rose at the start of trade. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led, up 3%. The company received a price target increase to 46, from 33, and an upgrade to buy from neutral, from Instinet. RBC Capital raised the stock's price target to 44, from 40.American Express (AXP) advanced 1.7% after an upgrade to buy, from neutral, by Nomura.Earnings news stirred some action early Monday, as payment solutions provider First Data (FDC) bolted 4.7% higher after its fourth-quarter earnings met analysts' views, and revenue was slightly higher than expected. The stock took an 8% loss last week and broke support, killing a three-month basing effort.Restaurant Brands International (QSR) popped 6.9% following mixed fourth-quarter results. The owner of the Burger King and Tim Horton's chains as well as Popeye's, the company's smallest chain, reported a surprise 11% gain in revenue, and the company announced a $742 million deferred tax benefit.China-based Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) jumped 2.9% before the open, and ahead of its fourth-quarter report which is due after the close. The online retail leader has pulled back 13% from its Jan. 26 high, leaving its Relative Strength line a notch off its high.Other China-based names were also positive, with Weibo (WB), TAL Education (TAL) and Sina (SINA) all posted early gains near 2%. Sina and Weibo report earnings this week.Apple (AAPL) pounded out a 1.4% advance and Netflix (NFLX) led the FANG stock tech leaders with a 2.3% gain.Computer tech services contractor CSRA (CSRA) spiked 31% after General Dynamics (GD) agreed to buy the Falls Church, Va., company in a $6.8 billion deal.  The deal allows General Dynamics to better tap a pending surge in federal upgrade of IT security and cloud-computing operations. General Dynamics was down 1%, and just below a 211.85 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.21st Century Fox (FOX) climbed 2.9% following news reports that Comcast (CMCSA) was contemplating a refreshed bid for the company's film and television assets. Fox accepted a $52.4 billion takeover bid from Walt Disney (DIS) in December, after rejecting Comcast's offer of more than $60 billion, on grounds that regulators would block the combination. Comcast shares rose 1.1%.Disney shares rose 1.5% after the company announced it was raising the admission price to its Disney World and Disneyland theme parks.

68,ORCL,"The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials are all near record highs. So where are the big winners?XApple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) sold off last week to drop below recent buy points, with Apple undercutting its 50-day moving average as well. Nvidia (NVDA) got off to a strong start, but has pared much of its gains. Meanwhile, many ""breakouts"" are like Alibaba (BABA), creeping into buy zones but just stalling or pulling back. All of that suggests that the risk-reward for investors isn't great.Using pattern recognition via IBD's Marketsmith, as of Friday there were 75 recent breakouts of stocks trading at least $15 million worth of shares a day, with current Composite Ratings of 90 or better. That doesn't include every breakout: Apple's Composite Rating was above 90 until its recent sell-off. Tesla now has a 77 CR, though that's in part due to a lack of profits. Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have decent but not great fundamental and technical readings.

There are several auto parts firms in the mix. A few chip gear makers are the only tech representatives.Meanwhile, dozens are like Alibaba, SAP (SAP), Square (SQ), Amgen (AMGN) — nudging out to buy zones, stalling out and sometimes briefly undercutting their entry areas. Alibaba and Square fell in Monday morning trading to below its ascending base buy point.Some of these breakouts have come in light or lackluster volume, suggesting a lack of institutional support. Unless you bought right at or just above buy point, there's good chance you're down.Boeing (BA) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN) are Sept. 15 breakouts that have advanced to near the high end of their 5% buy zones. Maybe Boeing and TI are on their way to be big gains.On the other hand, some stocks such as Nvidia and Universal Display (OLED), have made big initial moves but then pulled back.Nvidia broke out on Sept. 15. In the next session, the graphics and AI chipmaker rose as high as 9.5% above the buy point. But shares have fallen for the past four days, and are now just 2.5% over the entry.Universal Display, a maker of parts and tech for OLED screens as those next-generation displays are being used in high-end TVs, Samsung handsets and the upcoming Apple iPhone X, was 13.6% above its double-bottom entry Tuesday intraday. But thanks to three days of selling, Universal Display is now just 3.8% over the buy point. You don't want to see a 10%-plus winner roundtrip to the buy point.Nvidia and Universal Display fell more than 2% shortly in Monday morning trade, with both stocks undercutting their recent buy points.Meanwhile, 17 of the 75 recent breakouts were below their buy points as of Friday. Some are just below their entries. But Proofpoint (PFPT), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks (SWKS) fell so far that those buy points are now invalid.Because of the current 90+ Composite Rating screen, the number of underwater or failed breakouts may be higher. Apple and Tesla are definitely below their buy points but technically not quite failed breakouts, though Apple's above-average volume tumble through its 10-week line gave an additional reason for investors to cut losses. Apple fell 0.8% Monday morning while Tesla rose 0.5%.Oracle (ORCL), with its heavy-volume plunge below its buy point and 50-day line after issuing weak guidance, is a failed breakout.If the market picks up, with even a modest uptrend, you might see stocks that are hovering at or above buy points take off. On the other hand, a market slide, even modest, would likely push many more breakouts underwater.Investors need to recognize the current landscape, despite the market direction being ""confirmed uptrend."" There are stocks that are working, but big winners are scarce. Pay close attention to your portfolio as well as the major averages and leading stocks.RELATED:The Big Picture: Small Caps Up; Apple's Stock TumblesNvidia Stock Shaken On Report Tesla Is Developing Chips With AMDFacebook Stock Is At A Make-Or-Break Moment; Here's WhyThis Defense Giant Just Broke Out; These 2 Rivals Are Near BuysHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

73,ORCL,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group.

Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD.

But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting.

83,ORCL,"Technology stocks fell again on Monday as Republicans met to meld the Senate and House tax reform measures and investors fretted that the tech sector's gains may disappoint vs. those of banks and other industries.While financials have rallied, the technology sector has given back some of its year-to-date gains. One reason tech leaders — including FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — are getting hit is that fund managers are raising cash to buy financials, says BMO Capital Markets.From a macroeconomic perspective, JPMorgan says that higher bond yields are another factor in a market rotation out of growth stocks such as technology and into financials.There's also the nitty-gritty of tax reform. The Senate's version, passed late Friday, would cut the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 20%; limit interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); and lower the tax on repatriated overseas cash to 14% from the current full 35%.It also will allow the immediate expensing of capital spending over the next five years, which was helping telecom and cable companies on Monday. Comcast (CMCSA) surged 4.9% to close at 40.32, AT&T (T) was up 2.1% to finish at 37.27, and Verizon Communications (VZ) gained 0.9% to end the day at 51.72.The trouble for tech companies, though, is that they hold the most cash overseas, and the Senate's proposed 14% tax rate on such earnings is higher than expected. President Trump had proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings, while the House has proposed an 8.5% rate.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among companies with the most overseas cash.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While tech companies may bring back some cash if Congress passes tax reform, the legislation disallows some accounting measures by multinational companies. Another concern for tech companies is what happens with the research-and-development tax credits many companies use.Many biotech, pharma and manufacturing companies benefit from a research-and-development credit under which firms recoup some of the costs for spending on innovation, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is often for the wages of scientists and engineers.The GOP tax plan could hurt the R&D tax credit in lieu of retaining the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision that was initially expected to go by the wayside in the plan. Companies worked over the weekend to change congressional opinion on the tax ahead of the late-hour Senate vote.Amazon was down 2.4% to close at 1,133.95 on the stock market today, Netflix fell 1.5% to finish at 184.04, Facebook slid 2.1 to end at 171.47, and Google dropped 1.3% to 1,011.87. Apple was up a fraction to 169.80.Among stocks in the IBD 50, IPG Photonics (IPGP) plunged by more than 10% to 200.80, Cognex (CGNX) dropped 8.6% to 63.31, and PayPal (PYPL) fell 8.6% to 70.97.

85,ORCL,"Ah, those sociable humans, they're always up to something online — texting, tweeting, messaging, Googling.HubSpot (HUBS) Chief Executive Brian Halligan says he's staying on top of all that, and making it work to his company's advantage.X""We are really watching the way the marketplace and humans are changing, and building products to match that,"" Halligan said on a recent company earnings call.HubSpot is an 11-year-old maker of sales and marketing software based in Cambridge, Mass., and it sells to small- and midsize businesses. Its own pitch is that potential customers — aka those sociable humans — find businesses through digital channels like blogs, internet search engines and social media. HubSpot's expertise lies in attracting people to websites and optimizing content so that visitors are converted into paying customers.Its mantra: Help customers create more personalized interactions with their prospective buyers to close the deal. The strategy has helped HubSpot see its revenue shoot up 38% to $171 million in the first six months of 2017. Shares are up 52% this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2018 revenue growth to slow to 25% from 34% this year. HubSpot could beat those earnings estimates if new initiatives gain traction, says Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen & Co.""Their rate of growth has come down. Marketing tech in general is a tough market to scale. It's fragmented with lots of small vendors. So to come out as a single winner and take a lot of market share has been challenging,"" said Wood, who has a neutral rating on the stock.Further, HubSpot's main challenge is maintaining a sales growth rate that will support its valuation.HubSpot has evolved into a multi-product company — adding sales automation and customer relationship management (CRM) software. Many of HubSpot's customers have 10 to 50 employees, with some in the low hundreds. Analysts say HubSpot targets firms with up to 2,000 employees.The company has focused on the midmarket as opposed to competing head-on for large corporate accounts vs. the likes of Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM), SAP and Adobe Systems (ADBE). That way HubSpot has avoided the cost of investing in its own sales staff to chase down and close deals, says Wood.""What's different about these guys is the focus on midmarket. They have to keep the new-customer growth engine going. They're looking at new ways to acquire customers,"" said Wood. ""Also going into new markets, like they're doing with sales force automation and CRM, is going to drive growth. But I don't think you'll see them go upmarket into (larger) enterprise (firms).""HubSpot's customers mostly engage in business-to-business marketing. They buy online subscriptions to software that ranges from $2,500 to $30,000 annually. The average marketing customer spends about $13,000 a year.HubSpot also has laid claim to what it calls ""Inbound Marketing."" Halligan and co-founder Dharmesh Shah wrote a book on using Google, social media and search-friendly blogs to attract customers via the internet. HubSpot sells tools that track the online activity of website visitors and personalize content as their interests are identified.Halligan says people are spending less time texting, emailing back-and-forth, or searching on Google. Instead, Halligan says, they're using messaging platforms more, including Slack, in the workplace.And, humans consume tons of video. So HubSpot helps its customers evaluate video platforms such as Facebook (FB) Live for marketing purposes.""If you look how people spend their day, they're spending an awful lot of time on social media,"" Halligan said on the earnings call. ""There are big shifts going on, and HubSpot's going to be there to help our customers through it.""HubSpot has used Twitter (TWTR), Facebook and Instagram to build its own follower base. In late September, HubSpot will host its annual ""Inbound"" user conference to rally the troops.Still, there's more to HubSpot's marketing than social media engagement. HubSpot has built up sales channels, such as website design and marketing agencies, that point people toward its products. About 40% of revenue comes from customer-referral channels, says Wood.HubSpot aims to borrow some techniques from Intuit (INTU) and Autodesk (ADSK), which have successfully targeted accountants and architects, as partners. HubSpot aims to partner with sales agencies. HubSpot also works with industry players. HubSpot has growing ties to Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn and its sales tools.IBD'S TAKE: HubSpot has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern with a buy point of 76.20. The stock is hovering near its 50-day moving average. Alarm.com, Realpage, and Appfolio have the highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of companies in IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group.The company also provides help in integrating its software with Salesforce.com's bigger platform. And, HubSpot's tools work with e-commerce payment platforms such as Shopify (SHOP).HubSpot recently rolled out a $50 monthly marketing starter package. New visitors to its website are greeted with offers for free versions of HubSpot products. After using free versions for a while, or ""freemiums,"" the company figures users will upgrade to paid products.""If you roll the clock forward two, three, four years, that's just the way I think humans are going to buy products because they're going to want to try it and use it (first),"" said Halligan on the earnings call. ""This freemium thing is going to be here to stay.""Indeed, HubSpot has added two new board members — one from software firm Atlassian (TEAM) and one from data storage provider Drop — both of which use freemium business models.HubSpot has more than 34,300 customers, up 40% from a year ago, with roughly 27,000 of them buying marketing tools. Average revenue per customer has been falling, however, due to the lower-priced offers.Nate Cunningham, a Guggenheim Securities analyst, says HubSpot has a ""greenfield"" opportunity to target small companies that never bought marketing software. He says HubSpot needs to improve operating margins as it adds customers in new ways.""The No. 1 determinant of HubSpot's growth is probably not competitive displacement, to gain share vs. Salesforce or IBM,"" said Cunningham. ""It's more about how can they get people to try their product who never have had a marketing product before. I think greenfield is where the bulk of the opportunity is.""HubSpot had over 5,000 ""Growth Stack"" customers as of June 30, up from 3,000 at the start of the year. These high-spending customers buy more sales, CRM and marketing software tools. And, they're more likely to renew subscriptions annually as opposed to leaving.Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair, says HubSpot is on the right track.""We believe HubSpot's customer growth is a good indication of the health of the business,"" he said in a note to clients, ""and provides significant up-sell and cross-sell opportunities longer term, which we believe could ultimately lead to an acceleration of the business as soon as next year.""Shares of HubSpot have been in decline while forming a deep handle, but were up 2.2% at Friday's close to 67.35.RELATED:This Education Company Reaps Newfound Disposable Income In ChinaAd Tech Firm Does Bidding For Customers, One At A TimeBiotech Finds Its Stride With Kidney Cancer Treatment

86,ORCL,"Five companies, all in the tech sector, are sitting on nearly a third of all U.S. corporate cash not controlled by financial companies, Moody's Investors Service reported Wednesday.XThe top-five cash holders are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL). Those five held a collective $594 billion, or slightly more than 32% of the total U.S. non-financial corporate cash balance as of the end of 2016, Moody's said. At the end of 2015, those companies held $504 billion, or 30% of the total.Apple accounted for $246 billion, or 13.4% of total corporate cash in 2016, up from $216 billion, or 12.8%, in 2015, Moody's said.""Apple's cash pile is greater than the aggregate cash balance of every industry sector, excluding technology and health care/pharmaceuticals,"" Moody's said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are reaching new 52-week highs this week? Head to IBD Stock Lists for a peek.U.S. non-financial companies rated by Moody's held $1.84 trillion in cash at the end of 2016, up 9.2% from $1.68 trillion at the end of 2015. In its report, cash also includes short-term investments and liquid long-term investments.The technology sector had the largest cash hoard, at $871 billion, or 47% of the total.Overseas cash is estimated at $1.3 trillion, or 70% of total cash, Moody's said.""This amount reflects the negative tax consequences of permanently repatriating money to the U.S. and the use of domestic cash for dividends, share buybacks and the majority of acquisitions,"" Moody's said.

87,ORCL,"Trends in the enterprise software market favor big guns, says Goldman Sachs, and another wave of mergers and acquisitions seems likely with smaller players getting swallowed by the likes of Oracle (ORCL), SAP, Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY) and Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).XGoldman Sachs says companies such as Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Blackline (BL) and Zendesk (ZEN) could be takeover targets, though no deals seem imminent.Software companies with web-based, subscription-as-a-service business models have been market-share gainers against companies that sell one-time licenses.""Our view is that larger (software) suite vendors (SAP, Oracle) and smaller 'best-of-suites' (Salesforce.com, Workday, and Ultimate Software) are best positioned for sustainable growth, due to broadening product portfolios that expand addressable wallet and enable bundling,"" said the Goldman Sachs report. ""When comparing today's best-of-breed vendors (Blackline, Cornerstone OnDemand, and Zendesk) against today's best-of-suite vendors (Salesforce, Ultimate Group, and Workday) and Oracle and SAP, the suite vendors continue to have superior non-GAAP operating margins and free cash flow margins.""""Our view is that the wave of (mergers) is slowly beginning to build, and we would expect to continue to see a healthy dose of best-of-breed vendors consolidated into suites (both legacy software vendors like Oracle and SAP, as well as 'born in the cloud' vendors like Salesforce and Workday),"" the note went on to say.According to Goldman Sachs, a ""suite is a collection of applications built around a core system of record, such as a financial database.""Goldman Sachs raised Salesforce.com's price target to 117 from 110, Workday's to 101 from 96, and Ultimate Software's to 220 from 204.IBD'S TAKE: Salesforce.com and Workday are among enterprise software stocks with solid gains in 2017, but they swooned a bit in mid June amid high valuations and have recently bounced back. Salesforce.com has a technical buy point of 92.09. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.While software makers enjoy revenue growth above 30% and 40%, Goldman Sachs expects billings growth to slow for most. It expects suite vendors like Oracle, SAP and Microsoft (MSFT)  to claw back market share.""To sustain share gains, we believe that best-of-suites like Salesforce.com and Workday will continue to focus on building out their respective suites,"" the report said. ""To a certain extent, we have already seen several rounds of acquisitions of best-of-breed vendors, and our view is that M&A activity will only intensify, especially as growth rates of best-of-breed providers start to decelerate.""RELATED:These 5 Tech Superstars Are Setting Up Near Buy Points

92,ORCL,"February's stock market performance serves as a reminder that volatility can still take a bite out of market leaders like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). After a stunning 2017 in which everything worked, the market entered January with aggressive buying, sending the major indexes to all-time highs.X But February started with a shocking reversal. The market experienced its first correction, defined as a 10% drop, in two years. The S&P 500's 10.2% decline was as swift as it was dramatic. It lasted just nine days, ending Feb. 8. But the damage was done.Despite bouncing back the last three weeks, the benchmark ended the month down 3.89%. It's first monthly loss since March 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.3% in February, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 3.61% according to Lipper Inc. Surprisingly, S&P 500 Index funds beat the index by 18 basis points, down 3.71%, according to Lipper.General domestic taxable bond funds average a loss of 0.8% in February and were down 0.75% year to date.""The past month has been a snapback of the previous month,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds. In January investor sentiment turned aggressive, especially in technology, buying went a little too far too fast, Hackett said. Then at the beginning of February it reversed, partly triggered by the specter of rising interest rates.""It was indiscriminate selling,"" said Hackett. ""Even the names you would think of as safe havens didn't work because people thought of the defensive stocks, like telecom and utilities, as bond proxies and sold them. The fact we had a correction is not the slightest bit unusual and actually a healthy thing. You get a pressure valve release, so things don't get overheated and people don't get too complacent.""David Joy, the chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, said he wasn't surprised the market recovered quickly, ""because there was no change in the fundamental outlook. We think the economy will be quite strong and that we're going to get growth close to 3% this year.""The February bounce back came because of two events from Washington, the spending bill and tax reform, which combined should increase gross domestic product over the next two years by 50 basis points, said Lawrence Kemp, the portfolio manager of the BlackRock Capital Appreciation Fund (MAFGX). The fund was up 6.75% year to date going into Friday vs. the S&P 500's return of 0.49%, according to Morningstar.""That's positive for additional money for the consumer to spend and for corporations to invest and to increase dividends and buy back stock,"" said Kemp. ""It's a very positive tailwind regarding U.S. fundamentals and for very strong earnings growth.""We're overweight in technology,"" said Kemp. ""Financials will benefit from a rising rate environment.""Among the fund's top 10 holdings are five technology stocks, Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline Group) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).His top financial picks are Visa (V) and Bank of America (BAC). He also said he thinks the health care sector and consumer discretionary stocks will do well this year. He likes UnitedHealth (UNH) and Constellation Brands (STZ), a beer and wine company.Hackett and Joy agree that technology and financials are likely to do well. Other technology companies to look at are the ones repatriating income back to the U.S., such as Apple (AAPL), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).As for financials, they say look at the large money center banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  They both also see potential in late-cycle winners like industrials. This would include Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX)) and 3M (MMM).The names that were down because of interest rates have not bounced back nearly as much. Hackett said real estate is down 9% year-to-date, telecom is down 8% utilities are down 7% and consumer staples are down 7%, Names that were defensive and that you would expect to perform well in a volatile period to perform have not and are not viewed as defensive but as interest rates sensitive, and are suffering because of that.""We're also constructive on the international markets,"" said Joy. ""We like equity market in most parts of the world, developed and emerging, as there is a global recovery. There are not too many countries where the economies are not expanding. You still get very accommodative central bank policies in Europe and Japan and cheaper valuations.""""Even with huge upside in the U.S., we think foreign markets are one of the best places to be at this point, with the dollar weakening, the rest of the world lags the U.S. by two or three years,"" said Hackett, who said optimal international equity exposure would be 40%.RELATED:See What Leading Stocks Are Driving This American Century Growth FundNew To Stock Investing?

Total cloud revenue in the quarter rose 64% from the year-ago period to $1.4 billion, Oracle said.

With Monday's gain, Juniper Networks stock neared its 50-day moving average.""The cloud vertical is now 27% of revenues, highlighting Juniper's increased diversification and lesser reliance on the traditional telco vertical,"" Long said in a report. ""The cloud vertical has driven much of Juniper's recent growth and remains a significant growth opportunity as it architects its portfolio to meet cloud customer requirements.""Juniper's cloud-computing growth is coming from customers such as Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), Facebook (FB) and Oracle (ORCL).Long, though, says other parts of Juniper's business are struggling.""We hold no illusions about routing and security, and expectations remain low,"" he said in a report. ""Routing remains challenged by soft telco spending and instances of switching displacing routers based on improving merchant silicon capabilities. Security has been a long-term headwind for Juniper, and the updated product portfolio may be too little too late. That said, given low expectations, any upside represents a call option on the shares.""Juniper reports fiscal Q2 earnings on July 25. Juniper reported March-quarter earnings slightly above expectations.IBD'S TAKE:  While Juniper aims for a rebound, Arista Networks has been taking share from Cisco. Arista Networks is ranked No. 6 on the IBD 50, a roster of fast-growing companies. Look for more top-performing companies at the IBD 50, which also includes Lumentum Holdings and Lam Research.The company has been seeking a turnaround under its new chief executive, Rami Rahim.""Juniper has underperformed year to date, and we believe the shares are ripe for a turnaround as more credit is given to the switching business, customer diversification strategy, strong operating expense management, and balance-sheet flexibility,"" Long said.RELATED:Cisco Lowers Sales, Earnings Forecast But Not As Much As FearedArista Price Target Hiked: Less Cisco Risk, More HPE UpsideIs This Tech Celebrity And Political Honcho Planning An Exit?

95,ORCL,"Tesla (TSLA) got a price target cut Wednesday while Oracle (ORCL) was upgraded on the company's cloud offerings and Novartis (NVS) was downgraded.XTesla's price target was lowered to 180 from 190 at Goldman Sachs, which reiterated a sell rating. That's barely half of Tesla's lofty stock price as of Monday's close.Analyst David Tamberrino sees the electric car maker's  automotive segment falling  in value to 138 from 150 on lower margins but expects the company's energy segment to rise in value.However, Baird analyst Ben Kallo reiterated his outperform rating on Tesla and a price target of 368, saying investors can now ""focus on the Model 3.""Late Sunday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the Model 3 has passed all regulatory inspections, with production starting Friday. The Model 3 will be delivered on July 28 to the first 30 customers.After Monday's close, Tesla reported a smaller-than-expected Q2 deliveries of the Model S and Model X, citing big battery shortages.Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who has a 250 price target on Tesla, said in a Wednesday note that the Q2 deliveries figures ""raised more questions than answers, particularly about Model S and X demand.""Oracle was upgraded to overweight from sector weight at KeyBanc Capital. Analyst Monika Garg kept her 61 price target on the stock.Garg said she expects revenue from Oracle's cloud business to double to $12 billion in the next two years as the process to convert Oracle's current customers to the cloud is still in early innings.She also expects the growth of artificial intelligence to help boost Oracle's cloud offerings.Oracle shares rose 0.2% to 49.46.Oracle shares blasted out of a base to a long-time high on June 22, following stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and booming cloud growth.The upgrade comes as Microsoft (MSFT)  is reportedly going to lay off thousands of employees as it focuses on integrating its cloud service business. The announcement could come as early as Wednesday.Novartis was downgraded to underperform by Credit Suisse. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was downgraded to neutral from buy at Citigroup.Novartis shares fell 0.5% to 83.14 after sliding to 82.06 intraday, nearly returning to a 82.04 buy point cleared in late June. GlaxoSmithKline shares fell 0.3% to 42.66. Glaxo undercut its 50-day line on Monday.Teradyne (TER), maker of automation equipment was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus and had its price target raised to 39 from 32. Stifel is upbeat about Teradyne's collaborative robot business.Teradyne shares rose 4% to 30.87. The stock has been in a sharp downturn since June 9, along with many other chip gear firms.

96,ORCL,"If there was any doubt the technology sector is leading the stock market, just check the IBD ETF Leaders: Four technology ETFs are trying to break out to new highs.The four share many of the same stocks, and the ETF's charts have shadowed each other for years. Now, all four are quite close to buy points from flat bases they crafted over the past several weeks.On Wednesday, Fidelity MSCI Information Technology (FTEC) climbed to its 45.10 buy point, and Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) edged past its 148.36 buy point. IShares U.S. Technology (IYW) is near a 147.64 buy point. First Trust Technology AlphaDEX (FXL) is near a 46.15 buy point.All four funds own the technology titans Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). They account for big portions of three of the four funds, in some cases carrying outsized weightings. Apple, for example, accounts for 14% to 17% of all the ETFs except for the First Trust fund.First Trust Technology AlphaDEX is structured differently than the other three. It's based on an index developed by NYSE Group that seeks Russell 1000 companies with certain share performance and fundamentals. Those including three-, six- and 12-month price appreciation, one-year sales growth plus valuation measurements such as book value-to-price and return on assets.The index results in a much more evenly distributed portfolio, with no single stock accounting for more than 2.5% of its 80 holdings.By comparison, 57% of Vanguard Information Technology is stacked with just 10 of its 364 holdings, according to the fund's website. Just five stocks are responsible for about 40% of Fidelity MSCI Information Technology, and three stocks (Apple, Microsoft and Facebook) form some 37% of the iShares tech ETF, which owns about 135 stocks.No matter, the four funds have performed with remarkable similarity. First Trust Technology is up about 21% this year, while the other three are up about 22%.All four ETFs must be thankful the tech sector has outperformed this year, and investors have to be wondering how long the party will last. At least in terms of earnings outlook, there's reason for some optimism.Leaving aside energy companies, which are rebounding from depressed levels, the technology sector is expected to have the highest growth rate of all S&P sectors. Its Q2 profits are expected to climb 13% and revenue by 8%. ""All 10 industries within the sector are estimated to record positive numbers this quarter, but none more than semiconductors, which are currently anticipated to increase earnings by 50%"" year over year, Estimize Research noted.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

98,ORCL,"The popular Super Bowl commercial laid out a tongue-in-cheek crisis in the future of AI. Amazon.com's (AMZN) digital assistant Alexa loses her voice. What to do in a world dependent on artificial intelligence in business and at home?X Enter a series of stand-ins, including actor Anthony Hopkins, who goes into creepy Hannibal Lecter mode and unnerves the people he's supposed to help. Thankfully, Alexa recovers her digital voice and restores order. AI proves its value.Corporate America is on the cusp of a plunge into this future of AI in business. And giant technology companies — which stand to benefit by both harnessing their own artificial intelligence applications and helping other companies make the leap — are immersed in it now.Artificial intelligence innovations are well along at Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Alexa, found on Amazon's Echo devices, is just one example. Digital aides like Google's aptly named Assistant on its Home smart speaker and Apple's Siri on its Home Pod can help with shopping, entertainment, school work and other tasks.Tech companies also are busy at work on deploying AI in self-driving cars. And companies ranging from giant IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) to a wave of startups are competing for talent and technology so they can cash in as AI spreads to non-tech enterprises.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportOutside Silicon Valley, companies are dipping a tentative toe into AI. Surveys show that most companies plan to evaluate how artificial intelligence can make them better, whether in making sales forecasts, automating tasks now done manually, improving existing products or enabling new ones. Budgets could more than triple in the next few years.""There's a lot of interest and experimentation; companies are still in the proof-of-concept, project phase,"" said Nicholas McQuire, vice president of enterprise research at CCS Insight. ""We'll see more deployment in about one or two years.""Artificial intelligence software programs — essentially computer algorithms — analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes.Companies are developing AI software that could save lives through early cancer detection. Other projects might someday thwart a cyberattack.Banking, retail and health care are among the sectors pushing into AI with pilot projects. Conversational ""chat bots"" are popping up on company websites, answering questions and improving customer service.Walmart Stores (WMT) harnesses AI to optimize inventories and supply chains by predicting future demand and reordering stock. Monsanto (MON) uses artificial intelligence to identify the most promising molecules in bioengineering. John Deere (DE) expects AI to reduce chemical spraying volumes in farming. And shale oil producer Devon Energy (DVN) uses AI to guide drilling gear.IBD's Take: The so-called FANG stocks are leading the way in AI in consumer apps and cloud computing.

Banks see the future of AI in detecting money laundering and fraud. Manufacturers see AI as helpful in scheduling equipment maintenance. In health care, AI could predict diabetes and other diseases before they develop and identify the most promising treatments. A new algorithm from Google can help predict heart disease via retinal scans.In e-commerce, marketers expect AI tools to personalize website content to spotlight products or services that each online shopper is most likely to buy and to target ads more effectively. The telecom, oil and gas, media, entertainment and agriculture industries also are expected to embrace AI in their business.""A lot of companies see AI as transformational, but maybe not quite yet,"" said Jeff Cotrupe, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan.Industry disruptions and AI-based business models are off in the future.""The enterprise has been a bit slow,"" said Aditya Kaul, research director at Tractica. ""Many companies are still in the early stages of understanding what is AI, what problems can be solved, what is possible.""IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on AI hardware, software and services will jump to $58 billion by 2021, up from just $12 billion in 2017.""AI is not a budget line-item at this stage,"" said CCS's McQuire.JPMorgan estimates that AI will account for 1.8% of global enterprise IT budgets by 2021. Though still small next to, say, the 8% spent on cybersecurity, that would be up from a scant 0.3% in 2016.An AI spending boom would boost growth at enterprise software firms, cloud computing providers and IT service providers such as Microsoft, IBM, Accenture (ACN), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle.""The AI killer app has emerged: cost savings,"" Brent Bracelin, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent note to clients. Aside from customer service, he says many time-consuming, back-office tasks  such as human resources, finance and accounting will be automated with AI.One key to the future of AI will be to make it easier for companies to forge ahead with artificial intelligence projects, say analysts. Salesforce.com, AT&T (T) and Google are among those seeking a faster track for AI in business.AT&T, with an open-source software project, aims to make developing AI predictive tools as easy as building a website.  Working with IT consulting firm Tech Mahindra, AT&T has launched an open-source artificial intelligence software project with the Linux Foundation.""There is some confusion that doing AI is very expensive if you look at the R&D budgets of Google and Amazon,"" said Kaul. ""But you don't need billions of dollars to get AI projects started. There is open source software — it's a big trend within AI — that helps companies build their own solutions.""Salesforce.com has a mantra to help customers build AI tools ""with clicks not code."" That means companies don't need their own programmers to write algorithms that can find patterns or make inferences from sales data.Salesforce has a line of tools it calls Einstein that use a company's historical lead and account data to predict which deals are more likely to close.""What companies need is the ability to apply AI to their business. There's not a lot of off-the-shelf AI, like Salesforce's Einstein,"" said CCS Insight's McQuire. ""But technology is advancing quickly. We're going to see a lot more technology that helps companies automate the creation of custom AI models, which will speed up the market.""McQuire says nearly 60% of companies surveyed by CCS Insight are testing or studying AI. One problem is that high-tech companies are willing to pay much higher salaries for AI specialists, which increases their expenses.If they lack in-house expertise, McQuire says many companies are turning to cloud computing vendors — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google — to get a head start.Cloud computing vendors aim to provide AI-as-a-service. Companies can run artificial intelligence apps on powerful computers rented by the hour to crunch massive quantities of data.""All the public clouds are fighting over who has the best AI platform,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Google is focused on providing cloud customers with tool kits for ""machine learning,"" one type of AI. Google's AI tools enable cloud customers such as a hospital radiology department to focus computer vision algorithms so they can spot lung cancer.Many midsize or large companies lack internal technology staffers who can build AI-powered apps. That gives information technology services firms such as Accenture and IBM an opening as companies look to develop custom AI apps, says Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair. IBM, which has focused its Watson AI platform on health care, is moving into new markets such as digital marketing.Wall Street analysts anticipate that AI tools will be integrated with existing big data, business intelligence and industry-specific enterprise software. Kaul says many industries are still in the early stages of digitizing records handled as paperwork. Once that data is available, AI tools can go to work to help deploy AI in business.""Although Google, Facebook (FB), Baidu (BIDU), Apple, Microsoft and Amazon may have taken early advantage of their large data sets and established platforms, enterprise  software vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce are gradually embedding AI into their offerings,"" said the JPMorgan report.Software companies pushing into AI include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Coupa Software (COUP), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), HubSpot (HUBS), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY).The fact that most non-tech companies need a helping hand getting into artificial intelligence also provides an opportunity for startups pushing into the enterprise market. Among them: Sentient Technologies, DataRobot, Clarifai, Algorithmia, Affectiva and SpaceKnow.At this early stage of AI in business, corporate America is using what's called ""machine learning"" for the most part as opposed to more complex ""deep learning."" With ML, algorithms are trained to create predictive models or identify patterns. ML helps predict what a particular customer is likely to buy or detects insurance claims fraud.Tech companies use machine learning to personalize web content and other tasks. But they also are plowing ahead in applying deep learning, which mimics neural networks in the human brain, for classifying images and other purposes. Self-driving cars will require deep learning to map their surroundings and detect hazards.Technology giants are in an AI arms race. They're funding or acquiring startups and paying super-salaries to hire AI computer scientists.Amazon isn't stopping at Alexa-powered digital assistants. Its Amazon Go retail stores use computer vision and AI to do away with cashiers.Apple uses artificial intelligence software for facial recognition in the new iPhone X. And Apple is developing AI health care mobile apps.For Facebook users, AI lurks behind the scenes, playing a central role in what advertisements or news they see. And at Netflix (NFLX), programming recommendations are getting better as software algorithms are trained to identify movie matches.What sets the tech giants apart is commitment. For them, the future of AI is now.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai makes a point to show this. On earnings calls and tech conferences, he now calls Google an ""AI first"" company.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?No. 1-Ranked Stock With 118% Growth Breaks Out With Earnings DueBirth Of An Industry: Early Investing  Hot Spots In Artificial IntelligenceIt's An AI Arms Race: What China Has To Offer Vis-A-Vis U.S.

100,ORCL,"From a simple bookseller to e-commerce leader to media mogul, rocketship maker and now the richest man in the world, that's Amazon's (AMZN) founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos.X According to Bloomberg's billionaire index, Bezos has clawed his way to being the wealthiest person in the world, with a total net worth of $105 billion. Technology company founders hold six of the top 10 spots on the Bloomberg billionaire list.As Amazon shares have risen so has the wealth of Bezos, who moved ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, who has a net worth of $93.3 billion, followed by Warren Buffet at $82.7 billion.Gates has used much of his wealth from Microsoft to fund philanthropy, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and has gifted almost 700 million Microsoft shares. Bezos has said he sells about $1 billion in stock each year to fund Blue Origin, a manufacturer of rocketships and capsules he intends to use for space tourism and research.Amazon shares rose 56% in 2017 and are up 6.6% this year as the stock currently trades near a record high. Amazon has received two price-target increases this week. Shares were up 0.5% to close at 1,252.70 Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE:  Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock with a healthy IBD Composite Rating of 82 out of a possible 99. Looking for the next big thing? Start with this simple routine.Bezos, 53,  founded Amazon 23 years ago, selling books out of a garage. It's now the world's largest e-commerce company. Amazon's various ventures include a movie and digital media business. Bezos is also owner of the Washington Post, in addition to leading Blue Origin.Following Bezos and Gates is Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook (FB). Zuckerberg is fourth on the list with a net worth of $77.5 billion. Facebook stock rose 53% in 2017.Zuckerberg is followed by Alphabet (GOOGL) co-founder and Google owner Larry Page. Next is Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison. Alphabet co-founder Sergey Brin holds the tenth spot. Alphabet shares rose 32% in 2016. Oracle shares are up 24%.Facebook received positive reports from two Wall Street analysts on Monday, with one calling the social networking giant its ""top pick for 2018.""As noted by CNBC, Bezos may be the wealthiest man in the world today but he's not the wealthiest of all time, depending on how you tally his riches.Adjusted for inflation, Gates's $100 billion fortune in 1999 would be worth about $147 billion today, or about $42 billion more than Bezos. The case could also be made that John D. Rockefeller was the richest, when measured as a share of the gross domestic product. But, perhaps no one will ever be as rich as Augustus Caesar, whose fortune would have tallied into the trillions today.Amazon shares were trading near 1,246, up .07% during afternoon trading in the stock market today. Facebook shares were down 0.2%, near 187.90.Alphabet shares were up 0.2%, near 1,116.50. Oracle was up 0.6%, near 49.10, while Microsoft was up 0.2%, near 88.50.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Receives Price-Target Boost As Confidence In Growth MountsFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To Watch

101,ORCL,"XDatabase software giant Oracle (ORCL) reported fourth-quarter results after the market close Wednesday that soundly beat top- and bottom-line estimates, with strong growth in its cloud computing operations.Oracle reported revenue of $10.89 billion, beating the consensus view of $10.46 billion and up 3% from a year ago. It reported adjusted earnings 89 cents per share, ahead of estimates that called for 78 cents a share, as polled by Zacks, for the period ended May 31.Oracle stock was up 8%, near 50, during after-market trading in the stock market today. If it holds, that would beat the previous record of 46.99 on March 16.The company is about three years into migrating its business services to the cloud. Oracle said total cloud revenue in the quarter rose 58% from the year-ago period to $1.4 billion. For the year, cloud revenue rose 60% to $4.6 billion.""Our fourth-quarter results were very strong as revenue growth and earnings per share both substantially exceeded the high end of guidance,"" Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz, said in prepared remarks that came with the earnings release. ""This cloud hypergrowth is expanding our operating margins, and we expect earnings per share growth to accelerate in fiscal 2018.""Last month AT&T (T) announced an agreement to move thousands of its large-scale internal databases to Oracle's cloud infrastructure.Oracle approved a cash dividend of 19 cents per share, payable to stockholders of record as of July 19.

102,ORCL,"The stock market on Thursday continued a positive refrain, dipping lightly early but rising in late-afternoon trade. The Nasdaq composite led the field with a mild 0.1% gain, even without the help of NYSE-listed Oracle (ORCL), and is poised for its highest close since the June 9 sell-off.Looking at the top industry groups, they ranged from the top-performing medical software group (in the top 10 out of IBD's 197 groups), automakers (also in the top 10), foreign banks and hospitals to cellar-dwelling department store chains and steel alloy companies.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were virtually flat; the latter is still poised for a modest weekly gain, currently near 0.2%. In contrast, the Nasdaq composite, rich in software, internet, biotech and semiconductor stocks, is on track for a weekly gain of 1.6%.Market technicals are positive in the stock market today, with winners exceeding losers by a roughly 9-to-5 margin on both main exchanges.Oracle's breakout past a 47.09 flat-base buy point is stunning, given the huge gap up in price and tremendous volume with less than an hour to go in Thursday's session. At 3 p.m. ET, the database and business software titan saw more than 50 million shares exchange hands, more than quadruple its 50-day average of 11.1 million shares.The roughly 13-week flat base comes on top of a much longer saucer with handle that features a 43.36 entry, 10 cents above the Feb. 27 intraday high.As a large cap, no doubt, Oracle has now emerged alongside Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) as companies that are seeing a rebound in fundamentals. Earnings in the May-ended fiscal fourth quarter rose 10% to 89 cents a share, the best result since an 11% hike in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Revenue rose 3% to $10.89 billion.However, investors who wish to find software stocks with stronger EPS and revenue gains and great new products and services can view the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders screens. They include the following three names:Veeva Systems (VEEV), No. 8 in the IBD 50 and a top play in the medical software group. Veeva is all about cloud-based services to help Big Pharma firms manage their business.Veeva is perhaps in the middle innings of its impressive run. As seen on a long weekly chart, the Pleasanton, Calif., firm made no headway after its powerful IPO at 20 in late 2013 and its subsequent surge in its second week of trading to 49. The stock essentially cratered more than 65% to a low of 17.11, but in effect produced a first-stage bottoming base pattern.Eventually, Veeva cleared a first-stage pattern at 27.67 in April 2016, moving past a three-month cup-with-handle buy point. The stock rallied 54% before coolilng off in September that year and proceeding to form a new set of bases. The most recent base-on-base breakout at 48.05 was a second-stage breakout.Veeva has grown earnings from 15 cents a share in FY 2013 (ended in January that year) to 73 cents in FY 2017 on a four-fold revenue jump ($130 million to $544 million). The Street expects earnings to grow another 14% to 83 cents in FY 2018 and 19% in FY 2019.Paycom Software (PAYC), No. 7 in the IBD 50. The HR and payroll outsourcing firm for small and medium businesses has rallied 40% since vaulting past a 51.07 buy point on Feb. 9.LogMeIn (LOGM), in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. The online videoconferencing expert is forming a new base after a short-lived breakout past a 110.10 cup-base entry. It's in the same enterprise software group as Oracle, but LogMeIn sports stronger top- and bottom-line growth.Earnings per share have jumped 46%, 6%, 40%, 22%, 22% and 143% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, LogMeIn gets a sterling 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, 3rd highest in the enterprise software group, while Paycom rates 2nd with a 99 Composite.RELATED:Oracle Soars To New High As Analysts Hail 'Perfect Storm'Are These 3 Stocks The Next Apple Of Biotech?Will The Stock Market Decline Soon?

Oracle stock hit a record high of 46.99 on March 16.Oracle began its push into the cloud three years ago.""Our channel research points to another quarter of improved execution which began to surface last quarter,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk wrote in a recent note to clients.He attributes the improved execution primarily to significant changes in Oracle's sales management organization, focused on helping customers make the journey to the Oracle cloud. Senk says short- and long-term fundamentals at Oracle continue to take a more positive turn.Over time, he added, Oracle needs to show that it can retain database market share against Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others. Amazon and Microsoft are the two largest cloud vendors by revenue.IBD'S TAKE: Senk recently raised his price target on Oracle, saying the company has turned a significant corner and is poised to not only deliver overall top-line growth but also earnings-per-share growth as the cloud businesses begin to mature and customers continue to run business-critical applications on the platform.In the previous quarter, Oracle reported fiscal third quarter earnings that cruised past estimates as its cloud transition picked up momentum. Oracle said its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service non-GAAP revenue jumped 85% to $1.1 billion, as total cloud revenue reached $1.2 billion, up 62%. Oracle's traditional software-licensing business fell 16% as the company transitions.Senk expects Oracle cloud revenue to grow 65% from the year-ago quarter to $1.4 billion.RBC Capital Management analyst Ross MacMillan has an outperform rating on Oracle and price target of 47.MacMillan, in a research note, said Oracle's position in cloud computing is immature relative to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The risk is that Oracle customers looking to move their workloads to the cloud will choose alternative platforms over time.Last month AT&T (T) announced an agreement to move thousands of its large-scale internal databases to Oracle's cloud infrastructure.RELATED:After Microsoft Breaks Out, What Buy Point Is Oracle Targeting?Amazon Cloud Services Under Growing Threat From Microsoft, Google, IBM

"
107,ORCL,"Snapchat is for teenagers, Facebook (FB) is for your mom and Twitter (TWTR) is for folks who like the din of a public square.X But email remains the dominant form of business communication, and recent IPO SendGrid (SEND) is riding a wave of Uber receipts, Yelp (YELP) notifications and eBay (EBAY) marketing emails to profitability.The cloud-based email-service provider, which sprouted in 2009 after participating in the TechStars accelerator program, mostly specializes in something known as email API. Its servers send over a billion emails a day on behalf of its 58,000 customers, a list that includes Uber, Yelp, eBay, Spotify, Airbnb and Glassdoor.After pricing at 16 a share, SendGrid jumped 16.5% to 18 in its Nov. 15 debut. The stock was up nearly 7% in early trades Monday, near 25.74.In this day and age, email seems like a straightforward form of messaging, but as it turns out, a lot of them disappear into the ether. The industry average for email deliverability is only 80%, wrote William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri in a recent report, meaning that one in five emails never makes it to its destination. You might not mind so much if an ad whizzes by you, but refreshing your inbox for the arrival of a much-needed password reset or shipment confirmation is another matter.By contrast, SendGrid's delivery rate is 94%, which Suri — who initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating – says is ""a result of its strong sender reputation and close relationships with inbox service providers — enabling the company to effectively navigate sophisticated email filters and avoid emails being sent to spam.""For SendGrid's customers, ""the delivery of their emails to the inbox is not a 'nice to have,' it's a business-critical communication from their company to the user,"" Chief Executive Sameer Dholakia told Investor's Business Daily. ""And the difference between it getting there nearly all the time and it only getting there most of the time is the difference between acceptable and unacceptable.""Transactional email API drives about 80% of SendGrid's revenue, with the rest stemming from email marketing campaigns and other services. While the company would not disclose its largest clients by revenue, Dholakia said that no single customer accounts for more than 2% of total revenue.""Our top 10 customers constituted 10% or less of our total revenue in any period, so it's a highly de-risked and un-concentrated customer base, which is terrific,"" he said. ""I know not all companies that look like us enjoy that, but thankfully for us, we're fairly broad-based.""The company earned an adjusted $576,000 in the first six months of 2017 vs. an adjusted loss of $2.365 million during the prior-year period. For the year, analysts expect SendGrid to report a profit of 3 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research. But Wall Street sees a 4-cent loss in 2018 before the company returns to the black with a 2-cent gain the following year. Revenue was expected to rise 25% to $100 million in 2017, swelling to $136 million in 2018 and $170 million in 2019.IBD'S TAKE: Since going public Nov. 15, Sendgrid shares have generally climbed from their IPO at 16. Shares settled Friday at 23.97, a record close and up 50% from its IPO. But Sendgrid is not the top-ranked stock in its group. That designation belongs to Autohome (ATHM).SendGrid is in ""heavy investment mode,"" according to Morgan Stanley. William Blair's Suri expects public-company costs and investment expenses to weigh on operating margins and profitability in the near term, but says SendGrid's self-service model means that it doesn't need a big salesforce, translating to lower sales and marketing expenses.""Over the longer term, we believe SendGrid should be able to exceed its operating margin target of 25% given the efficient dynamics of its business model, which include high SaaS gross margins and below-average sales-and-marketing expense,"" wrote Suri on Dec. 11.Analysts put SendGrid's share of the very fragmented email API market at 1%-2%, competing against the likes of SparkPost and Amazon's Simple Email Service (more on that later). On its smaller marketing campaign front, MailChimp, Constant Contact (owned by Endurance International (EIGI)), Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are rivals.""We see a fragmented competitive landscape of private players, positioning SendGrid as the go-to platform, which should allow the company to sustain a 20%+ revenue (compound annual growth rate) over the next 15 years,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky. He initiated coverage with an equal weight rating and 23 price target, as he sees most of SendGrid's growth potential and margin expansion already priced in.Dholakia, who has been at the helm since 2014, sounds bullish about SendGrid's growth prospects and position in the industry.""There are many smaller competitors that compete with SendGrid that I think will find it increasingly difficult to compete with SendGrid, just given economies of scale,"" he said, indicating that management is keeping an eye open for possible acquisitions.The company has made two small buys so far, acquiring Message Bus' customer base in 2015 and bringing email marketing startup Bizzy into the fold earlier in 2017, the latter of which was ""a great technology and talent deal, more so than about revenue or business,"" said Dholakia. Bizzy should help beef up SendGrid's marketing campaign business.SendGrid also has a partner — and a rival — in Amazon (AMZN). The companies over the summer expanded their technology alliance, with SendGrid saying it is ""aggressively expanding (its) footprint with Amazon Web Services (AWS)."" But its offerings also compete with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), which debuted in 2011 as a ""bare bones"" add-on to AWS, wrote Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky.Amazon's seemingly endless appetite can prompt nervousness, even in companies that don't compete directly with the e-commerce and cloud-computing behemoth. (After all, prior to its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, who would've thought Amazon was so interested in the grocery space?)But even though SendGrid's per-email prices are three to four times more expensive than Amazon SES, neither its chief executive nor analysts seem too concerned about the idea of Amazon unhinging its jaw and feasting on the email API sector.""We had a very candid conversation about the 'co-opetition' nature of that relationship,"" said Dholakia of the e-commerce titan, adding that Amazon is ""very used to having this conversation where they partner very closely with companies that they may compete with on any given service.""And Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky said talks with customers revealed that SendGrid's higher email deliverability, analytics and customer support took priority over pricing. He also pointed out in his recent report that SendGrid is listed as the ""premier AWS email service"" in the AWS Marketplace.""They've been great,"" said Dholakia of Amazon. ""We integrated very closely — so it's not one of these Barney relationships, where you put out a press release and that's about as deep as the relationship goes.""Among various analyst concerns: growing competition, the sustainability of its self-service model and the ease with which customers could switch to a rival email API product.There's also the fact that SendGrid's business depends entirely on email. (Young people, Zlotsky notes, aren't so hot on email.)Nevertheless, he sees SendGrid as the ""leading provider"" in a $9 billion-and-growing total addressable market (TAM), ""which should provide the company with a long runway of sustainable growth,"" he wrote.Echoing that sentiment, William Blair's Suri told IBD that the company is ""very attractively valued"" and led by a ""solid management team, solid execution guys.""SendGrid's growth, he said, is ""underestimated by the market.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:New Cloud-Based Issue To Turn Profitable This Year, Forms IPO BaseTop Data-Analytics IPO Pulls Back To Critical Support LevelCould These 10 Growth Stocks In The IBD 50 Have A Banner 2018?IPO LeadersStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

The rival of Dow component Cisco Systems (CSCO) said revenue slipped 11% to $1.239 billion, topping estimates by roughly $4 million.The Juniper board's $2 billion buyback includes a $750 million accelerated share repurchase program.

Juniper said it expects revenue of $1.05 billion vs. estimates of $1.16 billion. That sent shares of the company tumbling 7.7% to to close at 26.15 on the stock market today.Juniper aims to sell more networking gear to cloud-computing providers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL). Its biggest customers have been telecom companies, such as AT&T (T).IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.""Juniper continues to see weakening results with cloud customers, as evidenced by their poor Q4 print and Q1 guide,"" said George Notter, a Jefferies analyst in a report. ""While the company is confident that the architectural changes impacting their cloud customers are temporary, we suspect this a more fundamental issue.""With Wednesday's loss, Juniper fell below its 50-day moving average. The stock had been up 6% from a year ago as of Tuesday's market close. Juniper has now retreated from a buy point of 31.06.RELATED:Bitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWill Resurgent Cisco Slow Down Arista Networks In Cloud Computing?

To find out which are the other top-rated biotechs, and how they stack up vs. objective critera, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Several other drug groups are big recent winners, among them the ethical drugs group, which includes Dow stock Merck (MRK). Merck rose 1.4% to 65.46 on Wednesday on a new approval for its immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda. Merck has a 66.90 conventional buy point with a 65.68 aggressive entry.Meanwhile, IBD's Software-Desktop group, home to Oracle, is the fourth-best industry over the past five days. The Dow's Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Red Hat (RHT) are also members. (Other software groups, including enterprise software and medical software, also have had big gains.)Celgene leapt 5.2% to 132.83, blasting past a 127.74 buy point, holding just within the 5% chase zone. There's a growing feeling among investors that President Trump will not crack down on drug prices, despite various comments he has made before and after the campaign.Regeneron rose 5.4% to 522.02, further extended from a buy point and trading at its best levels since the beginning of 2016.Amgen advanced 3.1% as it builds the right side of a base.Biogen gained 4.7%, retaking its 200-day moving average a day after vaulting above its 50-day.Recent Biogen spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) edged down 0.1%, but is holding in a buy zone after Monday's breakout. Bioverativ is on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service highlighting a select cull of stocks, mostly growth plays in or near buy zones.Clovis Oncology (CLVS) has skyrocketed 57% this week after reporting strong trial data, suggesting its ovarian cancer drug may get a much-wider use.Gilead Sciences (GILD) rose 2.9% to above its 50-day line as the Hepatitis-C and HIV biotech tries to break a downtrend going back more than a year.One good way to play the biotech boom is via ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB). Both XBI and IBB broke out of consolidations this week.Oracle reported much-stronger-than-expected earnings late Wednesday, with 3% revenue growth also edging past views. Shares of the business software giant shot up 11% to 51.35 in premarket trading on the stock market today. That would be a record high and well above a 47.09 buy point, though overnight trading doesn't always carry over into the regular session. Still, Oracle already topped an aggressive entry of 46.17 on Wednesday, rising 1.1% to 46.33 in heavy volume.In addition to desktop software names Microsoft, Adobe and Red Hat, which are all near long-time or all-time highs, several other business software stocks have been breaking out and hitting highs in recent months. They include cloud-based payroll software players such as Workday (WDAY), Paylocity (PCTY) and Paycom (PAYC), as well as ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Veeva Systems (VEEV).In Asian trading Thursday, Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.1% while China's Shanghai composite slid 0.3%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE retreated 0.4%, Germany's Dax was flat while France's Cac fell 0.3%.RELATED:The Big Picture: Biotechs Lift Nasdaq; Oil Bloodbath ContinuesBiotech Breakouts: Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ In Buy ZoneOracle Earnings Come In Ahead On Top And Bottom LinesBiotechs Surge As Generalists Return Amid Subsiding Trump WoesHow Dow's Merck Is Still Beating Bristol, Roche In Immuno-OncologyIs This Medical Cloud Computing Play Set To Rebound, Or Crash?

Oracle vaulted above a flat base formed over the past 14 weeks with a buy point of 47.09.""Oracle is clearly demonstrating to the market that the company has established itself as a formidable force in the cloud and the naysayers over the past few years are being proven wrong,"" Drexel analyst Brian White said in a report. ""Three years ago, Oracle began pushing aggressively into the cloud, negatively impacting sales and EPS along the way; however, we believe the worst of this transition is over.""RBC Capital Markets upgraded shares of CarMax to outperform from sector perform and raised its price target to 69 from 63.Richmond, Va.-based CarMax jumped 4.6% to 62.50, retaking its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. On Wednesday, it rose 0.8% to 59.74 in up-and-down trade.CarMax on Wednesday reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat expectations.

114,ORCL,"AT&T (T), Apple (APPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN) were among U.S. companies that added the most debt in 2017 to finance either acquisitions or stock repurchases, says S&P Dow Jones Indices.Apple, despite having a cash pile estimated to reach $285 billion by the end of 2017, added nearly $27 billion in debt. Apple has stepped up stock repurchases.AT&T, meanwhile, issued $38 billion in bonds last year, mainly to finance its purchase of Time Warner (TWX). The Department of Justice, though, has filed suit to block the acquisition.And Amazon acquired retailer Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. Amazon issued $16.9 billion in bonds, also financing its global expansion and cloud computing business.S&P 500 companies overall issued $775 billion in bonds, the sixth consecutive year of record U.S. corporate bond issuances,  says S&P Dow Jones Indices. The companies aimed to take advantage of low interest rates. Inflation is expected to rise in 2018, say some economists, which could hike borrowing costs and interest expenses.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Also among companies that issued the most bonds were Verizon Communications (VZ), Broadcom (AVGO) and Microsoft (MSFT). Verizon ranked No. 3, issuing $25.6 billion in bonds, Broadcom followed at $17.6 billion and Microsoft was next at $17 billion.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), Oracle (ORCL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also were in the top 10 of bond issuers. Qualcomm has yet to close its purchase of NXP Semiconductors. If that deal falls through, Qualcomm may buy back more stock.There's speculation Oracle could turn more aggressive in buying software companies in 2018. Comcast's talks with Walt Disney (DIS) fell through last year, but the cable TV firm issued $10.5 billion in bonds.Some companies, such as Comcast and Verizon, issued bonds to refinance existing debt on their balance sheet at lower interest rates.RELATED:Verizon Downgraded On Inflation Woes, But Price Target RaisedBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetDoubling Of U.S. Bond Supply Seen As A Threat To Global RallyGoldman Sachs Beats But Trading Lags Peers; Bank Of America Mixed

116,ORCL,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages to record highs helped by Trump tax cut momentum. Bitcoin futures had a successful launch on the Cboe Global Markets (CBOE). Walt Disney (DIS) agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox (FOXA) while also launching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" The Federal Reserve raised rates while the FCC repealed net neutrality. Adobe Systems (ADBE) had strong earnings and guidance while Oracle (ORCL) missed on cloud revenue and cloud guidance.X The Nasdaq rose 1.4%, the Dow industrials 1.3% and the S&P 500 index 0.9%, all hitting record highs Friday as the GOP finalized its tax legislation with apparently enough support to pass. The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers. Some analysts are expecting around $200 million from the film domestically. The film opened to the public on Thursday evening, with an estimated $45 million in ticket salesThe Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal utilitylike oversight on internet service providers, delivering regulatory reversal sought by Comcast, AT&T, Verizon Communications and other ISPs. FCC chairman Ajit Pai  said the new rules will ""return regulatory parity to the internet economy."" He said some giant internet companies engage in anti-consumer behavior, while ISPs have been unfairly targeted by regulators. State regulators, Comcast and others said Congress should step in and pass internet legislation. One analyst put the chances of that at less than 30%.The Federal Reserve raised rates at its final meeting of the year, as expected. Policymakers also still expect to raise interest rates three times next year and didn't seem concerned about Trump tax cuts overheating the economy. Economic data backed a Goldilocks scenario. November retail sales were much stronger than expected, core consumer inflation cooled.Several biotechs popped on news stemming from the American Society of Hematology conference last week in Atlanta, while clinical trial data from others fell short. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared Monday after it reported improvement in patients using its LentiGlobin therapy to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Fellow CAR-T player Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), though, retreated nearly 22% in two days despite strong data in patients with a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors wanted more data, analysts said. On Tuesday, GlycoMimetics (GLYC) rocketed on data from its drug in acute myeloid leukemia, but Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) sank following its presentation of its sickle cell disease drug. Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) crashed on its hemophilia A drug data, suggesting a later approval than a rival treatment from Biomarin (BMRN). Cellectis (CLLS) launched Wednesday after Phase 1 trials showed promise for its experimental treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.RELATED:Biotech Stocks Soar On Trial Data At Hematology ConferenceOracle earnings rose 14% as revenue rose 6% to $9.6 billion, both beating views. Cloud revenue missed, with the 44% rise to $1.5 billion below views for $1.56 billion. Oracle also gave weak guidance, especially for cloud revenue. Oracle shares tumbled 3.8% on Friday.U.S. crude production surged to another record high of 9.780 million barrels per day, according to the  Energy Information Administration, which sees output hitting 10 million bpd next year. OPEC said that it doesn't see oil markets balancing until late next year on increased U.S. production, throwing into doubt recent talk of forming an exit strategy from its output cut deal. The International Energy Agency raised its 2017 growth forecast for U.S. crude by 390,000 barrels per day and by 870,000 bpd in 2018 vs. estimates in its November report. But the energy watchdog sees a ""closely balanced market"" in 2018.Western Digital (WDC) raised its financial outlook after settling a lengthy legal battle with Toshiba over the ownership and expansion of a flash-memory-chip business. Toshiba Memory will be allowed to sell its stake in the joint venture to a consortium led by Bain Capital. Western Digital gets to participate in the development of new factory expansions and certain rights to the chip output.

The iPhone X uses VCSELs to power its Face ID security feature, Animojis and other apps. The deal marked Apple's second major commitment to support U.S. production with its $1 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund. In May, Apple awarded $200 million to glass display cover maker Corning (GLW).Finisar shares soared 21%, even after paring gains as Apple clarified the nature of the deal.Digital media and marketing software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) reported adjusted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.26, up 40% year over year, on sales of $2.01 billion, up 25%, in the quarter ended Dec. 1. Analysts expected $1.15 and $1.95 billion. For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $1.27 a share, up 35%, on sales of $2.04 billion, up 21%. For fiscal 2018, Adobe expects to earn an adjusted $5.50 a share, up 28% year over year, on revenue of $8.725 billion, up 20%.Adobe rose 1.4% Friday, continuing a rebound from its 50-day line.Boeing (BA) announced a $18 billion repurchase program and a 20% dividend hike to $1.71, joining other big companies like Bank of America (BAC), Home Depot (HD) and Mastercard (MA) in returning more capital to shareholders. Boeing shares hit record highs. That's despite Delta Air Lines (DAL) snubbing the aerospace giant. Delta will buy 100 Airbus (EADSY) A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices. The carrier had been in talks to buy 100 of Boeing 737 Max 10 jets.Airbus fell on reports, confirmed Friday, that CEO Tom Enders will leave at the end of his term in February 2019, while COO Fabrice Bregier will exit in February, amid U.K. and French corruption probes.Delta Air Lines (DAL) raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue guidance, lifting shares above a buy point despite a weaker margin outlook. JetBlue (JBLU) also raised unit revenue guidance, but shares reversed lower. United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) recently raised Q4 unit revenue targets.Costco Wholesale (COST) profit grew 16% to $1.36 a share on a 13% sales increase to $31.81 billion, ahead of estimates for $1.35 EPS and $31.52 billion in revenue.

117,ORCL,"A Trump tax reform package will not be passed by Congress this year, forecasts Morgan Stanley, a political development that would be bad news for technology companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) hoping for relief on foreign profits brought into the U.S.Proposed changes on ""repatriated"" overseas cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Oracle (ORCL). Many Wall Street analysts have speculated that cash brought back into the U.S. could be used for stock buybacks or acquisitions.""We still think there's a better than not chance that tax reform will happen before 2019,"" said Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Zezas in a report that outlines reasons why it will be delayed. Midterm 2018 elections could get in the way, Zezas said.He says momentum for tax reform is unclear even if Senate Republicans dump ObamaCare.""It is unclear whether the (health care) plan being developed by leader Mitch McConnell will pass the Senate, and if it does, if it will be acceptable to House Republicans,"" said Zezas. ""If the bill passes, the journey is not over yet — either the House will have to accept the Senate bill as is or they will need to work out differences in conference committee.""House Speaker Paul Ryan aims to get tax reform passed in 2017, but Zezas says there are big obstacles.""The main culprits? Lack of bipartisanship, the restrictions of the budget reconciliation process, and disagreements on key tax issues within the Republican party,"" he added.IBD'S TAKE: For an up-to-the-minute look at which good stocks are trading in heavy volume and making big moves, the place to check is IBD's Stocks on the Move. Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings.""

120,ORCL,"XThe Nasdaq continued to hold the leadership baton in afternoon trading Wednesday, helped by another solid showing for biotech stocks as well as a couple of strong earnings reports from two high-profile software names.Among biotechs, Celgene (CELG) soared past a 127.74 buy point, rising more than 4% to 131.86. But after seven gains in the past eight sessions, the daily chart has a straight-up-off-the-bottom look to it, making Celgene's latest base a bit lopsided.The Nasdaq added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 showed modest losses. Volume on both exchanges was tracking close to Tuesday's levels.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for July lost nearly 3% to $42.31 a barrel after U.S. government data showed a second straight weekly decline for crude inventories, along with a rise in domestic production.Wall Street cheered earnings reports from two well-run software names that have transitioned successfully to the cloud. Red Hat (RHT) soared 10% after reporting a 12% rise in quarterly profit and 19% increase in sales to $676.8 million. It's extended in price at this point, meaning it's too late to buy. Shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE) jumped 2% as adjusted earnings rose 44% to $1.02 share. Sales grew 27% to $1.77 billion.Another software name working toward a cloud-based model is Oracle (ORCL), which reports today after the close. Shares rose 1% to 46.26 ahead of the results as it works on a flat base with a 47.09 buy point.Elsewhere, RV-maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) broke out of a downtrend with conviction, rising 11%, after reporting better-than-expected earnings and its fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Aggressive investors got an early entry into Winnebago on Wednesday even though the stock is still 17% off its high.CarMax (KMX), which operates used-car superstores in the U.S., reversed in spectacular fashion. Shares edged higher after rising 8% intraday. Headed into the report, CarMax was working on a cup-with-handle base with a 65.90 buy point, but it was a flawed pattern because of recent uncertain action around the 50-day moving average. Handle areas should always form comfortably above the 50-day line.In economic news, existing home sales for May came in slightly better than expected, but homebuilders didn't move much on the news. iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB), an exchange-traded fund, was mostly unchanged around 34.

122,ORCL,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Tuesday. The Dow industrials rose 0.7% and the S&P 500 index 0.8% on Monday, hitting all-time highs. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.4%. As a result of these strong actions, the market direction has shifted from uptrend under pressure to confirmed uptrend.X Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Oracle (ORCL) and Grubhub (GRUB) all moved close to buy points on Monday.S&P 500 futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures just edged higher. U.S. crude futures dropped 1.7% to $43.44 a barrel, hitting their lowest levels since last November.Tencent has formed a three-weeks tight pattern. This is a bullish formation that investors can use to add a small number of extra shares. But it's not a place for new positions. Tencent rose 3.1% to 36.05 in Monday stock market trading, just below the buy point of 36.09, which would also match the all-time high set last month.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about the three-weeks tight, read this Investor's Corner: ""How The 3-Weeks Tight Pattern Gives You An Extra Buy Point""Tencent, which operates super-messaging app WeChat, is the archrival of Alibaba (BABA) and owns a strategic stake in e-commerce firm JD.com (JD). Chinese internet stocks rallied Monday.Tencent in March took a 5% stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). That investment was seen as a way for Tencent to get into electric and autonomous vehicles and for Tesla to perhaps smooth its way to opening a plant in China, avoiding a punitive tariff on imported cars. Tesla rose 2% late Monday on a Bloomberg report that the company is near a deal with the city of Shanghai to set up a production facility, though key details were unclear.Grubhub gapped higher Monday as an analyst speculated that the restaurant order-and-delivery app would be a good fit for Amazon.com (AMZN), which just agreed to buy Whole Foods Market (WFM). Amazon could view food distribution as a broader market to exploit, with Whole Foods and restaurant delivery just two just different aspects.Grubhub shares leapt 4.7% to 45.34 on Monday, but backed off intraday highs of 46.46. Grubhub is in a flat base with a 46.93 buy point just above a prior consolidationOracle reports earnings on Wednesday after the market close. Oracle, which retook its 50-day line on Friday, rose 1.4% to 45.73 on Monday.Oracle is in a flat base with a 47.09 conventional entry point. However, aggressive investors could see 46.17 as a potential early entry.Oracle's relative strength line has been lagging in its current consolidation and over the last 15 months, as the tech titan hasn't risen as fast as the S&P 500. It's preferable to see the RS line hitting a new high before the stock does.Meanwhile in Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8% Tuesday, hitting a 22-month high. China's Shanghai composite dipped 0.1% ahead of a decision by MSCI, expected after the U.S. market close Tuesday, whether to include some mainland China stocks in its emerging markets index.In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE edged up nearly 0.1% as the pound fell following Bank of England Gov.

Early indications point to another strong season.XS&P 500 companies are expected to report 8% earnings growth on a 4.6% gain in revenues, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S as of July 6. That's a big reversal from a 2.1% profit decline in Q2 2016 as the energy-led earnings slump extended to a fifth consecutive quarter. And it solidifies the comeback that has seen S&P 500 profit growth of 4.3%, 8% and 15.3% in the last three quarters.Apple (AAPL), which has returned to growth in the prior two quarters, should continue to show EPS and revenue gains when it reports on Aug. 1. That's despite many consumers awaiting the Apple iPhone 8 later this year. Due to its massive size, Apple has an outsized impact on overall S&P 500 earnings and especially the S&P 500 technology sector. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) should see fat profit gains.That 8% overall earnings target for the second quarter is down 2 percentage points from the start of April, but that's half the usual four-point cut typically seen.That is fueling optimism on Wall Street that Q1's momentum — which saw earnings growth hit its highest level since 2011 — will continue into future quarters.""There is a lot more confidence in what is expected for Q3 than at this time last year,"" Sheraz Mian, research director at Zacks Investment Research, told IBD.One downside to the modest revisions: The markets may already be pricing in strong results. Investors have been taking profits in leading tech stocks over the past month.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the opportunity for big gains or big losses. You may want to adopt this earnings options strategy to capture any upside while limiting your losses.Beyond Q2, S&P 500 companies should grow earnings 8.6% and 13.1% in Q3 and Q4, according to Thomson Reuters. They are estimated to grow earnings 11.3% in 2017 as a whole and 11.7% in 2018 vs. 1.4% in 2016.Profits and revenues have been robust from the roughly 5% of S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results so far, including Nike (NKE), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL). Of those 23 companies, 78% have beaten EPS estimates and 87% have topped revenue forecasts.In a typical quarter, 64% of companies overall beat earnings estimates and 59% beat revenue views.The energy, technology and financials sectors are expected to drive earnings growth in Q2 — a period over which the S&P 500 advanced 2.6% and set a new all-time closing of 2,453 on June 19.Oil and gas companies earnings should reverse higher after an outright loss a year earlier. But oil prices are down significantly from the start of 2017, which has hurt shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and other energy stocks.Financials and technology, the two largest S&P 500 sectors, are expected to moderate earnings growth from the near-20% Q1 pace. But growth should still be solid, with financials up 7.6% and technology 11.2%, according to Thomson Reuters.Banks continue to see a deceleration in loan growth and unfavorable moves in bond yields, Mian said.Several Wall Street giants have warned of weak trading revenue in Q2, continuing the lackluster trend in 2017. That's a key reason why JPMorgan and Citigroup are expected to show little-to-no profit growth, while regional banks such Comerica (CMA) should see big EPS gains.Still, bank stocks large and small have been leading in recent weeks, helped by higher bond yields and massive buyback and dividend plans. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have moved past buy points to long-time highs, while Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and others are in buy zones.Technology is the only sector outside of energy that is expected to best the overall 8% S&P 500 gain. The sector also has gotten a boost from Adobe, Oracle and Micron Technology (MU), which smashed quarterly expectations in late June, Mian said. Expect strong growth for Alphabet and Facebook, he added.Health care, which has seen shares of health insurers and many biotechs soar in 2017, is estimated to grow earnings a tepid 2.3%. Other laggards are likely to include materials (4.3%), consumer staples (3.6%), industrials (2.4%), real estate (1.9%), telecom (1.1%) and consumer discretionary (0.9%).The utilities sector should post a 2.8% earnings decline. Of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, only industrials has seen an upward estimate revision for Q2 since the start of April.Zacks, which tracks sectors differently, expects aerospace, construction and industrial products to shine, with earnings growth of 49%, 15.6% and 11.9% respectively.Multinationals such as Apple, Boeing (BA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet and Facebook, are expected to see less drag from a strong dollar on their earnings.""The dollar was only 4% higher year over year in the second quarter on average, so we don't expect a major impact to earnings because of that,"" said Lindsey Bell, a CFRA investment strategist. The greenback's continued weakness since then should provide a tailwind to multinationals' Q3 earnings.Mian also expects multinationals to benefit from a notably improved overseas growth outlook.""A dividing line in the last earnings season was that more internationally oriented companies had a more positive view of business than those that are domestically oriented,"" he said. ""I expect that trend to continue.""Q2 earnings growth should top current analyst estimates, in keeping with historical trends. But matching Q1's blowout performance will be a tough order, Mian said.The first quarter saw double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle — and that is unlikely to be surpassed for the next few quarters, in Mian's view.RELATED:Q2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

126,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) Chief Executive Safra Catz said Monday she discussed the U.S. Defense Department's cloud-computing contract with President Trump, and told him the Pentagon's plan to find only one provider isn't a sound strategy.""It just made no sense,"" she told journalists at Oracle's offices in Petach Tikva, Israel. ""I never heard of something like a single cloud and I would challenge anyone to point at a significant commercial customer who has one cloud.""The Pentagon intends to award a single contract for multiyear cloud services. The contract could go to one team made up of multiple companies. A final request for proposals, which outlines a contract as long as 10 years, is scheduled to be released in May and awarded by the end of September.Catz, who shares the title of CEO with Mark Hurd, usually keeps a lower profile than her colleague, except when it comes to Oracle's affairs in Washington, D.C. Bloomberg reported earlier that she criticized the bidding process at a private dinner with Trump earlier this month.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCatz added that the procurement process seemed designed to benefit Amazon.com's (AMZN) AWS, which rivals some of Oracle's computing and storage products.""I have no idea why they were given unfair advantage,"" she said Monday. ""I have no idea why anyone would think that is a good idea.""Trump told her that ""he was very confident that the Pentagon would have a fair review,"" she said.Oracle has led a campaign in Washington to prevent Amazon from winning the Defense Department contract, Bloomberg has reported. Catz's company has cooperated with Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM), among others, on the effort, which has included lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House.Israel-born Catz served on the executive committee of Trump's transition team before he was sworn into office. She later joined his administration's American Technology Council, which focused on government modernization.Under Catz, Oracle has orchestrated a transition to cloud-based products after decades as a mainstay of traditional corporate computing software. The shift hit a snag when the company's cloud sales growth slowed down, sending its stock tumbling the most in more than six years last month.The Redwood City, Calif.-based company was a late entrant to the cloud, and has continued to face stiff competition. That includes rivals Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.com (CRM), all of which have continued to boost their internet-based software offerings.Catz said the company's numbers last year were impacted by a change in the licensing model that gave the impression of slower growth. ""As this evens out, I think we will start to see cloud acceleration that is very significant. But I don't want to time that right now.""Oracle shares gained 0.4% to close at 46.05 on the stock market today. They have fallen 11% since the company's disappointing earnings release last month.

133,ORCL,"General Electric (GE) is staying the course on its digitally driven strategy started under outgoing CEO Jeff Immelt, as the Dow component on Tuesday unveiled a suite of Big Data tools and software that can transform how companies manage and service their machinery.At an event in Berlin, the industrial heavyweight unveiled digital products that allow utility companies, wind farms and oil drillers to analyze machine data in real time, identify leakages, enhance forecasts, increase productivity and even create new business opportunities.GE said the new offerings could help customers predict potential problems rather than merely react to them, thereby reducing costs and eliminating idle time.GE on Monday announced its first new leader in 16 years after nearly a decade of shedding its finance and media businesses and infusing core units like aviation, power systems, transportation and energy with technology.Underpinning these efforts is the company's Predix cloud-based software platform, a key initiative of Immelt that outfits industrial machinery with sensors that collect and monitor data, which can then be analyzed both on job sites and through remote servers. GE estimates the so-called industrial internet will be a $225 billion market by 2020, fueling massive gains in productivity and innovation.GE Vice Chair Beth Comstock told reporters in Germany that the company won't retreat from its software push under John Flannery, who will take over as CEO on Aug. 1.""I don't know how you don't go digital as an industrial company,"" she said, according to Bloomberg. ""John Flannery knows this firsthand. He's very aware of what's happening in other businesses.

135,ORCL,"Veeva Systems (VEEV) is a ""coiled spring"" ready to jump, thanks to several growth initiatives.XThat's the contention of Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis, who says Veeva stock has had a mighty run so far in 2018. He adds the cloud-computing firm that focuses on software applications for the pharmaceutical and life-sciences fields has room for further growth.In using the term ""coiled spring"" to describe Veeva's outlook, Davis says the future looks even more prosperous when 2019 comes into view.""Veeva has several growth initiatives in process that range from significant new feature upsells to adjacent customer breadth moves,"" Davis said in a recent note to clients.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Veeva has more than 600 customers in the life-sciences industry, ranging from Big Pharma firms to emerging biotechs.It counts companies like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) among its customers.Veeva went public in October 2013 at $20 a share, and hit an all-time high of 78.28 on March 8. It managed to avoid most of the carnage in this week's sell-off and shares were down 1% Friday to 74.30.Veeva stock broke out of a 38-week consolidation period with a buy point of 68.17 on Feb. 28, a day after the company posted better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter and gave guidance that crushed Wall Street's estimates for the current fiscal year.For its current fiscal year, which will end next Jan. 31, Veeva expects to earn an adjusted $1.32 a share, up 43% year over year, on sales of $818 million. That's up 19%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling adjusted profit of $1.01 a share on $807 million in sales.Veeva's growth initiatives are likely to reach sufficient scale this year to provide a path to upside to 2019 estimates, Davis said.""If this scenario is correct, investors will figure this out sometime this summer or fall at which point Veeva shares could sustainably move higher,"" he said. Davis rates Veeva stock as buy.Veeva began in 2007 with a software application to help pharmaceutical sales reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches. Today, that product for customer relationship management — called Veeva CRM — dominates the drug market with roughly 80% user share. It's now part of Veeva's Commercial Cloud business.A big driver of the company's business today is Veeva Vault, which launched in 2011. It was created to organize all content involved in clinical drug trials — documents, patient data and work flow. Vault products now cover the clinical, quality, regulatory and commercial aspects of drug development, manufacturing and sale. It has penetrated less than 10% of the market, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri told Investor's Business Daily.Veeva also has discovered that its Vault offering is useful for other heavily regulated industries, such as the chemical and consumer product sectors.The company's offering for companies outside of life sciences is called Vault QualityOne.

And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

147,ORCL,"Stocks held modest gains Thursday as emerging markets soared. Gold rose as Bitcoin tumbled on South Korea crackdown news.X SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) led with a 0.2% gain, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) added 0.1% each in the stock market today.Emerging market outperformed with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) up 0.8%. The Buenos Aires Merval Index leapt 3.5%, South Korea's Kospi Composite Index rose 1.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.9%. Emerging country ETFs on the move included iShares MSCI South Korea Capped (EWY), which gapped up nearly 2% to retake its 50-day moving average, iShares MSCI Taiwan Capped (EWT), up 1.6% and iShares China Large-Cap (FXI), up 0.9%.Leveraged emerging market plays surged: Direxion Daily MSCI Emerging Markets Bull 3X Shares (EDC), Direxion Daily MSCI Emerging Markets Bull 3X Shares (YINN) and Direxion Daily MSCI Brazil Bull 3X ETF (BRZU) each scored gains of more than 2%.Among sector plays, metals miners, semiconductor and home construction advanced.

SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) rose 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. Both funds reclaimed their 50-day lines Tuesday and are on track for a ninth straight advance.Bitcoin, meantime, has endured several sharp drops during the past seven sessions. The digital currency tumbled 10% to $13,902.11, according to CoinDesk, after rising to $15,470.44 earlier. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) slumped 7% to 2025.98, on track for a second straight decline. It's now 42% off its Dec. 19 intraday peak. South Korea announced it would crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges.Artificial intelligence stocks have taken center stage as the year wraps up, so it's no big surprise that software has rallied too.But it's not just the typical AI-related names such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce.com (CRM) that have outperformed. Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Red Hat (RHT) and ServiceNow (NOW) have each surged more than 70% this year.Better yet, an ETF that holds these hot AI stocks could soon present a buy opportunity: iShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) is looking for support near its 50-day moving average. If it finds support and stages a solid move above the 50-day line, that would set up a possible entry.IGV has pulled back to and rebounded off the support line for most of this year. In its prior test, shares advanced 11% from a late September bounce off the 50-day to their Nov. 28 high.The 16-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P North American Technology Software Index, has gathered $1.1 billion in assets. As of Dec. 26, the U.S. accounted for 98% of the 63-stock portfolio, with Canada contributing the remaining 2%. Application software represented nearly 51% of assets, systems software 35%, home entertainment software 13% and technology hardware, storage and peripherals less than 1%.The top four holdings: Microsoft, Adobe Systems (ADBE), Salesforce and Oracle (ORCL) each take a position north of 8%. Activision Blizzard is fifth with a 7% weighting. The top five stocks account for just above 40% of the portfolio.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.Microsoft, which is trading just below an 86.30 flat-base buy point first cleared Dec. 15, has advanced nearly 40% this year. The Xbox maker and Amazon (AMZN) recently teamed up to offer Gluon, a software platform that lets users develop apps with artificial intelligence.IGV has run up 42.1% year to date through Dec. 26, according to Morningstar Direct, well ahead of the S&P 500's 22.1% gain. The ETF's respective average annual returns of 20.1%, 11.6% and 12.7% for the past five, 10 and 15 years also beat the benchmark index's 16%, 8.3% and 9.9% gains for the same periods.IGV sports a 0.48% expense ratio.Wednesday's pick, SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) remains in a potential buy zone from a rebound off its 50-day moving average line.RELATED:Apple Tests Support, Bitcoin Drops; Big Dividend Play Near BuyWal-Mart, Apple Lead These 4 Dow Giants Just Below Buy PointsApple Drags Dow Into The Red; Will Bitcoin Resurge This Week?

148,ORCL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials fell slightly vs. fair value Friday morning. Nasdaq 100 futures were fractionally higher.XThe S&P 500 index and other major averages soared Thursday on strong earnings from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO). Wal-Mart and Cisco, along with General Motors, are older companies that don't show much headline growth, but they've been big winners on expectations for hot growth. Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) are companies that are a little further along on the process.Wal-Mart, Cisco Systems and General Motors are all companies that are seeing flat to declining revenue in their main businesses, but have strategies to transition into growth markets and the resources to carry out those plans.Wal-Mart reported a 2% earnings-per-share gain in the third quarter, defying views for a 1% drop. Revenue growth accelerated to 4%. Those numbers aren't thrilling. But U.S. online sales surged 50%.Investors increasingly see Wal-Mart as a worthy rival to Amazon (AMZN). While many traditional retailers are struggling just to manage the decline, Wal-Mart has moved aggressively with acquisitions and initiatives to tackle Amazon head-on. Wal-Mart may not dethrone Amazon, but there's strong confidence that it will survive and likely thrive.Wal-Mart shares surged 10.9% to 99.62 in Thursday's stock market trading. Shares were already well-extended from an 82.09 buy point cleared in early October. Wal-Mart stock has spiked 44% so far in 2017, making it one of the top performers on the Dow Jones industrial average. Amazon is up nearly 52%.Cisco late Wednesday reported its seventh straight quarter of declining revenue vs. a year earlier, while earnings were flat. But Cisco sees 1%-3% revenue growth in the current quarter. In its latest quarter, Cisco reported a 10% gain in deferred revenue, as the networking hardware giant shifts into software and services. Like fellow Dow component Wal-Mart, Cisco has used its hefty cash flow to fund acquisitions in growth areas.Cisco shot up 5.2% to 35.88 on Thursday, hitting its best levels in nearly 17 years and gapping back above a buy point.General Motors earnings and sales are declining, with U.S. auto demand falling from record levels and GM exiting Europe and some other international markets.Yet GM stock has shot up 25% in 2017, with almost all of that gain coming since late August.GM has been faring relatively well vs. rivals, helped by its more-profitable SUVs and pickup trucks. But more important, investors believe GM will survive the transition to electric cars and autonomous vehicles. GM has poured a lot of money into both areas, with Wall Street analysts generally viewing the venerable automaker as among the leaders in those fields. General Motors aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2026, CEO Mary Barra said Wednesday.Tesla (TSLA) has an early lead in electric vehicles, but once again is suffering huge problems with rolling out new cars, this time the Model 3 that is supposed to be a mass-market vehicle.Microsoft and Oracle have been making a transition toward a cloud-centric world.Microsoft revenue growth has picked up from 1% to 8% and 13% before cooling a touch to 12% in the latest period, as Microsoft Azure and other cloud-related offerings boom even in the face of industry leader Amazon Web Services. Microsoft is up 34% in 2017Oracle's top-line growth has accelerated for the past three quarters. Oracle stock is up 28% in 2017, but have stalled since plunging on Sept. 15 following Oracle's last quarterly report.Meanwhile, Walt Disney (DIS) is trying to make that transition. It's relying on blockbuster films and theme parks to keep cash flowing while touting its upcoming ESPN and Disney streaming offerings. But shares are down slightly in 2017 as investors aren't sure if those over-the-top channels will be big winners, especially as traditional cable and broadcasting revenues come under increasing pressure.RELATED:The Big Picture: Apple Ends Slide; This Index Makes Bullish MoveStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

149,ORCL,"Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) earned high marks from Wall Street analysts for its presentations at the SC17 supercomputing conference in Denver this week.In a report, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said he is ""incrementally more bullish"" on Nvidia's prospects in the data center, gaming and automotive markets after the chipmaker's investor update at the show. He reiterated his outperform rating on Nvidia stock and price target of 240.Nvidia shares added 0.7% to close at 214.18 on the stock market today.At SC17, Nvidia said its Tesla V100 graphics processing unit, based on the company's Volta architecture, has been chosen by every major cloud computing company for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing applications.""Volta is the world's most powerful platform for AI and HPC, and will allow the world's top minds in scientific research to push the limit on what's possible in areas like drug discovery, alternative fuel sources and predicting natural disasters,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a news release. ""With Volta now in data centers and clouds around the world, a new wave of innovation is underway that will have an incredible impact across society.""Cloud computing providers such as Alibaba (BABA) Cloud, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, Baidu (BIDU) Cloud, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, Oracle (ORCL) Cloud and Tencent (TCEHY) Cloud have announced Volta-based cloud services, Nvidia said.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is currently ranked No. 8 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.B. Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis said he is left more confident in Nvidia's data center growth after the company's presentations. Nvidia estimates the total addressable market in data center chips to be worth $30 billion.In a note to clients, Ellis maintained his buy rating on Nvidia and stock price target of 270.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann also came away from the show with a good feeling about Nvidia. He reiterated his buy rating on the stock.""GPU (graphics processing unit) acceleration trends in AI/HPC and data center are secular, powerful and devastating for CPU (central processing unit) incumbents,"" Mosesmann said in a report. ""Volta is at the early stages of an inflection point with broad implications for the industry and investors.""RELATED:Nvidia Upgraded As Analyst Admits Being Wrong On The Stock

150,ORCL,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

Congress is expected to vote on the legislation this week.Bitcoin futures were at $19,230 on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), near session lows but up from Friday. CME Group (CME) Bitcoin futures opened above $20,000 in their debut but then pulled back $19,390.Walt Disney is one of three Dow stocks to claim buy points on Friday.Disney climbed 0.6% to 111.27 on Friday, closing above a 110.93 double-bottom entry after a few intraday moves above that level this month. Disney jumped 6.75% for the week as it agreed to buy key Fox entertainment assets and more for $66 billion, including assumed debt.""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will reap an estimated $220 million this weekend in the U.S. on top of $45 million in its Thursday's night openings. That's above Disney's estimate for $205 million.Disney is gearing up to launch a stand-alone subscription streaming service in 2019, with Star Wars films and a new live-action Star Wars series among the key content.Disney's upcoming streaming service, and its planned removal of Marvel and Star Wars content from Netflix, will make Netflix more reliant than ever on its own original content. But Netflix is increasingly becoming a must-have for households, even if they subscribe to other streaming or traditional pay-TV services. Netflix is a major reason why many traditional media players are scrambling.Netflix shares rose 0.3% to 190.12 in Friday's stock market trading. Netflix is in a flat base with a 204.48 buy point, but is currently trading below its 50-day moving average. A strong retaking of that support level in high volume could offer a buying opportunity.Comcast held out better than most media and entertainment stocks, but finally broke down in September before finding a bottom in early November. Comcast has formed a handle in a six-month consolidation, creating a 40.83 buy point.Comcast's Relative Strength line has been weak for months, as the stock has retreated while the S&P 500 index continued to march higher.Comcast is the leading U.S. cable and internet provider. It also owns NBCUniversal, making it a major content creator.Verizon is the No. 1 wireless operator. Telecom giants are often seen as distinct from cable and media stocks, but there is growing overlap. Americans, especially teens and young adults, increasingly use their smartphone as their screen for content. Also,Verizon offers pay-TV and internet service via Fios. Verizon also plans to launch 5G wireless broadband in select U.S. markets, competing with Comcast's landline broadband.Verizon bought Yahoo earlier this year following its purchase of AOL. Verizon owns Huffington Post and Tech Crunch.Verizon cleared a 51.28 bottoming-base buy point on Dec. 4, but then fell back down. But the Dow industrials component retook that entry on Dec. 11, closing Friday at 52.67.AT&T has an even better claim as a media claim than Verizon. In addition to being a wireless giant, AT&T owns the DirecTV satellite service, along with the streaming DirecTV Now. AT&T also is trying to buy Time Warner (TWX), which would make a major content player, with CNN, TNT, HBO and more.The Justice Department is fighting to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, saying it would be anti-competitive.AT&T has cleared a 37.64 cup-with-handle buy point last week, ending Friday at 38.24. But there are definitely reasons to be cautious. AT&T fell to a two-year low on Nov. 6. It's rallied since then but the stock has no prior uptrend before the current consolidation. Shares have closed above their 200-day moving average for the first time in eight months.CSX CEO Hunter Harrison died Saturday from complications from an undisclosed illness. Harrison took an unexpected medical leave late Thursday, a move that sent the rail stock plunging 7.6%, below a recent buy point.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tax-Cut Bill Ignites Stocks, But Breakouts ScarceGOP Takes Bigger Bite From Apple, Microsoft, Google To Seal Trump Tax CutsWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?

153,ORCL,"The Nasdaq ran ahead of the major market averages Friday, up 1.2% as rising optimism regarding a GOP tax reform effort helped drive blue chip tech names including Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and United Technologies (UTX) to the head of the Nasdaq 100.X Electronics makers and staffing companies, metals and drug distributors were among the many industries to post gains of better than 3% during the session.The advance was sufficient to lift the Nasdaq past its Nov. 28 peak to its first new high in three weeks. The S&P 500 gained  0.9%, also scratching off a new high as Under Armour (UA) took the index's largest gain, surging 9% after Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold.That put Under Armour shares back above their 10-week moving average and up 32% from a November low, although still deep in a 20-month correction.Railroad CSX (CSX), Barbie-maker Mattel (MAT) and chipmaker Oracle (ORCL) turned in the S&P 500's worst losses, down 8%, 5% and 4%, respectively.The Dow ran not quite as hot as its peer indexes, up 0.6%, but plenty strong enough to once again make news highs. Intel was the leader, up 3% on what appeared to be primarily a tax plan-related move.Small caps also did well with the Russell 2000 up 1.5%.Intel's gain put shares in a buy range on a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average. The rebound occurred in only modest volume, and the chart pattern is also a flat base, so investors have the option of waiting to see whether shares climb past the 47.40 buy point.Microsoft took out its 86.30 buy point, rising nearly 3%  in powerful trade, moving to a new high but remaining well within buy range.Bitcoin drew heavy attention, with the cryptocurrency jumping 10% — back above $17,800. Related stocks were also busy, with Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) up 14%, bringing its gain since the start of the month to 79%. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) also vaulted 14%. Marathon Patent Group (MARA) thumped out a 6% gain and bitcoin friendly online retailer Overstock.com (OSTK) soared 11%.Nearly one-third IBD 50 names scored gains of 2% or better.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the S&P 500 inched 0.1% higher.X Among the Dow Jones industrial components, Walt Disney (DIS) reversed from early losses to rise 0.7% after reaching a $66.1 billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets. The media company is gearing up for a streaming content fight with FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), which rose 0.5% and 1%, respectively. Netflix was attempting to reclaim a 190.05 cup-with-handle entry.On the downside, Verizon Communications (VZ) was the day's early big loser, falling 1.3%. The stock remains in buy range from a 51.28 flat-base entry.Leading retailers were mostly higher in the stock market today, after November's retail sales handily beat the consensus estimate, coming in at 0.8% vs. 0.3% forecasts. The sales beat reinforces sustained strength in the economy. Michael Kors (KORS) advanced 1.2% and is well-extended from a 46.36 flat-base entry. Lululemon (LULU) moved up 1% and is extended from a 64.91 buy point. The stock was also upgraded from hold to buy at Deutsche Bank.Among companies reporting earnings, tech companies Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL) will report after the close Thursday. Adobe has been a top big-cap stock in 2017. Shares are 12% above a recent 157.99 flat-base entry that was gapped above on Oct. 19. The stock recently found solid support at its 50-day line.

Microsoft rebounded from just above its 50-day moving average starting on Dec. 5.The stock rose 0.3% in Thursday's premarket.Microsoft is seeing huge growth in cloud-computing services, moving the needle as its legacy PC-based Windows business stagnates. Microsoft on Wednesday rolled out new features for its Bing search service powered by artificial intelligence, including one that highlights reputable sources.The other half of the Wintel duopoly also is moving past PCs finally, finding strong demand for its chips in data centers — partly a reflection of cloud-computing demand. And Intel acquired Mobileye last year to provide fuel for its autonomous-driving efforts.Intel rose 1 cent to 43.34 on Wednesday, continuing to close above its rising 50-day moving average. It's a critical test, especially with most leading chipmakers trading below that key support area. If Intel rises strongly in high volume, it could offer a new buying opportunity. The chip giant also boasts a 47.40 entry from its ongoing flat-base consolidation.Intel was not yet active Thursday.Apple rose 0.3% to 172.27 on Wednesday. The iPhone titan needs a few more days to complete its flat base, or base-on-base formation. But if it does, it would have a 176.34 buy point.Apple edged up 0.2% Thursday.Apple will invest $390 million in Finisar to help the latter revamp a Texas plant, the companies said Wednesday. Finisar will make vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers used in the iPhone X to power its Face ID identification software and other apps.Finisar shot up 23% to 23.70 during the regular session, then rose 2.7% in premarket trading Thursday.Finisar's gain was seen as coming at the expense of Lumentum. Lumentum shares plunged as low as 44.05 intraday, but closed down just 2.85% at 50.28, near session highs.Lumentum rose 2.6% early Thursday, nearly recouping Wednesday's loss.The maker of adhesives and industrial coatings and systems earned $1.38 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter vs. $1.39 a year earlier. But that beat views for $1.32, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue swelled 13% to $573.9 million, well above views for $543 million. Nordson also gave first-quarter guidance that was well above analyst forecasts.Nordson shares shot up 11% in premarket trading to 141. That strongly suggests that Nordson will retake a 127.71 cup-with-handle buy point and hit a record high at Thursday's open.Nordson rose 2.2% to 126.91 on Wednesday, retaking its 50-day line.The stock's Relative Strength Line has been lagging since late May, reflecting Nordson's underperformance vs. the rising S&P 500 index over that span.RELATED:The Big Picture: Are These Leading Growth Stocks Acting Well?Disney's Disturbance In The Force, Adobe Earnings: Investing Action Plan2 Drug Stocks Among These 3 Leaders Taking Out Buy PointsDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

156,ORCL,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

159,ORCL,"After years of strong revenue growth and hefty losses, Workday (WDAY) has reached a major milestone. The cloud-based enterprise software firm unexpectedly reported its second straight quarter of positive earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter. Wall Street now sees increasing profitability as the company grabs market share from giants Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).X On June 1, analysts expect Workday to report that fiscal Q1 earnings surged 220% to 16 cents a share excluding various items. Revenue likely rose 35% to $467.33 million. After a 12-cent profit in fiscal 2017, the company's first year in the black, analysts project EPS to accelerate to 51 cents, 81 cents, and $1.32 over the next three years.Workday provides human capital management and payroll software and has recently expanded into financial applications. Its investment in new products and features and its ability to maintain a high customer-satisfaction rate bodes well, according to Credit Suisse analyst Michael Nemeroff.""Our subscription revenue estimates imply continued market-share gains in both the HCM and Financial applications markets due to WDAY's best-of-breed capabilities and competitive advantages in its large and growing total addressable market,"" Nemeroff said in an April report.
"
160,ORCL,"Workday mostly targets larger companies, boasting FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) as two premier clients. But it also serves retail giants Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) as well as big biotech Amgen (AMGN).
"
161,ORCL,"Workday finished January with 1,528 human capital management customers, including 136 Fortune 500 companies.
"
162,ORCL,"Existing top-tier customers are contributing to Workday's growth as many are signing contracts for additional product offerings.""There are many cases in the first several years of (our human-resources product) where we won the HR deal, but they don't want to touch payroll and now our payroll attach rate is over 60%,"" CEO Aneel Bhusri said on Workday's fiscal Q4 conference call on Feb. 27.Bhusri noted on that call that Netflix is one of five Fortune 500 companies that has signed up for Workday's new financial performance management software.""We are really well-positioned to run the tables within that enterprise (client) when they do move their transactional platform as well,"" he said.Credit Suisse calls Workday the leading vendor in cloud HCM applications ""for upper midmarket and large enterprises.""
"
163,ORCL,"Workday has reorganized to better accommodate companies of different sizes. The company has divided its North America business into two groups — large enterprise and medium enterprise — from the account executive level to the sales and services levels.IBD'S TAKE: Workday is a member of Leaderboard, a list of top growth stocks at or near buy points curated by our markets team. To find more fast-growing names with actionable trading opportunities, take a free trial.After hitting a nine-month low of 65.79 on Dec. 30, shares closed Friday at 99.99, near their best levels since their early-2014 all-time high. Workday shares cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 92.56 buy point in heavy volume on May 15. The stock is now extended from the 5% buy range, but if it pulls back in light volume — as some leaders do — it could provide investors with another chance to purchase shares.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of 99, yet it's still ranked seventh in the highly rated enterprise software industry group.Workday says that continued into the most recently reported quarter. ""The win rates against SAP and Oracle were as high as they have been in recent memory,"" CEO Bhusri said on the Q4 call.Despite expectations for strong revenue growth and margin expansion over the next few years, Credit Suisse and Benchmark both initiated coverage on Workday's stock in April with a neutral, or hold, rating.""We are wary of intense competition in its core target Human Capital Management (HCM) market, which continues to drive pricing pressure, unfavorable billings terms and lengthening sales cycle,"" Benchmark analyst Yun Kim said in an April 26 report. But Kim did highlight Workday's successful execution, citing ""strong product positioning and superior customer references.""Meanwhile, Nemeroff said there are not yet signs of ""accelerated momentum"" in large clients for Workday's financial management software, due to the risk and complexity of switching core financial applications to the cloud.But he notes that IDC projects the cloud-based financial applications software market will reach $9.5 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 12%.Workday could adjust its outlook on the next quarterly call, but last forecast fiscal 2018 revenue of $2.005 billion to $2.025 billion, or growth of 27% to 29%. That would make it the second pure-play software-as-a-service provider to top $2 billion in annual revenue, only after Salesforce (CRM).
"
164,ORCL,"Ask Wall Street analysts to name possible catalysts for a rise in big-cap technology stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), and near the top on most lists would be Trump administration plans to allow companies to bring foreign profits into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate.Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama.The proposed changes on ""repatriated"" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress.""A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved,"" Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. ""I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable.""Even so, one worry is that the overseas ""tax holiday"" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms.Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst.""If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know,"" UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report.There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track.""There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America,"" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. ""We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs.""Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings."" Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas.President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate.The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate.The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all.However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said.The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, ""Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases.""UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a ""tracking mechanism"" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place.S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations.The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says.While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas.If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it ""expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return.""In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund ""transformative"" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA).Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets.Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

On Wednesday, the Apple iPhone supplier shares shot up as high as 90.49, but closed at 85.76, just a 1.1% gain and near session lows. That's not great action, and investors should be cautious. However, shares are well within the 5% chase zone from the entry point.What sparked Wednesday's big move? Analog Devices reported strong earnings and bullish guidance before the market open, though revenue was essentially in line.Analog Devices has been touted as a likely big winner from the upcoming Apple iPhone 8, due out later this year.As for Apple itself, shares dipped 0.6% on Wednesday, continuing to trade tightly over the last few weeks, close to record highs. Apple does not have a potential buy point current after a long run.Analog Devices has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 99% of all stocks based on a variety of IBD proprietary fundamental and technical data. Big-time winners tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of their runs.Paylocity, the lone non-chipmaker highlighted here, is a cloud-based human resources software firm.Paylocity cleared a 45.71 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern on May 25, and shares have remained above the entry since then. Shares fell intraday Wednesday but closed up 0.2% to 46.85.Other cloud-based HR software peers include Paycom (PAYC) and Workday (WDAY). Paycom has been hovering around a three-weeks-tight follow-on buy point, while Workday is modestly extended from a breakout. Workday, which competes against Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), is expected to report a 220% EPS gain late Thursday.Paylocity has a 97 Composite Rating.The memory chipmaker cleared a 29.97 flat base buy point on Tuesday, then edged up 0.2% to 30.77 on Wednesday, still well within buy range. Industry demand and pricing is strong, boosting profits of other memory chip players such as Samsung Electronics and Western Digital (WDC).Micron's CR Rating is an 89, reflecting a poor run of earnings until recently. Memory chip makers' fortunes tend to be highly cyclical, so stocks often start to move on indications of improving industry fundamentals before big earnings come in. Micron is reporting strong results now.Marvell cleared a 16.82 buy point on May 25, then reported strong earnings after the closing bell that session.

167,ORCL,"Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled Wednesday a new cloud service dubbed Azure IoT Edge, which can be used for industrial applications, as General Electric (GE) pushes its reinvention as a digital industrial leader.Microsoft's new technology delivers artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and advanced data analytics via the cloud to local computing devices. It will help companies increase operational efficiency or respond more quickly to events like machinery glitches, while potentially slashing their tech-related costs.Meanwhile, GE's Predix cloud-based operating system software allows companies to add intelligence to their equipment, monitor for problems, and enhance efficiency and savings.GE pointed out that it has sharpened its focus on the industrial IoT (Internet of Things) over the past year — and partnered with Microsoft in July 2016 in pursuit of that goal.""In this partnership, we are bringing GE's Predix platform for industrial IoT to Azure, to give our customers access to Microsoft's global cloud footprint,"" a GE spokeswoman told IBD via email. ""We are also leveraging applications available on Azure, combined with Predix, to bring these joint capabilities to our industrial customers.""She noted that GE acquired machine learning company Wise.io in November last year to accelerate development of advanced AI offerings on the Predix platform.Shares of GE closed down 0.8% at 28.69 on the stock market today, after Boeing (BA) halted test flights of its 737 Max jets due to an issue with engines from CFM, a joint venture of GE and France's Safran. Microsoft edged up 0.4% to 69.31. GE, Microsoft and Boeing are all components of the Dow Jones industrial average, which slipped 0.2% Wednesday.The industrial internet market is being eyed by both tech heavyweights such as Microsoft and industrial stalwarts like GE, Honeywell (HON) and Siemens (SIEGY).By GE's own estimate, that market is poised to be worth $225 billion by 2020, topping $206 billion for the enterprise cloud computing market and $170 billion for the consumer IoT market. Major providers of cloud infrastructure include Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM) and Salesforce (CRM).That growth potential has fueled GE's ambitions to become a hybrid tech-industrial powerhouse.""If you went to bed last night as an industrial company, you're going to wake up this morning as a software and analytics company,"" Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric CEO, said in 2015.While Microsoft missed sales forecasts in the March quarter, the tech giant highlighted cloud services as a pocket of revenue strength amid broad global demand.RELATED:How GE Could Become The Apple Of The Industrial InternetGE Sees Digital Revenue More Than Doubling To $15 Billion By 2020Amazon Cloud Services Under Growing Threat From Microsoft, Google, IBM

Salesforce.com gave guidance that implied 5% to 6% billings growth, a sales metric, for the first quarter.""In a seasonally weak Q1, against difficult comps, the onus may lie more heavily on margin expansion than billings growth to push the story forward,"" said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""However, past Q1 we see multiple positive top-line catalysts.""""The high end of guidance for billings growth is 6.4%, and we expect the company to post reported billings growth above the high end of guidance,"" said Bhavan Suri, a William Blair analyst, in a report.

170,ORCL,"Dow component IBM (IBM) stock plunged Wednesday following a first-quarter earnings report that showed its 20th straight quarter of year-over-year declines.IBM stock fell 4.9% to close at 161.69 on the stock market today. At least three analysts lowered their stock-price target on the company.After the market close Tuesday, IBM reported revenue of $18.16 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $18.39 billion and down 3% year over year, as the one-time tech icon continues to struggle with a multiyear transition. It reported adjusted earnings of $2.38 a share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.35, up 1%.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani lowered his price target on IBM to 180 from 185, and maintained a sector perform rating.While he expects enterprise information technology to grow about 3% in 2017, ""We expect IBM's revenue to decline in the low single digits due to the increasing prevalence of public cloud products and services,"" Daryanani wrote in a research note Wednesday. He believes competitive challenges are emerging from companies seeking to build a business model similar to IBM's, notably fellow Dow component Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (Oracle) and Dell-EMC (DVMT).""We would not be surprised to see Cisco become the next major manufacturer move toward this model,"" Daryanani wrote.Beyond Cisco and Dell-EMC, he said, there are others attempting to recreate the IBM model, he wrote.""Oracle's purchase of Sun Microsystems is transforming the software vendor into a systems player,"" he wrote.  IBM also faces competition from vendors offering next-generation cloud-based services, including Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).IBD'S TAKE: IBM stock is down 11% from a 52-week high of 182.79 set on Feb. 16. IBM has a weak Composite Rating of 41, meaning the stock is topped by 59% of all stocks in the last six months. For better-performing stocks, take a look at IBD reports on tech leaders.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White referred to IBM's earnings report as a ""lackluster performance."" White lowered his price target on IBM to 200 from 215, but maintained a buy rating.""Given the combination of the seasonally weakest quarter of the year, continued investments and costs associated with new systems products that ramp later in 2017, IBM delivered a lackluster performance in the first quarter,"" White wrote. However, he added, ""IBM's strategic imperatives showed strong growth and the company continues to expand its cloud reach.""""We believe the turnaround is still intact and today's weakness represents another post-earnings buying opportunity,"" White wrote.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich lowered his price target on IBM to 167 from 185, with a neutral rating.""The quarter was worse than we expected in both gross margin and stock reaction aftermarket,"" Milunovich wrote in a research note.

172,ORCL,"Many mutual funds share the same holdings as TCW Select Equities, but most haven't performed nearly as well as this mutual fund under Craig Blum's management.The $907 million fund (TGCEX) is up 12.62% so far this year vs. returns of 6.07% for the S&P 500 and 8.63% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. In the past 10 years, the fund returned an average annual 8.20% vs. 7.40% for its peers and 7.08% for the S&P 500.How do Blum and his investment team produce such results? Their investment approach sounds similar to some other funds, so the difference must be in the execution.Part of that comes from the fund's concentrated portfolio. It holds only about 30 stocks and has about half of the fund's assets invested in the top 10 holdings. Top holdings as of March 31 were Alphabet (GOOGL) at nearly 7% of assets, Facebook (FB) 6% and Visa (V) 6%. Alphabet's stock has risen 12% this year. Facebook is up 27% this year and 13% above a cup-with-handle base buy point of 129.37. Visa is up 18% and 9% above a flat-base buy point of 84.06.Despite the heavier-than-average weightings, the mutual fund has a relatively low turnover rate of 14% vs. a norm of near 100% for stock funds.Blum's team selects quality large- and midcap stocks with the ""most unique and extraordinary growth opportunities available that are fundamentally misperceived by the market, and for that reason mispriced longer term,"" Blum explains.Underpinning stock holdings' potential are long-term revenue opportunities that flow from potentially huge addressable markets. Blum also looks at the business model for ""some sort of unfair advantage that puts a wide competitive moat around the business,"" he points out.TCW Select Equities focuses on fast-growing companies, but valuation matters. ""Valuation is the third pillar of what we do. It is best to avoid overpaying for a business,"" Blum said.He finds that deep and efficient markets are good at pricing-in consensus expectations and extrapolating near-term experience. ""What markets get wrong all the time are addressable revenue opportunities,"" he said. ""So markets misjudge how large an opportunity can be for a business, and they often misjudge competitive advantage.""A case in point is the story of Salesforce.com (CRM), which the fund started buying in 2005 and is now its fifth-largest holding. ""People thought it was never going to be anything more than sales force automation, Oracle (ORCL) is going to kill them, PeopleSoft is going to kill them,"" said Blum. ""Well, it wasn't just sales force automation. It was marketing and another segment of the service business, it was artificial intelligence and the predictive cloud. The entire software industry became the end market.""That said, the fund is not immune to volatility and significantly underperformed the market and its peers in 2016. TGCEX lost 8.07% last year vs. gains of 3.23% by its peers and 11.96% by the S&P 500.Among the culprits were a heavy exposure to the health care sector since early 2016 and the markets' favoritism of high dividend-paying stocks. In addition, Blum points out that there was asymmetry in the market in that it did not reward much for a strong fundamental story, yet any hint of chance of bad news would send otherwise-healthy stocks significantly lower. Also, the fund had little exposure to the postelection reflationary trade sectors such as financials, energy, materials and industrials.But as 2017 rolled around, markets started to realize that President Trump's proposals for pro-growth reforms may not happen as quickly as expected. ""You started to see the Trump reflation trade unwind,"" Blum said.In addition, the U.S. economy proved to be more robust to tolerate a Fed tightening, compared with a year ago. And markets became more comfortable pricing quality fundamentals and growth, he said, ""which is our wheelhouse.""""And so, you're seeing sectors like IT and health care, that were punished so heavily last year, begin to outperform,"" he said.One of the strong performers has been Mobileye (MBLY), a developer of software for camera-based advanced driver-assistance systems, which is being acquired by Intel (INTC). Mobileye's stock has jumped 62% this year.Blum says Mobileye is a good example of a business where Intel saw value whereas public markets didn't. ""They're the share leader in vision-based systems in your car. ... They're winning upwards of 90% of all business out of the auto OEMs.""Another stock he likes is Priceline Group (PCLN), of which the fund holds more than 4%. ""North of 70% of profits come from their European brand, which is Booking.com. Priceline is a dominant and proven online travel agent.""Blum says that the global online travel market is still only 11% to 12% penetrated, so there's a lot of runway for growth. Priceline's stock is up about 23% in 2017.One of the better plays on higher bond yields is Charles Schwab (SCHW), points out Blum. ""We still think it's sort of misunderstood as a high-quality business and asset-gathering machine, that also gives you lots of upside if we do successfully bring interest rates higher over the next two-three years.""Only about 15% of Schwab's revenue comes from trading commissions, while approximately 45% of the business is made up of fees from the asset management branch and another 35% to 40% from net-interest margins, Blum explained. ""So, it's a business that operates a very plain-vanilla bank as well.""Schwab's stock is up a just 1.6% this year and has been nearing its 50-day average in recent days.ServiceNow (NOW), a developer of cloud-based IT software, has gained 19% year to date and is a stock that Blum has been buying since 2014. ""This is another one that's poorly understood, we believe, by a lot of folks out there. It's a rapidly growing business. ... They're driving better results at dramatically lower cost for the end user.""Blum says that the number of use cases has expanded to not just IT service management, but also operations management, security management and many other tools. ""The reason it's performed well — it's because investors are slowly beginning to understand that the total addressable market that faces the company is much larger than once thought.""RELATED:This Top Mutual Fund Exploits Market Inefficiencies.

173,ORCL,"XAmazon (AMZN) is in a league of its own in the cloud-computing field but is being challenged by the fast-growing operations of other cloud service providers like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google.New data from Synergy Research Group, based on a reading of first-quarter reports, show that there are five major cloud infrastructure service providers that are growing more rapidly than Amazon Web Services, it said.Amazon Web Services, as the market leader, remains well ahead of the field, with a global market share that is holding steady at around 33%, Synergy said. Amazon, in its first-quarter report on Thursday, showed AWS revenue of $3.66 billion, up 43% year over year. The business is also highly lucrative for Amazon. Operating income of $890 million for AWS represented the bulk of its $1 billion in operating income overall.Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Alibaba (BABA) and Oracle (ORCL) all achieved growth rates in the first quarter ""that were substantially higher than that of AWS."" But AWS  is ""still comfortably bigger than the other five combined,"" Synergy said.It said Microsoft, Alphabet and Alibaba all achieved annual growth rates of 80% or more. Salesforce (CRM) and privately held Rackspace are the two other companies in the ranking of top cloud providers.Microsoft, in its first-quarter report,  said its cloud-computing platform, Azure, grew 93% year over year. The company did not disclose a revenue figure.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon hit a record high Friday, with Amazon Web Services playing a big role in why it beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.Synergy estimates that quarterly cloud infrastructure service revenue has now reached almost $10 billion, a figure that includes infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service as well as private cloud services. Synergy expects that to grow at more than 40% per year.While AWS, Microsoft and Google are the lead providers in IaaS/PaaS, IBM continues to lead in hosted private cloud, where Rackspace and some traditional IT service providers feature more prominently than they do in public cloud.Alphabet does not break out cloud revenue. It's included with its ""Google other revenues"" segment, which rose 49% year over year to $3.1 billion.Alibaba, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, said revenue from its cloud-computing unit rose 115% to $254 million. It reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on May 18.Amazon shares rose 0.7% to 924.99, moving above a 923.82 buy point but closing well off record intraday highs of 949.59.RELATED:Google Plays Catch-Up In The Cloud With Amazon And MicrosoftRed Hat's Big Bet On The Cloud Seen As A Revenue Driver

You can find a careful explanation of trading rules at Swing Trader, which also now tracks Alibaba Holdings.Juniper said first-quarter earnings rose 24% to 46 cents a share, with revenue rising 11% to $1.22 billion, edging analysts' estimates of 42-cents profit and revenue of $1.2 billion.""We believe cloud providers possess strong purchasing power and are beginning to impact gross margins,"" said Citigroup analyst Jim Suva, in a report. ""Investors will continue to be cautious on the gross margin story as product margins remain under pressure due to aggressive pricing, customer and product mixes and component headwinds.""George Notter, a Jefferies analyst, maintains a hold rating.""Guidance was a bit disappointing — particularly on profitability,"" Notter said in a report.Juniper said it expects June quarter revenue of about $1.28 billion and profit of 54 cents at its midpoint of guidance.RELATED:Can Dow's Cisco Take Arista's Best Customers With Software Bait?'Real Muscle' In Alliance Of Two Cisco Rivals, Says Analyst

191,ORCL,"Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have the most to gain if cloud computing evolves into an electricity-like service, while Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google cloud business could quadruple in size by 2020, Morgan Stanley said in a wide-ranging report issued Thursday.China's Alibaba Group (BABA) looms as the biggest potential share gainer in public cloud computing, the brokerage says, which also upped its price target on IBM (IBM) to 212 from 187 on views that its ""cloud strategy remains underappreciated.""IBM stock climbed 0.8% to close at 177.24 on the stock market today. Shares in Alibaba Group climbed 1.9% to 105.63, retaking a 104.67 buy point. Amazon edged up to 853.42, Alphabet ticked up to 870, a fresh high, while Microsoft lost 0.2% to 64.64 at the close.On the one hand, Morgan Stanley says corporate spending on public cloud computing services could slow after 2020, after enterprises move 50% of business workloads to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and other providers.The report says, however, that ""a more bullish view of public cloud suggests broader upside across cloud vendors. If public cloud is a transformational technology like electricity, usage broadens and workload growth accelerates, implying cloud stocks are widely undervalued today.""While AWS is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), where clients rent computing resources by the hour, Morgan Stanley's market definition includes cloud-based products such as Microsoft's Office 365. And, Morgan Stanley says Oracle (ORCL), SAP, Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW) and Workday (WDAY) will be significant players in public cloud.Here are some of Morgan Stanley's forecasts and views.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba has been taken off  IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. Leaderboard's roster still includes steel maker Nucor, Marvell Technology, Veeva Systems and other fast-growing companies.Alibaba should be the largest share-gainer, growing to $10 billion in cloud revenue, from $1 billion in 2016. AliCloud will make up 18% of Alibaba's sales in 2021, vs. 4% in fiscal 2017.Google will more than quadruple the size of its cloud business by 2020, growing to $9 billion in revenue.Software players Workday, ServiceNow and Salesforce.com have the highest gross margins in the group (82%-85%) followed by SAP (64%), and Oracle (55%).IBM is transforming to a cognitive and cloud platform through investments. Morgan Stanley forecasts a $3 billion public cloud business at IBM, growing at a 33% annual compound rate through 2020.RELATED:Why You Need To Look At Apple, FANG Stocks Right NowAlphabet Trots Out New Cloud Clients For Amazon, Microsoft To SeeGoogle Plays Catch-Up In The Cloud With Amazon And Microsoft

A spokesman for Trump's transition team didn't return requests seeking comment on the meeting.Venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a Facebook (FB) board member, was among Trump's lone prominent backer from the tech industry and is a member of his transition team.

On Friday, shares popped 3.5% to 88.49 in a four-month consolidation. Workday has run up sharply in 2017, but its relative strength line (the blue line in the chart below) remains weak.Piper Jaffray upgraded the provider of cloud-based human-resources applications to overweight on Friday, raising its price target for Workday to 100 from 78. Analyst Alex Zukin said his ""channel checks"" for Workday showed business momentum is ""the strongest in recent memory.""IBD'S TAKE: Investor's Business Daily boasts the IBD 50 of leading growth stocks, IPO Leaders, IBD Big Cap 20, Sector Leaders and Stock Spotlight — and you can go here to find all those growth stock lists and related articles.Workday boasts many large-scale customers, grabbing Wal-Mart (WMT) as a client, beating out software giant SAP. Workday also competes with Oracle in its HR niche.Revenue growth has trended down over the last several years, but was still up 34% to $409.6 million in the fiscal third quarter.Meanwhile, Workday is close to turning the corner on earnings. After consistent losses, Workday began alternating a quarter of slim adjusted earnings per share with a quarter of narrow losses.On Feb. 27, Workday reports earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ending in January. Wall Streets expects a 1-cent loss. But that would cap Workday's first annual profit, with analysts predicting only profits going forward, with strong growth for next several quarters.Of course, that's if all goes according to plan or better.

Shares are still just within the 5% chase zone from a 51.07 entry point cleared on Feb. 9. Its RS line is below old highs, which is not a great sign, but it's not way off those prior levels.Paycom is a cloud-based HR and payroll processing firm, but it mostly focuses on small- to mid-size companies and thus doesn't compete much with Workday. Its competitors include Paylocity (PCTY), Ultimate Software (ULTI) and Paychex (PAYX).Paycom is a rare fast-growing cloud-based software firm: it's decidedly profitable. Fourth-quarter earnings rose 80%, the third straight quarter of decelerating growth but it was well above estimates. Paycom also guided 2017 sales higher. Paycom's Feb. 8 earnings fueled the 13.4% spike into buying range the following session.RELATED:Splunk rose to 66.46 intraday, briefly topping a 65.85 buy point and its highest point since November 2015.

203,ORCL,"Workday (WDAY) stock plunged on Friday after the cloud software provider late Thursday reported fiscal Q3 revenue that topped views but forecast current-quarter revenue and billings that disappointed amid growing competition with Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).Beyond the weak guidance, on their earnings conference call Workday executives ""called out some political and macro uncertainty ... and it expressed a more cautious tone that we have not heard from Workday in several quarters,"" wrote William Blair analyst Justin Furby in a research note, and this from an analyst who rates the stock outperform.Workday stock cratered as much as 18% in the stock market today, hitting a nine-month low of 67.03. Shares ended the day down 12%, at 71.45.Workday is a possible takeover candidate, putting a floor under its valuation, says Ross MacMillan, an analyst at RBC Capital.""We think M&A valuation support is relevant,"" he said in his research report.MacMillan did not mention possible buyers. Oracle, SAP (SA)P, Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among companies that could have an interest in Workday, according to media reports over the years.IBD'S TAKE:  Many tech stocks have been hard hit in a second wave of selling since the Presidential election. But nontech companies, like Western Alliance Bancorp, are popping up in the IBD 50 and IBD Sector Leaders. ""We continue to think that Workday's best in class economics will convert into high margins over time,"" MacMillan wrote. ""Workday is an important SaaS (software-as-a-service) asset of scale and could have multiple suitors.""The M&A environment has been active among enterprise software companies. Oracle agreed to buy NetSuite for $9.3 billion in late July. In earlier deals, Microsoft  bought LinkedIn, Salesforce.com acquired Demandware and private equity firms purchased Qlik Technologies, Marketo and SciQuest, among others.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Workday makes cloud-based software for human relations, payroll and other business functions. Workday has expanded Workday from human capital management (HCM) software into financial management software, learning and analytics.Workday fiscal Q3 revenue rose 34% to $409.6 million, topping analysts' estimate of $400.4 million. It lost 3 cents per share ex items on a non-GAAP basis in the three months ended Oct. 31. vs. a 4-cent per-share loss consensus estimate.Current-quarter guidance for total revenue ($427-430 million), subscription ($360-363 million) and total billings ($630-635 million) were below Wall Street consensus estimates of $434 million, $366 million, and $641 million.""Fiscal 208 guidance was meaningfully below consensus expectations as management noted increased uncertainty around continued deal slippage and timing of large deal closings in the Q4,"" said Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst ,who has a neutral rating on the stock. On it call, Workday said one big deal was lost to SAP.""It's likely the market is becoming more competitive as Oracle and SAP see traction,"" Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in his research note.Competition is increasing, says John DiFucci, an analyst at Jefferies.""We believe the midmarket continues to be dogged by incremental competitive pressures from Microsoft,"" DiFucci said in a report. ""We do not believe that Workday's market is saturated, but there are legitimate alternatives in the market for cloud management solutions today that were not available just a couple years ago.""RELATED:Sharks Eye Appetizing Multiples In SaaS Software DealsWorkday Push Into Financials Debated Post-Analyst DayAmazon Re:Invent: Software Deals Aim At Microsoft Cloud

204,ORCL,"CEOs of Dow stocks General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 14 other big U.S. exporters are warning that unless Republicans embrace a controversial tax on imports, a once-in-a-generation chance at tax reform will fail and American workers would be the losers.""Our tax code penalizes American workers who make products or provide services sold abroad, while favoring their international competitors,"" the CEOs wrote in a letter to leaders of both parties in Congress.Among other companies whose CEOs co-signed the letter were Caterpillar (CAT), Dow Chemical (DOW), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX), Oracle (ORCL) and some of the biggest drug and biotech companies: Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Caterpillar, Merck, Pfizer and United Technologies also are members of the Dow Jones industrial average, in addition to General Electric and Boeing.The letter puts some of the largest U.S. companies squarely behind House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders, who argue that leveling the international playing field by cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% (or lower) will be impossible without their plan for a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.Yet the biggest surprise about the letter may be just how few companies signed it, while more than 100 companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nike (NKE) and the American subsidiary of Toyota (TM), and dozens of trade groups have signed onto the Americans for Affordable Products, created to oppose the House border tax proposal. (Wal-Mart and Nike are also Dow industrials stocks.)Retail stocks were under pressure from early December, as prospects for a border tax were on the rise, but they've made a modest recovery lately as prospects faded. On Tuesday, perhaps helped more by Wal-Mart's positive earnings report as well-received Macy's (M) earnings than weighed down by a revved-up lobbying campaign for the tax, retail shares were on rise. Wal-Mart rose 3% to close at 71.45 on the stock market today, while Target added 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House proposal for a border-adjusted tax, U.S. companies would pay a 20% tax rate on the full value of imported goods, while export revenue would be tax-free. The border tax would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to offset the cost of lowering the 35% statutory tax rate to 20%, the conservative Tax Foundation has said.Without the border tax, the ability of Congress to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate will be limited to ""incremental tweaks (that) will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth,"" the CEO letter said.It's not clear precisely why so few companies came out in favor of the border tax. Although the proposal seems to be running into a buzz saw among Republicans in the Senate, it's possible that the letter wasn't widely circulated. However, Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has predicted that ""many more big lobbies will be against the BAT (border-adjusted tax) than in favor."" That's because the tax favors labor-intensive industries that export more than they import, with aerospace being a rare example.There's one nagging question about why companies such as GE and Boeing that are so dependent upon exports would back the border tax. Most trade experts who have looked at the tax have big doubts that it would comply with World Trade Organization rules, so it could lead the U.S. into a trade war. Given that uncertainty and the possible consequences, it's hard to understand why companies so dependent upon trade would support the border tax, yet that may partly explain why the list of supporters is so small.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump Hotels

205,ORCL,"Add Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) to the short list of possible buyers of Salesforce.com (CRM), the leader in enterprise software-as-a-service, says U.K.-based Arete Research Services.Salesforce.com has a market cap of about $55.4 billion. Arete Research speculates that a $73 billion offer by Google could bring Salesforce.com to the negotiating table, says a Bloomberg report. Separately, Arete Research says that a Spotify acquisition by Facebook (FB) also makes strategic sense.Google's cloud computing business lags Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) in the enterprise market — large companies and government agencies.Buying Salesforce.com, also a leader in cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS), would boost Google, says Arete Research, according to a Bloomberg report. In PaaS, companies such as Salesforce.com and Microsoft sell applications and software that run on cloud infrastructure.Salesforce.com last year selected Amazon Web Services as its public cloud infrastructure provider, in a deal said to be worth $400 million. The pact runs through 2020.Late Thursday, Amazon reported mixed Q4 results, as AWS revenue jumped 47% to $3.5 billion, below some analyst estimates.IBD'S TAKE: Salesforce.com stock fell 12.6% in 2016, after hitting an all-time high of 84.48 in May, but it's up 17% in 2017. Learn more about Salesforce.com's growth trends at IBD Stock Checkup.Piper Jaffray speculated last year that merging AWS and Salesforce.com would make sense. AWS is one of the few companies that could afford Salesforce.com, he said.Microsoft reportedly backed away from a bid for Salesforce.com in 2015. Oracle (ORCL) also has been mentioned as a possible suitor for Salesforce.com.Diane Greene, a co-founder of VMware (VMW), now heads Google's cloud business. Google has stated it plans to increase investments in its cloud business.  Google holds its annual cloud computing conference from March 8-10.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com sells software under a subscription model. Its software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. Salesforce.com has expanded into marketing, customer services, and e-commerce.

206,ORCL,"Salesforce.com (CRM) aims to more than double its annual revenue to $20 billion, but its shareholders might settle for a different, near-term goal: better stock performance after a disappointing 2016, marked by its first earnings miss in several years.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com seems on track to hit $10 billion in revenue in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2018, bolstered by numerous acquisitions. It's expected to end up with revenue of roughly $8 billion for its fiscal 2017 ending Jan. 31, up from just more than $1 billion as recently as 2009.Salesforce.com stock fell 12.6% in 2016, after hitting an all-time high of 84.48 in May, but it's up 15% in 2017, rising a fraction to near 78.73 in the stock market today.What's preventing Salesforce.com's from hitting $20 billion or of being a 2017 comeback stock?In both cases, Microsoft (MSFT) might be the better answer than Salesforce's two longtime top business-software rivals Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). Increased competition from Microsoft as it integrates business social media platform LinkedIn, acquired last month for $26.2 billion, continues to loom over Salesforce.com.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is trading near record highs. For a look at companies hitting 52-week highs, listed according to Composite Ratings, regularly check IBD's New Highs list.It's not all about fighting Microsoft, though, says Andrew Bartel, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.""The real issue is what are the additional product categories that Salesforce.com can add that positions them for growth,"" Bartel said. ""Microsoft is a competitor, but there's more involved in Salesforce.com hitting that $20 billion target.""Salesforce.com's bread and butter remains its cloud software-as-a-service, sold under a subscription model and designed to helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. Software users track deals and manage client interactions.Microsoft, though, has been pushing into the cloud customer relationship management, or CRM, market itself, undercutting Salesforce.com's pricing.Analysts expect Microsoft to bundle more Office 365 and office productivity SaaS software with LinkedIn's enormous database and ""Sales Navigator,"" its sales lead and client interaction tools. Microsoft now can provide more products to help customers generate sales leads and close deals, analysts say.Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the Microsoft threat might not be overstated. In a recent research report, Weiss said Salesforce.com continues to add share at the high end of the CRM market. Microsoft, he says, has gained in great part with small and medium-sized companies, mainly at the expense of Oracle and SAP.Weiss says Salesforce.com's strength is its broad offerings that span sales automation, marketing and customer services.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says Salesforce.com's quest to the $20 billion revenue mark depends largely on share gains in marketing and customer services software, two areas where it can leverage its CRM customer base. Salesforce.com's $2.5 billion purchase of Exact Target in 2013 jump-started its move into marketing software.In marketing software, Salesforce.com's main rival is Adobe Systems (ADBE), but Pritchard expects Microsoft to make acquisitions as it aims to recreate the best parts of Salesforce.com.""We see the only way for Microsoft to make enough headway to be competitive with Salesforce.com — and this at the low end of the market — would be to acquire Zendesk (ZEN) and HubSpot (HUBS) — the only assets left with scale in customer service and marketing,"" Pritchard wrote. ""We expect the appetite to do this for the next 12 to 18 months is low, as Microsoft is likely focused on driving value from the purchase of LinkedIn before diving back into meaningful M&A.""Microsoft, though, already has something major that Salesforce rivals Oracle and SAP don't: a fast-growing cloud computing service branded Azure. With Azure, Microsoft is a leader in platform-as-a-service (PaaS), selling applications and software, including business management and database services, that run on cloud infrastructure.Salesforce.com last year selected Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services as its public cloud infrastructure provider. But the partnership could fray like the one-time close Microsoft-Salesforce.com relationship, analysts say. AWS leads in IaaS, infrastructure-as-a-service, with Azure No. 2.The battle between Salesforce and Microsoft is shaping up to be long term. both Microsoft and Salesforce.com are investing heavily in artificial intelligence. Salesforce.com debuted its ""Einstein"" AI initiative late last year.Salesforce.com aims to embed data analytics and ""machine learning"" into its CRM and marketing software, making it easier for customers to automate tasks. Microsoft launched its AI-based Dynamics 365 sales SaaS software late last year.While Salesforce.com has made at least nine AI-related acquisitions, Microsoft has gobbled up startups as well. And Microsoft's R&D budget, at $12 billion annually, is roughly 15 times that of Salesforce.com, estimates Pritchard.Salesforce.com doled out more than $4.6 billion in 2016 making acquisitions, including the purchase of e-commerce firm Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. At $2.8 billion, Demandware was Salesforce's largest acquisition. Salesforce.com has a cash balance of about $1.75 billion.Although Salesforce.com backed away from a Twitter (TWTR) purchase last year, concern lingers that any large deal would require a big chunk of stock that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders. The bear argument also says acquisitions might be artificially lifting bookings.""A clear management message that it will pause on large deals for the next 12 months … could go a long way in reassuring investors,"" said UBS analyst Brent Thill in a research report analyzing how Salesforce.com ""could be the turnaround story of 2017.""Morgan Stanley, in a report, said it expects ""more of the same"" from Salesforce.com, namely smaller ""tuck-in"" deals. In 2016, smaller deals included marketing data specialist Krux; business analytics platform BeyondCore; and Quip, a developer of a cloud-based word processing app that competes with Microsoft's Office.One startup that could interest Salesforce.com is Slack, says Forrester's Bartel.A list of the company's potential takeover targets, revealed in a resentation to Salesforce's board of directors, leaked in mid-2016. It included ServiceNow (NOW) and Pegasystems (PEGA) as well as much bigger rival Adobe Systems. ServiceNow's core business is software for information technology service management, or ITSM. ServiceNow has expanded into human resources, customer service and security.Salesforce.com last year shot down interest in Adobe, though there could be synergies. Adobe's Marketing Cloud is bigger than Saleforce.com's similar business and ""is expected to continue strong annual growth of 20% in revenue and 30% in bookings through 2018,"" said UBS' Thill.Aside from UBS, analysts from Canaccord Genuity, BTIG Research and Piper Jaffray also have called Salesforce.com, the leader in software-as-a-service, a top stock pick in 2017.Piper Jaffray and Drexel Hamilton, though, say Salesforce.com itself could be a takeover target. But Forrester's Bartel says the ""moment in time has passed"" for a Microsoft purchase of Salesforce.com. The pair reportedly broke off talks in May 2015.Salesforce.com has taken steps to stop relying on Oracle's database technology to run its business software. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, a 13-year Oracle executive before he left to start Salesforce, have exchanged numerous barbs over the years.In a Dec. 19 research report, though, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White says, ""Who is to say that Microsoft, Oracle or another large company would not be interested in acquiring Salesforce in the coming years.""RELATED:Salesforce.com Fiscal Q3 Beats, Sales Guidance Top Views, Shares UpMicrosoft Hits Record High On Bullish Reports

216,ORCL,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Facebook (FB)  COO Sheryl Sandberg and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) co-founder and CEO Larry Page and Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt are among tech industry leaders expected to attend a summit with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, Bloomber and online news site Recode reported Sunday, where U.S. economic growth as well as China, taxes and immigration policies could be on the agenda.Most tech industry leaders who attend will fly east from Silicon Valley. The meeting is planned at the Trump Tower in Manhattan.Trump transition advisor Peter Thiel, a PayPal (PYPL) co-founder and now a noted venture capitalist, has also reached out to Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, and the chief executives of Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC) and Oracle (ORCL), according to reports. Thiel was by-far Trump's biggest high-level Silicon Valley tech backer, even speaking in a prime spot at the Republican National Convention.Apple's Cook, Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins have confirmed they're going, says a Bloomberg report. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk also will attend, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, though Recode on Sunday said Musk was iffy.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and most of the FANG stocks are showing weak relative strength vs. the broader market. True market leaders show rising RS lines. To find stocks with RS lines hitting new highs, take a free Marketsmith trial.Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will not be attending and have other plans, said the Recode report.Recode on Sunday said it wasn't clear if Amazon.com (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos would attend, but Yahoo reported Monday that Bezos would attend.During the Presidential campaign, Trump called Amazon a monopoly and said it benefited from unfair tax advantages. Trump also has feuded with the Washington Post, which is owned individually by Bezos.Worries that Trump trade policies or future comments over Taiwan could raise tensions with China's government remain a concern of Apple, because of iPhone sales in China.Google, meanwhile, apparently won't have the same kind of access to top officials at the Trump administration as it did during the Obama administration.Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Oracle.During the Presidential campaign, Trump stated his opposition to the H-1B specialty-occupation non-immigrant visas — a key tool of U.S. tech companies looking outside the U.S. to fill key skilled tech jobs that they say are otherwise tough to fill.The largest tech stocks, in general, had not joined as much in the stock market rally post-Trump triumph, with sectors such as oil and banks seeing a bigger boost, though the big techs have done better of late. But Apple stock fell 0.57% in the stock market today, while Facebook and Amazon fell 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively.Apple stock found some support at its 50-day moving average, a key support line, while Facebook and Amazon were facing tests at their 200-day and 10-day lines, respectively.Netflix stock was flat at 122.83.

217,ORCL,"Stocks showed small movement Monday, but small caps fell harder with the Russell 2000 retreating nearly 1.1%. In contrast, the S&P 500, up 3.1% last week, lost just 0.1%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell around 0.6% to 113.30. More importantly, the stock held above its key 50-day moving average. And Intel (INTC) helped prop up chipmakers with a 0.7% gain to 35.97. Intel has been working on a new saucerlike base since peaking at 38.36 in October.The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6% on Monday, following last week's 3.6% rally, but volume on fell about 6% vs. Friday's level, according to preliminary data. That's a sign that big funds weren't overly eager to sell positions and raise cash.The NYSE composite outperformed by losing just 0.1%. Big Board turnover grew. The S&P 500 was also off just 0.1% while mega-cap names were virtually flat. Due to the small declines, the 500 avoided getting tagged with a new distribution day, or bout of heavy professional selling. The distribution count on the 500 is now at 2, down from 8 on Nov. 1, according to the IBD Market Pulse table found in each daily Big Picture column.A low distribution day count implies that large funds, banks, pension plans and the like are accumulating shares on net. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating on the S&P 500 is positive at C+ as of Friday's close.The S&P 100 was up a fraction while the Dow Jones industrials edged 0.2% ahead.Oil and gas royalty trust, oil drilling, and international oil and gas exploration companies paced the upside with gains of 1% or more. IBD's Medical-Diversified group, which includes Dow 30 component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and the Internet-Network Solutions group also excelled with gains of 2% and 1%, respectively.J&J jumped nearly 3% to 115.36 in heavy turnover, stopping short of retaking its 50- and 200-day lines. The stock is just 8% below a 52-week peak, but it's still in the early stages of forming a potential new base.The worst declines in terms of industry groups belonged to department store chains (down more than 4%), airlines (-3%), leisure products (-3%) and steel production (off more than 2%). Southwest bank, cement and aggregate, security software and consumer loan companies also sold off hard.Back to the tech sector, Microsoft (MSFT) rose 0.3% to 62.17, extending its gains from a breakout past a 58.80 base-on-base buy point to 5.7%. The mega cap is now slightly extended past the 5% proper buying range.Qualcomm (QCOM), which makes the IBD Dividend Leaders screen, gave up little ground as it builds on gains since a July 21 breakaway gap past a bottoming base buy point of 56.37. Yet the stock may also be working on a new flat-base-like structure. Qualcomm was also showcased in today's The Income Investor column.Netflix (NFLX) continues to show tight action after a strong rally last week. Down just 5 cents on Monday to 122.83, the video streaming giant is still above an aggressive entry point near 120, according to IBD Leaderboard. The standard buy point is 129.39.In the energy sector, numerous oil and gas explorers struggled to hold big opening gains in the wake of another surprise agreement among non-OPEC oil-producing nations to join in the body's historic decision to cut overall production starting in January.Britain's integrated oil major BP (BP) rallied more than 1% to 36.51, at one point getting as high as 36.96, or just a few cents above a 36.93 cup buy point. The eight-week cup sits within a much longer and deeper bottoming base pattern. Halliburton (HAL) ran up to a session high of 56.08 before sinking back to 54.49, up just 0.5%. The oilfield services giant, however, has climbed more than 16% since clearing a 47 flat-base buy point in early October.At one point, Halliburton pulled back below the 47 entry to an intraday low of 45.08, but that 4% drop was not enough to trigger the 8% loss-cutting sell rule following a good breakout.Wall Street sees Halliburton reversing from a net loss of 5 cents a share in 2016 to a net profit of $1.03 a share in 2017.The week features only a sliver of companies reporting quarterly results, but they include two major big-cap software names, Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The latter is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit 39% to 86 cents a share. Over the prior six quarters, earnings have grown on average 53.2%.In August, Adobe pushed past a 100.66 flat-base entry point and rallied more than 10% before fading. Yet in its most recent correction, the stock found bullish support at the long-term 200-day moving average. Watch to see if the stock can hurdle its 50-day moving average, which would boost the odds of a fresh breakout.Besides the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on Wednesday, keep an eye out for the November report on producer level prices. The Econoday consensus forecast calls for a 0.2% month-to-month rise.RELATED:Why Did Apple Form A Bottoming Base, And How Can Investors Profit From It?Why Apple Is Forming A New Base And Flexing Strength AgainWhy Is Adobe A Top Tech Stock Pick For 2017?Will Apple Invest In A Massive Softbank Fund?

218,ORCL,"Optimism is high for increases in information technology budgets in 2017, with 80% of chief information officers expecting IT budgets to climb, the highest in eight years, says a report from Pacific Crest Securities.Last year, 66% of CIOs expected IT budgets to increase. Of the 80% that expect budget increases in 2017, 28% see an increase of 10% or more.Among large tech companies in a strong position to benefit from IT spending increases are Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), especially as it relates to the public cloud market, the Pacific Crest report said. Amazon and Microsoft are the No. 1 and No. 2 provider of public cloud services, respectively, followed by the Google unit of Alphabet (GOOGL).A separate report from Cowen said Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.Spending priorities also remain high in the area of IT security, with Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) among those standing to benefit. The survey said 58% of CIOs expect security spending to increase, while 42% expect it to stay the same.CIOs also expect to see the continued adoption of software-as-a-service, especially in the area of sales and marketing, giving an advantage to Salesforce.com (CRM), Hubspot (HUBS), Zendesk (ZEN) and Shopify (SHOP). Salesforce last month reported fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue that topped views and also forecast current-quarter and fiscal 2018 revenue above expectations, sending shares up.Among key IT vendors, expect Microsoft, Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM) to be favored for budget spending increases.Amazon stock fell 0.4% to 767.33 in the stock market today.

219,ORCL,"Highflying maker of medical software Veeva Systems (VEEV) saw its shares gap up 11% Wednesday to a buy point, after its earnings and guidance late Tuesday handily beat Wall Street projections, as it continues to expand its product portfolio.With October's addition of EDC, or electronic data capture, to its suite of applications built on the Vault cloud content management platform, the company's total addressable market has now risen to $7 billion, Veeva CFO Tim Cabral told IBD following the earnings release.""We're in the early innings in terms of our opportunity; it's the early innings for some of our largest customers,"" Cabral said.Vault is geared specifically to life sciences companies, which face complex processes in managing drug trials and more. Veeva's fiscal Q3 was the first quarter in which Vault bookings surpassed the company's older CRM, or customer relationship management, products.IBD'S TAKE: Which NYSE and Nasdaq stocks have performed the best in the past 12 months, especially the most recent six? That's where the IBD 50 is your key tool, because those top performers are there. Veeva ranks No. 12 on the latest list, among a bevy of tech companies in the rankings.""A standout driver this year has been the continued strong uptake of new Vault products, which has now grown to represent about one-third of subscription revenue mix, up from 12% two years ago,"" Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin wrote in a research note late Tuesday.Bracelin raised his price target on Veeva stock to 48 from 42. He rates the stock overweight, or buy.Veeva stock closed at 46.30 in the stock market today, hitting its highest price since its October 2013 IPO.""Vault continues to be the primary growth driver,"" Needham's Scott Berg said in his research report, maintaining a buy rating and 46 price target on Veeva stock.Analysts especially liked Veeva's revenue guidance for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018. The company sees sales of about $650 million for that year, vs. Wall Street's $639.4 million estimate. That would be up 20.5% from the midpoint of its fiscal 2017 guidance, which the company hiked, of $539.4 million.""We were pleased with the revenue and operating income guidance, and believe investors will be reassured by management's confidence in continuing to grow the CRM business at 15% and non-CRM (Vault) business at about 100% while delivering margin upside,"" William Blair analysts Amanda Murphy and Bhavan Suri said in a research note. They rate Veeva stock outperform.""There are simply too many 'fans' who are dying to buy this stock the moment the shares dip, and that this dynamic puts the stock in a more or less permanent state of 'expensiveness,' especially based on what will likely be conservative consensus estimates,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in his research report. ""We believe VEEV shares are OK to buy here and should the overall market ever correct again, we would view exogenous weakness as a buying opportunity.""The rollout of its clinical data management Vault product next year will bring Veeva into competition with Medidata Solutions (MDSO) and Oracle (ORCL), Davis said. He maintained a buy rating but hiked his price target to 48 from 46.Veeva's main competition, though, is in moving legacy applications to the cloud, says Nitsa Zuppas, its chief marketing officer. The focus on cloud life sciences is simply not there for the big CRM and enterprise vendors, she told IBD.Besides Oracle, Veeva lists Microsoft (MSFT) and EMC, now part of Dell Technologies (DVMT), as among its biggest competitors.Veeva, however, says it counts more than 45 of the 50 largest pharma companies as customers of at least one of its products.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth paragraph to bookings in comparing Vault and CRM.RELATED:Veeva Posts Beat-And-Raise Fiscal Q3

220,ORCL,"Aaron Levie, the chief executive officer of Box (BOX), says he wants to change the world by improving how businesses work and operate.Founded in 2005, and after making its initial public offering in January 2015, Box aims to transform the way people and organizations function. Its cloud-based software, provided as a service, is a data collaboration and management platform for businesses and other enterprises.Levie says the platform is transformative. Customers can share content on any device, collaborate on content, automate business processes, develop custom applications and more. It has more than 69,000 customers.Box made its IPO in January 2015, pricing shares at 14 and peaking very soon at nearly 25. The stock hit an 18-month high of 16.59 in October and closed at 13.91, up 1%, in the stock market today.Levie recently spoke with IBD about the year ahead:IBD: What is the future of work?Levie: We believe every enterprise is going to have to completely rewrite the way they work. Organizations, the culture of a company, the way that people move, the way people share and work together, (all) will have to fundamentally change for large enterprises to stay competitive.And our job is to build amazing software that helps change the way people work together. We are going to continue to deliver an incredibly delightful, simple product for end users that solves very complex and difficult tasks and solutions for the enterprise. That's the intersection where we live.IBD'S TAKE: Why does Arista Networks lead IBD's IPO Leaders list? Take a look and continue to monitor that listing for newly public companies that could be poised for big gains.IBD: What will 2017 be like for Box?Levie: We've been on a journey to build out all the product and services required for any enterprise to move the vast majority of their content, their documents and data to the cloud. Going back a few years ago, we identified a bunch of new requirements for large governments, large financial services firms, life sciences companies, very big enterprises. We looked at what would they need to be able to move their information to a cloud-based content management environment.There still are a few more building blocks we want to be able to deliver — things that will continue to advance our solution in the analytics and intelligence space and in areas that, we think, can help customers on compliance and how to manage that information. So next year is going to be a bigger push in that direction.And then as we continue to deliver these solutions to customers you'll see innovation at Box, especially around things such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. You will see more investment in advanced security solutions. With the rise of cybersecurity attacks, that's an incredibly important area for our customers.IBD: Why does Box frequently partner with competitors?Levie: In terms of our partnerships, we take very much a Switzerland approach. We want to be the best place to store and secure your data, but we want you to be able to access that data and information from any application that you use.That might be via Microsoft's (MSFT) Office 365, it might be Slack, it might be (Alphabet's (GOOGL)) Google Docs. Our job is to be the best place to manage and secure and govern the content. We want to make sure you can have access to it and that you can work with that information from any application that you're in.I think what you're seeing is an overall change in the enterprise software industry, where you are seeing more openness. You're seeing more interoperability, more partnerships between traditionally competitive companies, and we just happen to be right at the center of all this because we help customers manage a very important resource, which is data, and that data needs to be accessed from lots of different places.IBD: You'll be celebrating your second year as a publicly traded company. What advice do you have for companies that want to IPO?Levie: The first thing is your business has to be ready. That means you want to have a very predictable business model. You want to have a very long-term view about how you are going to continue to perform and execute as a stand-alone company.Some organizations treat going public as an exit. If you just look at it as an exit, then I think you'll be sorely disappointed because there is still so much more work that you have to do as you build your company up. So the first thing is just making sure you have a long-term strategy with a high degree of predictability.The second thing is get very good at communicating your strategy to Wall Street and make sure that aligns both internally and externally in terms of how you communicate that and what the actual strategy is. We learned that early on, when we saw there were some pockets of Wall Street that really didn't understand what we were doing and how differentiated we were and what our strategy really was. So we wanted to get very crisp on exactly who we are, what we are doing, why what we do matters and how we're different.IBD: Why have we not seen the tech ""unicorns"" like Uber or Airbnb IPO yet?Levie: Most of the unicorns that we commonly talk about, whether that's Uber or Airbnb or Pinterest, these are actually relatively new companies. They just happened to get to scale very quickly. If we were to compare the historical precedent of how long it takes to IPO, whether it was Microsoft or Sun Microsystems or Oracle (ORCL) or even Google, I think by those standards these companies aren't taking that long to IPO. They've just gotten to a much bigger scale in a much shorter amount of time.Those (unicorn) companies will go public when it's the appropriate time, when they feel like they've really kind of captured their market and it makes sense. I would say that it's a pretty healthy situation out there, other than the fact that a lot of capital is locked up in these private companies.IBD: What do you hope to see from a Trump presidency?Levie: It's the same stuff that we would want to see from any president. Basically, if you think about the next 10 or 20 years and our economy, much of it is going to move more toward tech-driven business models. Not necessarily technology companies in the classic sense, but it might be traditional banks or life sciences companies where their underlying strategy, their underlying business model, their underlying products and services are going to be driven by technology.And that means (companies will face) a lot of the issues we see today in Silicon Valley, whether it's issues around encryption or how do we bring in the best talent or how do we modernize regulations. We would want to see a government respond and be thoughtful of the changes that are necessary if we are to be competitive in the future. That intersects with a whole bunch of issues — immigration, encryption, education, patent reform, regulation reform — and at the same time making sure we're protecting our employees and citizens in the process.IBD: As 2016 closes, what are you grateful for?Levie: I'm personally grateful for an organization that is comprised of just a tremendous amount of really great people that get you fired up every day when you come into work. These are people who are betting on being a part of a startup that wants to change the way the world works. We would not be here as a $400 million run-rate company without the level of intensity and the amazing contributions that all of our people bring. So, firstly, grateful for our employees. And them (I am also) very grateful for all the customers that bet on us and continue to bet on us.RELATED:Box's Partners Include IBM, Amazon Web ServicesBox Q3 Earnings, Q4 Guidance Beat Expectations

221,ORCL,"The past year has been a breakout one for Veeva Systems (VEEV) — doubly so if you look at its stock chart.The cloud-based software company, which develops applications for the life sciences industry, aims to displace legacy on-premise systems that make compliance with FDA and other international regulations especially painful and time-consuming. Veeva first made a splash with its customer relationship management software for drug sales reps. Now it's capitalizing on its strong position providing cloud-based content management for drug trials, where it faces competition from Medidata Solutions (MDSO), another cloud-based software company, and Oracle (ORCL).Growth has been robust, with sales gains gradually trending up to 34% in its October quarter. Despite a recent pullback, Veeva stock has advanced 44% in 2016, leaving behind a two-year trading range as its market position caught up with the hype surrounding its 2013 IPO.In 2016, Veeva expanded into tracking quality control processes for drug manufacturing. IBD talked to Veeva CEO Peter Gassner about the big picture behind Veeva's success and key milestones ahead for the company in 2017 and beyond.IBD: You have said that the life sciences industry ""has to move off legacy systems to the cloud."" Why is that, and how far along is that process?Gassner: It's a long-term process, but they have to move over time because really the best applications are in the cloud. That's where all the innovation is going, that's where all the venture-capital investment, that's where all the best technology people are doing things.A large pharmaceutical company, let's say one in the top 10, they will have over 5,000 people globally, both people inside their company and outside their company, collaborating around the process of executing these trials, literally around the globe — from China and Japan to Europe to Latin America and the United States, and you just can't do that effectively without a system designed for that.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Veeva Systems cleared a buy point at 42.68 on Nov. 23 on the heels of a strong fiscal third-quarter earnings report. But the stock gave back a 12% gain as it plunged back to its buy point five days later, a sell signal. Wait for the stock to regroup and form another price consolidation before considering buying shares. IBD Leaderboard keeps tabs on leading stocks like Veeva to help you spot buying opportunities as they emerge and sell signals to lock-in profits.The majority of the mission-critical systems in life sciences are still not in the cloud. They're still on premise. Not all things can be changed at once. It's still early. But if you look at the chief information officers of the pharmaceutical companies, most of them have what's called a cloud-first strategy. When they have to get a better application because there are some operational inefficiencies, they will absolutely look to the cloud first. And the reason is basically, with the cloud, if you get on a cloud application, not only is it likely to be better, but it's always going to be up to date. You don't have to upgrade your servers and do things like that. You just subscribe to it and it's always going to be up to date.IBD:  Veeva has announced a series of products coming to market for 2017, including Vault CTMS (clinical trial management), EDC (electronic data capture) and eSource in 2017. Explain how these products will build on your existing capabilities to expand your market opportunity.Gassner: What Veeva's done is we've built this (cloud application) platform called Vault, and that's the (content management) platform we used to develop these applications. We've been perfecting that platform over the past four or five years and it's pretty good and efficient now, and that's why we're able to develop these applications pretty quickly.We're now the first company that will have a full suite for clinical operations (CTMS, study start up, electronic trial master file) and also clinical data management, which is EDC and eSource. There's actually no other company that has that full suite of applications all on one common platform. Customers would like a common platform if they can get it, because then they have a common way of operating it. They have a common trust in that platform and they know that Veeva will do the necessary integration points between these applications, so they can really get a suite of applications for operating their clinical trials and that's really not been possible before. EDC and eSource expand our market by $1 billion and that brings our total addressable market to $7 billion.IBD: You set a goal in 2015 for Veeva to top $1 billion in revenue in 2020 from life sciences customers. With revenue jumping 34% in the third quarter to $142.8 million, are you running ahead of schedule?Gassner: We set the goal of a $1 billion revenue run rate in 2020 and at our analyst day in September, we did say that we're increasingly confident in that because we're actually tracking slightly ahead in Veeva Vault and we're on track in commercial cloud. So overall, we are slightly ahead of our plan. So that's pretty good to set out a plan and execute to the plan. That's what we do. We're proud about that. How we're getting there is by focusing on the customer success first and then our employee success second, because if you look at being a billion-dollar company with then plenty of room to grow after that into a multi-billion-dollar company, we're at 1,700-plus employees now. We need more employees than that to get us there, right? And it's about how do we build that great team.  The one thing I feel really confident about is our strategy is right on. We know the products we need to build and sell and get to a leadership position in. Now we just have to execute.IBD: What impact, if any, do you see on the life sciences industry and Veeva's market opportunity from the outcome of the U.S. elections and the recently passed 21st Century Cures Act?Gassner: I don't really see any major impact on technology based on this year's election. In terms of the 21st Century Cures Act, that's a little different because, I think, the science of healthcare is definitely advancing faster than ever before. I think there will be increased discussion with the regulators. That will end up being positive for the industry overall, because what it will do is get the industry and regulators more aligned because they both want to get the right treatments to the right patients as quickly as they can. When that happens, there's more value transferred from the industry to the population, there's less friction and it should be better for the industry. So what I'm pleased about is the discussion, the open-mindedness, the realization that, wow, our processes need to evolve, now that we have genomics, personalized medicine, cures for breakthrough things. So I think it will be positive for the industry, but like all new policies, we just have to wait and see how it plays out.IBD: While Veeva is focused on fully capitalizing on the large life sciences market, will 2017 be the year in which Veeva seeks to expand outside of life sciences and into other highly regulated markets?Gassner: We have our Vault platform, and we're developing a lot of good applications on that, and a few of those are applicable outside of life sciences.

223,ORCL,"Led by Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), tech companies continue to sit on hordes of cash, providing ample opportunity for acquisitions, stock buybacks and cash distribution.Microsoft ended the third quarter with the largest bundle of cash and short-term investments among companies in the S&P 500,  says a report from FactSet Research. Apple is the leader when including long-term investments. The top five companies by cash totals — Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL), and Apple — are all part of the S&P 500's information technology sector.Microsoft ended Q3 with $135.9 billion in cash and short-term equivalents, followed by Alphabet at $83 billion. Cisco was No. 3 at $71 billion, and Oracle No. 4, at $68.4 billion.Including long-term investments, Apple is king with $237.6 billion. Microsoft is No. 2 at $147.4 billion, followed by General Electric (GE) at $123.2 billion and Google-owner Alphabet $88.76 billion. They're followed by Ford (F), Cisco, Oracle and General Motors (GM).IBD'S TAKE: If Trump's tax holiday occurs, some of the largest companies could be sitting on piles of excess cash in the U.S., which can be used on things like shareholder distributions, capital expenditures, M&A, debt payoff, and research and development, activities that can boost stock prices. See which stocks already are leaders, at IBD Sector Leaders.Microsoft and Apple were cash leaders in Q2.The S&P 500 overall held cash and short-term investments of $1.54 trillion, up 7.6% from Q3 2015. That's the largest cash total in at least 10 years.Short-term investments are financial instruments that can easily be converted into cash. They include common stock, certificates of deposit and other securities that can be sold or redeemed within a year. Long-term securities have a longer time horizon, where a company intends to hold longer than one year.The IT sector overall held $672.7 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Sept. 30, 43.6% of the aggregate amount for the S&P 500, up from 39% in Q3 2015. The sector saw its balance grow 19% year over year, the second-largest growth rate of the S&P 500's 10 sectors. The consumer staples sector posted the largest increase in cash, at 26%.The cash situation could take a dramatic shift if President-elect Donald Trump commits to his plan for a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%.A report from Goldman Sachs speculates that U.S. companies will devote $150 billion in repatriated overseas cash for stock repurchases next year if Congress enacts Trump's proposal to lower taxes on such moves. Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%.As to what they'll do with all that cash. Apple led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in Q3. Apple also led the field in stock buybacks in Q2, followed by GE and Microsoft.Microsoft has plans to buy back as much as $40 billion in stock, and the company reaffirmed that it is on track to complete its current $40 billion buyback authorization by year-end.Apple stock fell 0.7% to 116.22 in the stock market today, its first down day in the past eight trading days. Microsoft stock rose 1 cent to 63.55, but earlier touched a record high of 64.10. It's well extended from its last buy point. Alphabet stock fell 0.3% to 809.68.RELATED:Apple, Exxon Mobil Lead S&P 500 In Q2 Dividends PaidApple Reportedly Held Talks About Investing In Huge SoftBank FundTrump, Silicon Valley Shake Hands; Amazon's Bezos Hails 'Productive' Meeting

224,ORCL,"Heavy-duty media hype can help drum up interest in the Super Bowl, an awards show or a new superhero flick and help boost interest and ratings.But in the stock market, heavy media coverage is often a lagging indicator, kicking in after a stock has already enjoyed a big run.IBD's goal is to help investors find the next Apple (AAPL), EMC (EMC) or Microsoft (MSFT) before they become household names. When those companies start attracting widespread media attention, it's time for investors to become cautious.Instead, look for sell signals, such as a climax run or the failure of a late-stage base, that indicate the stock's run is finished.In the past, popular business magazines like Fortune and Forbes often will run cover photos and long profiles of white-hot companies or big-name CEOs in part to satisfy their readers' interest in finding the secrets to success. That helps sell copies.Today, with fewer people reading magazines and newspapers in print, it may be a little trickier to spot excessive media coverage. Thanks to the worldwide web, we now live and invest in a hyper-information age. One can follow tweets on Twitter, listen to podcasts, and watch interviews on TV shows and videos by experts, journalists and amateurs touting a stock.But it's still worth the time to comb through the sea of information to spot instances of excessive optimism among talking heads or even Wall Street analysts about specific stocks, making companies seem to have no weaknesses or faults. After all, the crowd is always wrong at market extremes.After a stellar run during the late 1980s to 1990s, Oracle (ORCL) attracted huge media attention after it had already enjoyed a massive run-up.Oracle cleared an 11.76 buy point (adjusted for a pair of 2-for-1 splits, both in 2000) in a flat base-on-base pattern in the week ended Oct. 29, 1999. Over the next year, it quadrupled to a peak of 46.47 in the week of Sept. 1, 2000, about six months after the mighty tech bubble reached its zenith.The database and business software developer continued to attract media attention as it was peaking. IBD ran stories on the company in March 2000. In June that year, Oracle founder and CEO Larry Ellison was quoted as saying that the company's potential was ""breathtaking.""Such hyperbole coming from corporate executives, analysts or pundits is usually a cue for shareholders to take a close look at the stock. In fact, Ellison's comments came not long after the stock hit a peak at 45 in the week ended March 31, 2000.A couple weeks later, it launched into a gut-wrenching 28% plunge, slicing right through the 10-week line (1) in the week ended April 14. Though volume was only modestly above average, shareholders could have been forgiven for selling shares and exiting out of the position, even though the stock later rebounded to a high of 46.47.Ellison then appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine on Nov. 20, 2000. In the months before then, signs that the stock was breaking down were even more pronounced.Always consider what the market is doing. Back then, the S&P 500 had racked up a bunch of distribution days in late August, after the Federal Reserve's series of interest-rate hikes from June 1999 through May 2000 began to cool the economy.Less than two months later, in the week ended Oct. 6, 2000 (2), Oracle plunged 14% in huge volume after breaking down from a late-stage base. The stock not only sank further below its 10-week line, but also sliced through the 40-week line (roughly equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart). Another definite sell signal.By September 2001, Oracle slid to a low of 10.16 — below the initial buy point triggered in October 1999. When you sense that the stock has become so popular that it seems almost everybody around you owns it, then there's typically only one way for it to go — down.It took more than 14 years before Oracle came within pennies of its all-time peak, rising to as high as 46.71 in December 2014. Today, shares trade nearly 18% off that peak.(Editor's Note: This column originally was published in the May 17, 2013, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Why Oracle Showed The Late-Stage Base Is a Short Seller's Good FriendThe Benefits Of Short Selling: 7 Reasons To LearnWhen To Sell: Multiple Sell Signals Can Flash In A Single DayKnow This Sell Signal: The Value Of Taking Gains At 20% To 25%

Analysts had modeled flat earnings of 21 cents amid integration costs related to acquisitions, and revenue of $2.12 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31.In the current quarter, Salesforce.com forecast EPS ex items of 24-25 cents ex-items and revenue growth of 25% to $2.27 billion, vs. consensus estimates of 25 cents and $2.24 billion.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com said in fiscal 2018 it expects revenue of about $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion, up 21% at the midpoint, vs. consensus estimates of $10.08 billion.Salesforce stock was up 4.5% in after-hours trading in the stock market today, following the earnings release. Shares gained 2.6% to 75.19 in Thursday's regular session.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Computer-Software Enterprise group ranks No. 37 out of 197 industry groups, down from No. 3 eight weeks ago.  The Computer-Data Storage group has moved up to No. 2 from No. 32 in that span.

227,ORCL,"As has been the norm, Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in the third quarter as the information technology sector overall led the field, says a report by FactSet Research.Firms in the S&P 500 overall spent $115.6 billion on share buybacks in Q3, but that was down 28% year over year and the smallest quarterly total since Q1 2013.Top spender Apple repurchased $7.2 billion worth of shares in Q3. Following Apple for second place was General Electric (GE) at $4.3 billion, then Microsoft (MSFT) at $3.55 billion, Allergan (AGN) at $3.2 billion and McDonald's (MCD) at $2.77 billion.Apple, General Electric and Microsoft led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in Q2 as well. Three months ago Microsoft said its directors had authorized a new stock buyback program of as much as $40 billion, and the company reaffirmed that it is on track to complete its current $40 billion buyback authorization by year-end.IBD'S TAKE: Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding. It's also a move that companies make when they begin to transition from rapid growth into middle age.As has been the norm for the S&P 500 index, the information technology sector was the top spending group in terms of buybacks at $27 billion, but that was down 41% year over year. Several major contributors were the smaller repurchases from Oracle (ORCL), Intuit (INTU), and Apple. The financials sector was the second top spending group, with $25 billion worth of stock being repurchased in Q3.Apple shares rose 0.1% to 117.06 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple, Exxon Mobil Lead S&P 500 In Q2 Dividends PaidApple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Are Kings Of Cash

228,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) shares were down Friday following mixed fiscal second-quarter results after the market close Thursday that beat on earnings but fell short on revenue.The enterprise software giant reported non-GAAP revenue of $9.07 billion, up 1% year over year and just below the consensus estimate of $9.14 billion. Earnings per share minus items of 61 cents was down 3% but a penny above views.But results showed continued progress in Oracle's transition to the cloud.

To see which tech stocks are doing better, check out the IBD 50.""Our partner research does point to a significantly larger pipeline for the back half of (fiscal 2017), particularly in cloud ERP (enterprise resource planning) where we continue to see Oracle competing very effectively vs. both SAP (SAP) and Workday (WDAY),"" Senk wrote in a research note.Workday stock plunged 12.5% on Dec. 2 after the cloud software provider forecast current-quarter revenue and billings that disappointed amid growing competition.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White maintained a buy rating and 47 price target on Oracle stock.""After Oracle's stock has flatlined from 10 quarters ago, we believe the worst of this cloud transition is behind the company,"" White wrote in a report. ""Taking a step back and analyzing Oracle's cloud performance today relative to 3-4 years ago, the progress the company has made during this time has defied all the skeptics, and the company has built a formidable cloud franchise.""Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis also maintained a buy rating. He has a price target of 45.""Our view on Oracle is pretty simple: Expectations are low and the stock is cheap enough that we think shares could appreciate on gradual multiple expansion as investors gain confidence in the firm's cloud traction,"" Davis wrote in his report.BMO Capital Markets maintained an outperform rating but lowered its price target to 45 from 46. ""We think Oracle had a mixed quarter, but on balance we thought there were more negatives than positives,"" wrote BMO analyst Keith Bachman.Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite on Nov. 7.

229,ORCL,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is set to report quarterly earnings after the close Wednesday, as the software company continues to expand its product offerings and pose a greater threat to business-software leaders Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).Salesforce is a pioneer developer of customer relationship management software made available to business customers via the cloud as a software-as-a-service.

It also has expanded into financial management software, an area where analysts are mixed on its execution and prospects, but some of those fears were relieved with the Q2 report. Its business software rivals include Oracle (ORCL).Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin maintained a sector weight rating on Workday.""Improving subscription billings and commentary of a strong pipeline across an expanding product portfolio suggest demand fundamentals remain robust,"" Bracelin wrote, but said he said shares appear fairly valued. He didn't give a price target.Concerns about Workday's high valuation also resonated with Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim. He maintained a sell rating on Workday stock even while hiking his price target to 62 -- far bellow its current price -- from 55.""With shares representing one of the highest valuation multiples in the software industry, we believe risk/reward remains unfavorable."" Kim wrote.BMO Capital Markets has a market perform rating and price target of 93.  RBC Capital Markets rates Workday stock outperform and inched up its price target of 93 from 92.During the quarter, Workday announced new customer wins that include IBM (IBM) and Samsung. It also expects to increase sales to Dell as a result of that company's pending acquisition of EMC (EMC).Its multiyear strategic partnership with IBM, under which the IBM Cloud, will become the foundation for Workday's development and testing environment, which  will give it greater efficiency, flexibility and global scale, it said.Workday ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $2.1 billion.RELATED:Oracle To Buy NetSuite; Software Stocks Climb On M&A Climate

234,ORCL,"Look for more software partnerships to surface at Amazon.com's (AMZN) annual cloud computing conference this week, says Citigroup.Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business of the e-commerce giant, will likely announce more products for the enterprise market as it battles Microsoft (MSFT), says Citigroup. Re:Invent, AWS' annual Las Vegas conference, runs from Tuesday through Friday. AWS has forged partnerships in 2016 with Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in software-as-a-service, as well as VMware (VMW), whose software is widely used in corporate data centers.Rather than unveil products that compete with enterprise software providers, AWS is likely to tout its growing list of partnerships, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard, which now includes Freeport-McMo-Ran, Jack-in-the-Box and tech stocks Broadcom, Veeva Systems and Celegene. Holiday season e-commerce activity will be a key for Amazon. ""The tide has shifted in 2016 with more AWS partnering with software vendors,"" wrote Pritchard. ""We believe the market may be overly concerned around impact on Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK) and VMware.""He noted that Salesforce.com, Splunk, VMware as well as Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Intuit (INTU) are slated to take part is RE:Invent sessions.""We expect to hear AWS partnering more to keep up with Microsoft and IBM (IBM) in hybrid cloud deployment,"" Pritchard said.""We expect investor sentiment coming out of re:Invent to continue to focus on its disruptive impact on the enterprise market with significant traction with big-name customers,"" he said. ""We note that AWS as a development platform lags its position in infrastructure, but we see many of these customers presenting on how AWS is becoming key to its custom app development effort, replacing the likes of IBM, Microsoft and Oracle (ORCL).""AWS announced a new round of cloud computing price cuts in November.Citigroup lowered its price target on Amazon.com to 960 from 965 on Monday, on possible margin impact from the price cuts.In Q3, Amazon said AWS revneue jumped 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, topping analysts' estimate of $3.19 billion.Amazon stock fell 1.7% in the stock market today to 766.77.

235,ORCL,"The anti-immigration stance of President-elect Donald Trump is potentially the most obvious issue for tech companies in dealing with the incoming administration, says Edison Investment Research analyst Dan Ridsdale.But while Trump has stated his opposition to the H-1B specialty-occupation non-immigrant visas — a key tool of U.S. tech companies looking outside the U.S. to fill key skilled tech jobs that they say are otherwise tough to fill — he also has stated support for immigration of highly skilled individuals.Shares of the largest tech companies were all over the board early Wednesday afternoon, some up and some down.""Trump has offered few detailed positions on technology policy, and there will inevitably be major differences between what Trump has said he will do and what he does do or what he can do,"" Ridsdale wrote in an emailed research note. ""Nevertheless, his electoral thrust has been on rejuvenating the traditional manufacturing sector ahead of supporting its thriving technology community.""IBD'S TAKE: The big techs have all had big stock run-ups at times, but which are doing the best right now? IBD Leaderboard is the first place to check. The few companies on the current top-performers list include Facebook and chipmaker Broadcom.Trade relations, especially with China, a major source of goods manufactured for U.S. tech companies, is another issue for tech companies and Trump""Trump's rhetoric on the trade relationship with China has been bombastic,"" Ridsdale wrote. ""Pledges to take action against currency manipulation, export subsidies and intellectual-property theft are aimed at supporting U.S. businesses, but companies such as Apple (AAPL), for whom China is an important export market, may well suffer from the backlash.""Apple was mentioned specifically by Trump during his campaign regarding the production of iPhones overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook campaigned for Hillary Clinton, who was supported by the great majority of top tech executives.Apple stock was down 0.2%, at 110.88, on the stock market today.But Ridsdale added that Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes, if implemented, could clearly lift earnings of companies across the board. And Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas.The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Shares of Cisco climbed 1.2% to 31.36 while Oracle added 1.1% to 39.55. Meanwhile, Microsoft stock slipped half a percent to 60.17 and Alphabet was down a fraction to 805.59.Amazon (AMZN) stock was down 2% to 771.88, but it reportedly faces a possible tax crackdown in Europe.

"
236,ORCL,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59.

237,ORCL,"Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are in the same boat amid light guidance heading into 2017: Investors will wait-and-see whether President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tax reform will enable them to bring back overseas cash for bigger stock buybacks.HPE late Tuesday reported fiscal Q4 earnings that edged Wall Street estimates, but revenue and its current-quarter EPS guidance came in light. Shares initially fell, but closed strong to finish up 2.9%, at 23.54, in the stock market today. That's just shy of a 23.63 buy point from a cup base. HPE topped that entry point a few times in the past two weeks, hitting an all-time intraday high of 23.85 on Friday, but hasn't closed in buy range.Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).""HPE's Q4 results reflect challenges similar to those at Cisco: mixed regional execution but overall stable demand in the United States and some weakness in the United Kingdom,"" said Alex Kurtz, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report. ""A key catalyst is the potential treatment of its foreign cash under the new U.S. administration and how this could affect buybacks and/or M&A next year.""IBD'S TAKE:  Of the three large cap stocks in IBD's Computer-Tech Services group, HPE has the highest Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing. HPE's CR is 80 out of a possible 99, while Accenture's is 73 and IBM follows at 52. CACI International has a CR of 90, but it trades in low volume.Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, had a similar view after Cisco reported fiscal Q1 earnings on Nov. 17. ""Cisco has one of the largest overseas cash hoards at roughly $60 billion and has been a poster child for repatriation and corporate tax reform. At the very least, we expect Cisco could use repatriated cash to buy back stock and/or increase the dividend, which could boost shares,"" he wrote last week.Cisco guided to January-quarter earnings per share of 56 cents vs. consensus estimate of 59 cents.HPE said non-GAAP earnings rose 17% to 61 cents in the three months ended Oct. 31, while revenue, adjusted for divestitures and currency, fell 7% to $12.5 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected 60 cents and $12.8 billion.In the current quarter, HPE forecast profit of 44 cents at the midpoint of its guidance vs. consensus estimates of 46 cents.On  its earnings call, HPE told analysts that server revenue fell 6% and networking sales were flat, but solid-state flash storage was a bright spot, up 100% year over and now at an annual run-rate of $750 million.HPE might have lost share in the server market to Cisco, said a Jefferies report.HPE in May said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC). Then in September, HPE said it would spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International""Ahead of its pending divestiture, enterprise services posted a good quarter, with better-than-expected revenues and a strong margin performance,"" said Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a report. ""Within enterprise group, high-margin technology services revenues were also a bit better, an encouraging sign as HPE transitions itself.""Wrote Citigroup analyst Jim Suva in his report: ""While there are many moving parts to the business, we believe investors are under-appreciating the FCF (free cash flow) generation and net cash improvement for HPE"" since the former Hewlett-Packard split into two companies, HPE and the PC/printer company HP Inc., last November.Mizuho on Wednesday hiked its price target on Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock to 22 from 20.RELATED:Big Stock Buyback Boost Coming From Trump Tax Proposal: Goldman SachsCould HPE Go Shopping For Cisco Rival Arista Networks?HPE To Spin Off Software Unit, Slims Down As Dell Bulks UpWill Broadcom Chip Boost Arista Networks Vs.

251,ORCL,"For the broad market, a panic over a Donald Trump victory turned to a bull run the day after the election. But the hangover for the biggest and best-performing technology stocks of the Obama era has yet to fully dissipate.In some ways, that's not too surprising. Trump's election gave new reason to buy banks (higher interest rates and less regulation), steel (infrastructure and possible import tariffs), health care (less scrutiny on drug pricing and health insurance mergers) and a range of other sectors. Money managers had to sell something and tech was a pretty logical choice.Not only have managers' portfolios have been overweight in tech, but Trump butted heads during the campaign with Apple (AAPL) over encryption and outsourcing, with Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos over its online retail dominance and Washington Post political reporting, and with Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg over immigration. To top it off, all three of those stocks had slipped below their 50-day averages before the polls closed on Nov. 8, a technical signal that they were in consolidation mode. Shares of Amazon had tripped up after the e-commerce giant missed earnings estimates and gave a so-so holiday outlook amid big spending plans. Facebook advised that fourth-quarter revenue growth would slow meaningfully.Yet while politics is personal, investing isn't supposed to be, and it usually doesn't take markets long to sort out what matters to corporate bottom lines. So does the changing of the guard in the White House really augur a changing of the guard of stock market leadership? Or is this big tech Trump slump just a short-term adjustment to a changed landscape that won't derail their fundamental earnings power and stock market prowess?There are opinions on both sides because there's a great deal of uncertainty about what President Trump will do in office — especially when it comes to trade.DoubleLine Capital co-founder Jeffrey Gundlach, addressing investors via a webcast on Tuesday, advised selling the FANGs, reasoning that ""It's not a good idea to bet on things that were correlated to the regimes that have been defeated.""Yet more market strategists and analysts seem to think that a Trump administration won't diminish the attractiveness of some of the best-loved tech stocks of recent years, though there may be exceptions.""With the benefit of hindsight, the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)) should have been sold a few weeks ago, but I certainly wouldn't sell them now,"" Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, told IBD.""We would be buying the fear,"" Piper Jaffray tech analyst Gene Munster wrote in a Thursday research note, calling the recent declines a ""rare opportunity to buy pullbacks in companies with clear multiyear revenue and earnings trajectories.""Shares of Apple on Monday morning were back to their levels on Nov. 8 after sliding as much as 6%. Apple has retaken a 110.33 buy point on the stock market today but remains well off its 2016 peak on Oct. 25, when Apple reported mixed quarterly results and a cautious holiday outlook.Netflix shares haven't staged as much of a comeback and remain down 4.6% from their Election Day closes. But shares did find support above their 50-day moving average and are up nearly 3% Monday monring. Netflix was the one FANG stock to have a strong gain after its earnings report, and its shares didn't lose much ground into Election Day.In general, markets are expecting a more solid growth foundation at home, aided by tax cuts, infrastructure spending and a more lax regulatory climate, though that will generally be less of a boon to big technology companies which derive a high percentage of sales overseas.Since Trump's election, the 10-year Treasury yield has spiked by nearly a half percentage point to 2.33%, the highest since December 2015, pricing in a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index has hit 13-year highs, gaining vs. a basket of developed market currencies.The stronger dollar is a modest negative for the earnings of tech companies because profits earned abroad are worth less in dollar terms. Facebook generated 55% of sales outside the U.S. in the latest quarter, while international sales accounted for 62% of Apple's total.The biggest Trump-related uncertainty hanging over Apple is, of course, the possibility of rising trade tensions with China. Trump pledged during the campaign that his administration would label China a currency manipulator within his first 100 days in office, paving the way for possible tariffs on Chinese imports. China warned after Trump's victory via a Communist Party that ""iPhone sales will suffer a setback,"" as will other American products, if he imposes large tariffs on goods made in China, as discussed during the campaign.""Our 'Stay Home' investment strategy might make even more sense than the 'Go Global' alternative given the regime change in Washington,"" Yardeni says.Yet Yardeni doesn't think Trump will resort to trade wars, settling instead for modest improvement via negotiation and jawboning, of the sort that convinced Ford Motor (F) to keep a production line in Kentucky that was bound for Mexico.If Trump's tariffs turn out to be the dog that doesn't bark, then big techs could be net winners from his pro-growth plans. That's because Trump campaigned on cutting the tax rate to repatriate profits earned overseas to 10% from 35%. Apple, which has $216 billion in cash held overseas, would be the biggest winner from the change, which CEO Tim Cook has been seeking.Other big technology companies with major stores of cash held offshore include Microsoft (MSFT) ($111 billion), Cisco (CSCO) ($60 billion), Oracle (ORCL) ($51 billion) and Google ($50 billion), according to William Blair. The research firm thinks that the repatriated cash could ""spur an increase in M&A activity given that many large technology companies are looking for new avenues of growth.""The cash also could be used to boost dividends, buy back shares.Another area of concern about the Trump agenda among technology firms is immigration, high-skilled immigration in particular. The tech industry would like to see the 85,000 annual cap on H-1B skilled-worker visas, but the worry is that Trump will go the other direction. It's ""possible that Trump's administration could implement fees to make these visas more expensive to help protect U.S. workers from displacement — driving up wages even further for highly skilled talent and creating a shortage for specialized workers,"" wrote William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri and colleagues.While that could affect the FANGs at the margins, increasing compensation or requiring them to do more of their work outside of the U.S., ""IT services companies are likely to be hit the hardest (given their heavy reliance on temporary work visas) and business models will ultimately be affected and potentially need to change,"" Suri wrote.Vishal Sikka, CEO of India-based Infosys (INFY), told Reuters that its margins could be hurt if it can't send low-cost developers on temporary visas to work on U.S. projects. Company founder N.R. Narayana Murthy said that Infosys may need to cut its on-site teams in half, or less, in the U.S. and rely on more workers in India.While Trump's campaign platform on immigration and trade policies would be negative for the U.S. tech sector, ""Trump's election does not change these (three) trends"" that essentially determine the future of technology stocks, said Josh Spencer, manager of the Global Technology Equity Strategy at T. Rowe Price.Those three key trends include the growth of cloud computing, disruption of traditional industries due to the internet's increasing pervasiveness, and technologies pushing into new end markets, such as self-driving cars.Still, another of Trump's potential policies, a reversal of net neutrality rules that require similar treatment by telecommunications networks of any data transmitted over the internet, could shift the balance of power to some degree.""As video becomes an increasingly important growth driver for large-scale internet platforms (Prime Instant Video, YouTube, Facebook Live), the risks posed by a rollback of net neutrality magnify,"" wrote R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. ""Companies under our coverage that would be most impacted by net neutrality changes are Google, Amazon, and Facebook.""Meanwhile, a loosening of the rules that let carriers charge extra for ""fast lanes"" would stand to benefit AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA), notes Suri of William Blair.However, Trump said during the campaign that he opposed the planned AT&T buy of Time Warner (TWX).Still, taking all the potential tech-industry positives and negatives under a Trump administration together, William Blair still lists Facebook among its top picks. Microsoft is another megatech listed as a top pick. Suri clarified to IBD that Amazon remains a top pick for the firm based on sound fundamentals, but its research analysts left the company off their list of top performers in the postelection period because of its complicated relationship with Trump.RELATED:Apple Nears Buy Point As Most FANG Stocks Rise ModestlyApple, FANG Tech Leaders Still Have Trump HeadacheTime To Bite Into Apple, FANG Stocks: Piper JaffrayComcast: Does Trump Win Portend Regulatory Rollback?

252,ORCL,"Tech companies — at least of the few of the real biggies — continue to be cash-generating machines, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) having the most cash and equivalents of all U.S. nonfinancial companies, says a new report from Moody's Investor Service.Moody's predicts that cash holdings for all U.S. nonfinancial companies will reach $1.77 trillion by year-end, up 5% from last year, with the tech sector remaining dominant.The top five cash holders are all tech companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL). Together, Moody's projects, they will hold $587 billion, or 33% of the total nonfinancial corporate cash balance by the end of 2016. Cash figures include cash, cash equivalents and liquid marketable securities.Apple's cash holdings are expected to exceed $250 billion by year-end, or 14% of total nonfinancial corporate cash holdings.Microsoft will have $115 billion, with Alphabet at $85 billion, Cisco at $67 billion and Oracle at $68 billion.The technology sector's share of total cash will rise to 49% in 2016, up 4%.Most of the cash that companies have is generated and being held overseas. Moody's estimates that the amount of overseas cash will reach about $1.3 trillion, or 74% of total cash, in 2016. That's up from an estimated $1.2 trillion, or 72% of total cash, a year earlier.""Without tax reform that reduces the negative financial consequences of repatriating money to the U.S., we expect offshore cash levels to continue increasing,"" said Richard Lane, a Moody's senior vice president.Overseas cash from the top five tech companies is projected to reach $505 billion, or 86% of their total cash.Moody's said corporate cash holdings have more than doubled in the last 10 years, driven by rising cash levels at companies in the technology sector. Technology corporates now hold almost half of all cash that is held by U.S. nonfinancial companies.RELATED:Apple iPhone Grabs 104% Of Smartphone Industry Profit In Q3Microsoft Stock Rises To Record High As Cloud Leads Earnings Beat4 Top Stocks With Highest Dividend Growth RatesQ3 Bottom Line: Google A Cash Machine, Amazon A Free SpenderApple Loses Buy Point, Microsoft, BofA On Edge, Jobs On Tap: Investing Action Plan

""However, our closer examination highlights that a series of nonoperational, nonrecurring items are supporting the EPS.""We believe the structural profitability may continue to erode.""IBD'S TAKE: IBM hit a 52-week high last week, but which stocks are touching that level now? Quite a few, but always a good idea to parse these stocks by strength, which you find in IBD's New Highs. The companies are ranked by Composite Rating, which is based on key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.Garcha, who has an underperform rating on IBM stock, lowered his estimate for 2017 earnings per share to $12.64 from $12.74, vs. Wall Street consensus of $13.90.IBM stock, however, rose 1.7% to 168.25 in the stock market today.

The company has turned its focus to what it calls its strategic imperatives: cloud, mobile, security, data analytics and social business.In the meantime, though, Garcha says actions that have helped shore up its EPS in the past are less effective. He sees the company seeing lower returns from its intellectual property, for example. He says stock buybacks have helped but have ""led to an underinvestment in R&D.""He also says the job cuts and workforce rebalancing taking place at the company over the past five years ""has become less and less effective.""RELATED:IBM Among Megacaps At Buy Points; GE, Home Depot, Comcast, TooIBM CEO Among Those To Attend Trump Tech Summit

""So movement in the S&P 500, 90% of it was driven by people willing to pay more for stocks even though earnings didn't move. Only 10% was attributed to earnings moving up.""Going forward, Lafferty's team at Natixis, which has $874.5 billion under management, expects the U.S. to continue to outgrow Europe and Japan. But foreign stocks in general offer better values than U.S. equities. ""So we're leaning more to Europe in developed markets than to the U.S., where share prices already reflect expected growth,"" he said. ""And I'm fairly positive on emerging markets. But you must have a stomach for volatility.""Small-cap growth funds led U.S. diversifieds, gaining 5.77% last month. World equity funds rose 4.24% in July, lagging U.S. diversified stock mutual funds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersDavid Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, also sees U.S. growth outpacing the competition. But unlike Lafferty, he's more bullish about prospects for U.S. corporate earnings gains in the second half of the year. ""So looking at world equity markets, the only geography we are overweight in is the U.S.,"" Joy said.Macro trends fuel his outlook. Reported in July, U.S. jobs increased by 287,000 in June, a big jump up from the anemic 11,000 jobs gained in May. ""Retail sales and consumer activity look solid,"" Joy said. ""There was a rebound in manufacturing."" GDP rose at a 1.2% annualized rate in the second quarter, nearly double Q1's 0.8% pace.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance""Those create conditions that could lead to the long-anticipated recovery in earnings in the second half of the year,"" Joy said. ""And we're half through Q2 earnings season. They're not great. But they're a little better than expected.""The S&P 500 is trading at a multiple of about 20 times trailing corporate earnings but only a multiple of 17 on forward earnings. ""That disparity tells me that the market is looking down the road, seeing positive earnings growth, maybe in Q3 or Q4 and into next year,"" Joy added.His team's only sector overweights are in technology and telecommunications.Precious metals funds rose 10.46% last month, topping science and tech funds' 7.50% gain and health/biotech funds' 7.24% advance.""Our attraction to tech varies,"" Joy said. ""A couple of themes include: e-payments, return of capital, dividend yield and quality growth."" Apple (AAPL) and VeriFone Systems (PAY) are examples of companies helped by consumers' increasing use of e-payments, Joy says. Also, Apple boosted its share buyback program in April to $175 billion from $140 billion. Oracle (ORCL) said in March it is buying back $10 billion of shares this year. Cisco Systems (CSCO) carries a 3.4% dividend yield. And Alphabet (GOOGL) has shown durable earnings growth.Telecom is largely a yield play, he said.His team is also overweight in alternative investments to lessen its risk of volatility. ""Also, for investors who have the wherewithal and qualify, we want investments that might produce better returns, like private equity and venture capital,"" he said. ""You give up liquidity, but over time you have the opportunity to outperform.""And Joy warns investors to expect volatility in the run-up to the election, based on past election years. ""If the market is true to history, that will be the case again,"" he said.Volatility could also be fed by coming votes in a number of European nations that could hurt European Union cohesion, he added.Justin Kelly, lead manager of $15.4 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth (MLAIX), says prospects for outperformance are best in three traditionally growth-oriented sectors -- technology, health care and consumer discretionary.In tech, his fund has bet on Alphabet, Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V).""We like Alphabet based on continued strong market share gains in the global advertising market and improved cost discipline and capital deployment,"" he said.""Facebook is rapidly gaining share of the global advertising market as (advertisers find that) return on investment is much better in online than traditional offline media advertising spending,"" Kelly added. His team likes Microsoft because ""we think (Satya Nadella's) new management team will accelerate the company's earnings per share growth profile as they shift business to the cloud.""Visa (V) has a long-duration growth opportunity as we move from cash and checks to electronic payments, Kelly said. ""And we think they can grow at an above-average rate for a long time,"" he said.In health care, he holds orthopedic and dental implant maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) and medical-device maker Boston Scientific (BSX). ""Both have new products that are accelerating their growth and expanding their operating margins,"" he said.In the consumer discretionary sector, his team's bet on Home Depot (HD) reflects optimism about the U.S. housing cycle. ""Home Depot is the best way to play it because they're gaining share. And expanding their margins, they can grow earnings at attractive rates for years to come.""Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of midcap value $270 million GoodHaven Fund (GOODX), likes sectors and stocks that have been out of favor. Barrick Gold (ABX) edged up 2% in July and was up 196% this year through month end.Q2 earnings per share were up, the second quarter in a row of growth after 12 straight stanzas of declining EPS. The price of bullion has trended higher since December.Barrick Gold has trimmed $968 million in debt year to date and said it is on track to cut debt by $2 billion this year. ""They have reduced leverage and costs,"" Pitkowsky said. ""They are generating earnings and cash flow. There are many ways for them to grow intrinsic value from here.""He also likes Birchcliff Energy. Shares of the Canada-based oil and gas explorer and producer, which are trading below 10, rose 37% in July and were up 134% this year through July 29.EPS has fallen for six quarters, falling faster the two most recent quarters.Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

257,ORCL,"Do you find yourself doing more and more of the mundane tasks of life online -- buying groceries, filing a tax return, depositing a check, refilling a prescription? Here's something you need to know as ETF investors: So are businesses.That could mean exciting opportunities for those looking for successful investing ideas.Technology ETFs come in all stripes. The biggest and most popular tech exchange traded funds offer broad exposure to a sector that's been a winner for portfolios over the long term. A crop of smaller ETFs is worthy of attention too. They target specific tech industry niches that are gaining momentum after a sluggish year.As American companies make the great migration to the cloud, the computer software group is sizzling. Paycom Software (PAYC), which provides human-resources services via the cloud, has grown earnings an average 117% over the last three quarters. Veeva Systems (VEEV), which helps pharma and biotech companies sell and market their products over the cloud, has done a stellar job keeping down debt as it grew sales and profits over the last three years.Other highly rated IBD stocks in this group include Atlassian (TEAM), Ellie Mae (ELLI), CyberArk Software (CYBR), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and NetEase (NTES).IShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) is the largest of at least three ETFs that are thematic plays on the computer software industry. It hit an all-time closing high of 112.12 on the stock market Monday.This cap-weighted ETF has $775 million in assets and a 0.48% expense ratio. It holds 59 stocks, with the biggest stakes in tech giants Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE). It also has smaller positions in the likes of gaming company Activision and e-mortgager Ellie Mae.IGV has gained 6.1% in the third quarter through Aug. 12. Year to date, it is up 8.4%.Peers include PowerShares Dynamic Software Portfolio (PSJ), which skews toward smaller growth companies. This ETF aims to outperform by screening stocks based on risk factors, style classification and stock valuation, according to ETF.com.Paycom, Veeva and RealPage (RP), which caters to the rental housing market, are to be found in this portfolio. PSJ is outperforming its larger software-focused rival with a 7.8% gain this quarter and 12.6% gain so far in 2016. But it's thinly traded.The enterprise-computer software group ranks No. 6 among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD; it was No. 13 four weeks ago. The specialty enterprise computer software group has climbed from No. 120 to No. 13 over the same period.Shifting tech trends are also benefiting companies directly involved in the flow of electronic information. At least three stocks from the internet networking group make the elite IBD 50 list for their top-notch technical and fundamental metrics -- Gigamon (GIMO), LogMeIn (LOGM) and Rackspace Holdings (RAX).PowerShares Dynamic Networking Portfolio (PXQ) invests in 30 U.S. networking companies. These are typically internet-focused companies that support the ever-expanding flow of electronic communications, including voice, data, images and commerce.PXQ hit a 52-week high Monday. Its holdings include Gigamon, whose products help to optimize the reliability, performance and security of network infrastructure. With 72% average EPS growth over the last three quarters, Gigamon is top ranked in IBD's network-solutions group.The ETF also holds LogMeIn, which gives users remote access to their computers and mobile devices.PXQ  invests in companies that hold the potential to outperform based on their perceived quality and price and earnings momentum, but its trading volume and bid-ask spreads beg closer attention. It has $20.54 million in assets and a 0.63% expense ratio.A nearly 14% jump this quarter puts it ahead of most of its tech ETF peers and marks a sharp rebound after two down quarters. Year to date, the fund is up 8.1%.The internet/network-solutions group ranks No. 39 among the IBD industry groups vs. No. 69 four weeks ago.

258,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) early Thursday announced an agreement to acquire NetSuite (N) for $109 per share in cash, in a deal valued at $9.3 billion, continuing a wave of acquisitions in the software space and other tech sectors.Last month, Microsoft (MSFT) announced an agreement to buy LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.6 billion, and Salesforce.com (CRM) announced its agreement to buy Demandware for $2.8 billion.Salesforce, according to a regulatory filing, told LinkedIn it would have paid more than Microsoft. Private equity firms have also been active in gobbling up companies.NetSuite stock surged 18.4% to close at 108.41, while Oracle stock rose 0.6% to 41.19.Shares of enterprise software companies Workday (WDAY), Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA) rose 2.3%, 4.4% and 1.5% in the stock market today. Shopify (SHOP), Zendesk (ZEN) and Atlassian (TEAM) rallied 3.2%, 5.6% and 2.55%, respectively.IBD's TAKE: While IBD tracks 197 industry groups, those companies also are divided into 33 sectors. Atlassian is among the IBD Sector Leaders, a stringent and powerful screen for finding top stocks.Oracle's $109-per-share offer marks a 19% premium to NetSuite's closing price on Wednesday. But since NetSuite jumped 9.1% Wednesday on rumors of the Oracle buyout, the price is also a 30% premium to NetSuite's Tuesday close. NetSuite's stock last traded above 109 in January 2015.""Oracle and NetSuite cloud applications are complementary and will coexist in the marketplace forever,"" Mark Hurd, Oracle's co-CEO, said in a statement. ""We intend to invest heavily in both products -- engineering and distribution.""NetSuite sells cloud business software, including enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and e-commerce software.The deal will accelerate Oracle's move toward targeting medium-sized companies, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report. As a result, ""we expect investors to be more concerned about the competitive landscape for Workday, which has shown signs of investing in the mid-market,"" he wrote.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci agreed, writing in a research note that the acquisition ""provides (Oracle) an immediate, significant entry into the mid-market for corporate applications ... .""Early Thursday, NetSuite posted Q2 earnings and sales that beat Wall Street views. The cloud software maker said earnings per share minus items quadrupled to 8 cents from 2 cents in Q2 2015, as revenue rose 30% to $230.8 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 3 cents and $230.6 million. NetSuite did not give guidance in its earnings release, but analysts expect Q3 EPS ex items of 13 cents, up from 3 cents, on another 30% jump in revenue, to $250.4 million.Oracle founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison co-founded NetSuite in 1998 and has long had a stake in the company. As of March 31, Ellison and his family owned a 45.4% stake in NetSuite.The Oracle-NetSuite deal is expected to close this year.

259,ORCL,"The Dow Jones industrial average tried to join the other major indexes in positive territory with minutes left to go in Thursday's session, as earnings reports remained the focal point.In M&A news, Oracle (ORCL) struck a deal to acquire enterprise cloud services name NetSuite (N) for $9.3 billion. Shares of Oracle added 0.9%, while NetSuite soared 18.5%.Meanwhile, buyers were in Leaderboard name Amazon.com (AMZN) ahead of its earnings report after the close.

O'Reilly's earnings report was the catalyst.Inside the IBD 50, Facebook (FB) was near session lows but still rose 1.5%. The company delivered another solid quarter of growth late Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook sells at a premium valuation, but it's justified because of huge growth in recent quarters. To learn more about how earnings influence a stock's price, visit the IBD Learning Center.Another IBD 50 name, GrubHub (GRUB), soared 25% to a new 52-week high after second-quarter earnings and sales growth accelerated nicely from the first quarter.

260,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) reports quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday, with analysts looking for more insight on its transition to cloud computing and its acquisition of NetSuite.The Wall Street consensus is for earnings per share minus items to fall 5% from the year-earlier quarter to 60 cents, on a 1.7% revenue uptick to $9.14 billion, for its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30.The enterprise software giant has been steadily transitioning more of its business to the cloud and away from selling on-premise, licensed software.On Nov. 7, Oracle completed its $9.3 billion acquisition of NetSuite, a provider of cloud-based customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning software. Oracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison owned a nearly 40% stake in NetSuite.But UBS recently said several software vendors have hinted that the U.S. election and Brexit-related uncertainties have extended sales cycles and caused deal slippage.IBD'S TAKE: Oracle stock is up about 10% this year as it trudges through a flat base with a 42.10 buy point. Oracle moved above its 200-day moving average on Dec. 7, a bullish indicator. But the stock has a week IBD Composite Rating of 39, meaning it has been outperformed by 61% of stocks in the past year.Adobe Systems (ADBE) will also report earnings after the market close Thursday. Adobe also went through a cloud computing transition that is now paying off. Cowen recently rated Adobe as one of its top ideas for 2017. Adobe and Oracle will be the first of the big tech firms to report financials that include November, the month of Donald Trump's surprise presidential victory, which has sparked the stock market though not so much the tech sector.Ronsenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk has a buy rating and price target of 48 on Oracle stock.Senk expects Oracle to report cloud revenue of $1.05 billion, up 60%. And he said despite continued market share gains by No. 1 infrastructure-as-a-service cloud services provider Amazon.com (AMZN), he does not see that having a big impact on Oracle's platform-as-a-service cloud business in coming quarters.""For Amazon to take share in this market, we would need to see wholesale deflections off the Oracle database for large-scale production applications — which is a business risk we don't believe large customers are willing to take,"" Senk wrote in a research note.Oracle stock fell 1 cent to 40.51 in the stock market today.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White rates Oracle stock a buy, with a price target of 47.""We believe the worst of this cloud transition is behind Oracle,"" he wrote.RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan has an outperform rating on Oracle and price target of 43.RELATED:Trump Invites The Tech Leaders Who Opposed Him In For A TalkCoupa Software Earnings, Guidance Top Wall Street Expectations

262,ORCL,"Stocks opened lower Thursday as more earnings reports came out.The Dow industrials slid 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.3% and the Nasdaq 0.2%.Earnings reports provided the central force driving the stock market, with Facebook (FB), Ford (F), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Infinera (INFN) among the movers. NetSuite (N), however, soared on confirmation of a takeover bid from Oracle (ORCL).Unemployment claims jumped to 266,000 in the week ended July 23, the Labor Department estimated, up from 252,000 claims in the prior week and above consensus views for an increase to 264,000 claims. The four-week moving average dipped to 256,500, a fourth straight decline.The U.S. trade deficit widened to $63.3 billion in June, the Commerce Department said. That was up from May's $60.6 billion trade gap, and more than the $61.1 billion estimated by economists.In premarket trades, NetSuite spiked 18% after confirming Oracle had agreed to buy the cloud-based customer-relationship management programs leader in a deal valued at $9.3 billion. Oracle shares rose 2%.A host of names big and small were in motion in a busy reporting session early Thursday: AstraZeneca (AZN) gained 5% at the open. Total (TOT) added 2%.Facebook posted a 3% gain in early trading after reporting a 94% surge in earnings late Wednesday, along with a 60% revenue increase in its second quarter, easily clearing consensus views. Facebook, an IBD 50 and Leaderboard stock, ended Wednesday's session in a buy range above a 121.18 buy point from a flat base.Cirrus Logic stormed ahead 14%. The Austin, Texas-based chip designer reported after Wednesday's close that its second-quarter earnings fell for a fourth straight quarter, but both sales and earnings slipped much less than anticipated. The stock is working on its 11th consecutive weekly advance, and taking new highs.Cirrus peer Marvell Technology (MRVL) opened less than 1% higher. Its after-hours fiscal first-quarter report on Wednesday showed earnings and revenue falling for a sixth-straight quarter and further than forecast by analysts. But management guided second-quarter earnings and revenue above consensus views.Matress maker Tempur Sealy International (TPX) popped 15% after a strong second-quarter beat.Fiber-optic gear maker Infinera plummeted 33%, despite better-than-expected second-quarter sales and earnings. Chief Executive Tom Fallon said in a statement that ""demand is softening in certain areas of our business, and we face a difficult near-term revenue outlook.""Ford dropped 9% after a mixed second-quarter report, in which management said it may have trouble meeting its full-year earnings and revenue outlook. General Motors (GM) felt some of the downdraft, slipping 4%.Oil prices were little changed, with West Texas Intermediate rising a fraction to near$42 a barrel. Brent crude was down a half percent and just above $43. Gold added more than 1% to top $1,342 an ounce. The dollar was again mixed: up vs. the pound and the yen, but weaker against the euro. The 10-year Treasury yield gained 3 basis points to 1.53%.Markets overseas were generally quiet. China's leading indexes ended Wednesday's session mixed and in a tight range.

263,ORCL,"Housed in Las Vegas' former City Hall, Zappos headquarters is part college campus, part Vegas production. The main lobby boasts a wall of severed neckties -- volunteered by job interviewees and tour attendees who feel at one with Zappos' counter-corporate culture -- plus a popcorn machine and a playable ""ShoeZaphone,"" the latter courtesy of the Blue Man Group. When employees leave for the day, they are funneled through the front entrance by design, so that they may increase their ""collisionable hours,"" i.e., chances of bumping into and organically connecting with fellow ""Zapponians.""On a visit to the Amazon (AMZN)-owned e-commerce company by IBD last year, stacks of hay were strewn across the central quad, leftovers from the previous night's charity event that hosted both Britney Spears and a petting zoo. All rather peculiar for an internet business that sells shoes and clothes, perhaps. But the vision stems from CEO Tony Hsieh, the 42-year-old entrepreneur who has made clear that he puts passion and company culture above profits.""A lot of people or companies talk about work-life separation or work-life balance, and we're really much more about work-life integration,"" Hsieh told IBD last year. ""And so a lot of people, when they go into the office, at their companies, probably most companies, they're a different person at home on weekends hanging out with their friends, vs. when they're in the office with co-workers. And they end up leaving a little part of themselves, or in a lot of cases, a big part of themselves, at home.""A curiously soft-spoken rave enthusiast who loves llamas, Hsieh reportedly lives modestly, in a trailer park in downtown Vegas. Encouraging workers to be themselves and get involved with the community leads to greater productivity, he posits.It is those quirky ideals -- culture, self-expression, ""a little weirdness,"" per Zappos' core values -- that have guided Hsieh through Silicon Valley's dot-com boom and bust and to what he hopes will become a thriving new community in the middle of the desert.The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Hsieh was born in Illinois and raised in Northern California, about a 20-minute drive from George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. By Hsieh's own account in his memoir-slash-business-history, ""Delivering Happiness,"" his parents wanted him to get a PhD. But a tireless entrepreneurial spirit emerged early. As a 9-year-old, he tried his hand at breeding earthworms in an attempt to become ""the No. 1 worm seller in the world."" (Spoiler alert: He did not. The worms escaped.) In middle school, he flirted with the publishing business with a newsletter, ""The Gobbler."" (Discontinued after the second issue.) But a button-making business wound up raking in about $200 a month, planting the idea in Hsieh's mind as early as middle school that ""it was possible to run a successful business by mail order, without any face-to-face interaction."" Fast-forward to college -- Harvard, to please his ambitious parents -- and Hsieh's self-starter tendencies continued to wriggle free of the grasp of traditional academia. He crowdsourced a study guide, collecting research from classmates and then selling the collaboration back to contributors for $20 a pop. Later, he turned a profit on buying and then reselling McDonald's burgers at his fast-food-free campus.Not long after that, he started a pizza business on the first floor of his dorm, calculating that the low-cost pies would provide high margins. Unbeknownst to Hsieh at the time, fellow Harvard student and ""No. 1 customer"" Alfred Lin was actually reselling individual slices of those pizzas to his dorm mates, Hsieh recounted in his book. Perhaps fittingly, Lin would later become Zappos' CFO and COO.Working for someone else was never Hsieh's style -- taking a job at Oracle (ORCL) right out of college, he quit after just five months to start his own business.Hsieh was perhaps best known in the mid-to-late 1990s for co-creating with Sanjay Madan the web advertising network LinkExchange, which offered companies free ad space on other web pages if they, in exchange, hosted banner ads on their own sites. Some of the remaining ad space would then go to paying customers.The pair sold the startup to Microsoft (MSFT) for $265 million less than three years after its 1996 inception, following a period of hypergrowth that brought in too many new hires that, in Hsieh's estimation, were driven by the prospect of financial gain instead of passion for the company. ""The reason we ended up selling the company was that the company culture ended up going completely downhill, and it just wasn't a fun place to work at anymore,"" Hsieh told IBD. ""So for me, I didn't want to repeat the same mistake again at Zappos, and from the beginning, culture was always important.""After first investing in and then joining Zappos in 1999, Hsieh's happiness-focused ideals have been integral to shaping the company's goals, both existentially and financially. Internally, there are events like Bald and Blue, in which employees shave their heads for charity, while externally, Hsieh's team tries to cultivate working relationships with vendors that aren't simply about squeezing suppliers to benefit the bottom line, and has a perhaps unusual devotion to customer service.Part of Hsieh's emphasis on culture prompted him to move the company from San Francisco to Nevada, because ""Bay Area people didn't want to work in a call center,"" and he did not take to the idea of outsourcing calls, as many other companies do.His dedicated Zappos customer-service call center will field just about any question, and staff members aren't pushed to upsell customers or rush them off the phone. Zappos call center rep Steven Weinstein reportedly broke the record on June 11 for the longest customer call, chatting to the caller for a whopping 10 hours and 43 minutes.""It was excellent, the connection was amazing, and even though I never spoke to this customer before in my life, I felt like I knew her for 15 or 20 years,"" he told Business Insider in July.Zappos' customer-first attitude has paid off: In its first 10 years, it went from being a company with precious few sales to a billion dollars in annual gross merchandise sales, said Hsieh in his book. And its acquisition by Amazon in 2009, valued at $1.2 billion, has left the culture untouched. ""We're very different from their other subsidiaries or acquisitions, where prior to the acquisition, the only way we would consider doing it is if they left us independent and we could continue to have our own culture and brand (and) different way of doing business,"" Hsieh told IBD. He thinks of the ""marriage"" to Amazon as simply swapping out Zappos' previous board of directors for a new one.As a leader, Hsieh is described as being fairly hands-off. ""He likes to give space and opportunities to people. (He's) definitely not a micromanager by any means,"" Jeanne Markel, Hsieh's technical advisor, told IBD in early 2015. She says he is always ""very open"" to listening to employees' suggestions and ideas. ""As crazy as his schedule is, he's very accessible and willing to listen. I think he gives people a lot of rope,"" she said. Hsieh says Zappos employees ""work together, we hang out together. . . . I don't really manage their time.""The Zappos office reveals a little slice of Silicon Valley quirkiness that Hsieh has brought to Vegas. There's a resident ""life coach."" The gym walls feature prison bars from the old City Hall jail cell. Leading a tour group through the HR department, a Zappos guide flips on a switch, and employees jump up and begin dancing with Shake Weights in hand.Eccentricities aside, some of Hsieh's tactics are controversial. His implementation of ""holacracy"" -- a manager-less management style that nixes a conventional top-down hierarchy in favor of self-organized ""circles"" -- is meant to help the company run more like a city than a business.""It's designed to be constant change, and so I think, for some people, that's definitely uncomfortable,"" he said, later adding that ""there are so many companies that were big companies, great (companies) from 30 years go, even 10 years ago, that now are irrelevant or out of business because they couldn't adapt to the changing environment. And so holacracy allows the organization to be a lot more flexible and adaptable."" In his March 2015 announcement of the self-management plan, Hsieh offered voluntary buyouts to employees unwilling to follow it. And according to a blog post by current Zappos COO Arun Rajan, 18% of the company, or 260 employees, opted to leave.""If they're in this for the money, then they're not in it for the right reasons,"" Markel told IBD after ""The Offer,"" as it was called in-house, was made.Beyond the company, Hsieh's perhaps-even-loftier vision involves revitalizing all of Downtown Las Vegas. He has notably invested $350 million into the downtrodden area north of the shimmering, tourist-heavy Strip. The Downtown Project co-owns and invests in over 300 businesses, by its count, including the members-only dog park Hydrant Club; the whiskey cocktail bar Oak & Ivy; and the Downtown Container Park, a collection of shipping containers that house small businesses. (Hsieh's Burning Man sensibilities have extended to the decor. A 55-foot-tall, fire-breathing,  metal praying mantis sits at the entrance of the shopping center.)At the Airstream trailer park, where Hsieh lives, there are ""campfires almost every night, except in the summer (when) it's really hot,"" said Daniel Park, a musician and fellow trailer resident who sees Hsieh around the park ""almost every day.""There is just one entrance. The neighbors share community laundry, kitchen and pantry facilities, including a ""big fridge usually filled with beer"" and a nearby ""giant piggy bank"" that funds refills with resident donations, he said. They hang out often, playing board games or video games or just drinking around the fire.""A big living room is what we have,"" said Park, who added that the space also houses two resident alpacas. Rent is around $1,000 a month, he said.Downtown Project said last year that it generates $118.9 million in annual economic impact, citing an Applied Analysis report, and has created over 1,000 jobs in the area. But media reports have cast doubt on the development effort's success, after about 30 project staffers were laid off in 2014 with a source telling Recode then that local businesses were ""bleeding money."" Hsieh has waved off critiques of the Downtown Project, arguing that it takes 10 to 20 years for most revitalization projects to cement. And Park described it as ""still changing, but always for the better. The vibes are great down here."" He highlighted the local art, music and mom-and-pop restaurants, but feels ""we just need more housing downtown.""Checking in with Hsieh a year after IBD's initial visit, the entrepreneur remains bullish about both holacracy and the Downtown Project. This year he is looking forward to ""getting everyone (at Zappos) up to speed and fluent in holacracy,"" and building out residential developments in Downtown Las Vegas, he said via email in February. He only wishes he had done both sooner.That optimism harks back to something he had said in early 2015.""I think there's a segment of the population that wants to know what the plan is. 'What are steps 1 through 10?' "" Hsieh then told IBD. ""And there's others that really -- me, for example -- that really enjoy the creativity and improvisation that comes with not knowing how things will turn out, but at the same time having the confidence and faith that you'll figure it out.""Built Zappos into a billion-dollar brand.Overcame: The rigidity of traditional corporate structures.Lesson: Get comfortable with change.""There is a quote that is often attributed to Darwin (whether Darwin actually said it is up for debate, but I believe the general principle to be true): 'It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives.

265,ORCL,"It's no Thursday, but Monday has proved to be no slouch in the tech mergers and acquisitions department.Tesla Motors (TSLA)-SolarCity (SCTY), Verizon Communications (VZ) -Fleetmatics Group (FLTX), and Trina Solar (TSL)-private equity deals have tallied up $6.1 billion worth of transactions to start the week and the month.Thursday topped it by far, though. That day, Analog Devices (ADI) announced its agreement to acquire rival Linear Technology (LLTC) for $14.8 billion, the latest major chip industry merger, while Oracle (ORCL) continued its push into cloud software with its $9.3 billion agreement to acquire NetSuite (N).IBD'S TAKE: In only one area does Tesla get a good grade, as you can learn quickly from IBD's Stock Checkup. The e-car maker has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, meaning institutions currently are buying more or the stock than selling it.It again is a heady time for M&A, especially in the technology field, and especially in the U.S. In its 10th annual survey of its type, Big Four accounting firm KPMG early this year found that 550 U.S. decision-makers were forecasting that 2016 just might set a record for M&As -- a record that dates all the way back to ... 2015. KPMG counted $4.7 billion in U.S. M&A in 2015, topping a record that had stood since 2007.Factors boosting M&A, says KPMG, include the relatively robust economic prospects for the U.S., as well as an optimal financing climate in the face of continued low interest rates, and record corporate cash reserves.In Monday's deals:Fleetmatics and Trina Solar shares both soared in the stock market today. Fleetmatics catapulted by nearly 39% to 59.59 by the close while Trina surged by more than 25% to 10.33. Tesla stock finished the day down 2% to 230.01 while Verizon was off 1.6% to 54.50. Meanwhile, SolarCity plunged by 7.4% to 24.72.

266,ORCL,"Apple (AAPL) approached a buy point and most of the FANG stocks rose modestly Wednesday, now six weekdays since the surprise presidential election of Donald Trump — who has had some pointed criticism for the tech industry — sent big tech stocks tumbling before modestly rebounding the past two days.In fact, Apple and the other large FANG internets — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — had started falling at least two weeks before Election Day (except for Google-owner Alphabet, whose downturn began Oct. 28). All four FANGs had been trading at or near all-time highs, but mixed earnings for Apple, Amazon and Alphabet weighed on the group.But after the election, a sector rotation ensued, with industries such as drugs and banks getting a lift from Trump's win, and techs, alternative-energy and other arenas getting hit.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest tech companies, of course, aren't necessarily the best tech stocks for investors at any given time. Which techs are best? There are tons of opinions and answers when asking that question, but a good source to put on your checklist is IBD's Tech Leaders.But Trump's election-campaign views and expected priorities have good as well as bad connotations for tech industries.William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri summed it up in a research note Wednesday:""Overall, we believe his views on global trade, net neutrality and internet privacy, and immigration could have negative consequences for technology companies, but his tax plan (including reducing the repatriation tax rate to 10%) would be a net positive given the large amount of foreign cash that many technology companies possess.""Trump's repatriation tax plan could bring big bucks back to the U.S. for the top five companies with overseas holdings. Besides Apple and Alphabet, the top five include Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).In his note, Suri was not shy about pointing out what Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle might target with that cash. Microsoft, he said, might go after ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO) or Symantec (SYMC). Cisco he sees eyeing FireEye (FEYE), Gigamon (GIMO) and F5 Networks (FFIV). Oracle, he says, might take a run at Veeva Systems (VEEV) or Tableau Software (DATA).In the meantime, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix rose for a second straight day. Facebook was the only decliner, falling 0.73% to 116.34, after touching a more than four-month low of 113.55 on Monday.Apple was the big gainer of the bunch on Wednesday, rising 2.7% to 110.04. That was easily its best day since Trump's win, marking its biggest percentage gain since Sept. 14. It is nearing a 118.79 buy point out of a flat base.Netflix stock rose a fraction to 115.17. It's forming a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 129.40.Shares of Alphabet and Amazon rose 0.62% and 0.39%, respectively.RELATED:Apple, FANGs Stop The Bleeding Post-Trump

268,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) announced Friday that it's extended the expiration of its tender offer for the acquisition of NetSuite (N), for the final time, to Nov. 4, sending NetSuite shares falling.""This will be the final extension that Oracle is obligated to make under the merger agreement,"" Oracle said in a statement.In July, Oracle announced an agreement to acquire NetSuite for $109 per share in cash, in a deal valued at $9.3 billion, continuing a wave of tech and software acquisitions.If a majority of NetSuite's unaffiliated shareholders do not tender sufficient shares to reach the minimum tender condition, ""Oracle will respect the will of NetSuite's unaffiliated shareholders and terminate its proposed acquisition,"" it said.Unaffiliated refers to a condition that the deal get majority approval from shareholders other than NetSuite's biggest shareholder, Larry Ellison, co-founder and executive chairman of Oracle, or anyone affiliated with Ellison or his family, or any of NetSuite's executive officers or directors.On Sept. 9, Oracle announced the extension of its tender offer to Oct. 6, from Sept. 15.NetSuite offers cloud-based customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning software. Longtime database leader and business software powerhouse Oracle has been transitioning more of its business to the cloud, and more enterprises move more of their operations to the cloud.NetSuite stock sank 3.8% to 105.19 in the stock market today. Netsuite shares, which had barely budged since the July deal announcement, fell below its 50-day line.Oracle stock fell a penny, to 38.71.IBD'S TAKE: Oracle is transitioning to an on-demand, cloud-based software model. The combination of their cloud applications are complementary and will accelerate Oracle's move toward targeting medium-sized companies. Oracle, though, has some poor ratings, as you can learn at IBD Stock Checkup.Per the terms of the merger agreement, Oracle said, a majority of the unaffiliated shares, or 20.4 million total, must be tendered in order for the minimum condition to be satisfied and the tender offer to be completed. In aggregate, there are approximately 81.47 million shares issued and outstanding.RELATED:Oracle Cloud Makeover Accelerating, But Fiscal Q1 Results Miss

269,ORCL,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. The S&P 500 hitting a new record high Friday but closed the week down fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion. The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in mid-September.Apple stock rose 5.6% for the week, just retaking its 200-day line.Amazon Q2 EPS of $1.78 shattered the estimate of $1.11. Revenue rose 30% to 30.4 billion. Amazon Web Services continued to boom. Revenue guidance for Q3 also was strong, though operating income may be light.Amazon stock rose 1.9% to 758.81 for the week, hitting a record 766 intraday Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is a Leaderboard stock, hitting new highs as growth booms. But it's only rated No. 4 in IBD's Retail-Internet group. To see who's No. 1, go to IBD Stock Checkup. Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59% and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital. ""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

The company had formed a cup-with-handle base and briefly reached that buy point, but then it faltered in the wake of Great Britain's vote to leave the European Union.

272,ORCL,"Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM) or Symantec (SYMC) could make a play for database-monitoring firm Imperva (IMPV), RBC analyst Matthew Hedberg said Monday, responding to reported rumors that Imperva is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.Imperva shot up during the regular session, but wiped out those gains and more after releasing preliminary Q2 earnings and revenue far short of its earlier guidance and Wall Street expectations.Elliott owned 10.9% of Imperva stock as of June 27, according to the company's most recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Elliott is seeking to work with Imperva on ""strategic and operational opportunities,"" it said.But Imperva could seek a financial advisor as early as this week to help it review options, including a potential sale, and to help it deal with Elliott, Reuters reported Friday, citing anonymous sources.After the close, Imperva said it now expects to post a Q2 per-share loss minus items of 20 cents to 22 cents, on sales of $57.5 million to $58 million. It earlier had guided to a per-share loss ex items of 2 cents to 4 cents on sales of $65.5 million to $66.5 million.Imperva clsoed up 7.6% to 48.41 Monday after spiking as high as 51.70, a 5-month best. But shares tumbled nearly 12% in after-hours trading.""We are disappointed with our second-quarter financial results, which were primarily impacted by extended sales cycles across most geographies and verticals predominantly relating to larger deals,"" Imperva CEO Anthony Bettencourt said in the company's press release. ""During the quarter, we also experienced a reduction in size of several large purchases.""Hedberg, in his note released early Monday well before Imperva's release, kept his 55 price target and outperform rating on Imperva stock. He sees a bid of $55 to $78 per share, about $1.76 billion to $2.5 billion, as a fair bid on Imperva. That would be a 23%-75% premium to Friday's closing price at 44.76.""Overall this shouldn't come as a surprise to investors given activist pressure and uneven results in Q1,"" Hedberg wrote in a research report. During Q1, Imperva's Europe/Middle East/Africa sales stalled, prompting the firm to remove its EMEA head of sales.Imperva's bread-and-butter database activity monitoring offers opportunities and the potential for replacing IBM. That piece could be strategic for Cisco, IBM, Oracle (ORCL) or Symantec, Hedberg says. Symantec is planning to acquire Blue Coat Systems and reportedly tried to buy FireEye.Imperva's cloud assets might interest Microsoft (MSFT) Azure or Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Hedberg wrote.

273,ORCL,"Analysts expressed relief and hope after Oracle (ORCL) gave solid guidance and posted a sales beat.Amid its big transition to cloud computing, the longtime database software leader reported fiscal Q4 earnings late Thursday that met estimates and revenue that edged Wall Street views. And fiscal Q1 guidance came in roughly in line. Oracle is dealing with the major computing trend of companies and other enterprises converting from on-premise software licensed for the long term to software-as-a-service delivered via the internet cloud.""Our broad take on Oracle's earnings call is better than feared, since we (and we believe many investors) assumed that Oracle would guide lower,"" wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman, who maintained a market perform rating on Oracle stock and price target of 45.""While we are moving our numbers lower, we had assumed/feared a larger variance,"" Bachman wrote in a research note.Oracle stock rose 2.7% to 39.68 in the stock market today.

White maintained a buy rating and price target of 51.William Blair analyst Jason Ader maintained a market perform rating on Oracle.""The transition to cloud at Oracle is accelerating, even though overall revenue growth has so far been anemic in constant currency,"" Ader wrote. ""The challenge for Oracle is to deliver on its promises to get margins back up as cloud investments scale, while managing a hardware business facing significant secular challenges,"" he wrote.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle maintained a sector weight rating.""We remain on the sidelines while Oracle transitions to the cloud due to uncertainty around the transition,"" Barnicle wrote.""Oracle is seeing an acceleration in cloud, which is likely to create uncertainty and inconsistency in its model during this transition,"" Barnicle said. ""Therefore, despite a relatively attractive valuation for Oracle, we see limited upside from current levels.""

274,ORCL,"Amid a big transition to cloud computing, longtime database software leader Oracle (ORCL) late Thursday reported fiscal Q4 earnings in line with estimates, while revenue edged Wall Street views. And fiscal Q1 guidance came in roughly in line.Oracle reported earnings per share minus items of 81 cents, up 4% from a year earlier, for the quarter ended May 31. That reversed four straight quarters of revenue deceleration year over year.Revenue fell 1% to $10.6 billion, slightly above the consensus of $10.47 billion, as polled by Thomson Reuters. That was Oracle's fifth quarter in a row of declines in sales year over year.For fiscal Q1, Oracle sees EPS ex items of 56 cents to 60 cents, up 9% at the midpoint and vs. consensus of 59 cents. It sees revenue growth, in constant currency, of 2% to 5%, saying it expects currency headwinds will reduce the net top-line figure by one percentage point. The Wall Street consensus is net growth of 2%.Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White applauded the results.“With another strong quarterly performance, we believe the worst of this cloud transition is behind Oracle and our model indicates the company is past the trough in its operating profit cycle,” White wrote in a research note.He maintained a buy rating on Oracle stock, and a price target of 51.Oracle stock was up more than 2% in after-hours trading Thursday, after the company released its earnings. Oracle closed the regular session at 38.64, up a fraction.The longtime business software powerhouse is dealing with the conversion from on-premise software licensed for the long term to software-as-a-service delivered via the internet cloud.The company said its cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue jumped 66% to $689 million, and it forecast that those sales would rise 75% to 80%, year over year, in the current fiscal Q1. Total cloud revenue in Q4, including the third component of that sector, infrastructure-as-a-service, reached $859 million in revenue, up 49%.For the fiscal year, total cloud revenue rose 36% to $2.9 billion. Oracle said it added more than 1,600 new SaaS customers and more than 2,000 new PaaS customers in Q4.""We expect that the SaaS and PaaS hyper-growth we experienced in fiscal 2016 will continue on for the next few years,"" Larry Ellison, Oracle's executive chairman and chief technology officer, said in a statement with the earnings release. ""That gives us a fighting chance to be the first cloud company to reach $10 billion in SaaS and PaaS revenue.""But the cloud still represents a small portion of the company's overall business. Oracle posted fiscal 2016 revenue of $37 billion, down 3%.Oracle has been on a rocky road over the last few years, as the company was late to the cloud. Its legacy database business is under major pressure.Oracle said Q4 on-premise software revenue fell 3% to $7.58 billion.

275,ORCL,"Everything is for sale in tech markets -- with giants such as Apple (AAPL) among those actively looking -- though little is actually being sold, according to the latest report from M&A research firm Mergermarket, part of financial news and analysis provider Mergermarket Group.Mergermarket's overview of the first half of 2016 tracked the fewest number of tech, media and telecom (TMT) mergers and acquisitions, and the lowest deal value, since the first half of 2013.This is a ""rebalancing"" that follows a record 2015, the deal tracker said in its report, released Wednesday.China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) led the way in the first half of the year, with its $8.6 billion deal to acquire 84% of Finland's Supercell, the maker of such popular games as ""Clash of Clans."" Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) was the seller.Symantec's (SYMC) $4.6 billion agreement to acquire privately held Blue Coat Systems from Bain Capital was also among the few big deals for the period. Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will become Symantec's CEO.But there were no ""megadeals"" of $10 billion-plus in the TMT sectors in the first half, compared with a record nine such deals in the year-earlier period, Mergermarket said. The firm counted 1,363 M&As in these fields in the first half of this year, down 16% from 1,580 in the year-earlier period. And the value of the deals fell 42%, to $223.1 billion.Telecom deal value plummeted 82% to $27.1 billion, Mergermarket said, the sector's lowest six-month tally since the first half of 2009. The numbers of deals fell to 78 from 100 in the first half of 2015.The IPO market, similarly, has been in the doldrums, with activity hitting a seven-year low in Q1, though Q2 did see some pickup.One reason for the decline noted by Mergermarket is that many tech companies are ""at the beginning of their innovation life cycle, and as a consequence, less mature businesses are coming to market commanding smaller price tags.""Indeed, Apple's deals so far this year were all small enough as to be immaterial, so the company didn't release terms for its acquisitions of such companies as Emotient, LearnSprout, Flyby Media and LegbaCore. Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, has said the company is actively looking for M&A opportunities.Apple, with a hoard of cash and equivalents worth more than $200 billion, can at times go big on M&As, such as its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, announced in 2014.The research firm also said European activity slowed in part because of the run-up to the Brexit vote.The report quoted Jennifer Nason, global chairman of TMT banking at JPMorgan, as saying Oracle (ORCL) is among companies that might be active in M&A for cloud software companies. ""A lot of tech companies are picking verticals to focus on,"" Nason said in the report.On Thursday, security software maker AVG Technologies (AVG) announced an agreement to be acquired by privately held Avast Software for $1.28 billion.

276,ORCL,"Yahoo's (YHOO) search advertising business struggled again in Q2 -- no surprise there. But the reason why Yahoo mentioned Apple (AAPL) in connection with its search business on its earnings call is a mystery, says Macquarie Securities.Yahoo's net search revenue declined 23% from the year-earlier quarter, to $319 million. Like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Yahoo has been transitioning to mobile.""In our view, if Yahoo can't somehow turn around search, it is going to struggle to grow margins meaningfully,"" Ben Schachter, a Macquarie Securities analyst, said in a research report. ""If we are able to get more clarity on why the company mentioned Apple in regards to search, or if we learn that Facebook's (FB) Audience Network is being deployed more broadly, that may be of interest to shareholders.""Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer cited Apple as a search partner.""With search making up more than half of our GAAP revenue, it remains an important area of our business,"" said Mayer on the company's earnings conference call. ""Today, our search business is built on strong partnerships with Microsoft (MSFT), Google, Mozilla, Apple and Oracle (ORCL), among others.""In late 2014, Yahoo signed a deal with privately held Mozilla to replace Google as Mozilla's default U.S. search engine. And Yahoo renewed its search partnership with Microsoft in April 2014.Evan Wilson, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, said in a report late Monday that Yahoo's search advertising business continues to struggle.""Yahoo blames the transition to mobile, but it is clear that its technology improvements and Microsoft and Firefox deals have not been able to turn around this very important revenue driver,"" Wilson wrote.Yahoo also says its Tumblr social network has started using Facebook Audience Network for advertising.IBD's TAKE: Facebook hovers near a buy point, remains a large-cap leader and continues to be an IBD Leaderboard stock.Google's search engine is the default on most mobile devices, and it's the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser. However, there has been speculation over whether Apple and Google will renew the Safari contract, or whether they have modified it.Yahoo late Monday reported Q2 revenue that edged above views, but its earnings missed. Yahoo had little to say on the sale of its core internet business, a process that has dragged on longer than some observers expected.""I can say we are deep into the process, evaluating proposals and alternatives, and will update our shareholders as soon as is prudent,"" Mayer said.Verizon Communications (VZ), which bought AOL last year, remains the front-runner to buy Yahoo's internet business, many analysts say.Yahoo stock was up 0.6% at the close on the stock market today, to 38.17.

277,ORCL,"Analysts weighed in on the Nike (NKE) fourth-quarter earnings report, with most seeing positive signs.Research firms also adjusted their outlooks for Alphabet (GOOGL) and Oracle (ORCL), while starting coverage on Shopify (SHOP) and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX).Nike shares sold off after the close on Tuesday after the athletic shoe and apparel giant reported earnings that beat estimates by a penny a share, but also fell short on sales and orders. But the stock recovered and then some as analysts mostly were upbeat about the outlook. Nike stock jumped 3.8% to 55.13, its best gain since last November.Among 11 analysts, seven kept buy ratings on Nike, with one overweight and one outperform. Two others had a hold or equal weight rating. Stifel reiterated a buy, but trimmed its price target to 68 from 73. UBS had a 70 target. On the other end of the spectrum, Canaccord's target was 56.Axiom Capital kept a buy rating on Google parent Alphabet and continued to see huge upside in the dominant online search company. Still, the research firm pared its price target slightly, to 970 from 1001.Alphabet shares were up 0.6% at 695.19.JPMorgan upgraded the enterprise software company to neutral, noting that investor sentiment toward Oracle has been extremely negative, but that it now faces easier revenue and earnings comparisons to prior-year results. Still, the analysts gave Oracle just a 38 price target, below its Tuesday close of 39.13.Oracle stcok climbed 3.6% to 40.55, retaking the 50-day line.Monness Crespi Hardt started coverage on Shopify, a cloud-based software provider for small businesses, with a buy rating and 35 target.Shopify stock jumped 6.2% to 30.32.H.C. Wainwright started coverage on Neurocrine with a buy rating and 80 price target. Shares rose 3.4% to 45.39.

278,ORCL,"Microsoft (MSFT) remains the top ""strategic vendor"" of large companies, but Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Red Hat (RHT) will make gains over the next three years, thanks to their cloud computing prowess, says a Goldman Sachs survey of chief information officers.Microsoft, with its Office suite, is the leading provider of business productivity software, which is widely used in corporate data centers. Microsoft has also expanded into cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, part of e-commerce giant Amazon, is by the far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), but Microsoft is No. 2, and Alphabet-owned Google No. 3. In the IaaS market, customers rent computers and data storage via the internet cloud.Microsoft rose 0.55% to 52.59 in the stock market today after retaking its 50-day and 200-day moving averages last week. Amazon climbed 1.1% to a new record high. Alphabet advanced 1.3%, moving above its 50-day line close to its 200-day.Large companies continue to shift business workloads to cloud service providers, the Goldman Sachs survey says. Large companies have shifted 11% of their business workloads to public clouds, the Goldman Sachs CIO survey said in June, up from 6% in a December 2015 survey.""Google and Amazon are expected to be the second- and third-most-strategic vendors in three years, despite not ranking in the top five currently,"" said the Goldman Sachs report.While Microsoft is the top strategic vendor, IBM (IBM) overtook Cisco Systems (CSCO) as the second-most important provider of IT technology in the June survey of CIOs. IBM has also pushed into cloud computing.Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) round out the top five most strategic vendors.""In terms of being the most strategic vendor three years from now, Google, Amazon and Red Hat are expected to be the biggest gainers, and IBM, SAP, and Oracle are expected to be the biggest losers relative to their current position,"" said Goldman Sachs in the report.

279,ORCL,"Zendesk's (ZEN) upcoming Facebook (FB)-based messaging product is an example of how the software company will innovate as it drives toward a $1 billion annual revenue goal, says UBS, which initiated coverage with a buy rating on Thursday.Zendesk, a provider of customer-support software, recently set a goal of reaching $1 billion in annual sales by 2020. It posted 2015 sales of $209 million, up 64%.The goal is a tall order, said UBS analyst Brent Thill in his research note, which set a price target of 32 on Zendesk stock.""There have only been two front-office sales/service software vendors that have ever made it to $1 billion in annual revenues – Salesforce.com (CRM) and Siebel Systems,"" said Thill in his research report. Oracle (ORCL) bought Siebel Systems in 2006.He says Zendesk does not plan on an acquisition spree to hit its target. Zendesk does plan on selling more products to larger companies and enterprises, expanding from its base of smaller and midsize businesses. Thill says Zendesk will likely expand into sales or marketing software.Zendesk has provided customer support via email, live chat and phone.To help its customers interact with consumers via social media, Zendesk plans to roll out a messaging product by early 2017. It announced a messaging platform at Facebook's F8 conference in April. Salesforce.com also plans a similar product using Facebook's messenger.""Zendesk's platform will increasingly be viewed as a strategic differentiator and an asset that drives revenues from consumers who interact with support teams,"" wrote Thill. ""We expect Zendesk to continue its record of outperforming expectations as it expands its product capabilities and moves upmarket into the enterprise.""Zendesk stock was up 2.3% to 27.90 in the stock market today. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 26.10 buy point on June 3.

280,ORCL,"Among investors in the largest U.S. companies, no pay package is less popular than the one given to Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares.Only 23% of the shares of the housewares retailer were voted in support of its compensation plan at an annual meeting on July 1, the lowest level in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shareholders told the board that the CEO's $19.4 million pay for 2015 was too high, and that his performance goals weren't challenging enough, the Union, N.J.-based company said in its May proxy statement.New York Comptroller Scott Stringer, representing city pension funds, weighed in on the matter with a letter to Bed, Bath & Beyond investors. There's a ""gaping and persistent disconnect between CEO pay and company performance,"" he wrote. The retirement funds, with $160 billion in assets, are among the company's 60 largest shareholders.Bed, Bath & Beyond, which sells everything from coffee to accent rugs, is reducing Temares' target compensation by 14% for 2016 and is making his performance goals more rigorous, according to its proxy statement. Janet Barth, a spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the regulatory filing.Shareholder disapproval of Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay practices contrasts with a falling number of businesses that fail in so-called say-on-pay votes. About 1% of S&P 500 companies have lost in their most recent nonbinding votes, and the average support level is 93%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Temares' 2015 package was his largest ever, even as shares fell by more than a third. His pay tops that awarded to Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) CEO John Stumpf and approaches that given to IBM's (IBM) Virginia Rometty. The awards include a $4 million salary and $15.7 million in stock and options. That was an increase of about $1.1 million from his 2014 package. The exact amount of stock that 57-year-old Temares will receive may change depending on how Bed, Bath & Beyond performs against a group of 47 other companies on earnings and return-on-capital measures.A University of Pennsylvania law graduate who primarily worked in real estate, Temares joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in 1992 before its debut on public exchanges to oversee property transactions as it expanded. Its footprint has grown to more than 1,500 stores from 62 two decades ago. He was promoted to CEO in 2003, earning a $931,000 salary during his first year in the top job.Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay plan also failed with investors last year. The company determined it would make some changes after contacting 25 investors representing 68% of shares, the chain said in the May 31 proxy.Temares' target compensation was reduced to $16.9 million for 2016 in a plan that will be voted on next year. His $4 million salary, the third-largest in the S&P index, will stay the same. He receives the large salary in lieu of a smaller one and a potential bonus, because ""cash bonuses promote short-term thinking,"" according to the filing.Still, Institutional Shareholder Services describes the CEO's salary as ""excessive"" and notes that it could bloat his golden parachute to $46 million if the company gets bought. The proxy adviser gave Bed, Bath & Beyond a rating of 10, its worst governance score, meaning its structure may have a greater probability of risks to its reputation, long-term value or fiduciary obligations.Bed, Bath & Beyond is joined by car-parts maker BorgWarner (BWA), chemical producer FMC Corp. (FMC), mall operator General Growth Properties (GGP), and utilities owner Exelon (EXC) in receiving less than 50% support in its most recent vote. Representatives of Exelon and BorgWarner said the companies take the votes seriously and are seeking investor feedback. The other companies didn't return requests for comment.In addition to Bed, Bath & Beyond, only Oracle (ORCL) has received less than 50% support in two consecutive years. The Redwood City, Calif.-based software maker is on its fourth failed year. Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to comment.Stringer noted Bed, Bath & Beyond's compensation committee members Dean Adler, Stanley Barshay and Victoria Morrison have each served on the board for more than 13 years, which ""highlights the need for new directors that are able to exercise strong, independent oversight of management."" Each received about 65% support after calls by Stringer and ISS to oust them. The committee doesn't have a chair, which is rare.

281,ORCL,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound. So far, so good.""RELATED:Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On Facebook And Other Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Fund PerformersAlibaba Sets Stage For Big Online Shopping Spree

282,ORCL,"Workday (WDAY) stock slipped, then rose, Wednesday amid mixed reviews for its user conference and analyst day Tuesday.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Workday has expanded from human capital management (HCM) software into financial management software, and other areas. Workday stock fell a fraction in morning trading in the stock market today before rallying to close the day up 1.2%, at 90.88 and hitting a 16-month high of 90.95. Shares have generally risen since breaking out a flat base at 80.10 in June.At the Workday Rising conference Tuesday, the company was upbeat on competition vs. Oracle (ORCL) in HCM. Workday also announced a minor partnership with Microsoft (MSFT).""While we didn't sense any fireworks, the understated tone was more Workday's style, and it was clear to us the underlying current was one of a confident growth outlook,"" said UBS analyst Brent Thill in a research report.Keith Bachman, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, was upbeat on the outlook for Workday's financials software but said the stock price has gotten a bit high from a price-earnings ratio standpoint.""After attending Workday's analyst day, we are more bullish on Workday's prospects to generate meaningful share gains in financials, and thus attractive revenue growth over the next few years,"" he said. ""We believe that large financial wins could create lumpy billings growth. We like a lot about Workday, except valuation.""""The company announced two new financials customers in Panera (PNRA) and Denny's (DENN),"" said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a report.

284,ORCL,"While the possibility of Salesforce.com (CRM) acquiring Twitter (TWTR) attracted most of the buzz at last week's Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual user conference, a number of analysts were just as intrigued by the cloud software pioneer's relationship with frenemy Microsoft (MSFT).Salesforce and Microsoft announced a broad-based strategic partnership in 2014, with Microsoft integrating its cloud-based Office 365 software with Salesforce.com's apps. But while Microsoft — which in early 2015 reportedly came close to seeking to acquire Salesforce — had a booth at last week's Dreamforce, there wasn't much Microsoft presence, analysts noted.This comes after Microsoft in June announced an agreement to acquire social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion. The following month, LinkedIn revealed in a regulatory filing that Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff had said he would have been willing to pay even more.The battle for LinkedIn is just one issue between the two companies. There also is Microsoft's ramped up efforts to beef up its Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Salesforce focuses on CRM and ERP software.In addition, Microsoft last month inked a strategic partnership with Adobe Systems (ADBE), in which Adobe will deliver its Adobe Marketing Cloud on Microsoft's Azure cloud services platform. Also, the Adobe product will be the preferred marketing service for Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Enterprise edition. Adobe Marketing Cloud is a Salesforce rival.In addition, Salesforce reached a cloud services pact in May with Microsoft Azure's top rival, Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is among the big caps, and big companies can still make big moves, while also being less volatile than smaller stocks. While Microsoft is not a member of the current IBD Big Cap 20, Adobe is. Take a look at that and other big boys on the list.Like many tech companies, Microsoft and Salesforce have partnerships with companies that they also compete against, but the rising level of conflict between Microsoft and Salesforce has Wall Street's attention.""The combination of the drama around LinkedIn, a significantly stepped up investment in Dynamics and the just announced Microsoft/Adobe partnership has customers questioning if the relationship has soured and, if that even matters,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk wrote Monday in a research report reviewing Dreamforce.He points out, though, that Salesforce has managed to be an occasional partner of Oracle (ORCL), one of its main rivals.The conflict between Salesforce and Microsoft ""merits watching over the next year,"" Senk wrote, ""although we point to the company's success with Oracle 'coopetition' as evidence that the company can navigate these waters.""In the meantime, though, rumors of Salesforce buying Twitter have cooled, which had Salesforce stock rising 6% and Twitter stock falling 11.5% in the stock market today. Wall Street generally disliked the idea of such a merger.

285,ORCL,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 with the largest amount spent on stock buybacks in the first quarter, which in total set a nine-year high as companies sought to boost their stock price in a slumping market, according to the S&P Dow Jones Indices.Gilead spent $8 billion, up from the $3.1 billion it spent in the prior quarter. Apple spent $6.7 billion, slightly down from its prior quarter's $6.9 billion.Companies in the S&P 500 spent a total of $161.4 billion in stock buybacks in Q1, up 12% from Q1 2015. It was the second-largest expenditure on record, following the $172 billion spent in Q3 2007, as reported by the S&P Dow Jones Indices.The information technology sector continued to dominate buybacks. Following Apple in the IT sector were Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Microsoft spent $3.85 billion, with Oracle at $2.2 billion and Alphabet at $2 billion.Following Gilead and Apple as the biggest spenders, General Electric (GE) was No. 3 at $6.3 billion, then came Pfizer (PFE) at $5 billion and McDonalds (MCD) at $4.3 billion. Microsoft was No. 6 overall.For the ninth consecutive quarter, more than 20% of the S&P 500 companies reduced their year-over-year diluted share count by at least 4%, thereby boosting their earnings per share by at least 4%.""The pace of buybacks was partially driven by companies supporting their stock during the opening downturn of the year, which coincidentally started in early February when many earnings lock-ups ended,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a statement announcing the Q1 tally.""The upswing in both expenditures and participation appears to persist in the market, meaning that the upturn in Q4 was not a single-shot,"" he saidAccording to Silverblatt, cash reserves set a record, increasing 1.6% to $1.347 trillion. That topped the prior record $1.333 trillion set at the end of 2014.

His total pay was valued at $36.2 million, placing him third in the Network World survey. In 2013, Comcast completed its $16.7 billion acquisition for the 49% of NBC Universal it didn't already own, making it a leader in both content and distribution.Yahoo CEO Mayer came in fourth despite a $6 million pay cut -- but also despite problems recharging growth that were well apparent in 2015. She completed that year with a pay package valued at $36 million, down 15% from 2014. The company is in the final stages of selling its core internet business, with Comcast rivals AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) widely considered front-runners.Salesforce CEO Benioff came in fifth with a $33.4 million pay package, as he's made the cloud software pioneer the No. 1 seller of the key business product called customer relationship management software, and he's done so against much bigger rivals, led by Oracle.Benioff was followed by AT&T (T) CEO Randall Stephenson at $25.1 million, IBM (IBM) CEO Virginia Rometty at $19.8 million and Cisco Systems (CSCO) former CEO John Chambers at $19.6 million.Oracle founder Larry Ellison frequently made the list of highest-paid CEOs, but he gave up that job in 2014. Nearly all of the compensation to Hurd and Catz came in the form of stock and option awardsAt the low end on the Network World analysis of 62 tech CEOs were Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Larry Page, who earned $1 in cash, and Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, who received $68,506 in perks such as personal car service and residential security. The two opted for token cash and no new equity grants.Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg also took just $1 in cash but received another $5 million in extras. At the Facebook annual meeting on Tuesday, shareholders approved a new class of shares that will keep Zuckerberg in control as long as he is associated with the social networking giant.IBD Take: Facebook ranks fifth in its group but scores well in many areas.

287,ORCL,"Amid its major shift to cloud computing, longtime database leader Oracle (ORCL) is set to report quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Oracle to report a 4% year-over-year increase in earnings per share minus items, to 81 cents, for its fiscal Q4 ended on or near May 31. That would reverse four straight quarters of EPS declines. Analyst expect revenue to fall 2%, to $10.47 billion, the fifth straight quarter of declines.Oracle is transitions to selling more of its business software on demand via the internet cloud, a huge change for a company built by selling billions of dollars of traditional, on-premise software that clients license for the long term.Oracle stock was down 1% to 38.44 at the closing bell on the stock market today. The stock is down 7% since hitting an 11-month high of 42 on March 21. It's formed a cup-with-handle base with a 42.10 buy  point.Oracle has been on a rocky road over the last few years, as the company was late to the cloud. While the company's business is rising, its legacy database business is under major pressure.RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research note that he expects more information on Oracle's cloud shift and updates on its acquisition of Textura and Opower. He rates Oracle stock outperform, with a price target of 43.“Competition from leading software-as-a-service vendors such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY) and others creates the risk that new customers will be tougher to find and existing on-premise customers could move to different vendors when they shift to the cloud,” MacMillan wrote.UBS analyst Brent Thill has a buy rating on Oracle stock and a price target of 44.Oracle’s cloud transition appears promising, Thill says. While cloud offerings account for only about 8% of Oracle's revenue, they're growing at a compound annual rate of 30%, he wrote. An accelerated pace will be necessary to sustain investor conviction in Oracle’s evolution, he said in a research report.“Oracle is still in the early innings of transitioning its entire business model and operational mindset to cloud-first,” Thill wrote.

288,ORCL,"After Twitter (TWTR) soared over two weeks on hopes for a bidding-war frenzy, the stock crashed Thursday as investors woke up to the prospect that the struggling social network may only have one bidder, or perhaps even none.Twitter fell 20% to close at 19.87 on the stock market today, erasing most of its big run-up since Sept. 22.Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Walt Disney (DIS) won't bid, Recode reported late Wednesday, adding that Apple (AAPL) was unlikely to bid either. Disney and especially Alphabet had been seen as likely bidders, while Apple was more of a dark horse. But all three companies have deep pockets for buying Twitter.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is trading just above a buy point, as the social giant continues to grow. Upstart Snapchat is hot, but isn't cooling Facebook.If the report is true, that leaves Twitter with one interested suitor: Salesforce (CRM). CEO Marc Benioff reportedly wants to get ahold of Twitter's vast user data, seeing the company as an ""unpolished jewel."" But any deal would be highly dilutive to existing Salesforce shareholders, sending shares sharply lower. Benioff acknowledged such concerns Wednesday at an investor day Q&A, stressing that he is ""super-conscious"" of the impact of any deals on shareholders.Salesforce shares rose 4.15% to end at 71.26 Thursday on the prospect for a cheaper Twitter price tag, or no deal at all.So will anyone buy Twitter?Other possible bidders could be AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and Verizon Communications (VZ), according to Robert Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. He rates Twitter as neutral with a price target of 18.""Twitter may be destined to remain independent until a more reasonable valuation is available,"" said Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak, who also rates Twitter as neutral.RELATED:Who Will Buy Twitter?

And analyst Keith Bachman raised his price target on Splunk (SPLK) stock to 62 from 58.Shares of Salesforce finished 1.1% higher, Workday lost 0.8%, NetSuite gained 1.7% and Splunk rallied 2.2%.Salesforce.com, the cloud software leader, is the No. 4 enterprise software company by market value, following much older Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), but its organic revenue growth tops its bigger rivals.""Saleforce.com will benefit from two scale issues,"" wrote Bachman in his research report. ""We think customers favor buying sales force automation, service, and marketing suites that are well integrated, while Salesforce.com's scale provides brand, sales and cost advantages.""Bachman estimates revenue of $8.37 billion for the company's fiscal 2017 ending Jan. 31, and fiscal 2018 revenue of $10.28 billion, vs. Wall Street consensus estimates of $8.3 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com is the No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software. It garners mainly subscription revenue from on-demand software-as-a-service delivered via the internet cloud.Salesforce.com said on June 1 announced it had agreed to buy e-commerce software maker Demandware (DWRE) for $2.8 billion. Bachman says Salesforce.com can build upon its success with an earlier acquisition, ExactTarget. ExactTarget is now the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, providing software that helps companies with their e-mail, social and online marketing.“Based on Salesforce.com’s prior ventures in entering new markets like marketing cloud and service cloud, we think that Saleforce.com will be able to capture significant market share with its commerce cloud,"" he wrote. ""We think Salesforce.com will generate revenue growth while integrating Demandware similar to how it did while integrating ExactTarget.”BMO Capital set a price target of 98 on Salesforce.com stock, which fell a fraction, to 81.09, in Tuesday trading.On HR and finance software maker Workday, Bachman said, “We like the story but would advise looking for a better entry point.”He says Splunk’s July-quarter guidance might be conservative. Bachman also says NetSuite “does a lot of things well but does not have product leadership in any area.”Salesforce.com has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, while Workday also has a high CR of 95. NetSuite's CR is 68, and Splunk has a CR of 50.

Salesforce.com rebuffed the takeover offer, which reports said topped $50 billion. With its stock gain in 2016, Salesforce.com’s market cap now tops $56 billion.Salesforce.com last week agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE) for $2.8 billion. Despite Salesforce.com's size, though, some still see it as a possible buyout candidate, though the buyer would have to be very big.UBS analyst Brent Thill, who attended Salesforce.com’s two-day TrailheaDX developers conference, which ends Wednesday, says Microsoft has closely integrated its cloud-based Office 365 software with Salesforce.com’s apps.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com is the leading provider of customer relationship software. Salesforce.com garners mainly subscription revenue from on-demand software delivered via the internet cloud. Salesforce.com competes with such enterprise software providers SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL) and ServiceNow (NOW).“The Microsoft partnership is delivering real dividends,” Thill said in a research report Wednesday. “Integration with Salesforce has improved since last October, when Office 365 started to support two-way integration with Salesforce.com apps -- a big step forward from the non-real-time integration with Outlook.”In a blow to Microsoft’s Azure-branded cloud computing service, however, Salesforce.com has forged closer ties to AWS. Salesforce.com last month said it would offer a new “Internet of Things” service for web-connected devices using the AWS cloud computing platform.Shares of Salesforce ticked up to to 83.35 while Microsoft dipped to 52.04 by the close in the stock market today.

302,ORCL,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) could go shopping for a data storage company with software expertise, as enterprise customers shift toward “converged infrastructure,” says Barclays.While Cisco has a joint venture with EMC (EMC) and alliances with NetApp (NTAP) and startup SimpliVity, the computer networking giant needs to own data storage assets as customers shift to converged data center infrastructure -- including servers -- that run on network management software, the investment bank said.“We believe converged infrastructure could be an area of interest for Cisco to tactically acquire software-defined storage assets,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a research report.  “While storage is the glaring hole in Cisco’s portfolio, we think the company will move away from hardware-based assets as it attempts to shift to more software mix and value-added services.”Aside from Cisco, Moskowitz says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), EMC, VMware (VMW) and Oracle (ORCL) aim to be players in the converged infrastructure market. EMC is in the final stages of  being acquired by privately held Dell.“Hyper-converged infrastructure relies more on software and seems to be ushering in the software defined data center. As such, consolidation may be critical for some of the systems-centric vendors to keep pace with innovation within the software realm,” he wrote.San Jose, Calif.-based Nutanix has been gaining share in converged infrastructure, says the Barclays report. Nutanix might well rekindle plans for an initial public offering, analysts say.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, meanwhile, also is on the prowl for acquisitions, according to analysts.“Converged infrastructure is just a way of packaging IT components to drive efficiencies rather than a radically different concept that unlocks incremental revenue,” said Moskowitz. “We think storage vendors get hurt the most, implying only upstarts or companies not possessing legacy storage like Cisco are best positioned to benefit from this trend.”Cisco stock fell 0.65% to 28.84 in the stock market today.

306,ORCL,"Jump-starting its push into e-commerce, Salesforce.com (CRM) on Wednesday said it has agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE), a partner, in a deal valued at $2.8 billion.Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com said it would pay $75 per share for Demandware, a 56% premium to its closing price on Tuesday. Demandware shares shot up 56% to 74.75 in morning trade on the stock market today, near 75.The company provides software to design e-commerce websites, and at least one analyst says Adobe Systems (ADBE) also might have had its eye on Demandware.Now, “It’s possible Adobe looks at other assets in e-commerce, although others with large customer scale are scant,” Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research note.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com is the leading provider of customer relationship software. It competes with such enterprise software leaders as Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL) and ServiceNow (NOW).“The deal will also offer Salesforce.com an opportunity to expand its presence in the B2C (business-to-consumer) space where it has had limited success so far,” Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said in a research report. “Given Salesforce’s financial strength, we do not expect another bidder to emerge.”Salesforce.com stock was down a fraction in morning trade Wednesday, near 83.50. Salesforce.com stock hit an all-time high of 84.48 on Thursday and is up 6.5% in 2016 after having touched a 19-month low of 52.60 on Feb. 8.The Demandware acquisition is expected to close by the end of July. Salesforce.com said the acquisition ""is expected to increase fiscal 2017 total revenue by approximately $100 million to $120 million. This estimate reflects an approximately $50 million reduction relating to fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue.""Demandware’s Q1 revenue rose 33% to $67 million. It swung to a 6-cent profit minus items from a penny loss in the year-earlier period.Burlington, Mass.-based Demandware’s customers include Lands' End, L'Oreal and Marks and Spencer Group.Salesforce.com's  Q1 profit jumped 50% to 24 cents per share minus items. Revenue in the three months ended April 30 rose 27% to $1.92 billion.Salesforce.com had partnered with Demandware, Pritchard pointed out. Salesforce rival SAP in 2013 acquired e-com software maker Hybris.“The strategic fit is sound, although we expected partner strategy to persist for longer,” Pritchard wrote. “There is no question in our minds that e-commerce makes sense as part of a Salesforce.com suite.""Salesforce has had a “blank” square in its market coverage map for a number of years in e-commerce.  We believe it is likely that SAP’s success with Hybris put some pressure on Salesforce to bring e-commerce in-house.”

307,ORCL,"Enterprise software company Workday (WDAY) late Tuesday swung to an unexpected profit minus items, posted a top-line beat and gave revenue guidance that topped expectations, but shares nevertheless were down after hours.Revenue for the quarter ended April 30 rose 38% from the year-earlier quarter to $345.4 million, beating the consensus Wall Street estimate of $338.7 million.

308,ORCL,"Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google says Oracle (ORCL) ""took none of the risk” in developing and marketing Android software, but now wants “a lot of the money"" from the mobile operating system's success, says a report from tech website Ars Technica.In closing arguments to a jury, Google attorney Robert Van Nest said the copyright infringement case’s outcome is important for the software industry, reported Ars Technica.Oracle is seeking nearly $9 billion in damages from Google. It's slated to make its closing statement Monday afternoon.Oracle claims that Google violated its copyright on parts of the Java programming language when it created the Android mobile operating system, now used in mobile phones worldwide. Oracle acquired Java when it purchased Sun Microsystems in 2010.""This is a very important case, not only for Google, but for innovation and technology in general,"" Van Nest told the jury. ""What Google engineers did was nothing out of that mainstream. They built Android from scratch, using new Google technology, and adapted technology from open sources.“Now we’re in a situation where Oracle, which had no investment in Android, took none of the risk -- they want all the credit and a lot of the money. And that’s not fair.""Oracle says Google has earned $21 billion in profit from Android-based smartphones.At its I/O developer’s conference last week, Google showcased the Android N software upgrade, which includes an automotive variant and a virtual reality mode for smartphones.If Oracle wins its court case, it might also seek royalties, analysts say.Shares of both Alphabet and Oracle were down 0.6% in the stock market today. Alphabet ended the day at 717.25 while Oracle closed at 39.18

309,ORCL,"Microsoft's (MSFT) deal to buy online professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion took many on Wall Street by surprise. Most analysts thought it was more likely that Microsoft would acquire a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company like Salesforce.com (CRM) or Workday (WDAY). Many say the deal could spark more mergers and acquisitions in enterprise software.Microsoft announced its agreement to purchase LinkedIn early Monday. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the deal ""brings together the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network.""Microsoft stock, which fell 2.6% Monday, closed 0.6% lower at 49.83 on the stock market today. Workday rose 2.5% Tuesday, while Salesforce.com stock dipped 0.5%.Microsoft reportedly tried to acquire Salesforce.com in early 2015 with a bid that topped $50 billion, but it was rebuffed. With LinkedIn, Microsoft will get tools to compete with Salesforce. Microsoft will be able to use LinkedIn's Sales Navigator as a social selling tool integrated with its Dynamics customer relationship management software.“Microsoft’s agreement to purchase LinkedIn came as a surprise -- we thought a SaaS application M&A strategy was more likely,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research report.He said he sees the logic of the deal -- combining LinkedIn user data with Microsoft’s Office 365 and Dynamics CRM -- but he is not clear on how it materially expands Microsoft’s total addressable market.“The good news is this takes the risk of an even bigger deal off the table and (we think) implies Microsoft’s core business remains healthy,” MacMillan said. He rates Microsoft stock as outperform, with a price target of 61.The LinkedIn deal could spur more mergers and acquisitions in the cloud computing sector, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a report.“This acquisition increases the likelihood of more M&A in enterprise and systems software,” he said.The question is which companies will step up. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) are among the potential acquirers, he said.Microsoft eventually will consider buying a firm with exceptional sales talent, such as Salesforce, Workday, Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) or Splunk (SPLK), he said. Davis rates Microsoft stock as hold, with a price target of 55.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle also sees more M&A ahead in internet cloud applications.“As Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft and Google compete more aggressively in the cloud, applications provide a means of differentiation,” Barnicle said in a report. “Microsoft leads in applications because of Office. LinkedIn would provide additional differentiation.""It is likely Amazon and Google will also look to acquire large application companies, like Salesforce.com, Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK) or Workday. They are less likely to buy the smaller or more vertical SaaS vendors because those companies are too small to make a big difference for Amazon or Google, in our view.""Barnicle rates Microsoft stock as overweight, with a price target of 65.While some analysts on Wall Street were cautiously upbeat about the Microsoft-LinkedIn tie-up, others said Microsoft paid too much.“While we believe there is some strategic rationale supporting the deal, we question at what cost,” Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a report. “We view this acquisition as similar to other major acquisitions that Microsoft has made over the years, including aQuantive, Skype, and Nokia.”The purchases of aQuantive and Nokia were costly failures, and Skype’s performance is an unknown quantity, he said.“Microsoft has historically gotten a free pass from investors, since these deals typically only represented about a quarter of free cash flow, vs. more than a year’s worth for LinkedIn, which may force accountability,” DiFucci said. He rates Microsoft stock underperform with a price target of 40.RELATED:Public, Private Software Firms May Compete In M&A, Says CanaccordSalesforce-Microsoft Office 365 Deal ‘Delivering Real Dividends’Is Salesforce Big Enough To Avoid Amazon, Oracle Overtures?

314,ORCL,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is fortifying its kingdom on a cloud, but now the question is whether that automatically comes with an acquisition-proof moat.Salesforce's $2.8 billion buyout last week of e-commerce platform Demandware (DWRE) beefs up its arsenal as Silicon Valley continues to engage in turf battles atop virtual thunderheads. The rumored bidding war over Demandware is said to have included Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both compete -- to varying degrees -- with Salesforce’s cloud-based customer-relationship-management software.But few players now seem to have the full suite of enterprise tools that Salesforce offers. By adding an enterprise cloud e-commerce platform to its product lineup, it allows Salesforce to ""own the entire customer journey,"" as Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin put it. Salesforce's products involve the first contacts with customers to sales and transactions and on to service issues.""That’s the holy grail,"" Zukin told Investor's Business Daily.Is it enough to put Salesforce out of reach? With Salesforce's market cap at well over $56 billion, and with an increasing number of acquisitions under its belt, it might be getting too formidable to be a takeover target.The Demandware buy comes on the heels of Salesforce’s announcement that it has chosen the web services unit of Amazon (AMZN) as its ""preferred public cloud infrastructure provider,"" expanding its existing partnership and using Amazon’s cloud provider in certain markets abroad to ""help bring new infrastructure online more quickly and efficiently.""Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead called the agreement a ""big deal.""""It is a major endorsement of (Amazon Web Services), and Salesforce becomes the first of the larger 'incumbent' (software-as-a-service) vendors to give up on the idea that they need to own/control their own data center infrastructure footprint,"" he wrote. Keirstead added, though, that the deal materially shrinks the chances of Microsoft (MSFT) acquiring Salesforce, a rumored partnership in years past.Piper Jaffray's Zukin isn't so sure. He recalled chatter of years past that has included not only Microsoft but Oracle as a potential Salesforce buyer.""I think Salesforce is a unique strategic asset and I wouldn’t put it past someone else from buying them over the next couple of years,"" Zukin said.Zukin speculated in early May that a separate deal, in which Salesforce would build its new Internet of Things service on Amazon’s cloud, could lead to a ""cozier"" relationship between the two, perhaps in the form of a strategic sales partnership. Amazon also could spin out its web services unit and merge it with Salesforce, or even acquire the company outright, with the latter being the least likely, he speculated.""Fundamentally we view (Salesforce) as a clear beneficiary of a larger 'Cloud Game of Thrones' being waged among (Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL)'s Google) for the Cloud Platform 'Iron Throne,'"" Zukin wrote on May 12. (Coincidentally, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is a distant cousin of ""Game of Thrones"" co-showrunner David Benioff.)Zukin still thinks Amazon could annex Salesforce in some capacity, though. When asked if the Demandware acquisition put Salesforce at odds with Amazon -- given that Demandware builds e-commerce solutions for individual businesses, ostensibly guiding them away from selling their wares on Amazon -- he demurred.""You could almost argue the opposite case,"" he said. ""It almost makes Salesforce an interesting acquisition to Amazon.""While Amazon is the rumored Salesforce acquirer du jour, Zukin’s money is on Google’s name being added to the mix next year.""Depending on who bought them, it would make tremendous sense,"" said Zukin. ""A combination of (Amazon Web Services) and Salesforce.com is a killer combination that would put (others) on the defensive.""""That would make Amazon the new IBM (IBM),"" he said.Salesforce’s deal with Amazon Web Services is believed to clock in at $400 million through 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing someone familiar with the matter, plus a recent SEC filing that refers to a purchase commitment with an unnamed third-party provider for ""certain infrastructure services for a period of four years.""""As Salesforce looks to leverage their services internationally, I think they’re going to do so utilizing that Amazon infrastructure rather than going out and leasing data centers in international markets,"" said Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson. ""It’s a lot easier to just rent capacity from Amazon, where they already have a presence overseas.""He called the deal the ""right move,"" but said it’s hard to predict how that relationship could expand down the road.At the very least, Salesforce's moves are well-timed. More businesses are feeling comfortable moving their data to the public cloud as well as looking to save on technology costs, Nelson says. That has resulted in an accelerated migration to cloud services.Salesforce, which is seen hitting the $8 billion mark in revenue this year, is largely expected to benefit as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others stake out their space in cloud computing.And for its part, Salesforce right now sees itself as more the hunter than the hunted.""The M&A season right now is the most intense, most exciting I have ever seen,"" Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff said last week on CNBC. ""I have never seen more deals and more things happening. We’re not winning every deal; this is just a deal that we were actually able to get done. We’re excited that we could actually get Demandware, and it’s tough to get deals done in this environment because everybody’s positioning for growth for next year.""Still, it wouldn’t be a true game of thrones unless more land grabs were on the horizon.""I think we’re already seeing the M&A market heat up,"" said Nelson, noting Oracle’s acquisitions in recent weeks of Opower, which provides cloud services to utilities, and Textura, a construction software firm.""We’ve also already seen the privatization market intensify,"" said Nelson, highlighting Marketo and Qlik’s recent moves to go private, ""So I think we’re going to see activity remain high for a while.""The service and app clouds are Salesforce’s fastest-growing products, say analysts, and Zukin says its new Demandware-based ""commerce cloud"" could become its fastest grower. The company says it expects to create ""yet another billion-dollar cloud"" with the purchase.Salesforce’s clients span across industries and include the likes of GE (GE), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal.Shares now trade in the lower end of buy territory after breaking out of a period of consolidation with an 83 entry point and recovering from an early February dive that sent the stock tumbling 20% over the course of two trading sessions to a 16-month low.The plunge was prompted by Tableau’s (DATA) disappointing full-year earnings guidance that sliced Tableau’s shares nearly in half on Feb. 5, which weighed heavily on software stocks, including ServiceNow (NOW) and Splunk (SPLK).Tableau’s shares have only recovered slightly, while Salesforce shares came back to hit a new high of 84.48 on May 26.

But it's still down 5% in 2016.“Stock was controversial into the print, and we see Q1 results and outlook as good enough,” said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, in a research report.Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, maintained a neutral rating on Workday stock.“At its current valuation, we saw nothing in the fiscal Q1 results and guidance likely to drive Workday materially higher,” Barnicle said in a report. “Billings of $371.8 million were also better than consensus of $364 million, but decelerated to 37% year-over-year growth from 44% in fiscal Q4.”Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in another report that ""billings may have been modestly below real expectations.”Workday sells cloud-based software to large companies for handling human resources and financial management tasks. Workday competes with Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), Netsuite (N), and Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD).Workday said it earned 5 cents per share minus items for the period ended April 30, swinging to a profit from a 2-cent loss in the year-earlier period.On a net income basis, Workday said it lost $80.6 million compared with $61.6 million in the year-earlier period amid growing investments in marketing and R&D.Revenue rose 38% to $345.4 million, beating the consensus Wall Street estimate of $338.7 million.“We could see some (stock) pressure as the billings outperformance this quarter was more muted, though the raised billings view and pipeline commentary should limit any downside,” Justin Furby, an analyst at William Blair, said in a research note.

316,ORCL,"Google’s victory on Thursday over Oracle (ORCL) in a copyright infringement case is what Silicon Valley’s software industry wanted to see.At least, that’s what Google told the jury in closing arguments. Google also argued that Sun Microsystems, the developer of Java software and acquired by Oracle in 2010, had no problems with Google developing its Android mobile operating system using Java APIs, or application program interfaces.Some tech industry groups said Oracle's claim would undercut practices that are widely used to create all kinds of software.Oracle aimed to collect nearly $9 billion in damages and possible royalties down the line from Alphabet (GOOGL), Google’s parent. Oracle said it would appeal Thursday's jury decision.Alphabet stock ended the day up 1.5% to 747.60 Friday, while Oracle stock was up slightly to 40.07 in the stock market today.Google had argued that Oracle “took none of the risk” in developing and marketing Android software, but now wants “a lot of the money” from the mobile OS’s success.Android-based mobile phones are used worldwide. Oracle says Google has earned $21 billion in profit from Android-based smartphones.A federal judge sided with Google in 2012, but an appellate court sent the case back for a second trial. That ruling declared that the java APIs qualified for copyright protection.The ruling likely will be appealed, says Al Hilwa, an analyst with tech research firm IDC.The 10-person jury’s decision sets a “high bar” for copyright protection, he says.“The ruling certainly sets a high bar for creativity before deserving protection from fair use,"" Hilwa said in an emailed statement. ""Clearly for Oracle and others with strong, widely adopted platforms like Java, the verdict presents a higher bar for copyright protection in terms of what is considered fair use.”

317,ORCL,"Investors should realize that cash-rich technology companies will target privately held business software companies, as well as their public counterparts, a Canaccord Genuity analyst said in a new research report.“The good news for public company money managers is that the profitable platform firms are about to get a bunch of 'booster shots' of new technology via acquisition,” wrote Canaccord analyst Richard Davis. “That means companies such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), IBM (IBM), Google (parent Alphabet (GOOGL)), and perhaps Workday (WDAY) if that firm gets more expansive in M&A.”Microsoft on Monday turned its attention elsewhere, agreeing to buy professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD).Salesforce.com recently acquired Demandware (DWRE), while Oracle (ORCL) bought Textura in April. Also, private equity firm Thoma Bravo this month bought Qlik Technologies.While Davis explores the possibility of small software firms such as Benefitfocus (BNFT) or SPS Commerce (SPSC) being acquired, he notes that privately held companies might consider selling themselves if the outlook for initial public offerings remains tepid.“While we are nearly certain to improve on the 2016 pace, there is essentially zero chance that the 1990s’ IPO pace will return,” Davis said.Privately held companies that bear watching, says Davis, include: Adaptive Insights, Apttus, Avalara, Cloudera, DocuSign, FinancialForce, Hootsuite, InsideSales, Medallia, MuleSoft, Nintex, Okta, ServiceMax, Slack, Spredfast, Sprinklr, Tanium, Telogis, and Zuora.“Areas ripe for the consolidation we foresee include the most over-funded segments, such as analytics, point solution security tools and marketing tech. Inasmuch as more than 90% of software companies in operation are private, most of the action should occur there,” Davis added.

318,ORCL,"General Electric (GE) doesn't just make jet engines, wind turbines and locomotives anymore. It now makes data centers -- that also happen to power airplanes, harness wind energy and ride the rails.Connecting these machines is a GE software platform that could underpin an Industrial Internet ecosystem resembling Apple's (AAPL) intertwining operating system, computers, phones, app store and music store.""All of our products are becoming data centers,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Bill Ruh told IBD in an interview.The iconic 124-year-old conglomerate, long synonymous with light bulbs and washing machines, is looking more like a tech company. As it shrinks its finance unit and sells its home appliance business, GE is also reinventing itself as a digital industrial company that could compete head-on with tech stalwarts like Microsoft (MSFT), plus traditional rivals like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON) seeking to capitalize on the Industrial Internet.GE's transformation goes deep. The company is moving its corporate headquarters from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston, due in part to its need for ""technologically diverse"" talent. It also launched an ad campaign earlier this year to rebrand GE as ""The digital company. That's also an industrial company.""""There are still many people who think GE is locked in a time warp of what slow industrial companies used to be,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray. ""GE is breaking all of those molds.""GE estimates the Industrial Internet could be a $225 billion market by 2020, topping the $206 billion seen in the enterprise cloud computing market by then and the $170 billion in the consumer Internet of Things.While the Internet of Things includes connected refrigerators that can buy more milk online before it runs out, the Industrial Internet envisions machines that tell operators how to improve efficiency or fix a malfunction, potentially saving companies billions of dollars a year.For example, aircraft engines that GE makes with partner Snecma have sensors that measure vibration, temperature, heat, noise and emissions particles, Dray noted. They could send information while in flight to command centers, where the data are analyzed before the plane lands.If a fuel nozzle needs replacing, a maintenance team can wait for the plane at the destination airport with a new one. Similar capabilities exist on other equipment, like power generators and trains. Factories could also adjust output to match market demand or eventually operate totally autonomously.GE's Ruh said the company puts a data center at the heart of its locomotives, regulating operations like communications, safety and maintenance.""It's not a bolt-on,"" he said. ""It's a rethink of the products going forward.""In addition to building connected products, GE's tech push includes building virtual doppelgangers.GE says its engineers and scientists are creating ""digital twins"" of every machine delivered to customers that can continuously learn from their physical counterparts through embedded sensors, allowing GE to analyze the health of each machine without disrupting operations.And analyzing the flood of data GE products generate also represents an additional revenue opportunity in services. Last year, Japanese construction and mining equipment giant Komatsu (KMTUY) partnered with GE for Big Data analysis services for mining projects.GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said at GE's Minds+Machines developers conference last September that GE and other industrial heavyweights are evolving into hybrid technology/manufacturing companies.""If you went to bed last night as an industrial company, you're going to wake up this morning as a software and analytics company,"" Immelt said at the event.A cornerstone of the new GE is its Predix cloud-based operating system, which has an open architecture that allows industrial equipment customers to build on it. Ruh believes GE's Predix operating system software can become the standard for big manufacturers, as they continue to add intelligence to their equipment.""We think Predix can be embedded in every industrial machine that’s sold,"" he said.In February, GE launched an open-source digital industrial network, which includes dozens of global companies such as AT&T (T), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Verizon Communications (VZ), Japanese telecom giant Softbank (SFTBY), India's Tata Consultancy Services and China Telecom (CHA), among others.The list of partners has grown and includes more tech names. GE Digital recently teamed up with database software giant Oracle (ORCL) to develop and consolidate complementary offerings for the Industrial Internet.In April, GE released the first commercially available applications running on Predix. The Asset Performance Management suite includes a way to monitor equipment health, as well as a function designed to predict maintenance issues. Another feature to come out later this year is meant to help users manage the service life of their assets, maintenance costs and risk.Software is still a small part of GE's business -- about $6 billion of its $130 billion in annual sales. But it's growing at a 20% a year clip, Immelt said, and he's aiming for $10 billion in software sales by 2020, which would make GE one of the world's largest software vendors, and perhaps the largest industrial software maker.So does GE want to be the Microsoft of the Industrial Internet, with its Predix platform becoming as ubiquitous on large equipment as Windows is on PCs? ""Absolutely,"" Rue said.But Microsoft may actually want to be the Microsoft of the Industrial Internet. In April, CEO Satya Nadella spoke at Germany's Hannover Messe trade show, telling the gathered manufacturing executives that the software giant wants to take the lead in creating digital platforms for industry, citing work with Microsoft partners including aircraft engine maker Rolls Royce.""At this point, Rolls Royce is building a software product at the core value of what they do,"" he said. ""This is what we envision for every industrial company. We want to be able to create these platforms that can, in turn, create more digital technology from every industrial company.""Meanwhile, other industrial giants also have the capability to develop an open-standard operating system and will resist using something developed by archrival GE, even if it's an open architecture, noted Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.""All the major industrial companies are doing this to some level,"" he said in an interview. ""Siemens, Emerson (EMR), Honeywell already have sensors and gauges that collect data on pressure, temperature and such in their equipment. All of them are trying to elevate that.""Ruh says GE has an edge because it knows and accepts that it's transforming into a software and analytics company.""We think we're ahead of our competitors. We've invested for five years in cloud-based Internet-of-Things-focused architecture. Our competitors will be traditional competitors with software capabilities. They're still trying to catch up.""GE sees most tech companies as potential partners as it rolls out its industrial OS.“The reality is we could end up partnering with them,"" Ruh said. ""We don’t have to be competitors. Right now we’re working our way through that.”He hinted GE might partner with IBM (IBM), for example, with its Predix platform. Edward Jones’ Windau said that seems like a likely pairing.“IBM is coming from the top down, and GE is coming from the bottom up. Somewhere in the middle they meet each other,” Windau said.Not everyone thinks GE is succeeding in transforming into a high-tech industrial company. Asked about GE's digital thrust, Deutsche Bank senior analyst John Inch said, ""Talk is cheap. Just because GE says this doesn't mean it's so.""Inch noted that GE has often focused on change and has undergone various transformations over the years. There are positives, he said.""I'm not disputing that (GE) can make products better. But GE is not becoming a digital company. That's a fairly misguided notion,"" he said. ""It's an enormous company with power plant generators and locomotives. That footprint is never going to change.""It will also take two to three years to see if Predix can in fact evolve into an industry standard as GE hopes, Inch added.Still, as a first mover in the Industrial Internet, GE's deep knowledge of industrial manufacturing gives it an edge, said RBC's Dray.""It will be theirs to lose. Shame on them if anyone from the outside came in.""

319,ORCL,"The IBM (IBM) revenue numbers stand out like a broken arm.Deep into a major transition that has shed multibillion-dollar businesses, IBM has reported 16 straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines. And it's not done yet. Another three quarters of declines are expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.In the past several years, Big Blue has shed computer hardware units, reshuffled its software businesses and realigned its workforce to reduce costs as it focuses on growth areas such as cloud computing, Big Data analytics, security and mobile computing -- areas that it calls strategic imperatives. Since 2010, IBM has invested about $30 billion in these areas.They include the creation of a new business unit, Cognitive Business Solutions, with its backbone being IBM’s advanced Watson computer. Watson is being used in health care, the Internet of Things, analytics and other fields. IBM says Watson can address a total market opportunity near $2 trillion.""We continue to make significant progress in our transformation to higher value,"" IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said in the company's first-quarter earnings release last Monday. ""We strengthened our existing portfolio while investing aggressively in new opportunities like Watson Health, Watson Internet of Things and hybrid cloud.""The IBM transformation is showing progress. IBM revenue from strategic imperatives rose 26% in 2015 in constant currency to $29 billion, compared with a 12% decline in overall revenue to $81.7 billion. Strategic imperatives now comprise 35% of total revenue, up from 22% two years ago. IBM has targeted strategic imperative revenue to reach $40 billion and at least 40% of revenue by 2018.But when will the revenue slide reverse?  UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in a research report, says that 2017 is likely the turning point.“IBM is trying hard to transform its business and also to change the narrative from legacy loser to cloud and cognitive winner,” Milunovich wrote. He added, “Just because strategic imperatives gains the upper hand does not mean IBM's top line is off to the races, but it could mean the worst would be over.”As to whether Watson and its Cognitive Business can save IBM, Milunovich says that it’s too soon to know, as IBM does not disclose the Watson-driven revenue just yet.“Old IBM is in secular decline, but we believe cognitive eventually could create a material new revenue stream drawing from outside existing IT budgets. We don't expect revenue to be material for another three years, but the narrative is important now, and eventually Watson could be a $10 billion business,"" he wrote.Milunovich has a neutral rating on IBM and price target of 150.IBM stock was flat, near 148, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. IBM stock hit its all-time high of 215.90 in March 2013. It hit a six-year low in February but is up 27% since then.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Gracha has a more negative view on IBM and says that revenue won’t stabilize until 2018.“We see a painful multiyear turnaround from here, which drives underperformance,” Garcha wrote in a research note. “We believe that large parts of IBM’s business (hardware, operating systems, services) are being impacted by the cloud.”As to Watson, he said, “While we do believe the opportunity here is significant, it is also very early, with the commercial impact of such initiatives that may take several years, if not decades.”Garcha has an underperform rating on IBM stock and a price target of just 110.Other giants in the information technology field are also going through transitions and struggling to accelerate revenue growth. They include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).“We believe the competitive challenges are emerging from companies seeking to build a business model similar to IBM’s, notably Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cisco, Oracle, EMC and Dell,”  wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a research note.Of these competitors, he says, HPE is closest to IBM's model, with Cisco another. Dell is acquiring EMC.Daryanani has a sector perform rating on IBM stock and a price target of 155.

320,ORCL,"General Electric (GE) said Friday that first-quarter industrial revenue dipped as the collapse in oil prices weighed, but its digital unit saw sharp growth amid the conglomerate's tech transition.GE earned 21 cents per share, up from 20 cents a year ago and better than forecasts by 2 cents. Revenue declined 5% to $27.85 billion, but that topped estimates for $27.62 billion. Adjusted industrial revenue dipped 1% to $23.58 billion.GE shares fell 0.7% in the stock market today, finding support at their 50-day line. The stock climbed above a first stage cup-with-handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17. It's struggled to remain in buy range in the past month.""GE had a good performance in a slow growth environment,"" CEO Jeff Immelt told analysts on a conference call. ""We're in the midst of a challenging oil and gas market. However, we're seeing sustained strength in aviation and power markets, and health care is rebounding.""Revenue from its oil and gas segment dropped 18% to $3.31 billion, and its transportation business plunged 25% to $981 million. But power revenue climbed 13% to $5.2 billion, aviation jumped 10% to $6.26 billion, and health care rose 3% to $4.18 billion.Among its faster-growing segments, renewable-energy revenue surged 62% to $1.67 billion, energy connections spiked 34% to $2.26 billion, and digital leapt 29% to $1.2 billion.""That's still a small part of their $27 billion-plus quarterly revenue,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said of the digital segment. ""But it's a real fast growing area for them.""GE is reorganizing into what it calls a digital industrial company, focusing more on selling technology services and software. In Q1, GE opened its Predix digital platform for general availability, and more than 7,500 developers have registered for it.On Thursday, GE Digital and Oracle (ORCL) announced a strategic partnership to build what they called a ""first of its kind"" platform for companies to digitally connect industrial assets.Meanwhile, GE's order backlog climbed 18% to $316.1 billion in Q1. That includes $28.8 billion worth of orders from Alstom, the French industrial giant whose power business GE bought in November for $10.6 billion, its largest industrial purchase ever.GE reaffirmed that it expects 2%-4% organic revenue growth in 2016, with sales expected to accelerate in the back half of the year. It also confirmed earlier EPS guidance of $1.45-$1.55 for the year, in line with analyst views.Windau isn't worried about the Q1 drop in industrial revenue growth, saying that has been seen broadly in the industrial sector as oil and gas has been a headwind for a couple of quarters with lingering currency effects as well.""It's a positive that they stuck by their guidance,"" he added. ""That's baking in a pretty decent improvement in the back half of the year.""Along with its digital shift, GE continues to shed other businesses. In January, GE agreed to sell its home appliances business to China's Haier Group for $5.4 billion. Immelt said Friday that GE has inked deals to sell $166 billion of its $200 billion GE Capital businesses and is ahead of schedule on divesting that business.As GE repositions, other diversified manufacturers considered big moves too. Earlier this year, Honeywell (HON) revealed that it had tried to buy United Technologies (UTX) for more than $90 billion. But Honeywell ended its pursuit in March due to United Tech's unwillingness to engage in talks.On Friday, Honeywell also reported quarterly results. Earnings climbed 8.5% to $1.53 a share, beating by 3 cents. Revenue grew 3.4% to $9.52 billion, topping analyst projections for $9.37 billion.It raised the low end of its 2016 guidance and now sees EPS of $6.55-$6.70 vs. $6.45-$6.70 previously, on sales of $40.3 billion-$40.9 billion vs. an earlier view for $39.9 billion-$40.9 billion. Analysts see EPS of $6.61 on sales of $40.58 billion.Shares dipped 0.7%.

321,ORCL,"Software maker Splunk (SPLK), with its specialty of helping companies make sense out of machine, or unstructured, data, has cloud and platform potential for huge growth that could attract some possible tech leaders as suitors, including Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), an investment bank said in a research note Tuesday.""Given that Splunk is considered one of the best infrastructure software vendors in the space, based upon our conversations with people far smarter than us, we believe Splunk has become an intriguing acquisition candidate,"" Summit Redstone Partners analyst Srini Nandury wrote in initiating coverage of Splunk stock with a buy rating.Nandury said acquisition candidates, besides Amazon and Microsoft, include IBM (IBM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and database leader Oracle (ORCL).For years, Splunk in general has been viewed as a possible buyout candidate — Oracle and IBM surfaced as takeover candidates in 2013, for example — but no specific chatter has surfaced of late. Splunk's market cap is near $8 billion.IBD'S TAKE: It's not just its lead in e-commerce that's sparking Amazon.com. The company's Amazon Web Services cloud business leads its market and is growing fast. Amazon has set up shop of late on the IBD Leaderboard, which singles out only the top-performing stocks. Amazon stock is extended from an April breakout but continues to show strength at its 10-day line.Nandury wrote that ""we believe any acquirer would need to pay a significant premium from the current levels to close the deal ... given that it (Splunk) can provide years of growth for any potential acquirer.""Splunk's earnings for the quarter ended July 31, released on Aug. 25, beat Wall Street expectations, but billings growth disappointed as the company transitions into more of a cloud on-demand provider, and shares fell 10% the next day. But Splunk added more than 500 new customers, better than estimates of about 475 new customers, and its 446 individual sales above $100,000 easily topped the 405 or so analysts had expected.Splunk stock finished the trading day up 2.8% to 61.05 on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day line after dropping below that support area after its earnings report. Shares touched a nine-month high at 65.75 on Aug. 15.Among other things, Splunk's software helps enterprises finds performance bottlenecks in their networks. Publicly traded since 2012, it originally was not a cloud provider — instead selling on-premise licenses for large upfront payments — but it's been moving more in that direction along with the overall market.""Splunk's platform is used to derive new insights that are used by users to improve service levels, lower operational costs and address security risks in real time,"" Nandury said. ""Splunk's highly flexible platform allows it to continually develop new use cases such as real-time security and IoT ... .""He said Splunk's total addressable market will rise to about $50 billion in 2017, from about $30 billion in 2013.Following the recent earnings report, BC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg said in a research note that ""we believe Splunk is one of the best stories in growth software.""

322,ORCL,"One highly dangerous investing approach that all traders in growth stocks ought to think over is ""averaging down.""It's one of the biggest myths in investing, particularly for high-growth companies. Don't confuse it with the cost-averaging method of long-term investing in a mutual fund or broad-based equity ETF.When a high-octane growth stock has topped, rarely does it come back quickly and lead the next market uptrend. In fact, many stocks don't approach their all-time highs for years.Just look at five former huge winners during the 1990s: Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Qualcomm (QCOM).Intel this past week took out its December 2014 peak of 37.90. Yet shares are still miles below their August 2000 all-time high of 75.81. Qualcomm is up in 2016, yet it's still more than 37% below an all-time split-adjusted high of 100, seen in January 2000.""Averaging down"" means buying a stock, watching it drop and then buying more shares, resulting in a lower average price. You might hear people tell you that averaging down is a great idea, but in fact it's generally a risky way to operate.These folks will say something like: ""If you liked a stock at 64, then you should love it at 54."" They could be referring to a former high-profile stock such as pioneering smartphone maker BlackBerry (BBRY), formerly known as Research In Motion.That makes some sense, but here's another way to think about it that could save you some pain: If a stock has fallen below your purchase price, then it's quite simply a losing investment. When the losses approach 7%-8%, cut the stock loose and find a better name. You can sell the stock even more quickly if you judge the price and volume action to be negative.What if you ignore IBD's golden sell rule and instead opt to follow the stock lower? It means buying more shares could amount to throwing good money after bad, as the saying goes.Let's say you had bought BlackBerry in January 2011, as the stock cleared a possible buy point at 64.04 (1).There were some flaws with this breakout, such as an overly deep base, but you jumped in anyway.In any case, the breakout didn't provide much upside, and pretty quickly you would have had an opportunity to average down.And this example shows why averaging down is often a bad strategy. BlackBerry continued to drop, so you really would have been throwing good money after bad if you added to your position in March (2) or April (3) or later.You should have been selling your original position to avoid further losses, rather than adding to it. BlackBerry tripped some key IBD sell rules, such as by falling 8% below 64.04 and penetrating its 10-week and 40-week moving averages in heavy turnover.Also, there's a big opportunity cost. By keeping your money in a dog, you're losing the chance to invest in a market leader.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the March 27, 2012, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Know the golden rule of selling stocksA dive below the 50-day moving average is a key sell rule

Six of those 15 quarters have topped 30% earnings growth, including Q3 and Q4 2015, and all but two of the last 15 topped 20%.While still 25% off a record high 77.75 set Dec. 7, Manhattan Associates stock was up more than 1.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 58 and 31% above its 44.27 nadir hit Feb. 8 during this year's software slump. Most of its bigger enterprise-software rivals have been faring better, with the biggest, Oracle (ORCL) up fractionally, 9% off recent highs. Enterprise software maker SAP (SAP) was also up fractionally and just 2% off a recent high, while Salesforce.com (CRM) was up more than 1%, just 7% off its recent high.The entire IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, which does not include Oracle as a member, is about 9% off its Nov. 9 high. Oracle is a member of IBD's Computer Software-Database group, which is 22% off an August high.Among the re-accelerants that management might discuss Tuesday is just how much its new distribution management (DM) tools announced last week might contribute to revenue. Its new DM Mobile platform gives users ""the ability to address any operational issues, including inventory issues, directly from the floor via their tablet devices, increasing mobility and driving productivity and efficiency,"" the company announced at the MODEX supply-chain management show in Atlanta.On Feb. 3, just before Manhattan stock tanked more than 20% in three trading sessions, William Blair analyst Matthew Pfau said in a research note that ""the 2016 EPS guidance that management provided is conservative, and through a combination of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and share repurchases we expect Manhattan to continue to increase its EPS in excess of 15% over the next several years.""We recommend shares to long-term investors looking for a midcap software company with a strong record of execution and sustainable earnings growth opportunity.""By consensus, Pfau and four other Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Manhattan to deliver Q1 earnings up 15% to 39 cents per share minus items, on revenue up 8.9% to $145.5 million. That would be a record quarter in hard dollars, but the year-over-year rate would be only slightly better than Q4's 8% growth to $141 million and only the third time in 15 quarters that its sales growth had slipped into single digits. Over the past five years, it's averaged 14% sales growth annually and 15% earnings growth.Manhattan guided full 2016 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $1.69 to $1.72, the midpoint slightly below analysts' $1.71 consensus, or up 12.5% from 2015. It guided 2016 sales to a range of $609 million to $615 million, its midpoint coinciding with analysts' $612 million consensus, up 10% from 2015.""Although the retail environment remains challenging, Manhattan has not seen a material change in IT purchasing trends from retails and the pipeline is still strong,"" Pfau said. ""However, we believe that management's guidance takes into account a cautious retail IT spending environment for 2016.""While Manhattan's core software manages warehouse inventory, its visualization tools allow users to see everything from the manufacturer's supplies to the consumer's purchase at the checkout counter. Pfau noted that 70% of its total license revenue comes from its basic warehouse management systems (WMS) license revenue, so WMS is a ""leading indicator for sales of Manhattan's other solutions."" License revenue, however, amounts to only 14% of its total revenue. Most of its sales, 77%, come from services related to its software licenses.""We will continue to be a serial investor in innovation,"" Manhattan CEO Eddie Capel said in February.

327,ORCL,"Google is making more money from mobile search, as Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft (MSFT) ad platforms falter. But it’s not all gravy, as parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Q1 earnings attest.The good news is that clicks on Google’s mobile search ads are rising fast. Mobile rose from 44% of all Google clicks in Q2 2015 to 57% in Q1 2016, says digital marketing firm Merkle.But mobile ad clicks continue to pay less than desktop ad clicks because consumers buy less often on smartphones. Google’s average cost of a click on one of its ads fell 9% in Q1 vs. Q1 2015. Lower-priced mobile clicks were a big factor.Google aims to drive mobile cost-per-clicks (CPCs) higher with new ad technology.There’s also the matter of traffic acquisition costs (TAC). That’s where Apple (AAPL) may or may not come in.Google’s overall TAC -- what it pays partner websites, both desktop and mobile, in fees for carrying its ads -- rose 13% in Q1, to $3.8 billion. Higher TAC shrunk Alphabet’s earnings, which missed Wall Street estimates.More alarming to analysts was that TAC paid to “distribution partners” jumped 33% to $1.22 billion.Google’s search engine is the default on most mobile devices, and it’s the default search engine for Apple’s Safari browser. There’s been speculation over whether Apple and Google will renew the Safari contract. To some analysts, the 33% jump in “distribution partner” TAC was a red flag.On the company's Q1 earnings call last month, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat attributed the TAC hike to general mobile trends and new advertising technology -- and not to any one major contract renewal. Mobile TAC is higher than desktop TAC, Porat said.But analysts wonder.“I certainly can’t rule out a higher Safari TAC rate tied to a renewal,"" Mark Ballard, senior research director at Merkle, told IBD. ""There are so many moving pieces here, and Google and Apple have been very tight-lipped about their dealings over the years.“It very well could be a combination of higher Safari traffic share and TAC rate. (But) Google has made some moves in the past few quarters to significantly ramp up the monetization of its mobile results. This additional revenue may be coming at a higher TAC.”Ballard notes that Google in late 2015 added a third ad atop mobile-search results. Growing use of product listing ads (PLAs) in mobile phone search results may be another factor.Google’s Q2 earnings in July could provide more evidence either way.“We think the terms of (Google’s) contracts have potentially changed and could be another driving factor of the growing TAC,” Evan Wilson, a Pacific Crest analyst, said in a research report. “At this point, we've modeled (TAC) increases to be gradual and not a significant new headwind.""We're going to keep a close eye on news of a potential new Apple deal, as this would be a primary suspect to further fuel this dynamic.”The big picture, though, is that if TAC rises sharply, it would be a problem for Google’s profitability, whether or not Apple is directly involved.At RBC Capital, analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a research note: “We view the Q1 TAC trends as one of the clear negatives of the quarter. That 8.5% TAC rate for Google Sites is a material step up. We wonder whether a renegotiated Apple contract had anything to do with this. (But) we are modeling modest growth in TAC going forward.”Documents released in January in the ongoing Google-Oracle (ORCL) court battle revealed that Google paid Apple $1 billion in 2014 to make its search engine No. 1 on Safari. TAC payments, though, are separate, analysts say.Goldman Sachs, in a 2015 research report, estimated that 75% of Google’s mobile search revenue came from iOS users (iPhone and tablet), and half of that was related to Safari. Goldman Sachs estimated that 65% of ad revenue went to Apple, while Google kept 35%.Alphabet stock was up a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, while Apple stock was down more than 1%.

328,ORCL,"IBM (IBM) closed down 5.6% at 144 Tuesday, following a first-quarter earnings report late Monday that beat estimates but still left room for concern.IBM has been undergoing a major transition, shedding older technologies while making a concerted push into growth areas such as cloud computing, Big Data analytics, security and mobile computing -- areas it calls strategic imperatives. The transition helps explain why revenue growth has declined each quarter for the past four years.In its Q1 earnings results, IBM reported revenue of $18.7 billion, down 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter but edging the Wall Street consensus estimate of $18.3 billion. Revenue from strategic imperatives rose 14%. Total cloud revenue rose 34%.Earnings per share ex items of $2.35 easily beat views of $2.09, as polled by Thomson Reuters, but were down 19% and marked the fourth quarter in a row of EPS declines.IBM stock fell in the stock market today presumably on the view that Q2 expectations are below estimates. IBM does not provide formal quarterly guidance, but its implied EPS guidance of $2.85 for Q2 is below the consensus estimate of 3.01. Despite the Q1 beat, IBM did not increase but instead maintained its full-year earnings outlook.IBD's Take: How healthy is IBM's stock and how does it stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupRBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani maintained a sector perform rating on IBM stock, and a price target of 155.“We believe the competitive challenges are emerging from companies seeking to build a business model similar to IBM's, notably Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), and Dell,” he wrote. Of these competitors, he said, Hewlett-Packard is the closest. Another is Cisco.“Beyond Hewlett-Packard and Cisco, there are also others attempting to recreate the IBM model,” he wrote.A harsher report on IBM came from Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha, who reiterated an underperform rating and a price target of 110 on IBM stock.“We believe the quality of earnings was again low and the manner in which IBM has chosen to manage its business seems unsustainable,” Garcha wrote. “We believe the secular and structural challenges facing IBM remain, and specifically see limited improvement in Services and Software margins.”UBS analyst Steven Milunovich maintained a neutral rating on IBM but raised his price target to 150 from 132.“The quarter was mixed with revenue and EPS beating due to currency improvement, acquisitions, and the Japan tax rebate,” he wrote. “We give IBM credit for changing the narrative,"" with an emphasis on becoming a leader in the new category of Cognitive Computing, which includes its Watson computer business, he wrote.Drexel Hamilton raised its revenue forecast, maintained its EPS projection and raised the price target to 166 from 160.

329,ORCL,"Breakouts don’t always work the way an investor would prefer.Ideally, you want to see steady gains after a breakout. When a stock rolls over after a breakout, it’s easy to close the position and then forget about the “loser” stock.Yet, sometimes a loser is a winner that just needs to foul off a few of the market’s pitches before connecting for a long drive.The individual investor needs to stay awake and alert after an apparent failure. The stock could form a base-on-base pattern.The base on base’s story runs like this: A stock creates and breaks out of a base. After rising modestly, the stock retreats and forms a second base on top of the first base.The overall pattern might look like two ladles with the second hung a little higher than the first.Often the lows of the second ladle are at or near the highs of the first.A base-on-base pattern is often the depiction of a strong stock fighting weak market conditions. IBD founder William O’Neil describes it this way in “How to Make Money in Stocks”:“What happens is that a powerful stock breaks out of its base and advances, but is unable to increase a normal 20% to 30% because the general market begins another leg down. The stock therefore pulls back in price and builds a second back-and-forth price consolidation area just on top of its previous base while the general market averages keep making new lows.“When the bearish phase in the overall market ends ... this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain.”On Sept. 3, 1999, Oracle (ORCL) broke out in heavy volume (please see a daily chart). The buy point was 39.91 (before a pair of 2-for-1 splits taking place in 2000). The Composite Rating was 97. The industry group rating was A.The market was doing well. On the same day as Oracle’s breakout, the Nasdaq surged 4% in heavier trade. But it didn’t last, and the Nasdaq delivered four distribution days over the next three weeks.Oracle stumbled with the market. The tech stock also delivered quarterly results that only matched views. The Street was hoping for better. Oracle slipped.The stock then shaped a base on base. The base showed positive characteristics. Trading was tight within the base (1), a sign of support.The Nasdaq began to climb Oct. 28. Oracle broke out the next session, surpassing a 47.04 entry point in heavy volume. The stock advanced 283% in five months, while the Nasdaq jumped about 75%.

330,ORCL,"With its stock trading within shouting distance of its all-time high, Adobe Systems (ADBE) earned a price-target hike on Tuesday from investment bank FBR Capital Markets.Adobe stock was up a fraction to above 93 in midday trading on the stock market today. The provider of cloud-based media and marketing software hit a record high of 98 on March 18. It sports a good IBD Relative Strength Rating of 85, putting it among the top 15% of all stocks in performance the past 12 months.FBR analyst Samad Samana raised his price target on Adobe stock to 115 from 110 and reiterated his market perform rating.He predicts Adobe will see 20%-plus revenue growth and 30%-plus EPS growth for the next two years. Adobe has shifted its business from perpetual license software to software-as-a-service delivered over the Internet.“We believe the transition to a subscription model has yielded a more attractive business model,” Samana said. “We expect this to be reflected in fiscal 2016 and beyond.”Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes software for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Marketing Cloud provides online marketing and advertising services. Document Cloud leverages Adobe’s popular online document-sharing product Acrobat and its ubiquitous PDF format.The company’s Creative Cloud business earns most of the attention, but its Marketing Cloud is maturing at the right time, Samana said.“Digital marketing is at or near the top of the priority list for enterprises, and Adobe appears well positioned to help companies transform their businesses to be more engaging with end customers,” he said in a research report.Adobe should be able to continue posting healthy growth in the digital marketing business despite competition from Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and others, he said.RELATED:Adobe Driving Third Wave Of Enterprise Software Disruption

331,ORCL,"Stocks turned  higher in late afternoon trading Thursday, as Apple (AAPL) received a price target cut and Oracle (ORCL) got hit with a whistleblower lawsuit.The Nasdaq rose 0.2% while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 climbed 0.1%. Volume was tracking lower across the board vs. the same time Wednesday.Oil, meat products and building-related stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today. Oil stocks slid as OPEC, as expected, said it will not set production limits. But West Texas intermediate oil reversed an earlier loss and was up slightly to $49.07 a barrel after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. stockpiles fell last week. Department stores, biotechs and other medical stocks outperformed.Apple led the Dow laggards with a 1% drop in heavier-than-usual trade, though off its intraday lows. The stock is on track for a fourth straight decline after hitting resistance just above the 100 level. Shares are still below their 50-day and 200-day moving average lines. Goldman Sachs cut its price target to 124 from 136 and lowered its iPhone unit sales forecasts fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, but maintained a buy rating.Does Apple lead its Telecom-Consumer products group? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup.Oracle gapped down and fell more than 4% in rapid volume to test its 200-day line for the first time since March. Svetlana Blackburn, a former senior finance manager, on Wednesday sued the software maker for allegedly firing her for complaining about accounting practices in its cloud computing business. Oracle said it plans to countersue.IBD 50 stocks were mostly quiet. U.S. Concrete (USCR) gave up 2% as it fell further below its 50- day line. The stock is 4% above a 59.50 cup-with-handle buy point and 11% off its high.Medical software maker Veeva Systems (VEEV) added 2.5% in robust trade.

332,ORCL,"Stocks saw mild declines in morning trading. OPEC's decision not to set production limits hit energy stocks such as Chevron (CVX), while Oracle (ORCL) dived on accounting allegations. But Ciena (CIEN) rallied on better-than-expected earnings.The Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.2%. The Dow utility average sank 1.1%.Oracle shares fell nearly 5% to 38.33 to the lowest since mid-March, though they found support at the 200-day line. A former senior finance officer, Svetlana Blackburn, sued the software giant for allegedly firing her for complaining about its cloud computing accounting practices. Oracle said she was fired for poor performance and said it plans to countersue.Ciena reported fiscal second-quarter adjusted profit of 34 cents a share, down from 35 cents a year ago but blasting Wall Street's 27-cent consensus view. Revenue edged 3% higher to $640.7 million, also stretching past the consensus estimate.The small-cap specialist in ethernet switches for the cable and telecom markets surged 11% to 19.74, butting up against its falling 200-day moving average. Such a strong move improves the chances that Ciena can form a new base that could usher a new breakout.Ciena's Telecom-Fiber Optics group has advanced to No. 41, just outside the top 40 among IBD's 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative performance. Typically, great stock market winners also show excellent industry group strength when they break out to new highs.In recent months, fellow telecom gear plays Acacia Communications (ACIA), featured earlier this week in IBD's Stock Spotlight daily column, and JDS Uniphase spin-off Lumentum (LITE) have shown strength lately. The latter, which rose as high as 25.72, reversed to trade down 1.8% at 24.91, back below its 50-day line. The stock broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 22.74 on Feb. 4 and gained 23% before surrendering all of those gains. Acacia reversed also, trading down 2.3%.Major oil explorers slumped as crude oil futures cooled off.  OPEC, as expected, did not set production limits at its meeting. U.S. oil inventories fell in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but less than expected. The near-term WTI crude oil contract fell 0.8% to $48.60 a barrel; in late May oil attempted to pierce the $50 level but came up a bit short, rising to as high as $49.56 on May 25.Chevron, part of the Dow 30, dropped 1.3% to 99.85. The integrated oil and gas giant has rebounded nicely since January, rallying as much as 38% from a Jan. 20 low of 75.33. Lately, the stock has been moving sideways, locked in a price range of 98 to 104. It's also now just 3% below a 52-week peak of 102.11.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, NetEase (NTES) eased 1.5% to 173.59. The Chinese online gaming and internet portal giant has been forming the right side of a new cup base for the past six weeks; the potential buy point stands at 186.55 for now, 10 cents above the cup's left side high. It's currently No. 4 in the IBD 50.ADP reported a 173,000 lift in private-sector payrolls for May, slightly below the Econoday forecast, but the April figure was revised higher to 166,000 from 156,000. The numbers are treated as a preview to the Labor Department's payroll survey, slated for release Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.As seen in Wednesday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend, which means it's OK to buy breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points with a reasonable amount of risk.Do you know if your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

333,ORCL,"Medical software provider and IBD 50 stock Veeva Systems (VEEV) beat fiscal Q1 estimates and raised guidance after the close Thursday, sending the stock up 12% in after-hours trading.Veeva stock fell a fraction in Thursday's regular session but earlier touched a 14-month high of 30.Veeva's main business is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software specialized for the medical industry, but it's been branching out with its Vault offering, guiding clinical development, quality management and other applications for the life-science industry. In a preview note Monday, William Blair analyst Amanda Murphy wrote that she expected a good quarter.""Our sense is that the core fundamentals remain strong and we expect Veeva’s multitenant cloud offerings to continue to take share from Oracle (ORCL) and IMS Health (IMS) within the CRM space and Documentum within the document management space,"" Murphy wrote.Veeva made 15 cents a share in the quarter ended April 30, up 25% from the year-earlier quarter and 4 cents ahead of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 33% to $119.8 million, more than $4 million ahead of consensus.Veeva guided Q2 earnings in line with Wall Street at 13 cents a share, and revenue guidance of $125 million to $127 million was above expectations. A year ago, the company made 12 cents a share on $87 million in revenue.Full-year guidance was above estimates on both the top and bottom lines, with revenue between $516 million and $520 million and EPS of 55 to 57 cents. Last year, the Veeva did $409 million and 51 cents, respectively.With an IBD Composite Rating of 95, Veeva is No. 21 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.

334,ORCL,"Workday (WDAY) reports fiscal Q1 earnings late Tuesday, with analysts looking for earnings-call commentary on billings growth, international sales, competition with Oracle (ORCL), and newer financial products.Wedbush on Friday downgraded Workday stock to underperform from neutral, and Workday stock fell 2.5% that day, to 76.03, and for a time was breaching its 50-day moving average. Workday stock has a possible 80.10 buy point out of a cup base, however, and even with Friday’s loss its shares are up 25% since the company posted a fiscal Q4 earnings beat on Feb. 29.Wedbush expects Workday to deliver in-line or better-than-expected Q1 results, but the investment bank says competition with Oracle has heated up. Workday also competes with SAP (SAP), NetSuite (N) and Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), among others.Workday sells software to large companies, to help them handle human resources and financial management tasks. Its core market is called human capital management, or HCM.Analysts expect revenue for the three months ended April 30 to rise 35% from the year-earlier quarter, to $339 million. Billings, a sales growth metric, are usually a topic on earnings calls. Amid large investments in sales and marketing and R&D, Workday is expected to report a 2-cent per share loss, the same in the year-earlier quarter.Of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, 19 rate Workday stock a buy or strong buy, while 15 have hold ratings and one analyst says sell.Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, who rates Workday equal weight, says 2017 billings growth guidance, now at 30% for 2017, is one key.Nomura analyst Frederick Grieb, who has a neutral rating, expects Workday to raise its 2017 revenue growth outlook.At William Blair, analyst Justin Furby wrote in a research note: “We expect that management’s tone around financials will again be positive this quarter, and we would not be surprised to hear it sound bullish on the international opportunity.” Furby has an outperform rating on Workday stock.
"
335,ORCL,"While SAP (SAP) late Friday preannounced Q1 earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street views, investors Monday were buoyed by the German enterprise software company's assurances that its pipeline is flowing strongly into Q2.SAP stock was up a fraction, near 77, in afternoon trading in the stock market today, just 7% off an 18-month high of 82.70 set July 25.In its release Friday, SAP CEO Bill McDermott said he expects ""increasing momentum"" in 2016. Shares of rival Salesforce.com (CRM) were down a fraction Monday afternoon, but rival Oracle (ORCL) was up a fraction.With final Q1 results scheduled for release April 20 before the open, SAP issued preliminary earnings of 0.64 euros per share minus items (73 cents at Monday's exchange rate), up 9%, where Wall Street analysts expected 0.70 euros. It said revenue rose 5% to 4.73 billion euros (or $5.39 billion), short of the 4.85 billion euros and 4.82 billion euros that Evercore ISI and Wall Street projected, respectively, observed Evercore ISI in a research note.One euro was worth about $1.14 Monday.In a research note Sunday, Evercorse ISI analyst Kirk Materne said he's looking for ""more color"" from SAP on April 20,  but ""we expect the (Q1) license shortfall and comments around a slower start in the Americas are going to pressure shares on Monday despite SAP reiterating its full-year guidance and the comments around a 'strong (Q2) pipeline.' ""Materne maintained a buy rating on SAP stock, but said ""we continue to favor Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT) in  mega-cap software.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan maintained a sector perform rating on SAP stock but lowered his price target to 78 from 81.MacMillan noted that SAP's Q1 cloud bookings of 140 million euros rose 22% year over year, and more than 25% in constant currency.""We view this as slightly disappointing"" following Q4's 75% ""organic growth,"" less than 50% in constant currency, ""although do note that (Q1) is a seasonally weak quarter,"" MacMillan said. ""SAP also added over 500 new S4HANA customers, of which around 30% (i.e. about 150) are net new. While well below about 1,400 customer adds in (Q4), we would expect (Q1) to be seasonally weaker.""He said weakness in the energy sector and ""some pull forward of demand"" in Q4 due to S4HANA product promotions drove SAP's softness in Q1. ""As a result, we think there is limited read-through for other companies in enterprise software.""Got that, Salesforce.com sellers?""SAP’s fundamental growth drivers are rock solid, from our best-in-class S4HANA applications to our completeness of vision in the cloud,” said SAP's McDermott in Friday's release. ""We expect increasing momentum as the year progresses, fully consistent with our guidance for the full year. SAP continues to be a highly profitable growth company.”HANA is SAP's linchpin business software suite.CFO Luka Mucic said the Americas, dragged by Brazil, ""got off to a slower start.""

336,ORCL,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other rivals of Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google had better raise their game in artificial intelligence.While Apple, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have AI research projects underway, the field is one where Google aims to set itself apart from rivals.So said Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, Thursday in an open letter. Google founders  Larry Page and Sergey Brin normally write the founder’s letter, in the tradition of Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA) Warren Buffett. But Pichai wrote this year’s note.Pichai says that AI is key not only to its core search business and mobile computing, but also to Google’s push into the enterprise (corporate) market and cloud computing.“A key driver behind all of this work has been our long-term investment in machine learning and AI,” Pichai wrote.Google has pushed Android software-based mobile phones into a global power vs. Apple’s iPhone. (The Oracle (ORCL) vs. Google copyright battle over the Android OS is slated to resume with a second trial on May 9.)Pichai says that Google’s AI will be a difference maker.“Looking to the future, the next big step will be for the very concept of the 'device' to fade away. Over time, the computer itself -- whatever its form factor -- will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile-first to an AI-first world,” he said.While Apple and Google have dominated in the world of mobile apps, there could be competition down the road. Facebook recently introduced “chatbots,” while Microsoft (MSFT) launched its “Bot Framework” software tools for developers. Both rely on AI.Google also aims to capitalize on AI in the enterprise market vs. Microsoft and others.“Google started in the cloud and has been investing in infrastructure, data management, analytics and AI from the very beginning. We now have a broad and growing set of enterprise offerings: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google Apps, Chromebooks, Android, image recognition, speech translation, maps, machine learning for customers’ proprietary data sets and more,” Pichai said.“As we look to our long-term investments in our productivity tools supported by our machine learning and artificial intelligence efforts, we see huge opportunities to dramatically improve how people work. Your phone should proactively bring up the right documents, schedule and map your meetings, let people know if you are late, suggest responses to messages, handle your payments and expenses, etc.”

337,ORCL,"With a chance to chat with Oracle (ORCL) customers during its Chicago trade show that ends Thursday, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne came away more convinced that the legacy software leader has its head in the fast-growing cloud.And atop Oracle's head is a ""halo for more cloud uptake,"" UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a separate research note.Not that Oracle investors necessarily agree. Oracle stock was down 1.5% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 40. Rival Workday (WDAY) was down about 1%, but upstart enterprise software competitor ServiceNow (NOW) was up a fraction.Beginning with Oracle's fiscal 2017, which starts June 1, its cloud ""contribution to overall revenue growth will more than offset the declines in the new software license business (or in a more bearish scenario, essentially cancel out the license declines), which we expect to be a 2% headwind to total revenue growth,"" Materne wrote in a research note Thursday.By cloud, he means software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS), the popular pay-a-little-as-you-go model that is supplanting large, long-term license fees for software running on-premise enterprises and databases.""And as the base of new license revenue gets smaller, in FY '18 we project that new software license declines will negatively impact revenue growth by just 90 (basis points),"" Materne said.His parsing of the numbers, customer satisfaction and co-CEO Mark Hurd's commentary came out of the HCM World conference, where some of Oracle's 6,000 Fusion HCM (human capital management) clients began gathering Tuesday at the Hyatt Regency Chicago to compare notes.Not that they're all up and running with the new software. It's a process. Materne said only about 1,000 ""core"" human resources customers have gone ""live"" with Fusion HCM. Others are gearing up.The lag time between landing a customer and fully implementing the software was on Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri's mind during his last quarterly conference call when he said bluntly that Oracle has ""had time to get customers into production and hasn't been able to, (while) 75% of our customers are in production. That's actually the real driver behind win rates.""UBS analyst Thill, in his research note Thursday, counted 600 live customers of Oracle's latest Fusion HCM release, including Schneider Electric, BT Group (BT) and Siemens (SIEGY). He said the ""pace of go-lives (is) improving as sales/post-sales motions have matured.""Cloud uptake (is) begetting more cloud (with) better attach rates of other cloud solutions,"" Thill said, adding that about 50% of Oracle's midsize HCM customers are also buying Oracle's financial management SaaS.Besides, Oracle's ""international prowess (is) underappreciated, with some of the biggest opportunities outside the U.S.,"" he said.Oracle supports seven ""global payrolls"" with software in 24 languages in 199 countries, Thill said.While cloud growth might ""offset"" legacy sale slippage, cloud products won't outsell on-premise revenue anytime soon. In Oracle's Q3 ended Feb. 29, total revenue fell 3% to $9 billion, due largely to currency headwinds. SaaS and PaaS sales rose 57% from a year earlier to $583 million, as legacy on-premise software slipped 1% to $7.1 billion, although the latter was up 3% in constant currency.For the current Q4 ending May 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Oracle to report earnings per share minus items of 82 cents, up 5%, on revenue of $10.46 billion, down 2.3%.

338,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) stock slipped nearly 1% and Alphabet (GOOGL) stalled flat following a report that Oracle will seek as much as $9.3 billion in damages from Google Android's use of Oracle’s iconic Java software.Oracle sued six years ago, before Google restructured into Alphabet, and is preparing for a second trial to start May 9, according to an IDG News Service report.When it first went to trial in 2012, Android was said to be the world’s largest mobile operating system, with more than 300 million users. Today, it has more than 1.4 billion active accounts.In the first trial, the jury found that Google had used Oracle’s Java code for mobile Android but struggled over Google's claim to limited ""fair use"" of Oracle's code.""The core issue is whether the APIs (application programming interfaces) here are copyrightable, and that’s for the court to decide,"" Jim Prosser, Google’s global communications manager at the time, told IBD in May 2012. ""We expect to prevail on this issue and Oracle’s other claims.""Later that month, the jury ruled in favor of Google over the ""fair use"" question. An appellate court overruled the decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Google’s last appeal, essentially sending the case back to the trial court.Oracle presented the new damage total in court filings, according to IDG reports Monday, which also said that Google may have put a $100 million cap on some damages, according to an Oracle filing.Oracle fell 0.9% to 40.62 in the stock market today, 10% off a five-month June 16 high of 45.24 and 3% off a March 21 peak at 42. Google parent Alphabet closed down 0.2% to 753.28 Monday, just 7% off its Feb. 2 all-time record high of 810.35.Oracle and Google spokespeople could not immediately be reached for comment.

Comps jumped 15.2%.Analysts have praised the cosmetics retailer, whose in-store salons, loyalty program and vast array of offerings have enticed customers to return and try out new products, rather than buy their supplies on Amazon (AMZN).A jury ruled in favor of Google parent Alphabet, rejecting a $9 billion copyright claim from Oracle, deciding that Alphabet’s Google had made fair use of Oracle’s Java code. Oracle had argued that Google needed a license to use its Java programming language in its Android mobile operating system. The legal case, which began in 2010, revolved around Google's use of Java APIs.Oracle plans to appeal the jury verdict.Oracle had won partial jury verdict in 2012, but a judge threw out the ruling.Alphabet stock rose slightly in late trade.

342,ORCL,"Adobe Systems (ADBE), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec (SYMC) are among smaller sharks that could get involved in the ongoing acquisition spree of software companies, says Pacific Crest Securities.Salesforce.com (CRM) last week acquired Demandware (DWRE), sparking speculation over what other companies could be acquired. Playing matchmaker, Pacific Crest says in a research report that Adobe could target Shopify (SHOP). One analyst last week said Adobe could have been in the hunt for Demandware.Adobe Systems stock closed up 0.4% in the stock market today. Shopify rose 1.4%. Symantec ended essentially flat, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock climbed 3.3%.Other possible targets, speculates Pacific Crest, include such ""minnows"" as  Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Apigee (APIC) and Imperva (IMPV).While Microsoft (MSFT) was not active in the 2011 round of software-related M&As, Pacific Crest says it looms as a buyer in the current cycle. Microsoft in early 2015 tried to buy Salesforce.com, said reports. Some rumors of late, though, have Amazon.com as a possible Salesforce.com buyer.Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a move that could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say. HPE holds its Discover 2016 conference this week in Las Vegas, where new partnerships may be announced.Pacific Crest speculates that IBM could be a suitor for a security software firm or Apigee.“The 2016 M&A cycle includes a larger pool of minnows, but also more sharks,” said the Pacific Crest report. “Not only do we see the size of the software M&A pool expanding into analytics and security this cycle, we also believe the vertical software market is ripe for consolidation, particularly within health care.”Pacific Crest also includes Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in its pool of potential sharks. It says SAP, Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), too, could be on the prowl, as is usually the case for those sharks.

343,ORCL,"At the rate Workday (WDAY) is growing its core human capital management (HCM) software, combined with its new financial management products, analysts Ross MacMillan and Matthew Hedberg can see Workday's path to $5 billion in yearly sales by 2021. The company just hit it first billion-dollar year, closing its fiscal year ended Jan. 31 with sales of $1.16 billion.The pair of RBC Capital Markets analysts on Sunday raised their price target on Workday stock to 92 from 72 and affirmed their outperform rating.Workday stock rose a fraction Monday to a 2016 high, making its seventh consecutive up-day, closing at 78.92. Last week, Workday stock broke out of a cup-with-handle at a 75.60 buy point.Workday wasn't alone Monday. Rival ServiceNow (NOW) rose 3.6%  to 64.28 on a bullish report from William Blair on its long-term fundamentals.Bigger enterprise software rivals Salesforce (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) all slipped a fraction.RBC's MacMillan and Hedberg drew confidence by comparing Workday to PeopleSoft in 2001, four years before its HCM and financial management (FM) software businesses were acquired by Oracle for $10.4 billion. PeopleSoft co-founder David Duffield, who fought the Oracle takeover, went on to co-found Workday.""A look back at PeopleSoft is striking,"" they said. ""Workday today has (less than) 25% of PeopleSoft’s customer count in 2001, yet Workday has (more than) 50% of PeopleSoft’s revenue at that time. This is particularly interesting, given Workday has yet to generate any meaningful financial management revenue today and which (according to management) was (more than) 50% of PeopleSoft’s revenue at the time of acquisition by Oracle.""In other words, the RBC analysts say, Workday has plenty of room to grow. ""Success in financials would support a path to $5 billion,"" they wrote. ""While financials (are) not the focus in this note, we think the path to $5 billion revenue remains underpinned (split less than 50% HCM, more than 50% FM) which we think can be realized in the next 5-plus years.""For its fiscal 2016 ended Jan. 31, Workday revenue rose 48% to $1.16 billion. It lost 1 cent per share minus items, a huge improvement from a 33-cent loss in fiscal 2015.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a Q1 per-share loss minus items of 2 cents, on revenue up 35% to $339 million. They expect adjusted profit to break into the black in Q3.

On Wednesday, Workday stock broke out of a 12-week, first-stage cup-with-handle base with a 75.60 buy point.Workday competes against no shortage of rivals, including SAP (SAP), Salesforce.com (CRM) and legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL). Salesforce stock was up 1.6% to 74.98 at midday Friday, and Oracle was up fractionally at 40.96. But SAP stock was down 0.8% to 79.74.Samana said he learned that Workday had added more than 45 financial software customers in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, ""the most ever in a single quarter."" At 207 financial customers, it's more than double the base of a year before.For Q4, Workday earnings beat Wall Street views, but its Q1 revenue outlook missed estimates.For fiscal Q1, ending in April, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Workday to lose an adjusted two cents per share minus items, flat with a year earlier, on revenue up 35% to $339 million.Workday went public in October 2012, priced at 28.

345,ORCL,"When you're ""a small player in a large market that is still new, fragmented and growing,"" a key to success is ""staying one step ahead of the competition,"" and that's what workplace software developer Zendesk (ZEN) is doing, said Summit Research analyst Jonathan Kees.Following the upbeat commentary in Kees' research note, issued Sunday, Zendesk stock was up a fraction in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, but it's still more than 25% below a 17-month high at 27.52, touched Dec. 4.Like other players in the infamous Software Sag of 2016, Zendesk fell hard in January and early February, hitting a 21-month low of 14.39 low on Feb. 9.Zendesk, which specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software, went public in May 2014, priced at 9.Initiating coverage, Summit Research gave Zendesk a buy rating with a 25 price target.Zendesk is ""executing on its growth strategy in a largely untapped $7.6 billion market, moving successfully toward positive (free cash flow) and profitability, and maintaining revenue growth in the 30%-plus (rate) over the next several years,"" Kees said.""Most of Zendesk’s customers are SMBs (small to medium-size businesses), though the company has been moving upmarket, with customer deals with more than 100 seats now almost a third of monthly recurring revenues. Among other benefits, larger customers buy more, tend to purchase annual contracts and raise overall ARPU (average revenue per user). Founded in 2007, Zendesk is the oldest of the vendors targeting SMBs.""Big rivals such as Microsoft (MSFT),   Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) also target midsize businesses. Shares of all three were down a fraction Monday afternoon.""As ZEN moves upmarket, (it) faces deep-pocketed competitors like Salesforce.com and Oracle that can easily bundle customer engagement functionality with their total offerings,"" Kees warned.Zendesk is targeting positive free cash flow by 2017, profitability by 2020 and $1 billion in sales by 2020, he noted.For its Q1 ending Thursday, 12 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect a consensus 10-cent loss, flat with a year ago, on revenue up 56% to $66 million.Zendesk CFO Alan Black is expected to leave this year. Kees said, ""We are always a little cautious and little worried when a CFO leaves a company. However, we are cautiously optimistic Zendesk will take appropriate steps to identify a CFO who can take the company to the next level ($1 billion in revenue by 2020).""

346,ORCL,"There's a notion out there, says Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead, that Amazon’s (AMZN) flavor of the Linux open-source operating system is about as good as other Linux distributions -- and since it's free and Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers good support, converting is cheap.So does that stand to hurt Red Hat (RHT), which reports its fiscal fourth-quarter 2016 earnings after the stock market close Tuesday?""Bottom line, we conclude that the number of migrations from RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) to Amazon Linux remains quite modest and mostly confined to small enterprise customers,"" Keirstead wrote in a research note March 13. ""Larger RHEL-centric customers have only a small mix of workloads on AWS, they value OS consistency across their hybrid infrastructures, they prefer support from RHT and/or view the cost savings of a switch as being too modest to be worth the hassle.""These advantages appear to more than offset a view that AMZN Linux is at/near functional parity with other Linux distributions.""Keirstead reiterated Deutsche's buy rating for Red Hat with a 95 price target, which might take Red Hat a couple of months to achieve if it stays on the same upward trajectory that it's maintained since bottoming out Feb. 8 at a two-year low of 59.59.Red Hat stock was unchanged at 74.90 on Monday after rising 3.2% last week, closing just below its 200-day moving average. Shares are just 12% off a 16-year high set Dec. 30, 24% above its Feb. 8 low.But it looks like Red Hat is rebounding firmly from the Software Sag of '16 that battered many of Red Hat's rivals and tech players in January through early February.Red Hat stock gets an IBD Composite Rating of 84 out of a possible 99, factoring in earnings, sales, stock performance, institutional ownership and other metrics. Enterprise software developer Salesforce.com (CRM) carries an 81, Microsoft (MSFT) ranks 76, software giant Oracle (ORCL) earns a 61 and SAP (SAP) a 70.For its Q4 ended Feb. 29, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Red Hat earnings per share up 9% from a year earlier to 47 cents minus items, matching the company's guidance. Analysts expect revenue up 16% to $537 million, which also would match the midpoint of the company's guidance of between $535 million and $539 million, and rival the year-ago sales growth rate of 16%.At those levels, Q4 would be Red Hat's first quarter decelerated to single-digit growth since EPS flattened at 42 cents in fiscal 2015's Q3. It would be the 16th consecutive quarter of mid-to-high-teens sales growth.In a research note issued Thursday, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley warned that Red Hat's long-term revenue growth in Q4 could have fallen below expectations as seen in historical, sequential long-term growth weakness every three years, going back to Q4 2007. This is due to what he theorizes as three pools of larger deals that renew every three years in Q4, with the most recent cohort in Q4 being smaller than the others.""We believe this nuance (if correct) is truly just 'noise' and short-term billings should remain strong,"" Ashley said.He models Q4's total billings growth (long-term and short-term) at a 10% year-to-year improvement vs. the 12% consensus.""Where could we be wrong?"" Ashley asked. ""Signing a bunch of 'new' large three-year deals could augment the smaller renewal pool.""He tipped his hat to Baird's outperform rating on Red Hat with an 80 price target.

350,ORCL,"Money manager Vladimir “Val” de Vassal holds the same kind of leading stocks that you probably try to buy. But can you say your portfolio has outperformed 98% of your peers?De Vassal of Glenmede Investment Management aims to remove messy emotion from his buy and sell decisions. That adds to his performance in the long run, he says.Through May 31, he and his colleagues, including co-manager Paul Sullivan, have steered $2.3 billion Glenmede Large Cap Growth Fund (GTLLX) to average annual gains that topped all but 2% of their large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past three and five years.Since de Vassal took the reins in early 2004, the mutual fund has scored a 9.16% average annual gain, while the S&P 500 averaged 7.26%.The fund’s star performance over both the long and short term make it an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIn an interview with IBD from his Philadelphia office, De Vassal, 56, shared some of his investing secrets. Here’s what he had to say about the techniques that allow his investing team to beat the S&P time and again:IBD: You have a quantitative investment approach. What does that mean, and how do you mix in fundamental research with that?De Vassal: I look at our process as a quantitative discipline based on fundamental insights. I worked with fundamental managers for 20 years. They were value-oriented, growth-oriented, small-cap, large-cap, even international. Basically, one of my responsibilities was objectively assessing their criteria in selecting stocks in their particular sectors or universe, and assessing what worked and what didn't.And I've tried to remove the emotion and subjectivity out of the process.So we've built a library of the factors that worked and that didn't. They're different for different sectors. If you talk with a tech analyst versus a utility analyst, they talk about very different metrics as to why a company is effective or not.So we've built models that are unique for each sector. Some factors may be similar, but when we look at stocks, we look at them relative to their peers in the sector in terms of their attractiveness. This is a continual process every year.We add each year of data to our analysis. And we'll test new ideas.We have dialogue with our internal portfolio managers and analysts. We also have dialogue with some leading Street research firms like Empirical (Research Partners), Bernstein, JPMorgan (JPM) and Citi (C).IBD: What type of market does your approach work best in?De Vassal: Our process works when valuations and earnings matter. We look to create a portfolio that is cheap with high cash flow versus its benchmark, but has strong consistent profitability. And the stocks we own are likely to have positive earnings and revenue surprises, and fewer negative earnings and revenue surprises, than the benchmark.Where the strategy can struggle is when investors are distracted by macro issues. In the financial crisis in the Great Recession, earnings didn't matter. Investors fled equities, and they didn't care at what price.In that situation, when investors are not focused on specific company fundamentals but are driven by macro and behavioral issues, our models have less efficacy.IBD: What about more recently?De Vassal: Other periods when the strategy underperforms would be risk rallies, like 2009, and we've had a pretty strong risk rally starting in March this year, when a lot of the riskiest names are outperforming, in the last couple of months.But in this risk rally, there's been a lot of price dislocation when you look across stocks within sectors, a lot of gap between high- and low-priced stocks measured on, say, price-to-book.So this year's risk rally is a good environment for active equity managers because there seems to be a large arbitrage opportunity between cheap and expensive stocks that maybe can be taken advantage of. Those create opportunities for future price appreciation.IBD: So you like the current market?De Vassal: Our indicators still suggest we're in a positive growth environment for the U.S. economy. We had two weak quarters in Q4 and Q1. But our models suggest we should expect a rebound. Most economists expect 2% to 3% annualized growth in GDP for this quarter and the next couple of quarters.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWe favor more cyclical sectors right now, like technology and consumer discretionary. We're underweight in interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities and REITs.IBD: Let's talk about how you put your strategy to work. How does Edwards Lifesciences (EW) fit in? All of my questions are as of your latest disclosure.De Vassal: We owned it as of Jan. 31. It had good return on equity, over 20%. More sell-side analysts were raising than lowering estimates for the year and next year. The valuation was not cheap. But the fact that more analysts are raising estimates and that it has strong profitability and momentum -- historically, strong earnings growth offsets a rich valuation. And that's why we included this stock.IBD: What other holdings were you attracted to for similar reasons?De Vassal: Other names we bought in January were Oracle (ORCL), Masco (MAS), Schwab (SCHW). Again, they were attractive based on our criteria, a combination of earnings growth and analysts' estimates.One stock we sold in January was H&R Block (HRB). It was in the bottom quintile of its sector. Fortunately -- it's down 40% since we sold it.If there's something hitting one of our downside screens, we force it out of the portfolio. No questions asked.It takes time for fundamental analysts and portfolio managers to fall in love with a stock. But once they put it into a portfolio, it's hard for them to let go. We try to remove that emotion out of the process. In the long term, that adds to our performance.IBD: How does your approach differ from a fundamentals-only fund manager's?De Vassal: We look for stock that is cheap and has positive growth metrics and (whose coverage) analysts are raising estimates. We just look at what criteria work best in differentiating stocks in a sector. If it's a health care company, we don't look at what's in their pipeline, for example. Our stock ranking model for health care emphasizes high free cash flow yield, low relative price-to-book, strong reinvestment rate and positive earnings and revenue estimate revisions.IBD: Facebook (FB) has three quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. How do you look at this holding?De Vassal: It's attractive in our models. Its valuation is not cheap. But its fundamentals and growth story are positive. So is the fact that analysts are raising estimates.There have been periods when we sold Facebook because it was getting too rich. Last year, the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, which is now Alphabet (GOOGL)) were just flying. But their valuations got too rich, and we wouldn't hold on. But at this point, Facebook would still be considered a buy in our models.IBD: You opened a stake in Lowe's (LOW) just last year. What was your thesis?
"
351,ORCL,"De Vassal: We started our stake in June 2015. It ranked in the top third of our stock-ranking models. It had positive (revenue and earnings) estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. Valuation was not too extreme. The price-earnings ratio on this year's earnings was under 20.Our stock-ranking models are based on 12-month periods. We look to turn over about 1/12th of the portfolio each month to maintain attractiveness. Every month we look to refresh and harvest losses to offset short-term gains in particular.IBD: Cadence Design's (CDNS) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for two quarters. What's your quant view?De Vassal: It has had very positive earnings revisions. When we ran this in January, every analyst raised estimates for this company. Its P-E is not that expensive. It was 17.7 in January. It has done well and is now a little over 20.IBD: Thinly traded Mettler Toledo (MTD) is in an uptrend, but its EPS growth is slowing slightly. What's your view?De Vassal: It is still attractively ranked in our model. Estimate revisions are more neutral. But we showed positive for looking forward on analysts' estimates. It has very strong profitability, very high ROE. January ROE was over 40%. Some was contingent on book value. It's decelerating, but historically their growth has been over 10%. Looking forward, this still looks like double-digit growth, even if low double digits.IBD: You've been boosting your stake in Accenture (ACN). Why?De Vassal: It has a very attractive rank in the tech sector for us. Analysts at the margins are raising their estimates. It has high ROE and a good track record of dividend growth.IBD: What makes you different from other quant-oriented fund managers?De Vassal: The difference is in four principles.First, we believe in active management, and that stocks get mispriced. One issue with benchmark indices is that if a stock is overpriced, effectively it is overweighted. To address that, we ignore weights of individual stocks. We want to avoid the idiosyncratic risk of overexposure to a single name. If everything else is equal between a midcap and a mega-cap name, why wouldn't you invest in both instead of overweighting one just because it has a larger weight in the benchmark?Second, we treat each sector differently. I don't believe one model should be used for all stocks. Stocks in different sectors have different attributes and business models.Third, downside risk screens, including quality of earnings; avoiding companies with poor stock quality, debt and/or high idiosyncratic risk.Fourth, we differentiate stocks that are more likely to have positive versus negative surprises based on sell-side analyst behavior, company fundamentals and technical data.IBD: The idea behind your quantitative approach is that it homes in on the factors that identify stocks which outperform and it enables you to avoid being sidetracked by subjective factors that are, basically, irrelevant to outperformance, right?De Vassal: Yes, we build extensive back tests going back 20 years-plus, that identify which combinations of criteria would create a portfolio of stocks that outperform the average stock in the sector on a rolling 12-month basis, and which would be in the top 20%, the most attractive stocks.IBD: What about risk?De Vassal: We're looking for the most consistent excess return over rolling 12-month periods. So we're looking for the highest return per unit of shortfall risk. And shortfall risk would be any (stock) that didn't outperform the average stock by at least 200 basis points.We want to have upside, but we don't want to have much downside performance relative to the average stock.IBD: Some managers portray themselves as people who eat and sleep fund management, doing nothing else. But you've got at least one interesting hobby. Tell me about it, please.De Vassal: Well, one of my hobbies is genealogy. My last name is French. It's an old French name. We have a family tree going back more than 1,000 years. Apparently family members did a thousand-year reunion in 1987. We learned about it after the fact.We have a lot of documentation, interesting history. Our family went from France to the Ukraine in the early 1800s. We actually, this past Saturday, we saw relatives that we didn't know about. One, she was my third cousin. We got in touch through a Frenchman who was doing genealogical research on my family, and we ended up connecting for the first time.

352,ORCL,"If cash is king, then Microsoft (MSFT) gets the crown among companies in the S&P 500, ending last year with $102.6 billion in cash and short-term equivalent on its balance sheet.But Apple (AAPL) leads when including long-term cash equivalents, holding a whopping $215.7 billion at year's end, according to an analysis from FactSet Research. Long-term equivalents are investments that take more than one year to turn into cash.Following Microsoft in terms of cash and short-term equivalents is Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) at $73 billion. Next come General Electric (GE) at $70.5 billion, Cisco Systems (CSCO) at $60.4 billion, and Oracle (ORCL) at $52.3 billion.The information technology sector had the largest cash balance among the S&P 500's 10 sectors, with $580.2 billion at the end of Q4, FactSet said. That's been the norm over the past 10 years, it said. The tech sector's holding were up 15% over Q4 2014, making it the only industry sector to increase its cash and short-term investments year over year.Following Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle in the IT sector, in terms of cash and short-term equivalents, is Apple at $38 billion, then Intel (INTC) at $25.3 billion.Big companies with lots of cash are in a strong position to make acquisitions. And companies with large balances of long-term investments, such as Apple, also demonstrate a greater degree of financial stability and flexibility.Following Apple and General Electric as having the biggest money horde overall, when including long-term equivalents, are Microsoft at $114.1 billion, Alphabet at $79.6 billion, and Cisco at $65.2 billion.

353,ORCL,"The S&P 500's often-solid, always-hyped tech sector is set for its steepest quarterly earnings drop since the recession, with weakness in Apple (AAPL) and legacy tech giants overshadowing gains in newer leaders like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).The rest of the S&P 500's first quarter? Overall earnings for companies in the bellwether index were expected as of Tuesday to fall 7.1% from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters, which would mark the biggest drop since Q3 2009 and the third straight quarter of accelerating declines.Revenue is forecast to slip 1.1%, potentially the fifth consecutive slide but not as bad as prior declines.The forecast for a tech earnings drop of 5.5% would be the sharpest since the last quarter of the Great Recession in Q2 2009. It comes as Apple contends with weaker iPhone demand and concerns about waning interest in its new products.Apple's earnings are seen falling 14%. By comparison, Facebook's should jump 48%, and Alphabet's are expected to climb 21%.The iPhone's demand woes don't stop at Apple. Suppliers like Skyworks (SWKS) should suffer too, and analysts are forecasting the chip maker's earnings growth will slow to 8% from 27%. Broadcom's (AVGO) earnings growth is seen decelerating for the fourth straight quarter.Meanwhile, big players in hardware are trying to shift to mobile tech, the cloud, artificial intelligence and data analytics, with the transition weighing on results.Weakness in international economies -- China is slowing, Russia is hurting, Brazil is drowning in recession and a widespread bribery scandal -- have also hurt the tech sector. And the industry has been particularly sensitive to belt-tightening in the U.S.""The likes of IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco (CSCO) and Microsoft (MSFT) -- all of these guys suffer when corporate America does not spend on upgrading its infrastructure and its servers, its computers, and its applications,"" Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks, told IBD.But the earnings weakness in Q1 looks to be broad, as 7 of the 10 sectors tracked by Thomson Reuters are expected to show declines. The roughly 4-to-1 ratio of negative earnings preannouncements vs. positive ones is worse than in typical quarters.Energy remains under pressure, and the sector is expected to swing to its first loss since at least 2002. Excluding energy, earnings would improve to a 2% drop. Revenue excluding energy would creep up by 1.9%.“The economy here is not growing fast,” Thomson Reuters analyst Greg Harrison told IBD. “A lot of the companies in the S&P 500 are kind of dependent on international markets for growth, and that’s slowing down.”The dollar, which has generally been stronger against other currencies, has also weighed on results despite recent weakening.Earnings in the materials sector are on track to fall 19.9%. The reasons are the usual ones: Many companies overexpanded through debt to unearth more of the planet's resources, which China didn't need as its economy softened. Now mining companies like BHP Billiton (BHP) are picking up the pieces.First-quarter earnings for the finance sector are projected to fall 6.9%, with the Federal Reserve's more dovish stance toward rate hikes this year less likely to cushion banks' net interest margins.On the bright side, earnings for the consumer discretionary segment are seen climbing 13.3%. Those gains would be led by Amazon (AMZN), reflecting e-commerce's increasing popularity, and Ford (F), which along with other automakers has benefited from lower gas prices.Homebuilders are also set to do well, with cheaper land bought during the financial crisis helping margins now, Harrison said.But while American consumers are propping up much of the U.S. economy, China remains the issue for the index broadly.Mian noted that many companies had invested heavily in China in the last 10-15 years, often highlighting their spending as big selling points.

354,ORCL,"After the hell that many hotshot software stocks have put investors through this young year, Wall Street analysts got a break.""Listening to Oracle (ORCL) conference calls is always a hoot,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis in a research note Wednesday, following Oracle's late-Tuesday Q3 earnings that beat analyst estimates. ""In the 16 years we’ve followed this firm, we can’t remember a quarter when management wasn’t wildly bullish. This quarter was no different, with Trump-like phrases like 'slaughter,' 'better and better,' 'game over,' etc.""The good news for our now almost exactly 3-year-old buy rating is that Oracle’s execution has begun to catch up with its verbiage. Indeed, this was the first quarter in four in which Oracle did not scuffle somewhere -- bookings, revenues, earnings or whatever. Investors are still jumpy after the January panic, so this means they are flocking to moneymakers like Oracle.""Oracle stock was up 4% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 40, and touched an eight-month high. Rivals Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce.com (CRM) and SAP (SAP) were up about 1% Wednesday afternoon.Not that Davis was totally giddy: ""Should ORCL decisively penetrate the $40 price level, we will declare victory and seriously consider downgrading the stock from today’s buy to a possible hold.""What's all the fuss?They can visualize Oracle's cloud-revenue skyrocketing, while traditional database-software sales shrink.Oracle and its traditional enterprise-software customers have faced a tough conversion, but now Oracle is developing serious momentum with its own cloud and hybrid-cloud growth, shepherding the transition of its customers while absorbing the shrinkage of its still-dominant traditional enterprise sales.""With 310,000 on-premise database customers, the company sees an enormous potential TAM (total addressable market), as database customers continue to shift to the cloud,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne in a research note Wednesday. ""Management also noted that renewal rates were higher than in previous years.""Materne put annual recurring revenue from cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) sales up 77% in constant currency in Q3, with billings up 32%, ""and importantly, this strength is expected to translate into accelerating revenue growth going forward,"" he said.In Q3, Oracle said it added 942 new SaaS customers, more than half of which were Oracle Fusion ERP (enterprise resource planning) software subscribers. SaaS clients now total more than 11,000 with more than 2,000 on Fusion, Materne noted.Oracle sold customer experience (CX) SaaS to 465 new customers and 500 existing ones in Q3. Human capital management software was sold to 213 new customers. Oracle's ERP Cloud attracted 334 new clients, ""175 of which did not have an Oracle on-premise app before,"" said Materne, for an installed base exceeding 1,800 clients.Still, for all the excitement of watching Oracle's cloud revenue fly 40% to $735 million in Q3, that only amounted to 8% of Oracle's total $9.01 billion in sales for the quarter. Revenue fell 3% from the year-earlier quarter.Traditional software revenue slipped to $6.34 billion from $6.64 billion, as the legacy line slipped to 70% from 71% of total revenue. Likewise, legacy hardware sales slipped to $1.13 billion, or 13% of Q3's total sales, from $1.29 billion, or 14% a year before.""This is obviously a continuation of execution of their pivot toward the cloud pursuit,” Gartner analyst Charles “Chad” Eschinger told IBD via email. “Top line is better than I expected, even with the transition, especially with the increase in margins, where there have been many curmudgeons.""

Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq than Tuesday's levels.Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The central bank is widely expected to keep short-term borrowing costs on hold at between 0.25% and 0.5% amid tepid U.S. wage growth, subdued inflation and uncertainty in the global economy. But analysts will examine the statement for clues to future rate policy.On Wednesday, government data showed that consumer prices minus volatile gasoline costs rose for the fourth straight month, suggesting that inflation may be picking up.

Oracle is seeking $8.8 billion in damages.Oracle lawyer Peter Bicks said Google has raked in $42 billion in revenue from Android-based smartphones, according to a Bloomberg report.Google “took a short cut, and it was at Oracle’s expense,"" Bicks reportedly told the jury in San Francisco federal court.Oracle claims Google infringed on copyrights covering 37 Java application programming interfaces, or APIs -- the critical shortcuts that allow developers to write programs to work across software platforms.Even if Google loses, analysts have noted its strong balance sheet. Google reported $75.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in its Q1 earnings release.Android’s chief competition is Apple’s iOS software, used in iPhones and other Apple mobile devices. Unlike Apple (AAPL), Google has made Android open source and widely available to mobile phone makers, such as Samsung.Google says it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law.

359,ORCL,"Zendesk (ZEN) is expected to elaborate on plans to compete with bigger rivals Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) when the provider of customer-support software holds its investor day on Tuesday.Zendesk in November expanded a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), whose Office 365 is the most widely used cloud app by businesses. Providing support for Microsoft’s cloud platforms could help Zendesk vs. Salesforce.com and Oracle, analysts say. Oracle acquired RightNow in 2011 to boost its efforts in customer-support software.Zendesk, which aims to sell more to larger companies and enterprises, as well as to its longtime base of smaller and midsize businesses, also competes with Freshdesk and Desk.com.Research firm Gartner estimates that 80% of Zendesk’s customer base has 20 users or less. With $209 million in 2015 revenue, Zendesk has touted a $1 billion target by 2020.“We expect much investor interest around the trajectory of Zendesk's path toward their $1B revenue goal in 2020,” wrote Stan Zlotsky, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a research report out Monday. “With the unveiling of the new CFO, Elena Gomez, we think investors will be looking to better understand her thinking around the $1B target and any potential upside/downside risks.“Given the renewed market focus on profitability, in addition to growth, we believe an update on the company's plans for cash generation and reaching positive operating margins would be very helpful in framing investors' expectations.”Zendesk stock jumped last week after the enterprise software company reported a smaller-than-expected Q1 loss and raised its full-year 2016 revenue guidance, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base at a 23.87 buy point. Zendesk stock was up more than 1% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 23.75.Zendesk, with its shares up less than 3% in the past 12 months, has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 64 out of a possible 99.

Crude rose 3.3% for the week to $49.33.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, who has been among the more dovish policymakers publicly in recent months, said Friday that raising rates cautiously would be ""appropriate"" in the coming months as the economy continues to improve. Earlier in the week, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he sees two or three rate hikes this year, with three or four more next year. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard reiterated that the U.S. job market is tight and may start to push inflation higher -- cause for another rate hike. Fed Gov. Jerome Powell said the benchmark rate could go up soon, but weak productivity growth could curb further increases.While odds of a rate hike at the June policy meeting are about 33%, the chances for at least one quarter-point hike by the July meeting are above 60%.Economic data largely backed calls for a rate hike.

The lower court found the plaintiffs didn’t show sufficient harm, but the appeals court felt the opposite. Now the lower court will deliberate further on the matter and decide whether the plaintiffs are justified to sue at all.That same appeals court overturned a $1.27 billion suit against Bank of America that alleged the bank’s Countrywide Financial misled mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) on loan sales in the run-up to the financial crisis.

362,ORCL,"The Oracle (ORCL) vs. Google copyright battle over the Android mobile operating system is slated to resume with a second trial on Monday.Oracle is seeking $8.8 billion in damages. But even if Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google loses, it has deep pockets. Google reported $75.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in its Q1 earnings release.Oracle claims Google violated its copyright on parts of the Java programming language when it created the Android OS, now used in mobile phones worldwide. Android's chief competition is Apple's iOS software, used in iPhones and other Apple devices. Unlike Apple (AAPL), Google has made Android open source and widely available to mobile phone makers, such as Samsung.Google says it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law. Oracle acquired Java when it purchased Java developer Sun Microsystems in 2010.The case previously went to trial in 2012, but a jury deadlocked. In the new trial, U.S. District Judge William Alsup has set time limits and has ruled on what evidence will be introduced.Oracle is also seeking an injunction against Google's future use of Java in Android, which would give Oracle more leverage to negotiate an ongoing royalty, according to a Reuters report.

363,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) will pay $532 million to acquire Opower (OPWR,) a cloud-based software provider that says it's used by 100 utility companies for meter reading services for homes and businesses.Opower says its Big Data platform stores and analyzes more than 600 billion meter reads from 60 million utility end-customers, enabling utilities to meet regulatory requirements, decrease the cost to serve, and improve customer satisfaction.Opower became a publicly traded company two years ago and reported revenue of $148.7 million in 2015, up 16%. Oracle will pay $10.30 per share in cash for Opower, which will be integrated into the Utilities Global Business Unit of Oracle. According to an Opower news release, it is a leading provider of “mission-critical cloud services to utilities.""The price represents a 30% premium to Opower's Friday closing price of 7.90. Opower stock hasn't traded above 10.30 since early this year. Its shares were up 31% in early trading in the stock market today, near 10.30. Oracle stock was up a fraction, near 40.The acquisition follows the $663 million deal last week that Oracle reached to acquire Textura (TXTR), a leading provider of construction contracts and payment management cloud services. Oracle will pay $26 per share in cash to acquire Textura, paying a 31% premium on that company's stock.

364,ORCL,"This year's teeter-totter market has posed special challenges for all investors. The managers of $1.3 billion USAA Aggressive Growth (USAUX) are no exceptions.Over the past year going into Wednesday, the fund has outperformed 72% of its rival large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. by losing less than most of them. The fund has gained 4.99% in the volatile past three months, but that only tops 28% of its peers.The fund could be primed for strong performance when the stock market strengthens if the quality of its top holdings are an indication. Aggressive Growth's top 10 holdings as of March 31 included six stocks with IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. The highest Comp Rating is 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.In addition, holdings include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which sports a 92 Comp Rating.Trading around 95, Adobe is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 98.10 buy point. Volume has dried up as the handle forms, which is positive. But as IBD's Leaderboard analysis of the stock points out, Adobe's earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view the stock is extended. Still, you could make a case that the right side of the base needed more work.Adobe has succeeded in morphing into a company that lets customers receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Is Adobe a buy or a sell? Take a free trial of IBD Leaderboard today to find outRevenue growth has sped over the past three quarters, from 9% to 21%, 22% and 25%. The fiscal second quarter ends this month. Wall Street currently expects earnings to rise 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains of 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters. It's still vigorous profit growth.Facebook (FB), another Leaderboard stock, is one of those top holdings. It has a 99 Composite Rating.EPS gains are accelerating, rising 16%, 33% 46% and 83% the past four quarters. The 83% earnings jump to 77 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates as did the 52% jump in revenue to $5.4 billion. The stock responded to the upbeat results by gapping up 7% April 28 and clearing a 117.09 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It got as high as 121 before easing to just below the buy point.Facebook has gifted investors with a big 300%-plus return since it broke out past a 29.17 buy point of a double-bottom base in the week ended July 26, 2013, as IBD pointed out recently.Electronic Arts (EA) is a top new buy, which has a 95 Comp Rating.The video game publisher delivered better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week.Q4 EPS rose 28%. That profit got a boost from EA's growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue, as IBD reported on Tuesday.Also, EA had no debt last year and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% average annual EPS growth rate over the past five years, has attracted a rising number of funds as investors. Two typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts: $12 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and $12 billion MFS Growth (MFEGX).Among other holdings, Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) has a 99 Comp Rating and is up 16% so far this year.The maker of orthopedic and dental reconstruction implants, trauma products and related surgical products has seen EPS rise in each of the past four quarters, climbing from -2% to 30% in that span. Revenue grew 59%, 58% and 68% in the past three stanzas. The company beat consensus estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.The company was born from last year's $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet. That created a global leader in musculoskeletal health care, which does business in more than 100 countries, IBD recently reported.Last month, Zimmer said it would take over Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings.Trading near 117, the stock is within 1% of the 117.87 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.The portfolio is run by two separate subadvisors. Winslow Capital and Wellington Management each manage about 50% of the fund. When one side's outperformance skews the split by too much, USAA rebalances by funneling inflow into the lagging portion. It also takes any shareholder redemptions from the larger portion.Winslow's Clark Winslow, Patrick Burton and Justin Kelly are somewhat more aggressive in their style, says USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the subadvisors. Wellington's manager is Paul Marrkand. ""Wellington is more conscious of valuation,"" Latif said.The subadvisors' sleeves share many names. ""But Winslow has more FANG stocks,"" said USAA analyst Julius Barnes, referring to 2015 high-flyers Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL).As of Jan. 31, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Starbucks (SBUX) were in the Winslow sleeve only.Going into Thursday, UnitedHealth was up about 11% for the year. It had an 86 Comp Rating but a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks. Starbucks was down about 9% for the year. It has a so-so 70 Comp Rating and worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Oracle (ORCL) and PepsiCo (PEP) were two names in Wellington's sleeve only.Oracle was up 8%, but has a weak 55 Composite Rating and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. EPS fell the past four quarters and were flat in the two frames before that.Pepsi was up less than 1%, with a 59 Composite Rating and E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.""When we have a high-growth, bullish market, Winslow does better,"" Latif said. ""The opposite happens when the market is not led by growth and is challenged."" Wellington's sleeve has outperformed Winslow's so far this year, Latif says.

365,ORCL,"The major market averages finished higher Wednesday after the Fed left rates unchanged, as expected, and hinted at fewer interest-rate hikes this year than the Fed had indicated.The Nasdaq rose 0.7%, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4%. Volume was higher across the board vs. Tuesday, according to preliminary figures.Stocks started out in a narrow range amid mixed economic data. Consumer prices dipped 0.2% in February, but core consumer prices (minus food and energy) increased 0.3% for the second consecutive month. Core prices rose 2.3%, topping the Fed's 2% target, on a year-over-year basis. February housing starts rose to an annualized rate of 1.178 million, above forecasts for 1.146 million.Stocks rallied after the Fed statement but pared some of those gains just before the close.Oil and gas stocks led the upside, boosted by a jump in oil prices on a lower-than-expected increase in crude supplies. West Texas intermediate crude surged nearly 6% to $38.44 a barrel. Gold miners and hospitals also gained. Gold prices rose more than 2%.Biotechs, generic-drug makers and banks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) pared its loss to just 0.5% after sinking as much as 6% intraday. Shares found support above at their 50-day moving average. The embattled  fast-casual burrito chain said late Tuesday its same-store sales fell 26% in February, below expectations. It also guided for a Q1 loss of at least $1 a share.Oracle (ORCL) gapped up and rose 4% to a four-month high in fast trade. After the close Tuesday, the database software maker reported strong fiscal Q3 results.Sector Leader MaxLinear (MXL) led the IBD 50 with a 7% jump to a new  high in heavy volume. The chip designer's stock rose back above a 17.85 entry and is in buy range.

366,ORCL,"Enterprise software developers Workday (WDAY) and especially profitable Salesforce.com (CRM) have gotten this far without any love from software king Oracle (ORCL), so a little verbal swagger from Oracle's executives this week isn't going to stop them.But Oracle's 40% growth in cloud software revenue to $735 million in its third quarter, with a promise of more in Q4, can't bode well for the smaller rivals.Accelerating cloud sales, mostly for software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS), were Oracle co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd's favorite topics in a post-earnings conference call with analysts Tuesday.Oracle's cloud growth, while approaching Workday's recent 43% sales growth rate, has already puffed Oracle's cloud to more than double Workday's total revenue of $323 million in Workday's last quarter. More deceleration seems inevitable from Workday's triple-digit growth as recently as 2013.As for Salesforce.com, its year over year sales growth has slowed to the 23%-29% range for six straight quarters, following 13 out of the prior 14 quarters of 31% to 38% growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters put it on a 25% sales growth trajectory to $1.89 billion in the current quarter ending in April vs. 23% revenue growth in the year-ago quarter.Still, ""competition from leading SaaS vendors such as Salesforce.com, Workday and others creates the risk that new customers will be tougher (for Oracle) to find and existing on-premise customers could move to different vendors when they shift to the cloud,"" warned RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg in a research note issued Wednesday.""This was not a quarter to change the competitive concerns,"" he summarized.Not to worry, suggests Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison. In the Q3 earnings conference with analysts Tuesday, Ellison said: ""Oracle is now selling more new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud revenue than any other company in the world including Salesforce.com. We are growing much faster than Salesforce.com, more than twice as fast, because we sell into a lot more SaaS and PaaS markets than they do. We compete directly with Salesforce.com in every segment of the SaaS customer experience (CE) market including sales, service and marketing.""He went on to say: ""But Oracle also competes in huge SaaS markets where Salesforce.com does not compete at all, such as ERP (enterprise resource planning) and HCM (human capital management). It took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud including Fusion Financials, procurement, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing and much, much more. That long effort is now paying off.""In the conference call, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan, discussing the huge database software bulk of Oracle's business, addressed Ellison by noting that Amazon (AMZN) Web Services ""wants to go after your business.""""Microsoft (MSFT) just announced a SQL server running on Linux,"" Rangan continued, ""and everybody seems to be . . . swapping out your Oracle license for their license. Why are they doing this, Larry? Is it just because the industry views Oracle as this big giant that is less flexible with pricing? Is that right, that the industry feels like they need to take you guys on? How should we be thinking of Oracle’s presence in the database market a few years from now, given these threats?""Ellison replied:""Well, our PaaS business grew at 150% this past quarter. I mean, it’s interesting that Microsoft is now offering SQL Server on Linux. But people want Oracle in the cloud. People have a huge investment in Oracle products. I mean, people are coming after us because we are by far the market leader in database. So, of course, Amazon, (if) they’re going to be in the database business too, is coming after us, and of course (if) Microsoft wants to be bigger in the database business, they have to come after us. We’re the biggest player.""We see our customers -- literally millions of applications and millions of users of those applications built on top of the Oracle database -- wanting to move those applications into the cloud and we do that very well. Our PaaS service is even easier to use and better than Oracle is on-premises.""Or, as Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne put it in his Wednesday research note: “With 310,000 on-premises database customers, the company sees an enormous potential TAM (total addressable market), as database customers continue to shift to the cloud.""Workday stock at midday was trading up about 3% near 72 in afternoon trading in the stock market today, 23% off its 52-week high set May 26 at 93.62 and about halfway back from its dive in January and early February to 49.5% below that high mark. Salesforce stock was flat near 73, just 12% off an all-time high 82.90 set Nov. 19.Oracle was up about 1.7% in afternoon trading Friday near 41, just 9% off its 52-week high of 45.24 touched June 17.Oracle stock carries a relatively weak IBD Composite Rating at 56, partly because of its 6% earnings shrinkage and overall 3% revenue slip to $9.01 billion in Q3 -- as that fast growth in the cloud pulls sales and profitability away from its own legacy on-premises lines. That cloud revenue only amounted to 8% of Oracle's total Q3 sales, up from 6% a year earlier.Workday carries a 50 Composite Rating and Salesforce.com stock an 83.

367,ORCL,"Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter, as the information technology sector overall led the field.Companies in the S&P 500 spent $136.6 billion on share buybacks during the fourth quarter, up 5.2% year over year, says a report from FactSet Research. It was the sixth-highest quarterly amount since FactSet began tracking the data at the start of 2005.As the top spender, Apple repurchased $6 billion worth of shares in Q4. Apple was also the leader in Q3 stock buybacks, at a whopping $15.3 billion in repurchases.The information technology group led all industry sectors in the S&P 500, with $33.2 billion spent on buybacks in Q4. Four of the top 10 companies were in the information technology sector, as FactSet defines it: Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Visa (V).Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors led buyback spending in Q4. https://t.co/tTsQkCDffj pic.twitter.com/Zn2aeo46yL— FactSet (@FactSet) March 18, 2016Following Apple for second place was United Technologies (UTX) at $5.1 billion, then Microsoft at $3.6 billion and Oracle at $3.25 billion. In Q3, Microsoft spent $4 billion in buybacks, while Oracle spent $3 billion.Apple also led in quarterly dividends, with a cash distribution of $2.97 billion. Microsoft was close behind at $2.86 billion, followed by General Electric (GE) at $2.3 billion. General Electric came in sixth place in stock buybacks, at more than $3 billion.Share repurchase programs are a popular way of returning capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings, while dividends put cash in the hands of shareholders.In 2015, there were 70 activist campaigns in which a dissident objective was to return cash via dividends and/or buybacks, up 37% from 2014, Factset said in its report. This represented the highest total since FactSet began tracking the data in 2005. Of the 70 campaigns, activists were successful in 31, which was a record high.

368,ORCL,"Analysts expect Oracle (ORCL) to show a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings and sales declines in its Q3 fiscal 2016 report after the close Tuesday.The business software giant rose 2.4% to 38.95 Friday, hitting a 3-month high and rising back above its 200-day moving average. Oracle stock fell 0.6% to 38.70 in the stock market today, holding above the 200-day.Oracle stock remains 14% off a more than one-year high set June 17, and nearly even with its 38.91 close on Dec. 16, right before its fiscal Q2 earnings release showed shrinking earnings and sales. That report sent the stock sliding to a 25-month low of 33.13 on Jan. 20.""The stock is down 1.1% since (fiscal 2016's second-quarter) earnings, outperforming the S&P 500, down 4.0%, given the general rotation out of growth stocks into more value names like Oracle,"" wrote Nomura analyst Frederick Grieb in a research note Thursday. ""While metrics for cloud revenue growth have been solid, investors remain concerned by what the potential cost will be to the legacy business, as well as the potential impact to margins during the transition.""Meanwhile, Pacific Crest Securities says more business users expect to increase spending on software-as-a-service (SaaS) from Microsoft (MSFT) than any other vendor, followed by spending increases for Oracle, then rivals SAP (SAP),  Salesforce.com (CRM) and others.Microsoft stock closed up 2% to 53.07 Friday, then advanced 0.2% on Monday. SAP gained 2.3% to 78.65 on Friday, tacking on 0.1% on Monday. Salesforce rose 1.3% to 71.63 on Friday, then climbed 0.8% on Monday, finding resistance at the 200-day line.Analysts expect Oracle's legacy-software license sales to continue falling faster than increasing cloud-subscription sales will rise, at least in the short term. Those polled by Thomson Reuters now model total Q3 revenue down 2% from a year earlier to $9.13 billion, revised down from $9.28 billion, estimated when Q2 earnings were released. They see adjusted EPS of 62 cents, down 9% from a year earlier and down from the 65 cents they estimated three months ago for Q3.In a conference call with analysts after the Q2 release, CEO Safra Catz guided Q3 revenue to a $9.08 billion midpoint and earnings to a range of 60 to 63 cents per share minus items.Anticipating more acceleration of cloud revenue in the second half of the fiscal year for Oracle, Nomura's Grieb said: ""It will be important to make sure that the company is not losing share to the competition. Strong cloud growth rates supported the business until the steep license revenue declines in the last few quarters suggested that the company may not be successfully converting on-premise customers to the cloud.""Investors are concerned that Oracle is not only cannibalizing the on-premise license business, but also offering aggressive incentives to sign cloud customers.""Nomura maintains a buy rating with a 44 price target on Oracle.Aggressive discounting of subscription sales might be why Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle found feedback from Oracle customers better than expected.""Even though cloud is lagging with existing customers, it is doing better with new customers and cloud revenue recognition on existing deals is likely to drive upside to cloud expectations,"" Barnicle wrote in a research note Thursday. ""Among SaaS vendors, Oracle showed well in the recent Pacific Crest CFO survey.""He added that feedback about on-premises ""applications was surprisingly positive,"" particularly in the installed base.""We had little feedback on the database and infrastructure businesses. As a result, we see upside to the Cloud SaaS and PaaS  (platform-as-a-service) revenue expectation of $554 million and overall revenue expectation of $9.127 billion,"" Barnicle wrote. ""We are less confident on EPS upside. EPS consensus of 62 cents seems a bit high, so we expect in-line EPS.""Pacific Crest carries Oracle with a sector weight rating, akin to a hold rating.In his recent survey of CFOs, Barnicle said that 46% plan to increase SaaS spending in 2016 with Microsoft, followed by 26% with Oracle, 25% with SAP, 16% with Salesforce.com, and about 12% each with HubSpot (HUBS) and Paylocity (PCTY).Image provided by Shutterstock.

369,ORCL,"Negative trends in the enterprise market -- large companies and government agencies -- are lowering expectations ahead of Cisco Systems' (CSCO) fiscal Q3 earnings, due out Wednesday after the market close.Many large companies are outsourcing business computing workloads to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), lessening their need for the routers, switches and other networking gear sold by Cisco and others.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate Cisco earnings minus items will rise 2% to 55 cents, though they see revenue falling 1% to $11.97 billion.“We see three major issues into this earnings release, including weak IT data points, all signaling industrywide IT spending weakness, less visibility around service provider spending, and global macro exposure,” Kulbinder Garcha, a Credit Suisse analyst, said in a research report.“Year to date, we have seen weak IT spending indications from large bellwethers including IBM (IBM), EMC (EMC), Juniper (JNPR), Brocade (BRCD) and SAP (SAP),” added Garcha, who has an underperform rating on the stock.JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall, in a research report, cited negative enterprise market commentary from Intel (INTC), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Reports of slower tech spending was a factor in the stock market's plunge early in the year.With many tech companies struggling to meet expectations recently, an in-line quarter for Cisco might be good enough to move shares higher, said Citigroup analyst Jim Suva.RW Baird's Jayson Noland was another analyst citing slower spending of late. “Our partner survey results indicate a softer-than-expected April quarter, with improved prospects for growth for the remainder of calendar 2016,” Noland wrote in a research note.Cisco stock, up 1% near 27 in early trading in the stock market today, is about even in 2016. Cisco stock is up 20% since touching a two-year low in early February.

370,ORCL,"The European Commission may hit Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google with a $3.4 billion fine as early as June on grounds that the U.S. Internet giant favors its own shopping service in Internet searches.The European Union’s biggest antitrust fine to date was $1.45 billion, against chipmaker Intel (INTC) in 2009. The EU in 2013 also fined Microsoft (MSFT) $730 million for failing to respect an antitrust settlement with regulators.The most Google could be fined would be 10% of annual revenue under EU law, which would be roughly double the $3.4 billion fine. Google posted revenue near $75 billion in 2015 and reported $75.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in its Q1 earnings release.The Sunday Telegraph first reported the antitrust fine. Google has not commented.The EU's European Commission (EC) regulators in recent years have investigated other U.S. companies -- including Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) -- over antitrust and privacy issues.If the EU fines Google, it would put U.S. regulators in the spotlight. The Federal Trade Commission in 2013 ended an investigation into whether Google abused its dominance in the Internet search market without bringing charges.The EU has opened up a separate probe involving Google’s Android smartphone software.Meanwhile, a copyright infringement case involving Oracle (ORCL) and Google is heading into its second week.Oracle claims Google violated its copyright on parts of the Java programming language when it created the Android mobile operating system, now used in mobile phones worldwide. Oracle is seeking $8.8 billion in damages.“If the EC does issue the ruling, Google is required to comply with the nondiscrimination ruling even while pursuing a possible court appeal, which could take three to five years,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, in a research report. “This is not well understood by investors.""In addition, if Google refuses to comply -- or if its revisions are deemed inadequate -- it can be subject to an ongoing noncompliance fine  of up to 5% of its global annual revenues, pro-rated daily.”Alphabet stock was flat in early trading, near 724. Alphabet stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 777.41 buy point on April 14, but it is now near the 7% to 8% decline where selling shares is recommended.

371,ORCL,"Shares of enterprise software maker Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) jumped 6% in morning trade before settling back, following Tuesday's impressive first-quarter report, which beat Wall Street's top and bottom lines.Ultimate, which specializes in HCM SaaS -- human capital management software as a service -- reported first-quarter EPS up 40% to 73 cents minus items, eight cents beyond consensus, on sales up 29% to $187 million, where Wall Street expected $180 million. With 2016 gaining momentum, Ultimate also raised its full-year forecast to 26% sales growth from 25% ""and now claims 99% visibility into this goal,"" noted Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne.Materne raised his price target to 200 from 195 ""based on the continued acceleration in the business, especially in the midmarket,"" he said in a Wednesday research note, reiterating a hold rating.""All in all, we believe the company remains on track to hit its $1 billion revenue target in 2018; and with the company's current (2016) guidance implying (an approximately) 275 basis-point decline in recurring revenue growth in (the second half vs. the first half), we expect that estimates could potentially have room to move higher over the course of the year.""More bullishly, FBR analyst Samad Samana said in a Wednesday research note, Ultimate ultimately ""can deliver accelerating revenue growth and margin expansion in 2016."" Samana raised FBR's price target on Ultimate to 220 from 205 while maintaining an outperform rating.Climbing the right side of a 25-week cup base, Ultimate stock jumped 6% to 209.71 in morning trade before settling back to a 0.5% gain near 198 in the stock market today, 8% off a 216.27 record high set Nov. 9.Ultimate's enterprise rivals and peers were mixed Wednesday, with Salesforce.com (CRM) down 1.5% to 75.05, while SAP (SAP) was up 1.2% to 80.43, less than 1% from recent highs. Legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL) was down fractionally. Microsoft (MSFT) was off 1%.One stock in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, that of cloud advertising software developer Rubicon Project (RUBI), enjoys a slightly better IBD Composite Rating than Ultimate: Rubicon's best-possible 99 vs. Ultimate's 98. Salesforce carries a 93 CR and SAP 72. Outside the group, Oracle is rated 60 and Microsoft 43.Ultimate's 40% EPS growth rate was the best in eight quarters, but its 29% sales pace was the best in at least 19 periods.For the second quarter, Ultimate guided its adjusted operating margin to 20% and total sales to $187 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting earnings of 77 cents per share minus items on revenue of $185 million. A year ago in Q2, Ultimate earned an adjusted 62 cents per share on sales of $147 million.Needham analyst Scott Berg said he was ""impressed"" that Ultimate reported consecutive quarterly deferred revenue growth exceeding 30% in the first quarter and year-to-year deferred revenue up 34.5%, its best in at least six years. He reiterated a buy rating with a 220 price target.

376,ORCL,"The Big Daddy of business software, Oracle (ORCL) made it four consecutive quarters of shrinking year-over-year earnings, but the company posted a big increase in its cloud software and shares rose after hours despite a slight revenue miss.For its fiscal Q3 ended Feb. 29, the company late Tuesday said earnings per share minus items fell 5.9% from the year-earlier quarter to 64 cents. That nevertheless beat the 62-cent consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. And Oracle stock was up more than 4% in after-hours trading, after its earnings release.Revenue fell 3% to $9.01 billion, where analysts had modeled $9.13 billion.The company had guided Q3 revenue to a $9.08 billion midpoint and earnings to a range of 60 to 63 cents per share minus items.Cloud software revenue, however, jumped 40% to $735 million, and would have been up 44% in constant currency. Oracle does about 55% of its business outside the U.S., so it's hurt more than most by the strong U.S. dollar.Oracle said its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue jumped 57%. The third cloud software component, infrastructure-as-a-service, fell 2%.The legacy software developer is transitioning more of its business to the cloud, while still managing billions of dollars in traditional, on-premise enterprise-software license sales, making for an often rocky transition.""Our Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue growth rate accelerated to 61% in constant currency in Q3,"" said co-CEO Safra Catz in the earnings release. ""This dramatic revenue increase drove our non-GAAP SaaS and PaaS gross margins up to 51% in Q3 as compared with 43% in Q2. Our cloud business is now in a hyper-growth phase.""Oracle had closed up a fraction in Tuesday's regular session. Rival Microsoft (MSFT), which does many things other than developing software, also rose a fraction as did enterprise software rival SAP (SAP), while cloud rival Salesforce.com (CRM) fell a fraction Tuesday.""In absolute dollar terms, Oracle is already selling more enterprise SaaS and PaaS new cloud revenue than any other company in the world, including Salesforce.com,"" Executive Chairman Larry Ellison said in the earnings release and later reiterated in a conference call. ""We are growing much faster than Salesforce.com. We also have many more SaaS products than Salesforce.com. In some of our most important SaaS markets, such as ERP (enterprise resource planning), HCM (human capital management), supply chain and manufacturing, Salesforce.com does not participate at all.""By successfully competing in all of these markets, Oracle has the ability to sustain its high growth over a long period of time. That should make it easy for us to pass Salesforce.com and become the largest SaaS and PaaS cloud company in the world.""On the call, the competitive Ellison added that ""it took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud. Oracle Fusion ERP is the overall market leader in the cloud ERP market . . . more than 10 times more ERP customers than Workday (WDAY). And ERP has always been a much larger market than CRM (customer relationship management software). Salesforce is missing all of that ERP market opportunity.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fiscal Q4 EPS to fall 20.5% to 62 cents, minus items, on revenue down 14.8%, to $9.12 billion. That compares with year-ago performance of 78 cents per share ex items, down 15%, on revenue off 5%, to $10.7 billion.Offering ""non-GAAP, constant currency"" guidance for Q4, Catz said EPS might reach 82 to 85 cents, ""depending on the mix of revenue and tax rates."" She guided total revenue in constant currency to a range of down 2% to up 1%. Oracle posted non-GAAP EPS of 78 cents in the year-ago quarterAlso, the Oracle board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share, payable April 28, and authorized repurchase of an additional $10 billion of common stock. Oracle enjoys a $162.5 billion market cap, among the biggest in technology.Oracle said Q3’s non-GAAP operating income and margin improved from Q2 but slipped from a year earlier.

A year earlier, Q3 2015 non-GAAP operating income had fallen 4% to $4.2 billion, when the non-GAAP operating margin was running at 45%.

Microsoft (MSFT) offers Power BI business intelligence software for free to 1 gigabyte users and for $9.99 a month for 10-gigabyte users subscribing to Power BI Pro.Cisco Systems (CSCO) spent five years analyzing business intelligence products before settling on Qlik, consolidating its data from Oracle (ORCL), open-source Hadoop and Teradata (TDC) into QlikView and creating a dashboard that made it easy to see actionable intelligence, Qlik says.""Although Power BI appears to be gaining traction faster than we expected, we believe that Tableau and Qlik remain the clear leaders from a technology standpoint and continue to witness healthy deal activity,"" William Blair's Suri said in a research note Monday. ""While we intend to watch the competitive situation closely, we maintain our outperform ratings on Tableau and Qlik, based on our view that both can still deliver growth in a world where Power BI sees success, continue to be attractive acquisition candidates, and currently trade at a comfortable discount to intrinsic value.""Qlik stock was up 2% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 27.50, after shares last month touched a five-year low below 16.Tableau stock was down a fraction Monday afternoon, near 43.50 and more than 65% off the record high of 131.34 it touched last July.

379,ORCL,"Are long-lagging software stocks ready to rebound?With the major stock market indexes rallying about 2%, even Tableau Software (DATA) was up 4% by early afternoon Tuesday. But the real mover is enterprise software developer Workday (WDAY), back to work after an anxious Leap Year workday when it unveiled Q4 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street -- for the 13th time in 14 quarters -- but then sucked some oxygen out of the room by guiding the current Q1 sales below analyst estimates. The stock edged down in after-hours trade Monday.No matter. Workday stock gapped up 9.1% after the morning bell, then slipped slightly, then rebounded to sit 9.8% higher at 66.40 in midafternoon trading in the stock market today, heading for a fifth straight up day, its ninth in the last 11. Workday stock is still 29% off a three-month high made last May.The entire IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group was up 2.3% by midafternoon, also on a five-day win run, boosted by Salesforce.com's (CRM) big 11% jump after issuing solid earnings and outlook after the close Feb 24. Salesforce was up 2.3% in afternoon trade Tuesday, while legacy software king Oracle (ORCL) was up 2.9% to 37.85.Salesforce is the highest-ranked of the bunch, with an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of a possible 99, tracking metrics such as earnings growth, stock market performance and other measures. But the Computer Software-Enterprise industry group as a whole ranks just 90th in performance out of 197 tracked by IBD. The Computer Software-Database group, where low-rated Tableau resides, ranks near the bottom, at 184, though both groups have been on an upswing since the second week of February, clambering back from steep losses the prior week. Oracle, Tableau and Workday still hold relatively low IBD Composite Ratings in the 40s.A little momentum at Workday? Analysts differ. They're impressed, but also cautious.Citing Workday's ""strong billings"" -- up 44% -- with financial management software customers ""roughly doubling"" year over year to 207 clients, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi lowered his price target to 75 from 80 and retained his sector perform rating on Workday, not so much on any weakness at Workday but ""due to recent market multiple contraction.""And while revenue guidance for Q1 came in below analyst expectations, ""billings guidance was above,"" Seyrafi wrote in a research note issued Tuesday.""We are also impressed by WDAY’s strong degree of visibility,"" he said. Unearned revenue of $900 million grew by 42%, but noncancelable backlog -- not on the balance sheet -- grew by 62% to $1.56 billion, he noted.""This results in the combination of unearned revenue and backlog at $2.5 billion, up 54%. Since this represents 82% of our estimated next-eight-quarter subscription revenue, up from 72% at the end of fiscal 2015, WDAY’s visibility has increased.""Similarly, analyst David Hynes lowered Canaccord Genuity's price target to 75 from 95 but reiterated a buy rating for Workday.""Lots of things happening at Workday,"" he wrote in a research note, citing ""record new customer adds, Fortune 500 go-lives, triple-digit pipeline growth, improving competitive win rates, increasing attach rates, new SKUs set to hit the market in (the current) fiscal 2017, and the list goes on.""Those new SKUs -- stock keeping units, or individual products -- in planning, learning management and student software are expected to add ""more than"" a $5 billion total addressable market for Workday to work over, co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri told analysts in a post-earnings conference call late Monday. That's on top of Workday's core financial management and human capital management (HCM) software product markets.Then again, Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim warned that billings growth decelerated to 42% in fiscal 2016 from 69% in 2015. ""Its fiscal 2017 billings guidance calls for modest 31% growth,"" Kim wrote in a research note issued Tuesday.""While overall FY17 revenue and billings guidance was mostly positive, we believe its outlook for flat margins could disappoint some investors,"" Kim said.Brean Capital rates Workday a hold with a 60.45 price target.""Overall, given lack of transparency into its new business bookings, we believe there will likely be a high degree of uncertainty that exists among investors regarding its true sales momentum,"" Kim wrote.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne lowered his price target to 75 from 95 but maintained a buy rating.""Overall, we believe the longer-term trends in the business remain positive, and WDAY remains one of the best multiyear growth stories in software,"" he said in a Tuesday research note. ""But given that the market remains wary of high valuation SaaS  (Software as a Service) names, investors will need to take a long-term view.""For the current Q1 2017, Workday guided revenue below analysts' views to a range of $337 million to $339 million but didn't forecast earnings. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect on average a Q1 per-share loss minus items of 2 cents, flat with a year ago, on $343.3 million in revenue vs. Q1 2016's $251 million.

380,ORCL,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock rocketed 15% in morning trading on the stock market today. Late Thursday HPE edged above earnings-per-share expectations for its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, met on revenue and roughly met views with its Q2 earnings guidance, while also promising to return more capital to shareholders.For Q1, the company posted EPS ex items of 41 cents, down 6.8% from pro forma earnings of 44 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 3% to $12.7 billion. For Q2, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents. It didn't give revenue guidance.""All in all, the headline news looks like a solid report from a top/bottom-line perspective,"" Daniel Morgan, a vice president of HPE shareholder Synovus Trust, told IBD via email.On Wednesday, the company filed with the SEC to change its pro forma figures for the year-earlier quarter, which it issued after its Nov. 1 split from the legacy Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co.HPE contains the business software and services, servers, storage and cloud-migration operations of the old company, with the new HP Inc. (HPQ) taking the PC and printer business. HPE now has more freedom to battle broad-based business-technology providers such as IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).HPE changed its year-earlier figure for EPS minus items to 44 cents, from 48 cents. It didn't change its pro forma revenue figure.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected adjusted EPS of 40 cents for fiscal Q1, though it's unclear if that consensus estimate would have changed with the new pro forma figure. Analysts expected revenue of $12.68 billion.For Q2, analysts had modeled EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.3 billion.The company's fiscal 2016 EPS ex items guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 met the views of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. And HPE maintained its fiscal 2016 guidance on free cash flow -- cash from operations minus capital expenditures -- of $2 billion to $2.2 billion.HPE shares fell 2.2% to 13.60 Thursday. The stock, which debuted in early November, peaked Dec. 1 at 15.88.Looking for ways to speed growth and improve shareholder value, the Hewlett-Packard split came in the face of faster-growing competition from upstarts leading the way to cloud computing.Last week, HP Inc. said its Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.""During our first quarter as an independent company, we saw the progress that comes from being more focused and nimble,"" HPE CEO Meg Whitman said in the company's earnings release. Whitman also serves as chair of HP Inc. and had been CEO and chairwoman of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. before engineering the split-up.“We delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant-current revenue growth, and excluding the impact of recent M&A activity, we saw revenue growth in constant currency across every business segment for the first time since 2010,” she said.Revenue rose 4% year over year in constant currency, the company said.HPE CFO Tim Stonesifer said in the earnings release that the company will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1.The networking business was the clear winner last quarter, and in fact the only business that notched revenue growth. The company said its Enterprise Group overall rose 1% to $7.1 billion in revenue, with a 13.4% operating margin. Networking sales jumped 54% from the year-earlier quarter -- more than 60% in constant currency -- but storage revenue fell 3%, and tech services tumbled 9%.Also slipping were server sales, albeit by just 1%. Before the release, shareholder Morgan, of Synovus Trust, told IBD he was “looking for stabilization in areas of weakness (by) expecting strength in servers into next year, as cloud and Big Data growth spur purchases. Servers represents 48% of the Enterprise (Group) segment's revenue and was (up) 5% year-to-year last quarter.”HPE's separate Enterprise Services segment sales fell 6% to $4.7 billion, the company said. Infrastructure tech outsourcing sales fell 8%, while application and business services revenue slipped 3%.Software services fell 10% to $780 million. License revenue fell 6%, support fell 13%, professional services revenue contracted 7%, and software as a service (Saas) sales fell 9%.Financial services, which help customers pay for their purchases, fell 3% to $776 million.In its filing with the SEC on Wednesday, the company said the main differences with its new pro forma EPS number for the year-earlier quarter ""are related to cash acquired and debt incurred by HPE just prior to the distribution (of new shares to old shareholders). The primary differences between the previously provided figures and adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow are related to prepaids, deposits and liabilities associated with property, plant and equipment, pension obligations and income tax asset and liabilities that transferred to HPE from its former parent just prior to the distribution.""

381,ORCL,"All in a Leap Year workday's work, Workday (WDAY) late Monday issued its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street views, though its Q1 revenue outlook missed forecasts. Shares were up in early trading Tuesday.The company's CEO said that Workday will expand its total addressable market in fiscal 2017 by pushing products in its planning, learning management and students areas, beyond its core financial management and human capital management applications.And the Q4 that ended Jan. 31 marked the 13th time in 14 quarters that Workday beat consensus on earnings and revenue since going public in October 2012, priced at 28.But CFO Mark Peek forecast Q1 revenue of $337 million to $339 million, up 35% at the midpoint but below the $343.3 million modeled by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Workday stock was up 8% in early trading in the stock market today, near 65. Workday stock hit a 39-month low at 47.32 on Feb. 9. The stock climbed over the past two weeks but is still down 18%  this year.Investors in software stocks, battered in recent months, had hoped Workday might encourage upward movement in the sector like Salesforce.com (CRM) did last week when its stock jumped 11% after its fiscal Q4 earnings and its outlook beat expectations. The enterprise software sector dived Feb. 5 after Big Data developer Tableau Software (DATA) issue a disappointing Q4 and gave soft guidance. Tableau crashed 49.5% that day to 41.33 and has recovered just 10% since its plunge.""We ended FY16 on a high note, with a very strong fourth quarter across product lines and around the world,"" Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri said in the earnings release. ""Demand for our financial management and HCM (human capital management) products continues to rise, as do our competitive win rates. The year ahead brings us an expanded addressable market with the delivery of Planning, Learning Management and Student applications that allow customers to drive employee engagement and productivity in new and transformative ways.""Big legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL) unwittingly might be helping Workday by somewhat reducing its automatic promotional Software as a Service to customers,  D.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews wrote in a research note before Workday's earnings release.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy asked about that topic during Workday's earnings conference call late Monday, prompting Bhusri’s competitive bluntness: Oracle has “had time to get customers into production and hasn’t been able to, (while) 75% of our customers are in production. That’s actually the real driver behind win rates.”Among big recent wins, Bhusri cited transportation firm J.B. Hunt (JBHT) for going live with Workday’s financial management suite, now its largest financial management customer, and Bank of America (BAC) for going live with Workday’s HCM suite, “our largest HCM customer in production.”Bhusri said customer satisfaction levels are at 98%.The company posted a per-share loss minus items of a penny in Q4, better than its six-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter, on revenue of $323.4 million, up 43%.Workday had guided Q4 to revenue of $317 million to $320 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $320.3 million when Q3 results were reported in November, but then revised it down to $319.6 million. Analysts had expected an adjusted loss per share of 5 cents.Though Q1 revenue guidance missed, Workday CFO Peek also had more positive news.“Looking ahead to our fiscal 2017, we are increasing our billings guidance for the first quarter from $350 million to $360 million to $365 million,” he said. “Billings for fiscal 2017 are expected to be between $1.855 billion and $1.875 billion. For the first quarter, we expect subscription revenue of $277 million to $278 million and total revenue of $337 million to $339 million.”Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a Q1 per-share loss minus items of two cents, on $343.3 million in revenue. For the fiscal year, analysts have modeled adjusted earnings of four cents per share on revenue of $1.546 billion. Workday reported fiscal 2016 revenue of $1.16 billion, up 48%, so its guidance would represent a 33% increase.

396,ORCL,"Just as the stock market goes through a correction, earnings for the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to record their first year-over-year decline in the past 10 quarters.A slowing China, weak global economy, strong dollar, poor PC sales and the shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector, and the top tech companies' Q4 EPS are seen falling for the first time since Q2 2013.""Tech remains stuck in a low-growth environment, and the interaction of rising interest rates, a strong dollar, weak oil and commodities are increasing risk,"" said Bill Whyman, head of technology strategy research at Evercore ISI.Tech spending growth generally is slow, says Whyman, but he adds that underneath the surface, there is an aggressive shift in spending that favors companies connected to cloud computing, including providers of software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and young, disruptive Internet companies.Apple, Facebook, Amazon Earnings On TapThus far, 13 of the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings, including Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM), which both provided tepid guidance that sent their shares falling.The tech earnings season gets into full swing starting Tuesday, with the biggest company of them all — Apple (AAPL) — set to report that day after the market close amid fast falling expectations for sales of its top product, the iPhone. On Wednesday comes Facebook (FB) and Qualcomm (QCOM), both after the close. On Thursday it's Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), also after the close. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) reports on Monday, Feb. 1, after the close.The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings per share minus items to fall 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter, the fourth quarter in a row of deceleration. Subtracting Apple, which has the largest impact of any company in S&P 500, tech earnings would fall 6.7%, according to estimates collected by Thomson Reuters.For the S&P 500 as a whole, analysts call for EPS ex items, such as stock options and one-time expenses, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see its EPS tumble 73%. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to rise 1.6% overall.Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings that usually put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. Not now. In terms of earnings performance, tech is in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500.""The tech sector is now more of a mirror of the S&P index as whole,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The tech industry has been stuck in slow-growth mode at the same time it's going through a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing — which has shattered old ways of using technology, says Evercore ISI's Whyman. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by turning to Internet-based cloud computing services provided by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Cloud Computing Drives TechnologyCloud computing is the dominant force in technology and will continue to accelerate, says Whyman. Among other things, cloud computing has spurred the emergence of SaaS, provided on demand as needed. SaaS leaders include Salesforce.com (CRM).Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and mainland China, opting for stripped-down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products. That is rattling some of the largest information technology companies, such as IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), all of which are undergoing major transitions.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs and now-slowing growth for smartphones and tablets.Global PC shipments fell 8.3% in the fourth quarter vs. Q4 2014, to just under 76 million units, according to preliminary results by market tracker Gartner. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment declines. For the year, PC shipments fell 8% to 288.7 million units. Gartner expects PC shipments to fall this year as well, but only by 1%, and it anticipates a soft recovery later in 2016.Global semiconductor sales fell 2% in 2015 to $334 billion, Gartner says, attributed not just to PCs, but also in part to weakened demand for electronic equipment amid the cloud shift and the continuing impact of the strong dollar.Strong Dollar Hurts Tech ResultsThe strong dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, is more difficult for tech companies than other sectors.""A big variable remains the U.S. dollar, as it has a huge impact on tech,"" said Whyman. ""Tech derives more revenue from outside the U.S. than any other S&P sector.""Apple, despite the popularity of its products and huge size, is not immune to the fallout. When Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, its performance in China will be closely watched. China accounted for an estimated 25% of all iPhone sales in 2015. Slower economic growth in China and slower sales of smartphones globally are expected to pressure its earnings growth. The consensus on Apple is EPS growth of 6% year over year, which would be its slowest growth in eight quarters.As always, analysts will focus on corporate guidance, and the outlook might be especially important in this earnings cycle amid a rough start to 2016 for global stock markets.""The range of uncertainty is widening, so there is a greater interest in clues as to what 2016 might hold,"" Whyman said.Among the 12 subsectors in the S&P 500 tech group, application software leads with an expected average EPS increase of 44%. The group includes Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com.The Internet software and services group is expected to have the second-best performance among the tech subsectors. This includes Facebook and Alphabet, which continue to ride the rising tide of mobile and online ad growth. Facebook is expected to show EPS growth of 26%, while Alphabet is expected to post growth of 18%.Friday, some of the biggest tech companies reporting earnings in the coming week rose ahead of the major stock market indexes.Apple stock lifted 5.3% to 101.42, Facebook gained 4% to 97.94, Amazon rose 3.7% to 596.38 and Microsoft logged a 3.6% boost to 52.29.

That 0.5% loss was recovered from the index's 8.8% dive to a Feb. 11 low and a significant step up from January's 7.9% slide. The last monthly gain for both indexes came in November.Friday's payroll report for February is the big economic news scheduled for the week. It will be the last monthly payroll report before the Fed's policy meeting in March, and with investor concerns about a revived recession dogging the stock market, it will be closely considered.After a barrage of speeches last week, Federal Reserve officials show a relatively quiet calendar, with only John Williams of the San Francisco Fed scheduled to speak Wednesday morning.This morning, Kingsbury International reports its Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index at 9:45 a.m. ET.

But the Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite was at breakeven, as was the Nasdaq 100.The Philly SOX index, a benchmark for semiconductor stocks, fell 0.4%. But that didn't stop Taiwan's Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) from spurting ahead more than 3% to 35.08, breaching the 35 level for the first time since July last year. The stock continues to act well after breaking out last week from a cup base within a larger base. The buy point is 34.08. Buying the stock more than 5% past that entry, or 35.78, would be considered chasing an extended stock.Silicon Motion excels in chip designs for data storage in smartphones and solid-state hard drives. Last year, it acquired Shannon Systems to become a supplier of chips to meet the enterprise-level storage needs of Internet and e-commerce firms in China. That buy helped the firm achieve a 25% increase in 2015 revenue to $361 million. Earnings grew 24% that year, and Wall Street expects EPS growth of 15% and 17% in 2016 and 2017.Silicon Motion sport a 98 Composite Rating and a 91 Relative Price Strength Rating, meaning its 12-month price performance beats 91% of all companies in IBD's database.

But Patrick garners a 99 Composite grade. It has formed a somewhat warped five-month-old cup base with a handle giving a 45.41 buy point. Strong gains in the right side of the base help give Patrick a positive Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-.Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) rallied more than 1%. It's cleared a 52.70 cup-with-handle entry in light volume, illustrating the generally cautious attitude of equity trading desks ahead of the Fed announcement. Fortune Brands specializes in kitchen and bath products for the homebuilding and home-improvement markets. It has grown earnings per share each year since 2012 and holds a 96 EPS Rating. Wall Street sees earnings rising 20% to $2.48 a share this year.

399,ORCL,"Well, it's no Salesforce.com (CRM) in size, but investors are turning their attention to hot little rival Workday (WDAY), which reports earnings after the close Monday.The maker of cloud-based HR and financial software likely will show continued fast growth -- while likely staying in the red as it spends to grow.For its fiscal Q4 2016 ended Jan. 31 , Workday guided to revenue of $317 million to $320 million, up 40% to 41% from the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $320.3 million when Workday issued its Q3 results three months ago, but since then the consensus has slipped to $319.6 million. Workday didn't forecast earnings, but analysts expect an adjusted loss per share of 4 cents vs. a 6-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Like many stocks, Workday has been scraping bottom lately, hitting a 39-month low on Feb. 9 at 47.32. Workday stock fell 16% on Feb. 5, but it wasn't alone. That was the day Tableau Software (DATA) tanked 49.5% after releasing slower growth guidance for 2016, sending most software stocks down with it. Since then, Workday stock has enjoyed two good weeks, up 1% in early trading in the stock market today, near 60 but still down 25% for the year.Workday stock rose 3.2% Thursday, with enterprise software stocks helped by Salesforce.com's late-Wednesday earnings beat and better-than-expected guidance. Salesforce.com stock rose 11% Thursday but was down a fraction early Friday.Noting that Workday ""has beaten consensus revenue and EPS estimates in 12 of the 13 quarters it has been public,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews is bullish. ""We expect (Q4)  revenue to grow 41.9% ...  to $321.2 million, above consensus ...  and above the high end of the (Workday-provided) guidance range. By segment, we are projecting 44.6% growth in subscription services to $263 million (81.9% of total revenue) and 31.0% growth in professional services to $58.2 million,"" he said in a research report.He expects a 3-cent per-share loss minus items, a penny better than consensus.""One interesting note is that we believe Oracle (ORCL) has pulled back a bit on its promotional program on SaaS (Software as a Service) and aims to offer future promotions to customers tactically, rather than automatically,"" Andrews wrote. Davidson maintains a buy rating on Oracle stock.  It also has a buy rating on Workday stock, with a 99 price target.Oracle stock rose 1.8% Thursday, but was flat early Friday.Investment banker R.W. Baird on Thursday lowered its price target on Workday to 70 from 85, but it rates the stock outperform. ""Workday's share price has also been significantly reduced along with other high-valuation software stocks during the recent correction,"" wrote Baird analyst Steven Ashley.In Workday's Q3 earnings conference call with analysts, CFO Mark Peek said an adjusted operating profit likely wouldn't happen until Q2 this year.

400,ORCL,"Salesforce.com (CRM) matched analyst forecasts on earnings and beat them on revenue with a record fourth quarter, but shares soared in late trade after the enterprise cloud pioneer raised its forecast for sales growth.Announcing earnings after the market close Wednesday, Salesforce said adjusted fourth-quarter earnings rose 36% to 19 cents per share on revenue that rose 25% to $1.81 billion. Earnings were right on the money, according to estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, but sales were better than the $1.79 billion revenue they had anticipated.The No. 1 developer of customer relationship management software, Salesforce raised full fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to a range of $8.08 billion to $8.12 billion, up from $8.0 billion to $8.1 guided after its third-quarter release.For its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which ends in April, Salesforce said it expects earnings per share of 23-24 cents, up 47% at the midpoint and ahead of analysts’ 21-cent consensus view. That's on revenue up 25% to $1.89 billion, where analysts expected $1.86 billion, up 23%.Its results seemed to strengthen hope that Salesforce might trigger an upturn in software stocks, reversing Tableau Software's (DATA) profitable but softer fourth quarter and weak guidance that triggered a 49.5% collapse in Tableau stock Feb. 5.Tableau's misfortune also precipitated a 15% plunge in the entire IBD Computer Software-Database industry group, where legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL) also resides. Salesforce stock also fell 13% at the time, and the IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group where it lives fell 8%.Neither group has recovered, the most notable exception being steady Oracle, up slightly Wednesday to 36.63, 19% off a six-month high set June 17.Days after the Tableau debacle, Salesforce set a 16-month low at 52.60 on Feb. 8, before rising 19.5% through Tuesday’s close at 63.98.  Salesforce ended the regular session down 0.6% to 62.50  in the stock market today. That was 24% off the stock’s all-time high of 82.90, hit Nov. 19, when Salesforce reported fiscal-third-quarter earnings up 50%.After Wednesday's earnings release, Salesforce jumped more than 8% to 67.95 in after-hours trading.""By any measure, this was a spectacular finish to the year with 27% revenue growth in constant currency for the fourth quarter and for the full year,"" Chief Executive Marc Benioff said in the earnings release. ""We are raising our fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion at the high end of our range -- unprecedented growth for a company of our size and scale.""Chief Financial Officer Mark Hawkins said its adjusted operating margin rose by 177 basis points, driving full-year operating cash flow up 37% to $1.6 billion during the fourth quarter.Said President and Chief Operating Officer Keith Block: ""We hit an all-time high in large transactions in fiscal 2016,"" adding that Salesforce's cloud platform is growing sales ""across every region, every cloud and every industry.""For full fiscal 2016, revenue rose 24% to $6.67 billion where analysts expected $6.65 billion. Salesforce said subscription and support revenue grew 24% to $6.21 billion and professional services and other revenue rose 28% to $462 million. The full-year adjusted earnings matched Wall Street at 75 cents.Salesforce managed to take a fourth-quarter unadjusted loss of 4 cents, better than the 6-cent loss expected by Wall Street.Beyond predicting Salesforce’s first $8 billion year in fiscal 2017, Benioff repeatedly assures that the company is ""well on the path to reach $10 billion faster than any other enterprise software company.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a recent note to clients that the firm’s Salesforce1 platform for mobile-application development is driving fresh growth, although ""there are many avenues to sustain growth, including service and marketing, the platform, and international and future initiatives.""MacMillan went on to say: ""We think Salesforce can continue to drive premium growth for its size, and it remains an important strategic asset.""RBC maintains an outperform rating on Salesforce.com stock, with a price target of 80, as ""one of the best positioned companies in large-cap software.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Jones downgraded Cerner from buy to neutral and lowered its price target from 62 to 54, with a 3% upside potential.Cerner's Q4 earnings beat, but its Q1 adjusted EPS guidance of 52 to 54 cents, on sales of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion, slightly lagged at the midpoint the 54 cents and $1.178 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The midpoint of guidance would mark a 22% year-over-year gain in EPS and a 27% gain in sales.Cerner also said Q1 new-business bookings would be flat with Q1 2015, at $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion.

430,ORCL,"UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note last week, ""We view 2016 as another transition year as IBM ramps investments, with 2017 a possible payoff as strategic imperative exceeds core franchise revenue.""IBM reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Tuesday, and its CEO said it's making ""significant progress"" in a major company transition, but 2016 EPS guidance fell short of analyst expectations.IBM (IBM) reported revenue of $22.06 billion, down 8.5% from the year-earlier quarter but slightly edging the Wall Street consensus estimate of $22 billion. Adjusting for currency exchange rates, IBM said revenue fell 2%.The company has been hit by currency-exchange woes, as IBM derives a majority of its revenue from offshore markets.It reported earnings per share ex items of $4.84, topping views by 3 cents but down 17% — its third quarter in a row of EPS declines.It was the 15th quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue declines.For 2016, the company expects EPS ex items of $13.50, well short of the $14.97 analysts had modeled. IBM didn't give other guidance.IBM stock was down 3% in after-hours trading following the company's Q4 earnings. In the regular session, IBM stock fell 1.5% to 128.11 and touched its lowest price since September 2010.IBM stock has been in retreat since hitting its all-time high of 215.90 in March 2013.Big Blue has long been in transition, shedding hardware units and realigning its workforce to reduce costs as it focuses on cloud computing, Big Data analytics, security and mobile computing — growth areas it calls strategic imperatives.IBM said revenue from strategic imperatives rose 17% in 2015 to $29 billion, compared with a 12% decline in overall revenue from continuing operations, to $81.7 billion. Strategic imperatives now comprise 35% of total revenue.In its investor conference last February, IBM had said that it expected its strategic imperatives revenue to rise about 20% in 2015.Tuesday, the company said Q4 revenue from strategic imperatives rose 10%, or 16% adjusting for currency.Transforming To 'Higher Value'""We continue to make significant progress in our transformation to higher value,"" IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said in the company's earnings release.

431,ORCL,"More than most, Salesforce.com's fourth-quarter earnings -- scheduled for release after the market close Wednesday -- could help bring an end to what one analyst calls ""the beatdown that growth software stocks endured for about 45 days.""""We believe that last week probably marked a bottom, or close to a bottom"" for software companies that ""are down about 25% for the average stock,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis in a research note Sunday. ""Deals are getting a bit more scrutiny than before, but we believe we are nowhere near anything that looks like an IT spending clampdown. We are broadly optimistic on the outlook for next-generation software companies.""Salesforce (CRM) stock hit a 16-month low at 52.60 on Feb. 8, then rose 22% through Monday's close at 63.98. Salesforce stock was down a fraction, near 63.50, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. That's 23% off the stock's all-time high of 82.90, hit Nov. 19, after Salesforce reported fiscal-third-quarter earnings up 50%.Salesforce is a cloud software pioneer and the No. 1 maker of customer relationship management software. Salesforce is coming off many years of double-digit revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters of double- or triple-digit earnings-per-share gains, year over year. Its market cap at $42 billion makes it half the size of SAP (SAP), the largest in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, and much smaller than business software giant Oracle (ORCL), with its $154.7 billion market cap. But Salesforce is much larger than next-generation cloud software companies Workday (WDAY), ServiceNow (NOW), Ultimate Software (ULTI) and others.Salesforce's fiscal Q4 2016, which ended in January, should make it eight consecutive quarters of double-digit-or-better earnings growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Salesforce to report earnings up 36% to 19 cents per share minus items, on revenue up 24% to $1.79 billion. Salesforce had guided Q4 to adjusted EPS of 18 to 19 cents on sales up 24% at the midpoint. Earnings especially were a tough comparison to follow, as EPS had doubled to 14 cents in fiscal Q4 of 2015.For the current Q1 2017 ending in April, Wall Street models EPS up 31% to 21 cents ex items, on revenue up 23% to $1.861 billion.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said at the Q3 analyst conference: ""We expect to deliver our first $8 billion year during our fiscal year 2017, which puts us well on the path to reach $10 billion faster than any other enterprise software company.""The company's Salesforce1 platform for mobile-application development should spark growth, RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research note Sunday, although ""there are many avenues to sustain growth, including service and marketing, the platform, and international and future initiatives.""While deceleration is inevitable, we think Salesforce can continue to drive premium growth for its size, and it remains an important strategic asset.""RBC maintains an outperform rating on Salesforce.com stock, with an 80 price target, as ""one of the best positioned companies in large-cap software.""

432,ORCL,"As Silicon Valley remains firmly rooted as the global center of technology and innovation, rarely mentioned is one huge fact that could blunt a ton of good vibes: The area is due for a  major earthquake.“There are going to be infrastructure problems,” David Walters, Cisco Systems (CSCO) director of global safety and security told IBD. “If it’s 6.5 or greater, the bottom line is that a lot of people are going to be walking.”The U.S. Geological Survey says there’s a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on one of the region’s many faults in the next 30 years. The percentage shoots up to 89% for a magnitude 6 or greater quake, USGS scientist Morgan Page told IBD. Either could be catastrophic.""The Bay Area has the highest density of active faults per square mile of any urban center in the country, and on a long-term basis it has the highest amount of earthquake energy released per square mile of any urban center in the country,"" David Schwartz, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told the East Bay Express in 2005. ""So we're really kind of living at ground zero.""A magnitude 7 or greater quake would ""likely"" spur damage to buildings and infrastructure in the range of $95 billion to $190 billion, says Renee Lee, an analyst with Risk Management Solutions, a firm that models risk for insurance companies. “Despite the area being really well educated about earthquakes, and the substantial investments in infrastructure, we will expect to see some pretty significant damage if there’s a quake along the Hayward fault.”Scientists have long considered the Hayward fault one of the most likely candidates for a major quake within a few decades. The fault runs through Oakland and other heavily populated East Bay cities.What’s all but certain is that Silicon Valley will experience widespread utilities losses -- water, power -- as well as damage to buildings and infrastructure such as roads and bridges.A phenomenon called liquefaction -- in which normally solid soil acts like a liquid -- could wreak havoc on any firms with offices near the San Francisco Bay’s shore. Oracle’s main campus, for example, sits atop what’s called bay fill, a material that is highly susceptible to liquefaction. (Oracle (ORCL) spokeswoman Jessica Moore refused to comment on the company's business-continuity plans in the event of an earthquake, or any other natural disaster.)Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also have large campuses located on land susceptible to liquefaction -- though less so than Oracle's (neither of these companies responded to requests for comment). The liquefaction risk to Apple's (APPL) office in Cupertino is low.The good news is that the Internet will almost certainly continue to function, for the most part. Service disruptions are likely, but the core backbones that tie the Bay Area to the Internet will remain intact. That might not have been the case 15 years ago, though ""even then there were major fiber cuts that the Internet weathered fine,” Mike Leber, CEO of Hurricane Electric, an Internet backbone provider, told IBD via email.And many Silicon Valley companies have been sure to locate data centers in other parts of the country, so service disruptions are less likely.""Our data centers are located at sites which have limited potential for severe weather and seismic events,"" Yahoo spokeswoman Carolyn Clark told IBD in an emailed statement.Yet, though the experts can make educated guesses, no one knows how a big one might affect Silicon Valley, or any area, says Anne Wein, a USGS operations research analyst.""The hard work is going to be to get a description about what will happen,"" she told IBD. ""We're just not there yet.""The USGS is studying the issue, what it calls ""Project Haywired,"" and is aiming to complete its research in the fall, according to spokesman Justin Pressfield.In the meantime, uncertainty will persist. ""We haven't had a major earthquake in the U.S. since we have become so connected with wired and wireless technology,"" Wein said. ""Do we have new vulnerabilities? How much redundancy is there? How will this new technology help us recover?""Of 15 large Silicon Valley tech companies -- and several startups valued by investors at more than $1 billion -- that IBD contacted for this report, Adobe Systems (ADBE), eBay (EBAY), Oracle and PayPal (PYPL) declined to comment and nine did not return the request. Cisco provided access to executives for a wide-ranging interview, and Yahoo issued a brief statement.When asked why tech firms are reluctant to discuss business-continuity plans, Sam Singer, a public relations executive who specializes in crisis situations,  said tech companies are “better at talking about services and products. They’re not prepared to talk about public policy issues, safety issues, even though they ought to be.”He says that there’s no reason why companies shouldn’t be able to describe how they would deal with a natural disaster in the Bay Area without giving away proprietary information.“It’s important that companies discuss earthquakes,"" Singer said. ""They need to be leaders, and offer reminders to their employees, the public and the news media that we live in earthquake country.”Dick Evans, president of the Business Recovery Managers Association, a networking and information group for disaster recovery planners, told IBD that his group used to have more membership among major Silicon Valley firms. At the moment, he said, ""we don't have as many as we would like.""Cisco has been active in preparing for quakes. It might take the issue more seriously than others, in part, because it's among the tech giants that were around during the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, Walters says. That quake, centered near San Jose and San Francisco, killed 63 people, displaced 12,000, destroyed an estimated $6 billion worth of property and caused an unknown amount of productivity losses.At Cisco's main offices in San Jose, Walters says the company maintains what it calls ""Arks,"" which store water, food, tents and emergency supplies for all employees on site -- enough supplies to last up to three days.And executives all carry three-day survival backpacks in their vehicles, he says.The company also has a mobile operations center that can staff 13 -- and can turn it into a kind of mobile office for execs. The company has five command-and-control centers around the world -- with satellite communications abilities and backup generators for incident response vehicles. And the company conducts earthquake drills at its main offices.""We have the right processes, right supplies,"" Walters said. ""We know as much as we can about the fault lines and we want to be as knowledgeable as possible."" He adds that USGS scientists come in from time to time to talk about the fault lines with Cisco's safety and security team.The company also monitors incidents around the globe, and has a Tactical Operations team that it deploys on humanitarian missions to restore communications connectivity.Yahoo was willing to share a few details of its plans, though declined to provide access to business continuity executives.Spokeswoman Clark, in a statement, said ""Yahoo has prepared our technology, as well as our physical spaces, to allow us to continue to run and operate our business either in California or other parts of the world in the event of catastrophe. We have invested at our mission-critical facilities to provide for alternative power supplies that will allow those facilities to run in the event of a loss of power or other utilities.""

433,ORCL,"While investors applauded Hewlett Packard Enterprise's first quarterly performance as an independent company -- beating Wall Street estimates and driving its stock up more than 13% Friday -- some analysts and owners are pushing CEO Meg Whitman to compete harder.That means more aggressively taking on cloud enterprise leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), and buying up software  rivals such as Workday (WDAY) or Salesforce.com (CRM), rather than directing cash to shareholders.""I think we need to give Meg a chance to see if she can take advantage of the opportunities in servers with the cloud migration led by Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft on the service and software side,"" said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust, which holds 251,971 shares of HPE, in a Friday interview with IBD.""Further, the 54% year-over-year growth in the Q1 2016 quarter in networking allows HPE to build more momentum in this space"" vs. rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), he said.""And finally as we discussed before, the huge opportunity to expand the software unit with its 17%-plus operating margins (enables) a large acquisition in the cloud space. Right now software is just 8%-10% of total HPE revenues.""Buying enterprise software rivals Salesforce or Workday specifically is ""a chance to make that unit significant by bringing it up to 20%-25% of revenues,"" he said. ""Post-split, Hewlett Packard Enterprise was supposed to be the growth portion of the Hewlett-Packard Co., (creating) a reinvigorated growth company.""Nevertheless, happy with HPE's earnings performance issued after Thursday's market close, investors bid up its stock up 13.5% to close at 15.44 in the stock market today. That's less than 3% below its Dec. 1 high since splitting from its parent Nov. 1.For now, HPE stockholders interested in growth of any kind will need patience because the company is still shrinking, despite the slight Q1 beat.Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported earnings of 41 cents per share in the fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, on sales down 3% to $12.72 billion vs. pro forma figures from a year earlier. The results slightly beat the average view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which called for EPS of 40 cents on sales of $12.68 billion. The non-GAAP 41 cents EPS is down from 47 cents a year earlier. (However, if HPE had been a standalone company at the time, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS would have been 44 cents, the company said in a March 1 note.)That's pretty much as planned, with HPE not projecting much growth until fiscal 2018. For Q2 ending in April, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q2 EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.297 billion before Thursday's earnings release, but on Friday, the revenue consensus was revised up to $12.332 billion.For the entire fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31,  analysts  polled by Thomson Reuters projected $1.87 EPS ex items for fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, on revenue revised up Friday to $50.805 billion. HPE earlier had modeled $50.81 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016, down 2.5% from a $52.12 billion pro forma in fiscal 2015.The slightly smaller half of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., now called HP Inc. (HPQ), kept the legacy PCs, printers and ticker. HP Inc. lifted 0.6% to 11.18 Friday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the enterprise software, servers, networking and financial services businesses.To encourage patience among Hewlett Packard Enterprise shareholders, CFO Tim Stonesifer said HPE will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1. In ""addition,"" Stonesifer said, shareholders will receive a ""majority"" of proceeds from the sale of a 51% stake in its Chinese server and storage business to Tsinghua Holdings, valued at $2.3 billion at the time the deal was announced last May. The transaction was supposed to be done by February, but Whitman said regulatory delays have pushed back closing to May, after which the cash will flow to shareholders.To UBS analyst Steve Milunovich, who complained in the post-earnings-release conference call that HPE shares were priced too low, Whitman chuckled: “We appreciate that, which is why we’re backing up the truck” to buy back more shares, which helps boost the price.Whitman advised analysts that by investing internally and encouraging organic growth “you don’t end up with a Frankenstein of architecture"" as the company would risk doing by  growing through acquisitions. She cited HPE for pursuing both paths.“Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT (Internet of Things), all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems.” Aruba Networks is a networking leader in mobile enterprise that the old Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy last March for about $3 billion, strengthening the new HPE's rivalry with Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks.As for ""taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace,"" Whitman said, ""we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's (IBM) sale of their server business to Lenovo. ... We have a big opportunity to go take (merging) Dell and EMC (EMC) business, much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo.”She told CNBC on Friday that ""in the last quarter, we had about 107 deals that we actually took from Dell/EMC.""She also told analysts that HPE has become the ""leading infrastructure provider for SAP (SAP) HANA (application server) with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor.”In the cloud, she said, ""following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials.”It just wasn't enough for Needham analyst Richard Kugele, who chided the company in a research note issued Friday, arguing that the $2.3 billion windfall from Tsinghua should be spent on organic or M&A growth, not shareholders' short-term benefit.""We had hoped that post-split, HPE would be able to focus on getting its house in order and leverage its cash and balance sheet to buy/invest in solutions that solve their product gaps,"" Kugele said. ""Instead, the company seems intent on continuing financial engineering by doubling its cash return to shareholders (including the pending Tsinghua cash). In our view, this creates no sustainable value for the company or its investors but merely provides a floor for the stock during a period of poor enterprise spending.""With no material growth, revenue improvement or product strategy to build a buy thesis around, we reiterate our hold rating on the stock.""Said Morgan, the Synovus Trust portfolio manager who wants to give Whitman time to execute: ""I did hear HPE management touting its share repurchases and FCF (free cash-flow) generation capability on the call. And this is very reminiscent of when Mark Hurd was leading HPQ  (the former Hewlett-Packard Co.) and grew the share price through financial engineering and not new product growth.""Hurd is now co-CEO of Oracle (ORCL), one of HPE's toughest software rivals, and another legacy giant growing slowly.

434,ORCL,"The next round of price cutting in public cloud computing services could come from Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, just as Amazon.com and Microsoft show some restraint, says a Goldman Sachs research report.Amazon Web Services (AWS), part of Amazon.com (AMZN), is the biggest provider of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where customers rent computer servers and data storage systems via the Internet. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet’s Google are the next biggest.The new boss of Google’s cloud business, Diane Greene, will make her debut at that unit's user conference March 23 to 24, notes the Goldman Sachs report. Greene, a Google board member since January 2012, founded virtualization leader VMware (VMW), which she led as CEO until she was forced out in 2008.In November, Google acquired Greene’s startup, Bebop, for $380 million.While AWS has been the biggest IaaS price-cutter of the last decade, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been aggressive since moving into the market. Google slashed prices in March 2014, October 2014 and May-June 2015, Goldman analyst Heather Bellini said in the report.“Another 20% to 30% across-the-board price cut from Google in 2016 would not be surprising,” wrote Bellini. “This could be announced as early as their GCP Next conference in San Francisco on March 23-24. Similar to behavior in 2015, we do not expect Amazon and Microsoft to follow suit.”Goldman Sachs says that the top three service providers are gaining share as Verizon Communications (VZ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and others exit the public IaaS market and focus on private clouds.Goldman Sachs estimates that AWS’ revenue will hit $12.5 billion in 2016, up from $7.88 billion last year.“If AWS surpasses $10 billion in 10 years, it would be the fastest-growing software business,” surpassing Microsoft, Oracle (ORCL), and SAP (SAP),” Bellini wrote.

436,ORCL,"Trying to identify which among the many enterprise software companies deserve the most attention in 2016 might be impossible, but we've cut our list down to six.Among cloud software upstarts, Splunk (SPLK), Tableau Software (DATA) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) could make noise in the new year.And among the longtime standard-bearers, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) bear watching.These companies will generate billions of dollars in 2016 helping companies and people organize, analyze and manage ever-rising stores of data.Mobile data traffic alone will jump 1,000% from 2013 to 2018, to the equivalent of 43,709 text messages each second, says Cisco Systems (CSCO). Big Data and data analytics software turns those digits into actionable intelligence.Successes And, Uh, FailuresThe chosen six will serve well in gauging Big Data successes in 2016, says FBR analyst Daniel Ives.They will be less useful, however, for detecting Big Data failures, since most failures don't get publicized, says Svetlana Sicular, an analyst with research firm Gartner.These six offer some engaging dynamics: Splunk, Tableau and Qlik are just new enough, small enough, good enough and growing fast enough for the other three to acquire. The big three have single-digit growth rates prodding some investors to pressure for more action, like buying faster-growing rivals.""There are many companies that are extremely innovative, but the majority are not,"" Sicular told IBD. ""I gave a presentation on Big Data failures, because there are successes about which we all know but there are many failures, and people don't like to speak about them.""The Core WinnersLooking for success?""Qlik, Tableau and Splunk (are) the core winners in the Big Data trade for 2016,"" Ives told IBD. ""Front and center is Splunk. Their Big Data machine-to-machine analytics footprint is poised to see an inflection of growth in 2016 and beyond.""The company's Splunk Enterprise solution has been viewed as the 'go to' Big Data platform that is helping enterprises and governments launch their Big Data endeavors. We view this as a $40 billion market opportunity the next few years, with Splunk only less than 10% penetrated.""Next, we view Tableau and Qlik as Big Data winners, with Tableau being one of the best pure-growth companies in the tech space . .. and Qlik as the best Big Data turnaround story, with its new product portfolio, Qlik Sense. Qlik remains our top M&A candidate for 2016, with HPE, IBM and Oracle as potential acquirers.""Analyst Sicular expects some great data innovations in 2016, while people will benefit from innovations recently brought to market. She shares the tale of Climate, which agriculture giant Monsanto (MON) bought in 2013 for nearly $1 billion.""Climate Corp. installed sensors in the ground and were the first to offer crop insurance, (since) insurance companies never profited from crop insurance and gave up,"" Sicular said. ""So the innovation from Climate Corp. was they not only insured crops, but told farmers how to water the land. Those sensors were within 20 meters of each other.""The advantage was not only insuring the crops, but knowing how to very granularly grow the crops.""Sensors in the ground sound like the Internet of Things, Sicular notes: ""People didn't think back then of the Internet of Things, but that's how it worked.""Another example is John Deere (DE). They're changing their model (so it's) much more data-driven and providing preventive maintenance ... moving toward leasing their fleet, or being a different provider of their fleet, rather than selling.""There are many different models. We can't separate the data from its surroundings. We call it a convergence of social, mobile, cloud and Big Data.Built-Environment Cases""My favorite example: Fujitsu's turned one of their semiconductor fabs (chip manufacturing plants) into sort of a greenhouse, a place for growing lettuce. It turns out that some people ... cannot (eat) any foods with potassium. ... Fujitsu is growing potassium-free lettuce in a very controlled environment for a semiconductor fab.""Not only they, but other semiconductor manufacturers are implementing through the Microsoft (MSFT) Azure cloud.""Sicular cites real estate management as a good and growing market for Big Data IoT, with landlords saving 20% to 30% by monitoring and controlling built environments remotely, especially helpful in harsh climates.Online real estate firm Zillow (ZG) not only provides online home prices, but ""rich analytics about everything ... the crime situation, the level of education, all kinds of demographics, a lot more information than traditionally, and that's some of the keys to their success. ... Some of it is the availability or taking advantage of more data,"" Sicular said.She notes that NASA makes its images of earth available to the public, some in real time, and ""there's a company that predicts retail outcomes by analyzing the satellite images of parking lots in shopping malls.""Sicular divides Big Data into two categories: business extension implementation and game changing.In business extension, the technology is used to make something ""faster, better, cheaper, and it doesn't disrupt the business.""But game changing is the more exciting, she says.The Thrill Of Game Changing""Uber is not a taxi company,"" Sicular said. ""They don't own the fleet. They're a data company. Airbnb does not own rooms or hotels. They're a data company. Those would be examples of game-changing use cases.""Game changers don't have previous baggage pulling them down and can take full advantage of new technology and forward thinking, she says. ""It's much harder to change an old business than start a new business,"" she said.She calls Splunk and Tableau ""two very good companies.""Tableau, she says, offers ""one of the favorite tools for end users, which means it's here to stay ... current, prime time analytics software. It's great.""Splunk has over 10,000 users and (recently retired) CEO Godfrey Sullivan was a visionary. He was driven by the idea, and I think he's stepping down because he's satisfied with the result. I think it's a great company.""She points out that Splunk was ""the first in the Big Data world to go public (in 2012) and did everything right, growing organically with a good mix of analytics and data management.""

452,ORCL,"Well, which canary is it?After Big Data analytics software maker Tableau Software (DATA) disappointed investors with Q1 and 2016 guidance well below Wall Street expectations -- sending its stock crashing 49.5% Friday to an all-time low -- Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury questioned whether Tableau ""will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.”Nandury was referring to Tableau and prospects for its growth. But later Friday, in a research report, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley posed the identical question: “We wonder if Tableau will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.” Ashley's canary was much bigger.“With among the smallest deal sizes and shortest sales cycles in enterprise software, Tableau theoretically would be the first to see any downturn in new pipeline business due to a macro weakness,” Ashley wrote, questioning whether other enterprise software vendors might follow.Investors got the point. Tableau rivals Splunk (SPLK) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) fell 23% and 15%, respectively, and little Hortonworks (HDP) -- which may have been Big Data’s first canary with a 37% gap down Jan. 19 after a poor earnings report -- fell 17%, also hitting an all-time low.Closing Friday at 8.48, Hortonworks is not only below its December 2014 initial public offering price of 16, but is also below the 9.50-a-share price Goldman Sachs set Tuesday for an 8.425 million-share secondary offering. Hortonworks' Jan. 19 dive came after it filed with the SEC to raise $100 million in the secondary offering, coming after the worst opening two weeks of any year in the market's history. On Tuesday, Hortonworks said in its new SEC filing that it had raised only $77.19 million, before expenses.Evercore ISI analyst Bill Whyman told IBD on Friday, however, that he stands by his research issued Jan. 26, in which he acknowledged tech companies face continuing “weak” demand, but not so weak that stocks should be “falling off a cliff” like they have so far this year.“The harder question is: Are stocks anticipating that demand will fall off a cliff six months from now?"" Whyman said. ""The evidence to date does not make this our base case.”He expects 6% global tech revenue growth for 2016 vs. 2% in 2015, and offered a mixed bag when looking at sectors. He advises overweighting portfolios with software and Internet stocks, underweighting communications equipment and computing, and market-weighting (neither buying nor selling) semiconductor stocks.“We forecast ‘not-pretty-but-we’ll-take-it' overall,"" he said.Late Friday, however, his Evercore ISI colleague Kirk Materne, sang a tougher mine-canary tune, “as software officially enters the pain cave.""“If you wanted a cathartic event to wipe out any remaining optimism in the software space, (Tableau’s) earnings report was it,” Materne wrote in a research note. “Ironically, the idea that a license-based, visualization tool vendor (Tableau) that is facing growing pains would cause a 10% pullback in Adobe (ADBE) or 14% pullback in CRM (Salesforce.com (CRM)) would seem like a stretch, but welcome to the new reality.“While most of the major ‘blow-ups’ year-to-date in software have been more company specific (at least in my view) vs. a dramatic change in the fundamental backdrop, the reality is no one cares, and the broader de-risking in the sector is unlikely to end until we see a strong quarter from one of the higher-quality growth names like CRM or Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and the stock actually goes up) and/or until some of the smaller names throw in the towel and M&A picks up.”Palo Alto Networks stock fell 12% Friday, part of the general downturn.Database leader Oracle (ORCL), which is still trying to accelerate its cloud business, fell 1.9% Friday, in line with Friday’s broader market decline. IBD's entire Computer Software-Database industry group fell 15%.Other big names in the enterprise software market tumbling Friday included SAP (SAP) (down 3.6%), Salesforce.com (13%), Workday (WDAY) (16%) and Manhattan Associates (MANH) (9%). IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group fell 8% Friday to a 2-1/2-year low.Qlik, CyberArk Software (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE) and Hortonworks are all scheduled to report earnings in the coming week, with the pressure on.

453,ORCL,"Tableau Software (DATA) late Thursday posted Q4 earnings minus items and sales that beat expectations, but shares were down more than 35% in after-hours action amid signs that Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft and others were grabbing Big Data market share.Tableau's outlook for the current quarter missed Wall Street views, at least one analyst said Q4 licensing revenue missed and at least one analyst said the Q4 sales beat lagged many analyst expectations.Tableau reported earnings minus items of 33 cents, down 21% from the year-earlier quarter but well ahead of the 16 cents expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But Tableau's net loss, using generally accepted accounting principles, soared to 57 cents a share from 27 cents.In its earnings release, the maker of Big Data analytics software said its Q4 ""tax expense was $34.1 million due to the recognition of a valuation allowance. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $46.7 million on the deferred tax assets relating to these jurisdictions.""Q4 revenue rose 42% to $202.8 million, $2 million above analyst estimates, but ""the buy side was looking for sales upside of $20 million-plus,"" William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri wrote in a research note emailed after the earnings release.License revenue rose 31% to $133.1 million in Q4, but Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry said the missed Wall Street expectations and indicated the “market is moving away from (Tableau) products, to alternatives like (Amazon.com's) AWS QuickSight,” financial news site Benzinga reported.Tableau also gave weak revenue guidance for Q1 and 2016.In the company's earnings conference call with analysts, Tableau CFO Tom Walker guided Q1 to an 8- to 12-cent loss per share minus items, worse than the 6-cent gain expected by analysts. Walker guided revenue at $160 million to $165 million, up 27% at the high end but well below the $179.5 million analysts expected.For the year, Tableau sees revenue of $830 million to $850 million, up 30% at the high end but short of the $871 million analysts expected. Its EPS outlook also missed.In an email, Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury reminded IBD that he’d warned that “Tableau is perceived as expensive.” in a post-Q3 research note.“We have data and have heard anecdotally that the Tableau solution is the most expensive in the market when compared with"" products from rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK.)""It would not be a surprise if (Microsoft's) PowerBI finds greater traction with Excel users, precisely the same users Tableau is targeting,” Nandury said.In a subsequent phone interview, Nandury told IBD ""the company is going to remain in the penalty box for a long time to come, basically because they blew up in such a massive scale. They have not only guided down Q1 but they also guided down the full year.“Microsoft is giving away their software for free. Amazon is coming up with their own ... our thesis on the stock has always been that Tableau is a one-trick pony.”In a Jan. 15 research note, Nomura analyst Aashiv Shah warned of competition faced by Tableau and Qlik from Microsoft: ""Competition is increasing, with (Qlik) partners noting increased customer interest in Microsoft's Power BI, which is a freemium product and sells at a cheaper price compared to Qlik and Tableau. While Power BI continues to lag Qlik and Tableau in terms of user experience and functionality, its lower price point could eventually lead to pricing pressure in the analytics market.""Tableau stock was 36% in after-hours trading, after rising nearly 3% in Thursday's regular session.Tableau also competes with much-larger Oracle (ORCL), Splunk (SPLK)  and others. Shares of both Splunk and Qlik were down 11% after-hours""In Q4, a record 3,600 new customer accounts chose Tableau, bringing our total to more than 39,000 worldwide,"" Tableau CEO Christian Chabot said in the earnings release. ""This speaks to the immense popularity of Tableau’s products and continued strong demand from customers around the world.""

486,ORCL,"SAP (SAP) more than doubled its cloud customers in the fourth quarter, compared with Q3, to 2,700 businesses using S/4HANA, its next-generation business software ""nucleus"" around which operators can integrate old enterprise and new hybrid ""external ecosystems,"" the company said in releasing Q4 earnings before the open Friday.The Germany-based business software maker reiterated its 2016 guidance, pumped up its outlook for 2017 and predicted its new cloud revenue would exceed legacy software license sales by 2018.Year over year in Q4, SAP's 81% growth in cloud systems and support sales revenue to 632 million euros ($682 million at Friday's exchange rate) compared favorably with the 13% growth rate of its traditional software and support sales, but the latter reached 4.749 billion euros, still the bulk of SAP's activity. The combination of cloud and legacy software sales grew 18%, SAP said. Including other sources, total revenue rose 16% to 6.346 billion euros in Q4.At today's exchange rate of $1.08 for 1 euro, SAP's Q4 rose 16% to $6.853 billion.Shareholders have heard most of it before: SAP pre-announced 2015 performance on Jan. 11. SAP stock lifted 0.4% to close at 78.27 in the stock market today. Shares are 4% off a nearly two-year high of 81.21 set Dec. 29, as SAP stock ended a 37-day, stage-1 flat base. Shares rose 2% after the company pre-announced the 2015 results.""It's encouraging to see SAP is able to increase its market share in what appears to be an area of growth for the company,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD in an email after the Q4 announcement. PureFunds manages BDAT, which claims the title as the world's first Big Data ETF. SAP is now BDAT's No. 2 holding.""Due to the rapid increase of data growth, it's important to secure loyal customers now, as it gives SAP an opportunity to ... grow along with (customers') data management requirements,"" Chanin said. ""Locking in customers now could potentially be seen as locking in future growth.""Q4's IFRS operating profit fell 3% in to 1.7 billion euros, but non-IFRS operating profit rose 7% to $2.28 billion, yielding IFRS per-share earnings down 2% to 1.07 euros and non-IFRS up 7% to 1.40 euros. In U.S. dollars, that's $1.15 per share in earnings and $1.51 in per-share earnings minus items.IFRS stands for International Financial Reporting Standards, which like Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., are stated in strict and non-strict terms in order to better compare performance from period to period. Non-IFRS and non-GAAP terms exclude extraordinary items.SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Face ChallengeThe Q4 difference in cloud vs. legacy growth rates illustrates the challenge that SAP and other legacy software developers such as Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT) face: Traditional business software and legacy enterprise products are still producing the big-revenue dinners, while upstart cloud software developers such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA) are eating the legacy players' lunch with faster growth from a smaller plate.All of SAP's cited rivals lifted Friday: Oracle by 2%, Microsoft by 3.6%, Salesforce by 2.9%, Splunk by 3.6% and Tableau by 0.7%.SAP reiterated its full-year 2016 guidance for non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to a range of 2.95 billion to 3.05 billion euros at constant currencies vs. 2015's 2.30 billion euros, with ""the upper end of this range (representing) a growth rate of 33% at constant currencies.""But it also raised 2017 guidance and predicted a 2018 milestone. Total 2017 revenue is now expected to rise to a range of 23 billion to 23.5 billion euros, SAP said, and it now sees a 2017 non-IFRS operating profit of 6.7 billion to 7 billion euros.""Our strength in 2015 shows that the S/4HANA innovation cycle is well underway,"" SAP CEO Bill McDermott said in the company's earnings release. ""Our completeness of vision in the cloud has distinguished SAP from both legacy players and point solution providers. We beat on cloud and software, we beat on operating income, and we are ever-confident that SAP will remain a profitable growth business well into the future.""

487,ORCL,"Sales of $2 billion are a drop in the bucket -- if you’re IBM (IBM) or Cisco Systems (CSCO).That’s how much tech giant IBM drew in 2015 security revenue. Networking giant Cisco pulled in $1.75 billion in security revenue. But security sales accounted for just 2.4% and 3%, respectively, of those companies’ multibillion-dollar top lines.Both IBM and Cisco say their cybersecurity revenue rose 12% last year. The growth outstripped pure players Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP). And the total dollar sales for IBM and Cisco easily topped total revenue for leading security pure players Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE).Cybersecurity Ventures CEO Steve Morgan says it’s just the beginning of a series of “knockdown, dragout brawls"" among tech giants IBM, Cisco, Dell and others specifically in the security software-and-services arena in 2016.And companies like IBM and Cisco don't enter the ring with kid gloves. This bare-knuckle  donnybrook for cybersecurity superiority will be fought with well-padded M&A budgets. The steep decline in security software stocks of late, amid fears of slowing spending on enterprise software, only raises the stakes, making some buyout targets likely more affordable.Lower spending could hit security vendors, but there's no debate that cybersecurity needs have grown. Hackers stormed the digital bulwarks of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), Sony (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the Office of Personnel Management in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That drove a lot of what Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski calls “panic spending.”More than 60% of 137 chief information officers recently polled by Piper Jaffray had refreshed their security firewalls within the past 12 months. And firewall security ranked only No. 5 on a list of CIO priorities. Endpoint security, compliance, protecting Web applications, and internal-access management topped CIO priorities.These latter four segments will be hot M&A sectors this year, Nowinski says.“A lot of enterprises, in light of all the mega-breaches that occurred in 2014 and 2015, really beefed up and spent a lot on their network perimeters,” he told IBD. “After getting more comfortable with your perimeter (by beefing up firewalls) . . . you need to invest in technology that protects what the hackers are going after.”Symantec, Trend Micro and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee lead the endpoint protection sector, according to Gartner. The market tracker says Imperva (IMPV) and F5 Networks (FFIV) top the Web-application firewall market, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) leads the internal-access management segment.Valuations skyrocketed in the hyperactive 2015 threat landscape, Nowinski says. Thus, last year wasn't one of big consolidation for cybersecurity.""Companies were trying to figure out what were the most strategic assets they needed to add to protect against the changing threat environment,"" he said. ""The threat environment was evolving very quickly and valuations were going through the roof with these mega-breaches.""Valuations, however, have plunged lately. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was down nearly 40% as of Friday from its 2015 high achieved July 24 -- after the group plunged 7.4% on Friday. From the start of 2015 through July 24, the group had rocketed 33%.The group tacked on another 7.2% loss by the closing bell Monday, as techs tumbled on the heels of poorly received forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA), whose stocks sheared off after their quarterly reports last week. Cloud securer Qualys added to the pressure when, late Monday, the firm reported Q4 and 2015 sales that missed consensus views, and issued Q1 guidance that lagged Wall Street expectations.The mass high-tech selloff also plagued IBD’s 26-company Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which landed down 4% and 2.8% on Friday and Monday, respectively.Still, a lot of big dollars are up for grabs in cybersecurity, FBR analyst Daniel Ives says. He estimates that spending on next-generation security wares will jump 30% in 2016, though total IT spending is seen rising just 3%.Gartner estimates that IT security spending will soar from $75 billion-plus in 2015 to $101 billion in 2018. Research firm Markets and Markets sees the cybersecurity market hitting $170 billion by 2020.""It's such an enormous growth segment, in a very choppy environment,"" Ives told IBD. ""It's pent-up demand and it's the massive threat environment. . . . You look at the technology landscape and cybersecurity is a priority.""As nontraditional security firms jump on the cybersecurity bandwagon, no potential M&A is off limits, Cybersecurity Ventures' Morgan says.""If you look at the cybersecurity industry, there are not a lot of unicorns,"" he said. ""What we're seeing is (startups) will raise $10 million to $100 million . . . to ratchet up and get acquired by multimillion-dollar tech companies.""In January, FireEye stirred the M&A dust with a $200 million acquisition of cyberthreat intelligence firm iSight Partners, expanding its portfolio again after its $1 billion Mandiant acquisition in 2014.""That's where we're going to see the market,"" Morgan said. ""Any company that has successfully raised (venture capital) funding would be a takeover candidate.""Alan Kessler, CEO of privately held Vormetric, calls these ""tuck-in acquisitions.""""I think the pace of acquisitions is probably going to accelerate simply because of what's happening in the overall market demand for solutions,"" Kessler told IBD, ""but also the fact that some of the smaller players may have difficulty getting funding at a valuation that is appealing to their investors.""Vormetric falls into that ""tuck-in"" field. The encryption specialist is in the process of being acquired by Thales, a French company focused on ""creating a safer world,"" according to its website.Thales isn't a pure cybersecurity player but it touches 80% of online-processing payments, Kessler says. Vormetric will be threaded into Thales' data security group when the transaction closes, likely in late March.Kessler expects IBM and Cisco to continue adding new cybersecurity offerings to their portfolios. And the market recognizes that -- big tech firms know enterprise-level software, Enterprise Strategy Group analyst Jon Oltsik told IBD.""There's consolidation in the customers, the enterprise; they want to buy fewer tools from fewer vendors,"" Oltsik said. ""They want an integrated platform because what we've done in the past isn't working anymore.""And the efficiency of the technology has to be enterprise class, so that kind of speaks to the bigger vendors who know how to service the enterprise.""In the largest pure-tech merger ever, Dell last year agreed to acquire EMC for $67 billion in -- and thereby got its hands on EMC's RSA security business. In December, Dell confirmed rumors that it filed a $2 billion IPO for its SecureWorks business, which it acquired in 2011 for $612 million.""They single out cybersecurity and decide that's their spinoff?"" Morgan said. ""That says a lot about the market.""The pure players have done some tucking of their own. In 2015, Fortinet acquired Meru Networks for $44 million and Check Point spent $80 million on Lacoon Mobile Security.Also in 2015, Cisco followed up its $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013 by acquiring OpenDNS for $635 million. And Raytheon acquired Websense for $1.9 billion, to create privately held Forcepoint.Between 2014 and 2015, Microsoft (MSFT) -- which Oltsik calls a cybersecurity ""wild card"" -- spent $600 million to buy three Israeli cybersecurity firms.""You would not call Microsoft a cybersecurity company,"" Morgan says. ""But you're starting to see them get very active in cyber. IBM would be another interesting company.""In 2015, IBM's total sales fell 12%, to $81.7 billion, even as its cybersecurity sales rose 12% to $2 billion.""That's a lot (of growth) when you're counting in the billions,"" Morgan said. ""That's not on a lot of people's radar. That gets lost a little bit in the context of much bigger companies.""FireEye's iSight acquisition is the only confirmed M&A in the sector this year. But CyberArk stock surged in January on rumors that Check Point is seeking to acquire it. Culturally, it makes sense --  they're both Israeli firms, Ives says.Should Check Point and CyberArk merge, such a deal would be larger than a tuck-in, Morgan says. Although Check Point is much larger -- with a $13.5 billion market value to CyberArk's $1.3 billion -- both are credible performers, he said.""I'm not sure we'd call that a merger or an acquisition,"" he said. ""CyberArk and Check Point, if that were to happen, I think you're looking at two companies coming together and looking to move into a much larger position in the market.""Cisco, Oracle (ORCL), IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec will stoke 2016 M&A, Ives says. He lists Qualys (QLYS), CyberArk, Fortinet, FireEye and Imperva on his takeover list. He says the timing is especially ripe for Symantec to make an acquisition.Symantec completed its Veritas sale to the Carlyle Group on Jan. 29,  saying it received $5.3 billion in after-tax proceeds from the deal. Symantec acquired data storage firm Veritas for $13.5 billion in 2005, a deal that many analysts questioned.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec struggled in 2015, when revenue fell 2.4% to $6.54 billion. Now, Symantec will apply the cash from the Veritas sale toward an acquisition that strengthens its position, Nowinski said.Oltsik sees platform plays taking out Resilient Systems, Phantom Cyber, Invotas or ServiceNow (NOW) as automation becomes an increasingly important piece of cybersecurity. Smaller firms like Malwarebytes and Code DX also could be swept into the M&A frenzy, Morgan says.""In a different tech sector, where there's not as much M&A activity, you have to be doing some very cutting-edge things to be an acquisition target,"" he said. ""Here, if you walk and talk and raise money in the cybersecurity space, you're a target.""

"
582,ORCL,"With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.
"
583,ORCL,"A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.
"
584,ORCL,"They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).
"
585,ORCL,"Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.
"
586,ORCL,"Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.
"
587,ORCL,"Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.
"
588,ORCL,"Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services. This would contribute to long-term growth and feed economic expansion, they say. Critics also say that executives use buybacks to flatter financial results.
"
589,ORCL,"But defenders say returning money to shareholders is a good use of money that's left over after capital has already been allocated to normal business expenses.
"
590,ORCL,"In today's environment, many companies are ""still left with a large amount of excess capital,"" even after investing in growth initiatives, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business Group.
"
591,ORCL,"""They are choosing to redeploy the money to investors,"" he told IBD. ""When done the right way, buybacks are a good capital allocation. There are a lot of misperceptions around share buybacks.""
"
592,ORCL,"Record Buyback Pace
"
593,ORCL,"What's certain is this: A whole lot of money is going toward buybacks and dividends lately.
"
594,ORCL,"The total dollar amount of dividends and stock buybacks is on track to reach a new high this year and could soar above $1 trillion for the first time, according to industry estimates.
"
595,ORCL,"The percentage of operating cash flow used to buy back shares is at its highest level since 2007, Arone says. He calls that a ""watershed year"" for buybacks. That was also just before the U.S. fell into a sharp recession and bear market.
"
596,ORCL,"""Some look at 2007 as a kind of peak year,"" he said. ""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""
"
597,ORCL,"A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.
"
598,ORCL,"In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.
"
599,ORCL,"FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.
"
600,ORCL,"The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).
"
601,ORCL,"Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.
"
602,ORCL,"Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?
"
603,ORCL,"The most basic answer is that the money is there, and something has to be done with it.
"
604,ORCL,"""You have low interest rates and record profits,"" Arone said. ""This has resulted in corporations at peak levels in terms of having a lot of cash on hand.""
"
605,ORCL,"In some cases, activist investors are pressuring companies to reward investors with that money, analysts say. In others, executives are simply gun-shy about investing in products and services that might not pay off over the long term.
"
606,ORCL,"Another reason some companies are buying back outstanding shares is that doing so fattens up per-share earnings.
"
607,ORCL,"Innovation Shortchanged?
"
608,ORCL,"The worry in some quarters is that buybacks come at the expense of product development, innovation and long-term growth.
"
609,ORCL,"""The U.S. is behind on production of everything from flat-panel TVs to semiconductors and solar photovoltaic cells,"" Gary Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School, told Reuters. He's also the author of ""Producing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance.""
"
610,ORCL,"Reuters reported that among the 1,000 or so firms it tracked that buy back shares and report R&D spending, the share of net income spent on innovation has averaged less than 50% since 2009. That com pares to over 60% during the 1990s.
"
611,ORCL,"But not all data show such a grim view, Arone said. ""There's a bunch of data showing R&D growing at its fastest level in 50 years. There's this misperception that companies are not reinvesting or spending on business growth. But many companies do continue to reinvest in their businesses.""
"
612,ORCL,"He also says that while buybacks can boost a company's EPS, research from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that on a weighted basis, recent S&P 500 EPS gains ""are built on profits — not buybacks.""
"
613,ORCL,"A recent report from Deutsche Bank found that S&P 500 per-share profits since 2012 have risen by 6.2% annually on average, of which just 1.6 percentage points are from buybacks. That fell to 1.2 points in Q3.
"
614,ORCL,"Misperceptions about buybacks are due to a couple of factors, Arone says.
"
615,ORCL,"""Global economic growth has been sluggish, and therefore folks equate that sluggishness with a lack of business investment,"" he said. ""There's also been a lack of any meaningful wage growth. There's this view that we would be accelerating much more quickly had businesses been investing more, but I'm not convinced that's accurate.""
"
616,ORCL,"If economic growth is sluggish, the return on capital may be low, so returning cash to shareholders may be a sound decision.
"
617,ORCL,"That's not to say there aren't cases where companies issue buybacks and dividends at their detriment.
"
618,ORCL,"""If a company is borrowing aggressively or levering its balance sheet to buy back stock, that is not necessarily a good strategy,"" Arone said. ""Or if a company buys back its stock to offset the dilutive effects of stock-based compensation of employees, that's not a good strategy, either.""
"
619,ORCL,"But those are the exceptions rather than the rule, he said. ""To say that's what's happening broadly is, in my mind, an exaggeration.""With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services. This would contribute to long-term growth and feed economic expansion, they say. Critics also say that executives use buybacks to flatter financial results.But defenders say returning money to shareholders is a good use of money that's left over after capital has already been allocated to normal business expenses.In today's environment, many companies are ""still left with a large amount of excess capital,"" even after investing in growth initiatives, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business Group.""They are choosing to redeploy the money to investors,"" he told IBD. ""When done the right way, buybacks are a good capital allocation. There are a lot of misperceptions around share buybacks.""Record Buyback PaceWhat's certain is this: A whole lot of money is going toward buybacks and dividends lately.The total dollar amount of dividends and stock buybacks is on track to reach a new high this year and could soar above $1 trillion for the first time, according to industry estimates.The percentage of operating cash flow used to buy back shares is at its highest level since 2007, Arone says. He calls that a ""watershed year"" for buybacks. That was also just before the U.S. fell into a sharp recession and bear market.""Some look at 2007 as a kind of peak year,"" he said. ""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?The most basic answer is that the money is there, and something has to be done with it.""You have low interest rates and record profits,"" Arone said. ""This has resulted in corporations at peak levels in terms of having a lot of cash on hand.""In some cases, activist investors are pressuring companies to reward investors with that money, analysts say. In others, executives are simply gun-shy about investing in products and services that might not pay off over the long term.Another reason some companies are buying back outstanding shares is that doing so fattens up per-share earnings.Innovation Shortchanged?The worry in some quarters is that buybacks come at the expense of product development, innovation and long-term growth.""The U.S. is behind on production of everything from flat-panel TVs to semiconductors and solar photovoltaic cells,"" Gary Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School, told Reuters.

644,ORCL,"Take some growth stocks, put them in with some value stocks, and what do you get? A core mutual fund. Some growth mutual funds own a few value stocks and some value funds own some growth stocks. But some funds own too much of each type to be classified as growth or value in Morningstar's eyes. So core makes a home for those funds.There are times when the stock market favors each style over the others. Value mutual funds hold stocks that in aggregate have below-average price-earnings and price-to-book values.Value investors see such stocks as having less risk and great potential for price appreciation. Their prices are already depressed, and so most of the hot money is out of them already. They could rise as investors discover the stocks' potential.Growth investors seek companies with above-average earnings and sales growth, and potential continued growth. The ability to grab market share or expand new markets is a hallmark of these stocks. They often have higher than average P-E and price-book values as growth investors tend to be willing to pay up for companies able to achieve rapid growth.John Hancock Large Cap Equity has both types of stocks in its recent top holdings. Sandy Sanders and Walter McCormick have managed the $3.7 billion fund since 2011 and Jonathan White since March this year.Facebook (FB) has grown earnings at a 70% annual pace for the past three years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that its earnings will climb 18% this year and 33% next year. By comparison, the S&P 500's EPS growth is expected to be -1.03% for 2015 and 8.90% for 2016, notes Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst at S&P Capital IQ.The stock has climbed 24% this year, near an all-time high, and is trading at about 51 times trailing 12-month earnings or three times the level of the S&P 500, a proxy for the broad stock market.Oracle (ORCL) used to be a growth stock, but its annual earnings growth pace has been a subdued 3% the past three years and 9% the past five years. Its stock is 21% off its 52-week high and is trading at 14 times earnings, or about 20% less than the S&P 500's P-E. Earnings of the developer of database systems are seen falling 5% this year fiscal year, which ends in May, but rising 10% next year. It's got a dividend growth rate of 28% and a dividend yield of 1.6%.John Hancock Large Cap Equity is a top-performing core fund, having risen an average annual 10.6% the past 10 years vs. 7.86% for the S&P 500.

645,ORCL,"Amazon (AMZN) and its cloud business are likely going to face vigorous competition from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google for its now-dominant cloud computing business, as Microsoft (MSFT) and other competitors continue to struggle to gain market share.Late Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced in a blog post that the tech-giant has hired former VMWare (VMW) CEO Diane Greene to lead the firm's cloud operations. The new team will combine Google for Work, Cloud Platform and Google Apps into a single business unit with Greene at the helm. ""This new business will bring together product, engineering, marketing and sales and allow us to operate in a much more integrated, coordinated fashion,"" Pichai blogged.Pichai also wrote that Google was acquiring another company that Greene founded, Bebop, which is a developer platform for enterprise software. Greene is one of the most prominent women in the tech industry and she ""moves in the industry's most elite circles,"" according to the New York Times. She will remain on Google's board.Last year Google infrastructure executive Urs Holzle told Wired that the cloud business may generate more revenue than the search firm's ad business. ""One day, this could be bigger than ads. Certainly, in terms of market potential, it is,"" he said.Google's renewed interest in building its cloud business has the potential to erode Amazon's significant leadership in terms of revenue and market share. The cloud business unit, Amazon Web Services or AWS, has been aggressively going after the market, and boasted a 78% jump in Q3 revenue to $2.09 billion over the year-ago quarter.The e-commerce juggernaut's explosive cloud growth generated a price target hike from Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak last week. The analyst bumped the investment bank's target 7% to 800 from 750, citing revenue and the firm upping its total addressable market to $240 billion from $150 billion in 2013.Fierce CompetitionAmazon's dominance in the sector has dwarfed competitors such as Rackspace (RAX), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft. But, demand is growing at an ""explosive"" rate, according to Mark Russinovich, chief technology officer of Microsoft Azure Cloud.""We're at the early days,"" Russinovich told IBD. ""We've just seen the beginning of the cloud explosion. Having said that, if you haven't been a player for a long time, it's a challenge for anyone that's just started to get the ecosystem going and build momentum. That gap is only going to widen.""The Redmond, Wash.-based firm reported in Q1 that its cloud business has an annualized run rate that exceeds $8.2 billion.Russinovich said that Microsoft is focused on its hyperscale, meaning that the software giant is adapting its business worldwide to the hundreds of jurisdictions with specific regulations regarding cloud data — or cultural preferences regarding where customers want to store their data. Citing a specific example — a partnership with a German telecom firm — Microsoft has been able to ensure that its cloud offerings are available in countries with such sovereign data preferences, Russinovich said.Russinovich characterized the cloud market growth as a ""quantum leap.""Alphabet and Amazon are both IBD Leaderboard stocks, with IBD Composite Ratings of 98 and 97, respectively, with 99 being the highest.

"
650,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) stock took a hit in the early going Thursday as wary investors focused on the troubles facing the database software giant instead of its first-quarter earnings beat.Shares of Oracle were down 3% to around 37 in the stock market today, a day after the company said that it had come in ahead of profit estimates by a penny. But Oracle said that it fell short on revenue as its efforts to break into cloud computing, while promising, weren't enough to offset declines in more established businesses.Adjusted Q1 income for the period that ended Aug. 31 came in at 53 cents a share, a penny ahead of forecasts from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, though it was 14.5% lower than a year earlier. Sales, at $8.45 billion, were off 1.7% from a year earlier and 0.9% below analysts' views.Analysts who issued post-earnings research notes Thursday morning noted Oracle's positive prospects but struggled to reconcile them with current and recent woes. Oracle's earnings beat was only the second over the last seven quarters. The company's fourth quarter was particularly difficult, with Oracle missing earnings estimates by nearly 10%.Some analysts were holding out hope that Oracle still could rebound.""We still believe our Oracle 'buy' (rating) is a good idea, but we haven't yet won the good timing award,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in his note to clients. Davis added, however, that he expects Oracle to come around, thanks to its efforts to boost its cloud computing.""While it's more fun to own exciting, fast-growing companies alongside the financial equivalent of the 'cool kids,' sometimes you can make money in stocks by owning companies that investors conclude aren't as bad as they thought,"" Davis said. ""Indeed, it is during the early stages of a perception change that we have seen the most alpha. Basically, this is the reason we have a 'buy' on Oracle; we believe the company is not as bad as investors believe.""Oracle officials were trying to make that very point on their call with analysts Wednesday. The company said that its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue was up 34% and that it sees growth in those arenas at 60% by the fourth quarter, which ends in May.While some analysts wondered aloud whether Oracle could live up to those projections, given its past shortcomings, Co-CEO Safra Catz tried to assure them. ""It's not possible that it does not happen,"" Catz said. ""It's not avoidable. It's inevitable."" She noted that the company has received but not yet recorded a sizable amount of revenue.William Blair's Jason Ader said that the currency headwinds that Oracle faced during the quarter, which Catz said took a 6-cent bite out of earnings, obscured the picture, though he was cautiously optimistic that the company might pull through.""Overall, the story is incrementally improving, as strong gains in cloud are beginning to outrun declines in on-premise software,"" he said in his note. ""Ultimately, we continue to await a more meaningful inflection point in the product mix shift, more consistent execution and a more attractive entry point.""Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt and on Facebook.

652,ORCL,"After two strong up days following the Hewlett-Packard split-up, PC and printer maker HP Inc. (HPQ) fell Wednesday after getting a cautious report from UBS.
"
653,ORCL,"HP was down 2% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 14. Its sister company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), was down 4%, also near 14. Hewlett-Packard split into HP and HPE on Sunday.
"
654,ORCL,"UBS analyst Steven Milunovich on Wednesday initiated coverage of HP with a neutral rating and HPE with a buy rating.

655,ORCL,"He set a 12-month price target of 15 on HP.
"
656,ORCL,"""Although we find the valuation and dividend yield somewhat attractive, we think the business fundamentals are likely to get worse before they get better,"" he said about HP. ""We expect the printing margin to come under pressure and PC sales to decline albeit at a more modest rate.""
"
657,ORCL,"In the longer term, he is optimistic about HP's prospects in encroaching on the copier market and becoming a leader in 3D printing.
"
658,ORCL,"HP gets about 80% of its profit from printing, mostly by selling ink, and the remaining 20% from personal computers.

660,ORCL,"""Although HP Inc. is comprised of two secularly challenged businesses — printing and PCs — we do expect to see a benefit from increased focus over time,"" Milunovich said.
"
661,ORCL,"As for HPE, Milunovich sees the business improving in the near term, but has longer-term concerns. He set a price target of 18.50 on the stock.

""In the near term, HP should benefit from distractions at its printing peers and No. 3 PC vendor Dell, which is in the process of attempting to swallow larger EMC (EMC).""
"
671,ORCL,"HPE faces a different set of challenges. He described it as ""an on-premise vendor in an increasingly off-premise world."" IT customers are shifting from servers and storage located on site to cloud computing resources accessed over the Internet.

Shares had been trading above 90 prior to the May earnings release.Other analysts, however, were somewhat encouraged with the company's progress. Justin Furby, an analyst at William Blair, pointed out in a research note that Workday contends it is beating Oracle (ORCL)and SAP (SAP) for business twice as many times as it loses to them.Oracle and SAP are the top makers of business software overall, but both are struggling to transition more business to cloud computing, where users access the software via the Internet as needed, which can save money. Workday in among the leading new breed of software companies that provides their software via the cloud. Besides HR software, Workday has expanded into software that helps companies manage finances.""The win rates are remarkably similar from those discussed two years ago at Rising, although perhaps sliced slightly differently,"" Furby wrote. ""Our discussions with users and partners back up the company's strong competitive positioning and provide us with increased conviction that financials will be a meaningful long-term driver of growth, in addition to international markets and ancillary products.""Another analyst in Workday's corner was David Hynes of Canaccord Genuity, who gave investors the green light to buy Workday shares.

682,ORCL,"Deep in transition, IBM showed its 14th quarter in a row of year-over-year declining revenue, as the company reported third-quarter earnings after the market close Monday. IBM (IBM) logged earnings per share minus items of $3.34, down 9% from the year-ago period but beating the consensus estimate of $3.30, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue from continuing operations came in at $19.3 billion, down 14%. IBM said adjusting for currency and divested business, revenue fell 1%. Currency fluctuations clipped revenue by $1.9 billion.Foreign currency exchange woes have battered earnings, as IBM gets about two-thirds of its revenue from outside the U.S. IBM has estimated that currency headwinds and divestiture will cut approximately 80 cents off its EPS for 2015.IBM lowered full-year EPS minus items to a range of $14.75 to $15.75, vs. previous guidance of $15.75-$16.50. The midpoint for its updated guidance, $15.25, is below the consensus estimate of $15.68.IBM stock slipped 0.8% during the regular trading session Monday and was down 5%, near 141.85, in after-hours trading. That reflects a decline of about 18% since the company last reported earnings on July 20, beating earnings estimates but missing on revenue.IBM has long been in transition, shedding hardware units and realigning its workforce to cut costs as it focuses on growth areas such as cloud computing, data analytics, mobile computing and security — what it refers to as strategic imperatives.Revenue from strategic imperatives rose 17% from a year earlier (27% adjusting for currency and divested business). It is up 20% year-to-date (30% adjusting for currency and divested business), IBM said.IBM said revenue from its cloud computing business rose 45% (65% after currency and divestiture adjustments). In the trailing 12-month period, cloud revenue totaled $9.4 billion.""We've always said our transformation would take time and the transition wouldn't be a straight line,"" said Martin Schroeter, IBM chief financial officer, in a call with reporters after earnings posted. ""We've maintained high levels of investments because we are seeing our strategy is correct and we are getting the returns and growth.""IBM is not alone among tech giants that are transitioning to more advanced business models.""As we have seen with IBM and many of its mature tech brethren (Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco (CSCO) over the past year, growth has been agonizing to come by as these large traditional IT vendors face an Everest-like climb in their quest for success in this ever changing IT landscape,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note prior to IBM earnings.An example of that is the $67 billion Dell will pay to acquire data-storage giant EMC.""These once almighty stalwarts are now scratching their heads trying to figure out the path (or exit strategy) for a renaissance of growth around cloud, big data, cybersecurity, and IoT (Internet of Things),"" Ives wrote.Schroeter said IBM has invested over $10 billion in research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions in the past year.This month, IBM acquired Merge Healthcare, a provider of medical image processing technology, for $1 billion. It will become part of IBM's new Watson Health business unit. IBM also launched a new business unit called IBM Cognitive Business Solutions, based on its Watson computer.IBM said revenue from the Americas fell 10% to $9.1 billion, down 3% adjusting for currency fluctuations and divestitures.

Still, the net worth of the 400 richest Americans climbed by $50 billion to a collective $2.34 trillion.Bill Gates, whose wealth is valued at $76 billion, heads the list for the 22nd time in a row, followed by his friend Warren Buffett, the sage of Omaha and head of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), with $62 billion. Both are worth about $5 billion less now than this time a year ago.Microsoft shares, which are down 6% so far this year, closed up 1.9% on the stock market today.

752,ORCL,"Accounting benefits for phone companies have made some telecom investors scratch their heads, and upcoming revenue-recognition changes for software companies could be the next conundrum.The good news for technology stock investors is that the accounting changes for software companies have been ""effectively delayed until 2018,"" says a Citigroup report. The bad news is that there's a long list of companies that would be impacted.They include: Adobe Systems (ADBE), security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK).Industry ""deliberations"" over the new software revenue accounting standards will heat up in Fall, 2015, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a report. ""Proposed changes are significant and make revenue treatment less conservative,"" he said.Accounting standards bodies FASB and IASB proposed the changes in international revenue accounting in 2014.Pritchard notes that the accounting changes come just as the industry is shifting toward cloud computing's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model and subscription-based revenue, rather than one-time licensing fees.""We see the non-SaaS subscription contracts such as those employed by Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK), CA, Guidewire Software (GWRE), Jive Software (JIVE), Microsoft and Splunk to be most at risk to change, with revenue timing accelerated.""The new accounting rules ""could provide more of an incentive for companies to change contract terms in order to accelerate revenue and achieve quarterly targets, something that current rules make more difficult. Beyond subscription revenue treatment, we also see other proposed changes that could drive more inconsistent allocation of revenue between product (license-appliances) and ratable sources (maintenance support) as well as separation of hosting arrangements from software in certain SaaS arrangements,"" Pritchard said.The accounting changes, Pritchard speculates, could ""make it difficult to compare reported revenue between native SaaS companies (like Salesforce) and flexible SaaS companies (like Oracle and SAP).""In a separate report, Morgan Stanley on Thursday said more than 50 ""pension heavy"" companies have recently changed their GAAP accounting, thereby redefining pension costs, and sometimes eliminating pension costs from adjusted earnings. They include Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), Honeywell (HON) and AT&T (T).Telecom companies have roiled earnings by introducing wireless financing plans for mobile phones. The EIP (equipment installment plans) pull forward earnings by booking equipment revenue on the date of sale. T-Mobile's (TMUS) aggressive Uncarrier promotions started the EIP trend, and AT&T followed. Sprint (S) more recently has introduced leasing plans that boost EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter: @IBD_RKrause.

753,ORCL,"The pressures that have slowed tech growth this year will show up again when Q3 earnings season begins in earnest on Tuesday, when chip leader Intel (INTC) reports.
"
754,ORCL,"The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings-per-share growth to average just 2.4% from the year-earlier quarter. That's despite an expected huge quarter of 32% EPS growth from the biggest company of all, Apple (AAPL).
"
755,ORCL,"Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. At least, that's how it had been. But the 2.4% average EPS growth outlook for Q3 would mark the sector's worst performance since Q2 2013, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
"
756,ORCL,"And if Apple is taken out of the equation, then average tech EPS would be expected to fall by 3.4%.
"
757,ORCL,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, analyst consensus estimates call for earnings per share, typically minus items such as stock options, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see EPS tumble 26%. Excluding the energy section, EPS is expected to rise 2% overall for the S&P 500.
"
758,ORCL,"As has been the case all year, a weak global economy, strong dollar, slow PC sales and the seismic shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector.
"
759,ORCL,"""The tech industry is no longer one of the consistent leaders each quarter, but it's expected to improve going into next year,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.
"
760,ORCL,"But first, the outlook is expected to get worse before it gets better. For Q4, the consensus tech EPS estimate is for a slight decline of 0.3%. That's expected to improve to growth of 6.7% in Q1 2016 and 8.8% in Q2.
"
761,ORCL,"Optimism Vs. Reality
"
762,ORCL,"Analysts, it should be noted, tend to be more optimistic the further out they look. At the start of this year, for example, the consensus Q3 tech EPS estimate was for growth of 12%. That Q3 consensus forecast fell to 9.4% in April and 6% in July, before hitting the current 2.4%.
"
763,ORCL,"""Optimism goes away when reality begins coming into view,"" said Harrison.
"
764,ORCL,"Bill Whyman, an analyst at Evercore ISI, does expect things to improve in 2016, but he says improvements will be weighted more toward the second half. Whyman gave his tech outlook in a conference call with investors on Oct. 5.
"
765,ORCL,"What's missing now, Whyman says, is a powerful tech product cycle or a better economy, neither of which have come into view.
"
766,ORCL,"""We're still stuck in a low-growth world,"" Whyman said on the call.
"
767,ORCL,"Part of what's ailing many big tech companies is what Whyman says is a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing, which has shattered old ways of using technology. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by instead turning to cloud-computing services from such companies as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the new parent company of Google.
"
768,ORCL,"Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from China and Taiwan in order to cut their costs. That trends has hurt hardware vendors such as IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and EMC (EMC).
"
769,ORCL,"IBM is slated to report Q3 earnings after the market close Oct. 19.

The 14th straight quarter is likely ahead, as IBM is expected to report a 12% drop in sales, to $19.65 billion. EPS is expected to fall 9% to $3.34.
"
770,ORCL,"Cloud computing has spurred the growth of software-as-a-service business models, pioneered by companies like Salesforce.com (CRM). The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of handing over hefty fees for some services they don't need. The SaaS model has been disruptive to old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.

774,ORCL,"Among the sub-sectors in the S&P 500 tech group, the application software group leads the field, with an expected average EPS increase of 40%. Adobe Systems (ADBE) last week showed a 93% EPS increase when it reported earnings for its fiscal Q3 ended Aug. 28. But the software company forecast fiscal 2016 sales and profit below Wall Street estimates, and the stock sank more than 5%.

842,ORCL,"The question for Splunk (SPLK) as it nears its Thursday earnings release is not whether the security database software maker can make its numbers — it's whether a positive report will actually help.Like the rest of the market, Splunk stock has taken a beating with the widespread sell-off that started late last week and continued into a volatile Monday.Some on Wall Street worry that Splunk is too volatile itself to ride out the market's current slippery patch.""We believe the tech stocks are in for a major correction and high flyers such as Splunk with lofty valuations will see their multiples compress more than other players in the market,"" analyst Srini Nandury of Summit Research said in a research note issued Sunday. Nandury downgraded Splunk to ""hold"" from ""buy"" and lowered his price target to $50 a share from $84.""Even adjusting for growth and even if the company beats estimates and guides up as we anticipate it will, we cannot foresee how the stock can gain from current levels in the current trading environment,"" Nandury wrote.It's been nip and tuck for Splunk the last month in the stock market. After returning in late July to the mid-70 range — levels not seen since early 2014 — Splunk stock slumped and hovered around the high 60 neighborhood. When the sell-off started late last week, Splunk joined in. On Monday, it touched a 6 1/2-month low at 55.01 but climbed out of the hole and was trading up nearly 2% in the afternoon.While Splunk may be displaying volatility, its fortunes as of right now seem better off than the likes of others in its space such as well-established player Oracle (ORCL). Oracle stock started sliding from the 45 level in mid-June and has continued to drop. On Monday, it was flirting with the 35 range before trying to climb back out. Shares were trading down nearly 2% in the afternoon.Nandury may be looking toward the likes of Tableau Software (DATA), which tumbled in late July despite coming in ahead of earnings projections. Tableau gapped down immediately after reporting its late July earnings and stayed down. But like Splunk, it was climbing back Monday despite virtual carnage on the markets.According to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, Splunk's earnings for the quarter ended July 31 should double from a year ago, to 2 cents a share, while revenue should jump 38% to $140.3 million. The current estimate for the 2016 fiscal year, ending Jan. 31, calls for earnings to increase 56% to 14 cents a share, with revenue climbing 37% to $616.1 million.History suggests that Splunk may come in ahead of those numbers; it often beats the Street. But that may not matter, Nandury says.""We believe many high flyers in the security/infrastructure space are in for a period of volatility,"" he wrote. ""Despite increasing spending directed towards sprucing up enterprise security, we believe Splunk will likely suffer from the valuation compression. To remain at current levels, the company has to not only beat the estimates handily, it should also guide up significantly.""

899,ORCL,"Salesforce.com (CRM) stock surged Friday in the wake of another lauded earnings report for the software maker, as shares defied a broader market downturn.Following Thursday's after-hours earnings report, Salesforce stock jumped at the open on Friday, gaining more than 5% shortly after the opening bell in the stock market today. By midday, though, Salesforce.com stock gave back some gains and was up about 3% near 70. That's after Salesforce stock dropped 5.9% on Thursday.Salesforce came in ahead of forecasts on all fronts for its fiscal 2016 second quarter, ended in July. The company said earnings sans items were 19 cents, up 46% from the year-ago quarter and 2 cents ahead of the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was $1.63 billion, up 24% and beating estimates of just under $1.6 billion. The sales figure snapped a three-quarter string of slowing growth in sales.The company guided to fiscal third-quarter earnings of 18 cents to 19 cents a share, in line with estimates. Revenue is expected to reach $1.69 to $1.7 billion, which would be up 22.5% from the midpoint and ahead of analyst projections of $1.675 billion.While CEO Marc Benioff struck an ebullient tone on Thursday's conference call — dubbing Salesforce's quarter its ""best ever"" — analysts sounded nearly as enthusiastic in their research notes Friday. The maker of customer relationship management software competes with giants SAP (SAP), Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL), as well as rising stars like Tableau Software (DATA), and offers its products and services on the cloud.""In a stock market racked with rising fears about about China, oil or whatever, Salesforce delivered best-in-class revenue growth, a fifth consecutive margin improvement and a nice cash flow upside, which took (operating cash flow) up 44% year-to-date, totaling over $1 billion,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in his research note. He said Salesforce ""remains our favorite large-cap growth stock.""Salesforce gets an 89 Composite Rating from IBD out of a possible 99, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock price gains.Prior to Salesforce's quarterly conference call, there were rumblings on Wall Street that the company may have trouble meeting its own ambitious revenue goals. Benioff wants to be the fastest software company to $10 billion in annual sales and plans to be third of all software makers in overall revenue, behind only Microsoft and Oracle.But some analysts said Friday that Salesforce continued to break through on that front, noting that the revenue gain of 24% was ahead of last quarter's 23%.""Salesforce accelerated (second-quarter) revenue growth to 24% (year-over-year) and 28% in constant currency, despite facing the most difficult revenue growth comparison of the year. Based on the company's accelerating growth and encouraging guidance, we are raising estimates and continue to see upside to at least $80,"" analyst Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities said in a research note.

"
912,ORCL,"Page wrote in a blog post in August titled ""G is for Google"" that he and Brin pledge ""to make sure each business is executing well"" and will break out financials for each group starting in Q4. That's hoped to bring clarity to what analysts see as profits from Google's core operations supporting the company's more speculative efforts.

"
925,ORCL,"At home, the company is striving to fend off rivals for its search business that range from Web portals Yahoo (YHOO) and Microsoft's (MSFT) Bing to e-commerce king Amazon.com (AMZN), which has boosted its own direct search offerings as Google moves forward with its search-based Google Shopping service.

926,ORCL,"Shrinking Desktop Search
"
927,ORCL,"In July 2015, Google controlled 64% of the U.S. desktop search market, down 5% from July 2014, according to analytics firm comScore. Bing saw its share of desktop search rise 5% year over year during that period, while Yahoo's share rose 27%, comScore said.
"
928,ORCL,"Google's dominance is also being challenged abroad. ""Google's share of U.S. search queries remains very high ... but global share fell ... year-over-year to about 55%, as it is yielding share to regionally focused search engines like China's Baidu (BIDU) and Russia's Yandex (YNDX),"" wrote Stifel analyst Scott Devitt in a 2015 Internet Outlook report.

939,ORCL,"IBD gives Google a strong Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99, the third highest in the Internet-Content industry group after online auto sales operation Autobytel (ABTL) and Facebook.Seems like Google just can't stay out of the limelight. During the past three weeks, the world's No. 1 Internet search engine landed in the headlines after formally denying long-standing antitrust charges from European Union regulators that could cost the company up to $6 billion.Its growing YouTube video wing revealed plans to steer into video gaming in a big way later this year through YouTube Gaming, a new stand-alone video site.Mountain View, Calif.-based Google (GOOGL) even said that it will start selling a ""mix and match"" smartphone with easily changeable parts, designed for the global mass market.Then, in mid-August, came the real jaw-dropping news: Google announced a major restructuring designed to separate the company's far-out ""moonshot"" efforts such as driverless cars and glucose-reading contact lenses from its bread-and-butter Internet operations.That significant change, to go into effect later this year, will place Google's search business, Android phone operating system and promising YouTube video unit under the wing of a new parent, Alphabet.The Google search part of its operations will become the biggest single company within Alphabet and will be run by Sundar Pichai, an 11-year Google veteran who headed Android and Chrome before being promoted last fall to direct all of Google's core products.The overarching Alphabet will also have Google vets at the helm.Google co-founder and current CEO Larry Page will become CEO of Alphabet, and co-founder Sergey Brin will be Alphabet's president. They will select and oversee CEOs to run each business.The Noncore CornucopiaThe new structure is supposed to free up the Alphabet parent to focus on nonsearch ventures, including Life Sciences, smart-home service Nest, health spinoff Calico, venture capital wing Google Ventures, fast-broadband Internet service Google Fiber and the hush-hush Google X lab, which is developing delivery drones and other advances.Page wrote in a blog post in August titled ""G is for Google"" that he and Brin pledge ""to make sure each business is executing well"" and will break out financials for each group starting in Q4. That's hoped to bring clarity to what analysts see as profits from Google's core operations supporting the company's more speculative efforts.Some $3 billion to $5 billion in noncore costs could be transferred to Alphabet, Cowen analyst John Blackledge wrote in an August research report.Google stock rose as Wall Street learned about Page's pledge to provide ""Google financials separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole.""However, some observers aren't so sure that a radical amount of transparency will actually materialize.""That is the hope, but I fear that those hopes will be dashed,"" London-based Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor told IBD. He speculated, ""They won't report what people are hoping to see,"" mainly a breakdown of revenues and operating profits for all entities within Alphabet.Google declined comment about what it will reveal beyond what Page said in his blog post: ""We will rigorously handle capital allocation"" and will improve ""the transparency and oversight of what we're doing.""The Alphabet-Google arrangement could also present a new set of problems, Windsor says.""Google has just basically become a conglomerate, (and conglomerates) tend to be slow, inefficient and duplicative,"" he said, adding that the different Google and Alphabet sectors also have the potential to clash over funding and how profit is allocated.""It's ... too early to say that Google's going to become a huge, unwieldy, inefficient conglomerate.

That would give it a 13% stake in the company.Tarena shares corrected 33% from mid-June to early July, and have since rebounded 25% and recovered their 50-day moving average.Tarena notched a net loss of 3 cents a share in Q1 — its first since 2012. Earnings are expected to decline but remain positive in Q2, then jump 55% in Q3. Analyst consensus sees EPS up 31% for the year. It reports Aug. 18.Nord Anglia (NORD) runs 41 international schools scattered across China, Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia. International schools are K-12 private schools generally catering to an international mix of clientele such as corporate executives. Academic standards tend to be high and based on international curricula.The stock rose 68% from its March 2014 IPO to a high in May this year. It has since been in a flat base with a 26.97 buy point. The company reported a 60% EPS gain in its fiscal Q3 period, ended in May. Analysts project a 21-cent loss in the August-ending Q4, but a 104% gain in EPS to 49 cents this year on a 20% rise in revenue to $568.1 million.

984,ORCL,"Tyler Technologies, which bills itself as America's largest provider of information management software and services to local governments, continues to bolster its position with an expanding portfolio of products to meet what it views as reliable demand from the public sector.
"
985,ORCL,"The Plano, Texas, firm's client base of over 13,000 local government offices spans all 50 states, as well as Canada, the Caribbean and the United Kingdom.
"
986,ORCL,"Following the 2007-08 financial crisis and the recession that accompanied it, local governments grappled with tax revenue shortfalls and budget struggles, forcing many to put off investments in new technology. In turn, Tyler (TYL) saw its growth curbed in 2010 and 2011.
"
987,ORCL,"As this happened, aging software and management systems — many of which dated to the late 1990s when governments last made upgrades en masse ahead of Y2K — grew outdated.
"
988,ORCL,"Once the economic recovery took hold, analysts say, rejuvenated local governments moved with haste to address pent-up demand for new technology, bolstering Tyler's fortunes.
"
989,ORCL,"Meeting Demand
"
990,ORCL,"Tyler Chief Financial Officer Brian Miller says the market has settled into a new normal now, one defined by solid demand from a broad customer base. The replacement cycle, coupled with increasing needs for advanced technology and Tyler's ability to sell more of its services to existing customers, creates a long runway for ongoing sales growth, he said in an interview.
"
991,ORCL,"""It's a very steady market with strong long-term opportunities,"" Miller said.
"
992,ORCL,"The company has generated double-digit gains in revenue for 14 straight quarters. Most recently, for the first quarter, it reported revenue of $135 million, up 20% from a year earlier. It posted net income of 59 cents per diluted share, an increase of 38%.
"
993,ORCL,"For Tyler's second-quarter report on July 22 after the stock market close, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 61 cents, up 17%, on revenue of $142 million.
"
994,ORCL,"For the full year, Tyler has guided for revenue of $568 million to $575 million, with EPS of $2.46 to $2.54.
"
995,ORCL,"The analyst consensus is for a little under $574 million in revenue and $2.52 EPS.
"
996,ORCL,"Tyler is a part of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group. The biggest names in the group by market cap are IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), but Tyler is highest-ranked by Composite Rating, with a 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD.
"
997,ORCL,"Tyler's managerial offerings include enterprise resource planning (ERP) for cities, counties and schools — everything from electronic records management to payroll processing — as well as software and systems that automate property assessments.
"
998,ORCL,"Revved Up In The Downturn
"
999,ORCL,"Miller says the company invested in research and development in the aftermath of the recession, pushing for innovation when most competitors pulled back on that front.
"
1000,ORCL,"It has developed faster, more comprehensive and easier-to-integrate systems that are of increasing appeal to local governments that need to replace systems and want to do so with technology that can make them more efficient.
"
1001,ORCL,"Miller says that as Tyler invested in R&D, many of its smaller competitors who ""went the opposite direction"" have since lost relevancy.
"
1002,ORCL,"Miller adds that two-thirds of the local government ERP systems needing to be replaced in the near future were bought from companies that no longer compete with Tyler — creating fertile ground for new business.
"
1003,ORCL,"Another big advantage for Tyler, analysts say, is that it operates in multiple areas of the local government arena, while smaller players tend to be less diverse.
"
1004,ORCL,"This lets Tyler provide more comprehensive services at competitive rates and sell more of its offerings to each customer.
"
1005,ORCL,"""They've really become the standout,"" Benchmark Co. analyst Mark Schappel told IBD, adding that smaller competitors are ""less and less meaningful. Tyler is in the driver's seat.""
"
1006,ORCL,"Miller also credits Tyler's ""evergreen"" program for its software.
"
1007,ORCL,"Under a systems support or subscription agreement with a customer, he says, the client pays small annual maintenance costs, as opposed to dealing with large periodic licensing fees, and in exchange gets regular software updates to stay current.
"
1008,ORCL,"Tyler this year introduced a companion offering, its EverGuide initiative for services and consulting. This should further boost customers' ""upsell likelihood,"" William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research report.
"
1009,ORCL,"Tyler competes with industry stalwarts such as SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL). Miller says that Tyler often wins business over its larger rivals because customers appreciate its focus solely on the public sector —local governments in particular.
"
1010,ORCL,"The Tyler staffers responsible for integrating new technology for customers ""know that business backward and forward,"" he said.
"
1011,ORCL,"Winning Contracts
"
1012,ORCL,"Miller says that Tyler has been consistently posting overall win rates of 60% or better — meaning it beats out the competition at least 60% of the time on the business it goes after — and that is 10% better than prior to the recession. Tyler is generating even higher win rates in certain businesses.
"
1013,ORCL,"The company's courts-and-justice operation is a key example of this, Miller says. Its software helps administrators manage jails, aids police and prosecutors in tracking cases, and connects the three entities to provide efficient case management and records updates.
"
1014,ORCL,"Tyler's Odyssey court-case management system, an electronic filing service, processes fines and generates court documents among other tasks, reducing staffing hours and paper costs for local governments, the company says.
"
1015,ORCL,"Tyler's win rate is ""north of 85%"" in the courts-and-justice business, Miller said. ""We are winning virtually every meaningful deal in that space.""
"
1016,ORCL,"Business has been particularly robust in California. Miller notes that a drawn-out effort to develop a statewide court system there was ultimately scrapped two years ago.
"
1017,ORCL,"It left counties, which had put their own systems in limbo in anticipation of moving under a state umbrella, to hastily pursue upgrades.
"
1018,ORCL,"""That created an accelerated demand,"" he said. ""A lot of the counties had very urgent needs to replace systems.""
"
1019,ORCL,"Courting California
"
1020,ORCL,"Of 58 counties in California, 28 have bought new systems, and Tyler has won 25 of those deals, Miller says. ""I think we've won the last 18 in a row. We clearly have been very, very successful in that marketplace,"" he said.
"
1021,ORCL,"Its clients range from the smallest counties all the way up to the largest, Los Angeles County.
"
1022,ORCL,"The L.A. County contract was valued at $32 million, Miller says.
"
1023,ORCL,"""In our view,"" analyst Ho wrote, ""the courts-and-justice business continues to be a source of significant opportunity for the company.""
"
1024,ORCL,"Tyler's growth plans could include acquisitions, Miller says, adding that the company is ""very disciplined"" on pricing. With no debt on its balance sheet and strong cash flow, he says, it has its eyes open for attractive opportunities.
"
1025,ORCL,"He points to its acquisition of Brazos Technology in May as a good example. Brazos makes handheld electronic devices for police officers to record traffic tickets and accident information. Brazos had generated annual revenue under $10 million. But by pairing its devices with Tyler's broader offerings and larger client base, Miller says, Tyler can boost those sales.
"
1026,ORCL,"He adds that Tyler in recent years has sought out targets of Brazos' size, largely to fill gaps in its service, and has the wherewithal to do larger deals too. That said, Tyler is so confident in its organic growth prospects that it feels no pressure to move urgently on the deal front.

1031,ORCL,"For a tech company, 16 years is practically middle-aged. And with revenue expected to top $6 billion this fiscal year, some might question how much growth is left for cloud and customer relationship management pioneer Salesforce.com (CRM).Top executives steering the San Francisco-based company known for automating all manner of sales functions insist there is still plenty.CEO Marc Benioff and President Keith Block believe that Salesforce will reach the $10 billion revenue mark in record time for an enterprise software company, though no time frame was given.""We also believe we will go from the sixth largest software company to the third largest, surpassing SAP (SAP),"" Block said in an interview with IBD.That would put it third behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL).And it's not just its core business in sales-force automation and customer relationship management, he says.""I think we will be the most relevant technology company in the world in the next few years,"" Block said. ""We will be influencing and advising companies and gaining their trust on how they can change their business model and disrupt the market.""Six Key ServicesSalesforce introduced its first customer relationship management, or CRM, solution in 2000, a year after Benioff co-founded the firm.In addition to its sales-cloud franchise, it now sells five other core services, including recently introduced analytics, community and marketing clouds.The Salesforce1 Platform provides the technology to power its products and lets customers and partners build their own apps.CRM apps allow sales and marketing staffs to record, organize, automate and strategize on customer interactions, using data as a key tool.The company's Marketing Cloud was born out of its $2.25 billion acquisition in 2013 of ExactTarget. It's the fastest growing top-five marketing vendor, Block says, citing research from Gartner.Analytics IntroducedSalesforce is also taking market share while other top-five vendors are losing share, he says.Analytics Cloud was launched in November at the company's annual ""Dreamforce"" conference, which drew 125,000 attendees — ""the largest technology conference in the world,"" Block says.Within two weeks of the Analytics Cloud launch, Salesforce was closing on $1 million-plus deals with several Fortune 500 companies, he says. However, the company has not yet reported sales results.Analytics Cloud lets customers run analytical reports on all digital platforms, including mobile phones and tablets.""In the old world, you go to the IT department to run reports and get the information in three to six weeks,"" Block said. ""They don't provide insights. Ours is all about ... analysis. We put it in the hands of everybody"" to quickly turn ""insights into action.""Though the firm's cloud services are sold to customers of all sizes, Salesforce is transitioning to an ""enterprise-class company,"" Block says.He says it has closed nearly 550 transactions for fiscal 2015 in the ""seven-and-eight-figures,"" about 100 more than last year.""No other cloud computing (company) is closing transactions at this size, scale and volume,"" he said.Driving UberCar service Uber uses Salesforce's integrated platform, which includes analytics, service and marketing clouds to ""power their business,"" Block says.New or expanded client wins in the first quarter, as called out by Benioff in a conference call, included Bouygues Telecom in France, Tyco International (TYC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Expedia (EXPE), Medtronic (MDT) and Western Union (WU), among many others.Salesforce signed a ""major new deal"" with a transportation company — ""one of the world's greatest brands in their category,"" Block said in the call.The unnamed company was using ""on-premise legacy technology from Oracle,"" he said, adding that it plans to put Salesforce1 on mobile devices and ""into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world.""Salesforce's chief rivals in CRM are Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Management pegs its market share in CRM at 41%, making it the No. 1 player.""We created a bow wave, a movement and a market. Others are tying to surf in our wake,"" Block said, adding that the transition for players with legacy technology is like ""turning a battleship in stormy seas.""Salesforce's addressable market for all its cloud offerings stands at around $62 billion, and it's expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 11%, according to Rob Breza, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities.Helping to fuel that growth will be new wins in international markets — especially Europe and Asia, analysts say.Only 26% of Salesforce's revenue in Q1 was generated outside the U.S., a lower percentage than at Oracle and Microsoft. The largest share was in Europe, where revenue grew 28% from a year earlier, in constant currency.Total revenue in the quarter ended in April rose 23% to $1.51 billion. That put it on track to surpass a $6 billion annual revenue run rate ""faster than any other enterprise software company,"" Benioff said in the Q1 report.Operating cash flow jumped 54% to $731 million. Earnings per share rose 45% to 16 cents.Based on robust Q1 results, Salesforce raised its full-year revenue forecast to $6.55 billion, at the high end of its previous range.Management also upped EPS guidance for 2015 by two cents, to 71 cents per share, for a 37% year-over-year gain.In recently initiating coverage on Salesforce with a ""buy"" rating, analyst Breza of Wunderlich Securities noted that billed and unbilled backlog of over $9.1 billion ""should reassure investors"" that the company can sustain long-term growth.Investors drove up Salesforce stock 12% on April 29 after Bloomberg reported that it was fielding buyout offers. Executives at the company have declined to comment on ""market rumors and speculation.""Government Business Ahead?Analysts expect new wins in U.S. government contracts to provide solid growth opportunities in the future.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted that the U.S. General Services Administration is in the early stages of assembling a sizable purchase agreement with Salesforce for CRM products.Salesforce's ""dream"" of achieving $10 billion in revenue is a ""tangible target,"" Murphy wrote in a research note on June 25.The ""customer company,"" he said, has ""blossomed into a true multi-product success story as it now rides atop multiple product pillars of substantial scale and trajectory.""

1032,ORCL,"Cracking the Chinese tech infrastructure market is becoming more challenging for U.S. heavyweights Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard as the cyberspying issue heats up.
"
1033,ORCL,"China's government is discouraging its companies from buying tech gear from large U.S. vendors such as Cisco (CSCO) and HP (HPQ) in the wake U.S. government allegations last year that the Chinese government had sponsored cyberspying on U.S. companies.
"
1034,ORCL,"""They are really pushing harder now against buying U.S. infrastructure products like networking or servers — they have taken it up a notch,"" Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald who toured China in April, told IBD. ""Last year, it was more pronounced, but then in April it was like a full-blown huge initiative.""
"
1035,ORCL,"White says the catalyst for the rift began two years when Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency subcontractor, leaked classified documents about the agency's surveillance activities.
"
1036,ORCL,"""Once the Snowden thing happened it was a validation of the Chinese fear that they were going to be spied on,"" White said.
"
1037,ORCL,"The China government's mandate pertains mostly to areas critical to security, says White, who said he learned of the edict from a well-placed source in China.
"
1038,ORCL,"""Certain industries, like military and government and oil, you have to buy 100% from China-based vendors,"" White said. ""In other industries, they have to hit a goal of 70% in five years.
"
1039,ORCL,"""The guys most impacted, according to my contact, would be Cisco and HP, especially Cisco.""
"
1040,ORCL,"Both companies reported poor results from China in their most recent earnings.
"
1041,ORCL,"Cisco's product orders in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China rose just 1% in its fiscal Q3 ended April 25, vs. the year-earlier period. Minus China, growth would have been 8%, Cisco CEO John Chambers told analysts on the firm's earnings conference call.
"
1042,ORCL,"In HP's earnings call for its fiscal Q2 ended April 30, CFO Catherine Lesjack called the company's networking sales in China during the period ""disappointing."" HP's global networking revenue tumbled 16%.
"
1043,ORCL,"China represents only a sliver of total revenue for Cisco and HP, but neither can afford to be shut out of China too long, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for market tracker IDC.
"
1044,ORCL,"""China has been a growth engine, so it's going to be important for the likes of Cisco and other U.S. companies like HP to be able to find ways to penetrate the Chinese market,"" Mehra told IBD.
"
1045,ORCL,"By 2018, sales of Ethernet switches, a key networking product, in China will reach $3 billion, up 230% from 2014, says IDC. Sales of routers, also crucial in networks, will rise 26% in that span to $2.2 billion, IDC says. Cisco is the No. 1 seller of switches and routers.
"
1046,ORCL,"U.S. sales of switches and routers will be $10.3 billion and $5.2 billion by 2018, says IDC, but their growth rates will be just 14% and 5%, respectively.
"
1047,ORCL,"Server sales in China are seen rising 51% in that span to $9 billion, IDC says. U.S. server sales will hit $22.2 billion in 2018, it says, but that growth rate from 2014 is only 23%. HP is a top seller of servers.
"
1048,ORCL,"China also is soaring in use of mobile devices and networks. In Q1, China added 8 million new mobile subscribers, vs. 6 million in the U.S., says mobile gear maker Ericsson (ERIC).
"
1049,ORCL,"Cisco and HP don't want to miss China's growth in mobile, White says.
"
1050,ORCL,"""The mobile Internet in China will be the biggest in the world and that requires routers, switches and servers,"" he said.
"
1051,ORCL,"China's governmental clampdowns on Cisco and HP helps China vendors Huawei Technologies and ZTE. White says other Chinese vendors also will gain from the boost at home. ""Ultimately, you will have some major IT companies coming out of China that will be global players,"" he said.
"
1052,ORCL,"Huawei in particular is gaining traction, says Mehra.
"
1053,ORCL,"""Huawei in the last five years has become much more of a competitor in the networking market, which was not the case five years ago in switching and routing,"" he said.
"
1054,ORCL,"But HP might have found a way to compete in China.
"
1055,ORCL,"HP's move to sell a 51% stake in HC3, HP's China-based networking, server and storage services company, to Tsinghua University for $2.3 billion last month should give it continued access to China's market, analysts say.
"
1056,ORCL,"HC3 was originally a joint venture of Huawei and 3Com, a U.S.-based networking equipment and security products maker. HP bought 3Com for $2.7 billion in 2010.
"
1057,ORCL,"HP could also leverage the partnership to sell additional products such as wireless networking equipment from its recent acquisition of Aruba Networks, Mehra says.
"
1058,ORCL,"""It could evolve into a cross-selling relationship, then they could OEM all of the Aruba portfolio and sell it under the HC3 brand,"" he said.
"
1059,ORCL,"Other U.S. tech sellers also appear to be hurt by China's political climate.
"
1060,ORCL,"In a conference call to discuss its Q1 earnings in April, EMC (EMC) executive David Goulden said weakness in China was ""due to increased scrutiny of U.S. technology purchases in the government and financial services sectors.""
"
1061,ORCL,"Some vendors, though, apparently see no impact.
"
1062,ORCL,"This month, Israel-based Radware said it would provide its security software for China Railway, to help build its next-generation e-ticketing platform. And in January, Radware inked a deal to provide security software to the Shenyin & Wanguo Securities MU Fund.
"
1063,ORCL,"U.S.-based Oracle (ORCL), the No. 1 database maker, is another seemingly safe, White says.

1064,ORCL,"""Oracle shouldn't have much of an impact because it's tough to replace them,"" he said. ""What are you going to replace them with?""Cracking the Chinese tech infrastructure market is becoming more challenging for U.S. heavyweights Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard as the cyberspying issue heats up.China's government is discouraging its companies from buying tech gear from large U.S. vendors such as Cisco (CSCO) and HP (HPQ) in the wake U.S. government allegations last year that the Chinese government had sponsored cyberspying on U.S. companies.""They are really pushing harder now against buying U.S. infrastructure products like networking or servers — they have taken it up a notch,"" Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald who toured China in April, told IBD. ""Last year, it was more pronounced, but then in April it was like a full-blown huge initiative.""White says the catalyst for the rift began two years when Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency subcontractor, leaked classified documents about the agency's surveillance activities.""Once the Snowden thing happened it was a validation of the Chinese fear that they were going to be spied on,"" White said.The China government's mandate pertains mostly to areas critical to security, says White, who said he learned of the edict from a well-placed source in China.""Certain industries, like military and government and oil, you have to buy 100% from China-based vendors,"" White said. ""In other industries, they have to hit a goal of 70% in five years.""The guys most impacted, according to my contact, would be Cisco and HP, especially Cisco.""Both companies reported poor results from China in their most recent earnings.Cisco's product orders in Asia-Pacific, Japan and China rose just 1% in its fiscal Q3 ended April 25, vs. the year-earlier period. Minus China, growth would have been 8%, Cisco CEO John Chambers told analysts on the firm's earnings conference call.In HP's earnings call for its fiscal Q2 ended April 30, CFO Catherine Lesjack called the company's networking sales in China during the period ""disappointing."" HP's global networking revenue tumbled 16%.China represents only a sliver of total revenue for Cisco and HP, but neither can afford to be shut out of China too long, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""China has been a growth engine, so it's going to be important for the likes of Cisco and other U.S. companies like HP to be able to find ways to penetrate the Chinese market,"" Mehra told IBD.By 2018, sales of Ethernet switches, a key networking product, in China will reach $3 billion, up 230% from 2014, says IDC. Sales of routers, also crucial in networks, will rise 26% in that span to $2.2 billion, IDC says. Cisco is the No. 1 seller of switches and routers.U.S. sales of switches and routers will be $10.3 billion and $5.2 billion by 2018, says IDC, but their growth rates will be just 14% and 5%, respectively.Server sales in China are seen rising 51% in that span to $9 billion, IDC says. U.S. server sales will hit $22.2 billion in 2018, it says, but that growth rate from 2014 is only 23%. HP is a top seller of servers.China also is soaring in use of mobile devices and networks. In Q1, China added 8 million new mobile subscribers, vs. 6 million in the U.S., says mobile gear maker Ericsson (ERIC).Cisco and HP don't want to miss China's growth in mobile, White says.""The mobile Internet in China will be the biggest in the world and that requires routers, switches and servers,"" he said.China's governmental clampdowns on Cisco and HP helps China vendors Huawei Technologies and ZTE. White says other Chinese vendors also will gain from the boost at home. ""Ultimately, you will have some major IT companies coming out of China that will be global players,"" he said.Huawei in particular is gaining traction, says Mehra.""Huawei in the last five years has become much more of a competitor in the networking market, which was not the case five years ago in switching and routing,"" he said.But HP might have found a way to compete in China.HP's move to sell a 51% stake in HC3, HP's China-based networking, server and storage services company, to Tsinghua University for $2.3 billion last month should give it continued access to China's market, analysts say.HC3 was originally a joint venture of Huawei and 3Com, a U.S.-based networking equipment and security products maker. HP bought 3Com for $2.7 billion in 2010.HP could also leverage the partnership to sell additional products such as wireless networking equipment from its recent acquisition of Aruba Networks, Mehra says.""It could evolve into a cross-selling relationship, then they could OEM all of the Aruba portfolio and sell it under the HC3 brand,"" he said.Other U.S. tech sellers also appear to be hurt by China's political climate.In a conference call to discuss its Q1 earnings in April, EMC (EMC) executive David Goulden said weakness in China was ""due to increased scrutiny of U.S. technology purchases in the government and financial services sectors.""Some vendors, though, apparently see no impact.This month, Israel-based Radware said it would provide its security software for China Railway, to help build its next-generation e-ticketing platform. And in January, Radware inked a deal to provide security software to the Shenyin & Wanguo Securities MU Fund.U.S.-based Oracle (ORCL), the No. 1 database maker, is another seemingly safe, White says.""Oracle shouldn't have much of an impact because it's tough to replace them,"" he said. ""What are you going to replace them with?""

1086,ORCL,"Oracle late Wednesday posted fiscal Q4 results that missed analyst expectation as the strong dollar hurt, but executives touted ""astonishing"" cloud growth that they say outpaces that of cloud software rivals Salesforce.com and Workday.Oracle (ORCL) said earnings per share minus items fell 14% from the year-earlier quarter to 78 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 86 cents. EPS ex items would have fallen 5% in constant currency, Oracle said.The Redwood Shores, Calif.-based company's revenue fell 5% for the quarter ended May 31, to $10.7 billion. Analysts had forecast $10.9 billion. Revenue would have risen 3% in constant currency, Oracle said.For the current period, Oracle expects EPS ex items of 56 cents to 59 cents in constant currency, down 8% to 3.3%, and expects sales to rise 5% to 8% in constant currency. Analyst views aren't in constant currency. They expect 61 cents and $8.61 billion.Oracle stock was down 6% after hours, after the company released its results. Oracle stock rose a fraction in the regular session.Oracle is moving to a cloud model, where a company collects monthly subscription fees instead of large upfront license payments. Oracle also is working to increase adoption of its 12c database software, released in 2013, and to resuscitate its hardware business.Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz pointed to strong cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue, in the company's earnings press release.""We sold an astonishing $426 million of new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud subscription revenue in Q4,"" Catz said. ""We expect our rapidly increasing cloud sales to quickly translate into significantly more revenue and profits for Oracle Corporation.""Oracle co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison said in the statement that ""we expect to book between $1.5 and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business this fiscal year.""That means Oracle would sell more new SaaS and PaaS business than Salesforce.com plans to sell in their current fiscal year — the only remaining question is how much more. Oracle's planned SaaS and PaaS revenue growth rate is around 60% in constant currency; Salesforce.com has a planned growth rate of around 20%. When you contrast those growth rates, it becomes clear that Oracle is on its way to becoming the world's largest enterprise cloud company.""Smaller rivals such as Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY) built their businesses for the cloud and provide stiff competition.On a conference call with analysts, Ellison took aim at Workday. ""It's between us — Oracle and Workday — in the midmarket and high end of the cloud ERP (enterprise resource planning software) market, and we are winning big-time,"" he said.On Wednesday, Salesforce.com announced a new version of its Marketing Cloud, adding features.Oracle continues to tout its fast growth in the cloud, but with its total year-over-year revenue growth in the low single digits in most of the last 14 quarters that message isn't carrying much weight, says Daniel Ives, an FBR Capital Markets analyst.""The biggest challenge is that time is ticking,"" Ives told IBD.

The strong dollar is hitting U.S. techs, and the PC industry slowdown is also having an impact.The 2% rise puts tech in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500. It's the weakest growth for tech in nine quarters, as reported by Thomson Reuters. The S&P 500 tech companies' earnings per share growth in Q1 averaged 9.7%.""Tech has slowed down and there are not a lot of strong trends driving industry growth,"" said Gregory Harrison, an earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The S&P 500 tech companies' EPS growth had averaged 13% in the previous four quarters, more than double that of the S&P 500 overall in that span.The overall estimate for the S&P 500 is for a 3% decline in EPS, but that's due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to show a 61% drop. Take out the energy sector and EPS growth for the S&P hits 4.6%, more than double the tech average.'Low-Growth Environment'""We're stuck in a low-growth environment, with only modest improvement expected for the rest of the year,"" said Bill Whyman, research analyst at Evercore ISI. ""Tech investors are always looking for acceleration, but expectations for Q2 and the second half of this year have been coming down.""Besides concerns about the strong dollar, the global economic weakness highlighted by the stock crash in Asia and the near-bankruptcy for Greece are among the reasons that 24 of the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 have lowered their Q2 guidance. Only seven have raised their views.The upcoming release of the Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 10 PC operating system and a new line of microprocessors coming from Intel are not expected to be strong growth drivers. Wearable devices such as smartwatches might be a long-term positive, but that field is just getting under way. The same is true with augmented reality devices.Meanwhile, the seismic industry shift to cloud computing continues to disrupt, says Whyman. That significant technological shift is shaking the rafters of the largest information technology companies, he says.The emergence of cloud computing has shattered old ways of using technology. Companies, rather than buying large volumes of computer servers and storage systems needed for business operations, are instead turning to cloud computing services from Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft and IBM (IBM), among others.Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and China, opting for stripped down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products.That's hit IBM, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO), EMC (EMC) and other hardware vendors.Cloud computing has also spurred the growth in software-as-a-service business models. The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of paying hefty fees for some services they don't need. Old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) have struggled to shift more of their products to the cloud.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.Research firm Gartner said PC shipments fell 9.5% in Q2 from Q2 2014, to 68.4 million units. Gartner also lowered its chip sales forecast for the year, now seeing a rise of just 2.2% this year, to $343 billion. It had been forecasting 4% growth.Apple Suppliers UpbeatThat's a problem for Intel, by far the largest maker of PC microprocessors. After the close Wednesday, Intel is expected to post a 7% drop in EPS to 51 cents a share. Revenue is expected to fall 5% to $13.1 billion. Year-over-year sales were flat in the previous quarter.Some Apple chip suppliers, though, have higher expectations. Avago Technologies (AVGO), which supplies chips for the iPhone and other smartphones, is expected to show EPS growth of 70%. Skyworks Solutions, another Apple supplier, is expected to post 54% EPS growth.Overall smartphone growth is slowing, but not at Apple, which is seeing strong growth in sales of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus line rolled out last fall.Apple reports its June-quarter earnings after the close on July 21. Its expected 39% EPS rise would mark its sixth quarter in a row of double-digit percentage gains. Revenue is expected to climb 33.5% to $50 billion.The slowdown in smartphones, however, is hitting Google (GOOGL) Android phones, which account for the vast majority of overall smartphone sales. Cellphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to show a 34% drop in EPS. Its revenue is expected to fall 14% to $5.5 billion. Qualcomm reports after the close on July 22.The tech trends have been a big issue for IBM, which has sold hardware businesses and has posted 12 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 13th quarterly decline is likely ahead. IBM, which reports after the close on July 20, is expected to report a 14% revenue drop, to $20.9 billion.As the buying and selling of goods shifts online, along with advertising and other services, some companies benefit. Google, which reports after the close Thursday, is expected to show a 16% rise in EPS. Revenue is expected to rise 11% to $17.75 billion, its sixth quarter in a row of double-digit growth.Also reporting that day is eBay, which is expected to show a 4% rise in EPS and a 3% increase in revenue to $4.5 billion.Another beneficiary of the shift to Internet communications and advertising is social networking leader Facebook (FB), which reports after the close July 29. Facebook is expected to post 12% EPS growth and 37% growth in revenue, to $3.98 billion.

1132,ORCL,"Microsoft (MSFT) received mixed reviews for its business road map detailed Wednesday at its Build developer conference in San Francisco.At the conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and other senior executives outlined their plans for the company as it transitions to cloud computing from a PC-centric business. It set a goal of reaching annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business in the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. In the March quarter, Microsoft's cloud business had an annualized run rate of $6.3 billion.Microsoft's Internet cloud offerings include Azure data-center services, Office 365 productivity software and Dynamics customer management programs.Microsoft also set a goal of getting its upcoming Windows 10 operating system on 1 billion devices (PCs, tablets and smartphones) within three years.Both of Microsoft's big goals are achievable, said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle.In a research report Wednesday, Barnicle reiterated his overweight rating on Microsoft stock and raised his price target to 55 from 50. Microsoft fell nearly 1% to 48.64 on the stock market today.45% CAGR The Cloud TargetUBS analyst Brent Thill concurred. In a note Wednesday, Thill maintained his buy rating and price target of 50 on Microsoft stock.To hit its $20 billion goal in 2018, Microsoft's commercial cloud business will need to grow at a compound annual rate of 45%. This ""seems reasonable"" given that it has had seven consecutive quarters of more than 100% growth in the business, Thill said.""We believe their targets show the business getting to more critical levels of scale, where margins can slowly improve from current levels,"" Thill said.Other analysts weren't swayed by Microsoft's projections.Summit Research Partners analyst Richard Williams praised Microsoft's presentations on HoloLens holographic computing, Windows 10 and cloud computing, saying the company ""exceeded expectations."" With all three subjects, Microsoft executives excited the audience at Build ""by proposing to 'change the world,'"" he said.However, Williams still rates Microsoft stock as a hold with a price target of 43.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci on Thursday reiterated his underperform rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 38.""Disruption was a theme of the event, but how much Microsoft will disrupt, vs. how much it will be disrupted, is still unclear,"" DiFucci said in a report.Microsoft could easily meet its $20 billion cloud computing annualized revenue run rate if it made a big acquisition.Salesforce.com (CRM), a leading provider of customer relationship management software, is in play, Bloomberg reported last Wednesday.

1134,ORCL,"Manhattan Associates continues to maintain a firm grip on warehouse management.The enterprise software company late Tuesday reported first-quarter earnings that soundly beat analyst estimates as it staves off meaningful competition from larger rivals Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) and others in the warehouse management software market.Manhattan Associates (MANH) also raised its guidance for the year that easily beat views.Shares fell about 2% in after-hours trading following the earnings news release. During the regular session Tuesday, the stock rose 0.8% to 56.18. Earlier in the day, Manhattan stock reached an all-time high of 57.02.Manhattan has emerged as one of the information technology industry's most consistent players, with year-over-year revenue growth in the high teens and low 20% range over its past five quarters.The company's ability to beat analyst views while maintaining a solid growth trajectory has helped Manhattan's shares soar 38% this year after ending 2014 up nearly 39%.Tom Vandeventer, manager of the Tocqueville Opportunity Fund, began buying Manhattan stock in January 2012.""They have been executing,"" he told IBD.

Revenue of $111.3 million, up 7.4%, beat by $3 million.

1248,ORCL,"Job-hungry and space-guzzling tech companies have driven up real estate values to staggering levels in California's San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley.
"
1249,ORCL,"Now they're rattling other markets — from Seattle to Boston and south to Austin, Texas — as companies stretch beyond tech's traditional enclaves.
"
1250,ORCL,"Where tech expands, real estate values rise, according to residential and commercial real estate experts who have done studies on the sector's real estate impact.
"
1251,ORCL,"One prime tech spillover market is Seattle, where Bay Area carpetbaggers Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), Salesforce.com (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and Dropbox, among others, are extending their reach.
"
1252,ORCL,"'Meaningful Impact'
"
1253,ORCL,"Costs for downtown Seattle office space soared 22% in the 12 months ending March 31, according to global commercial real estate firm CBRE Group (CBG).
"
1254,ORCL,"That was the second fastest pace in office markets worldwide, behind Dublin.
"
1255,ORCL,"""A lot of the tech companies in San Francisco have opened engineering and sales offices in Seattle,"" said Owen Rice, a senior VP at CBRE who is based in Seattle. ""Some have grown tremendously, such as Facebook and Salesforce.com. I'm talking about big tech tenants making a meaningful impact.""
"
1256,ORCL,"In addition, he added, ""Apple (AAPL) is looking for space right now.""
"
1257,ORCL,"On the housing front, demand for homes in Seattle is growing faster than supply, causing prices to rise around 10% from the previous year.
"
1258,ORCL,"""This year almost every single home that goes on the market is getting multiple offers, sometimes 10 to 20 offers,"" said Chad Pluid, managing broker with real estate brokerage and research firm Redfin, which is headquartered in Seattle. ""As you get closer to core areas like downtown Seattle or Bellevue, it gets more competitive.""
"
1259,ORCL,"Demand is being fueled largely by ""the huge increase in tech workers,"" many of them recent arrivals from elsewhere, he says.
"
1260,ORCL,"According to a Redfin analysis of LinkedIn (LNKD) data, the number of tech workers in Seattle climbed 21% in May from a year earlier.
"
1261,ORCL,"Despite rising home prices, Seattle homes are still much more affordable than in the Bay area.
"
1262,ORCL,"The median home price in San Francisco is more than $1 million, vs. $481,300 in Seattle, according to Zillow Group (Z), the online real estate company. And while San Francisco's median rent is $3,995, it's $1,765 in Seattle.
"
1263,ORCL,"""Seattle is becoming a digital technology city,"" Pluid said, but it's still ""an affordable West Coast city.""
"
1264,ORCL,"Still, the kind of wealth created from technology in the Bay area and Silicon Valley is extending to cities across the country — especially Seattle, Portland, Austin, Boston and Denver, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said in a recent blog.
"
1265,ORCL,"""It has already begun to increase the cost of living,"" he said.
"
1266,ORCL,"Take Austin, where the median home price rose 10.5% in the last year to a still relatively affordable $274,000, according to Redfin.
"
1267,ORCL,"""People who come back to Austin after two years feel as though they traveled 20 years into Austin's future,"" Kelman said, pointing to the city's ""new level of prosperity,"" traffic jams and higher home prices.
"
1268,ORCL,"How many tech workers does it take to increase home prices?
"
1269,ORCL,"Redfin looked at hiring trends at Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon (AMZN) as a proxy for each metro area's overall tech hiring growth. It found that for every 1% gain in tech workers, there was about a half-percentage point uptick in home prices above the national rate of appreciation.
"
1270,ORCL,"Tech companies are gobbling up much of the available office space in new tech corridors. In Seattle, they are responsible for ""the lion's share of tenant growth,"" notes a report from CBRE.
"
1271,ORCL,"In the hot South Lake Union district of downtown Seattle — home to Amazon's main campus — only 4% of the 4.1 million square feet of office space is vacant, CBRE's Rice says.
"
1272,ORCL,"If tech companies aren't opening offices for the first time in Seattle, they are expanding.
"
1273,ORCL,"Facebook has signed on for 274,000 square feet of space at Dexter Station, a new office building expected to open late this year or early next in South Lake Union.
"
1274,ORCL,"Facebook started with about 8,000 square feet five or six years ago, Rice says.
"
1275,ORCL,"Not Just Amazon
"
1276,ORCL,"Seattle is the longtime hometown of Amazon and Starbucks (SBUX). Microsoft (MSFT) is based in Redmond, about 15 miles away. And though Boeing (BA) moved its headquarters to Chicago years ago, it left behind aerospace plants in Seattle.
"
1277,ORCL,"Pluid says he's always asked if Seattle's rise is ""all about Amazon."" His answer: ""No, it is not.""
"
1278,ORCL,"""Even though South Lake Union gets all the buzz because that is where Amazon has their major campus, Seattle is also home to the University of Washington and a lot of biotech research and labs,"" Pluid said.
"
1279,ORCL,"HBO, a unit of Time Warner (TWX), has tripled its space in Seattle as it has grown its engineering staff, Rice says. ""As companies look to open engineering offices, there is labor available and it comes at a lower cost.""
"
1280,ORCL,"And because of its urban vibe and outdoor attractions, Seattle is apparently an easy sell for recruiters.
"
1281,ORCL,"""Seattle is a place where the millennials want to live and work. We have a downtown with a strong residential base, and alternative types of transportation,"" Rice said, citing bus, light rail and car services Uber and car2go.
"
1282,ORCL,"""And if you can tell an engineer that you can buy a house for $400,000 in Seattle and it is a million bucks in San Francisco, that's a huge spread.""
"
1283,ORCL,"A home listed in Seattle last month sold in eight days on average, according to Redfin. And 46.5% sold above list price, compared to 37.4% a year earlier.
"
1284,ORCL,"In up-and-coming tech market Denver, homes sold the fastest of any market in the country — a mere five days, Redfin noted. A Redfin broker in Denver said San Francisco-basedTwitter (TWTR) is looking for 60,000 square feet of office space for more than 400 mostly new employees in Denver.

1304,ORCL,"With the honeymoon over for Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, investors are interested to see what kind of house he builds at the storied software company.Wall Street will get a progress report after the close Thursday when Microsoft discloses fiscal third-quarter earnings.For the March quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Microsoft to earn 51 cents a share, down 25% year over year, on sales of $21.08 billion, up 3%. It would be the second straight quarter of declining earnings per share and single-digit sales growth.For the June quarter, Wall Street is modeling EPS of 60 cents, up 9%, on sales of $22.69 billion, down 3%.Nadella, who replaced longtime CEO Steve Ballmer in February 2014, is trying to refashion Microsoft into what he calls a ""productivity and platform company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world."" Under his reign, Microsoft has been making apps for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) Android mobile devices as well as pushing cloud computing initiatives like Azure and Office 365.Microsoft stock reached a 14-year high of 50.05 on Nov. 14 on enthusiasm for Nadella's leadership. But shares trended down for the next two months before diving 9% the day after it reported better-than-expected December-quarter results but gave disappointing March-quarter guidance.Microsoft stock was up 1%, near 43, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Still Windows-, Office-ReliantMicrosoft is navigating a changing information technology world where computing has shifted from PCs to mobile devices and the Internet cloud. But Microsoft is still heavily reliant on Windows and Office sales in the PC market.In the first quarter, worldwide PC shipments fell more than 5% year over year, market researcher firms Gartner and IDC said. Q1 shipments of 68.5 million PCs marked the lowest recorded volume since Q1 2009, IDC said.The release of Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system this summer is expected to provide a boost to PC sales. That new OS is due out in late July, according Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su.Analysts will question Nadella and CFO Amy Hood about the company's prospects during a conference call after the earnings news release. They also will have a chance to question them at a two-hour investor briefing on April 29 in San Francisco, in conjunction with the Build conference.UBS analyst Brent Thill says five core issues need to be addressed to remove lingering investor concerns:1.) What does the Microsoft financial framework look like?2.) Mobile — where do we go from here?3.) How long will the ongoing shift to the cloud take?4.) If PCs and servers continue to suffer, can the Microsoft story work?5.) What gets the consumer business back on track?In a research note Monday, Thill said he remains upbeat about Microsoft. He rates the stock as a buy with a 12-month price target of 49.Microsoft needs to provide more long-range guidance, Thill said. One concern is Microsoft's operating profit margins, which have fallen from 40%-plus just 3.5 years ago to the mid-to-high 20s over the past three quarters.""Looking at Microsoft's quarterly operating margin trajectory vs. some of its large cap tech peers, we see margins have shifted from in-line with Oracle (ORCL) and other software companies, toward more hardware-focused names such as Cisco (CSCO), Apple, and Intel (INTC) — names with inherently lower margin structure,"" Thill said. ""We would like to better understand where the floor is for operating margins.""Investors also want an update on Microsoft's Lumia handset business, which it acquired from Nokia (NOK) in April 2014. Results have been mixed since the acquisition, with Windows smartphone market share mired in the low single digits.Last week, Raymond James analyst Michael Turits reiterated his market perform rating on Microsoft stock. He says March quarter results will be hindered by slow PC sales, foreign currency headwinds and the impact of software sales shifting to the cloud.

1431,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL) is gaining some ground on Workday in cloud HR software, as the legacy software giant continues to transition more toward the cloud.So says Rick Sherlund, an analyst for Nomura Securities, in a research report Friday after attending Oracle's HCM World conference in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. HCM stands for human capital management, the more encompassing name for human resources.Oracle, the No. 1 database software provider, has been transitioning to a cloud software-as-a-service subscription model, where companies pay a monthly fee for the software they use vs. paying larger one-time license fees up front.The cloud model continues to gain in the market, and Oracle has been forced to play catch-up with such cloud vendors as Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY). Both companies are growing fast.HCM software helps companies manage employees, benefits and recruitment.Based on his discussions with customers and systems integrators (SIs), Oracle's efforts to better compete with Workday could be paying off, Sherlund says. He rates Oracle stock a buy.""We came away incrementally more positive after Oracle HCM World, given our conversations with customers and SIs,"" he wrote. ""Interest in (Oracle's) Fusion HCM (cloud product) has picked up over the last six months, with a key Oracle SI partner indicating that Oracle added approximately 580 Fusion HCM customers following the Release 8 product, with maybe one-third, or 150-200, live over the past two quarters.""Oracle's Q3 earnings earlier this month provided more evidence of the company's aggressive push into the cloud.Oracle's cloud revenue is still relatively small, but the company is making progress, Sherlund says.""Our view is that given enough time, Oracle will get it right in the cloud,"" he wrote. ""Workday was written natively for the cloud and is the high watermark for ease of configuration, ease of use and high customer satisfaction.""Our customer and SI checks indicate Oracle is getting better all the time and has the advantage of a broader product line, and it is easier for existing Oracle e-Business Suite customers to move to Fusion in the cloud since this was the design objective.""Oracle stock was down a fraction in morning trading in the stock market today and is down 5% this year after rising 17% in 2014.

1432,ORCL,"Why might Salesforce.com be sold? Decelerating revenue growth and market saturation, analysts say — and also a belief by some that the cloud software pioneer just might be at its apex.
"

"
1436,ORCL,"The company's annual sales have soared from barely $1 billion in fiscal 2009 to $5.4 billion for fiscal 2015 ended Jan. 31.
"
1437,ORCL,"Yet, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth has slipped from the high 30% range to the low 20% range in the past two years, and that lower growth is expected to continue, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. Salesforce is set to release fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Wednesday. The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for revenue from the April quarter to rise 22% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.5 billion.

1441,ORCL,"""There is no double that we are past the peak growth, so does (Salesforce.com CEO Marc) Benioff want to tap out at the top? That's a possibility,"" the analyst said.
"
1442,ORCL,"But as a company gets bigger, smaller percentage growth inevitably follows. And growth will remain solid as it gains traction in new areas such as marketing services and data analytics, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore ISI.
"
1443,ORCL,"""They have a much broader product portfolio,"" Materne told IBD. ""They are just now starting to penetrate the enterprise in a more meaningful way. And you look at their revenue base in international markets and they still have plenty of growth potential there.
"
1444,ORCL,"""I just don't see a huge deceleration in the near term for these guys.""
"
1445,ORCL,"But Koenig says Salesforce's sales team is having some troubles despite the hiring of former Oracle executive Keith Block as company president and head of sales in June 2013.
"
1446,ORCL,"But sales team execution issues may not be the only issue crimping its sales growth, Koenig says.
"
1447,ORCL,"""A bigger factor is simply that while the market is not yet mature, I think it's saturated,"" he said.

1448,ORCL,"That is, many companies still have to move toward the cloud, he says, but Salesforce already might have converted most of the companies that had used older CRM systems from Siebel Systems, an enterprise software giant that Oracle bought in 2006 for $5.8 billion. That had been a key Salesforce target.
"
1449,ORCL,"""That market has been picked through pretty well by now,"" Koenig said.
"
1450,ORCL,"In the past few years, Salesforce has looked to boost revenue by moving into new markets. One of those markets is email marketing services, which it entered via its $2.5 billion acquisition of ExactTarget in 2013.

1451,ORCL,"In October, Salesforce launched a data analytics service that competes with fast-growing Tableau Software (DATA) and others.

1452,ORCL,"The company is also moving into human resource management software, where it will run into Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW), says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.

"
1455,ORCL,"Microsoft ended its March quarter with $95.4 billion in cash. Oracle had $43 billion in cash and equivalents as of the end of its Q3 on Feb. 28.
"
1456,ORCL,"According to Bloomberg, Salesforce hired bankers to review potential bids after being approached by a possible buyer. Contrary to many others, Wood says that company likely wasn't Microsoft or Oracle.
"
1457,ORCL,"""The problem with Oracle's cash or Microsoft's cash is that 90%-plus is offshore,"" Wood said. ""They would have to raise a significant amount of debt to get a deal done or issue a significant amount of stock, and that makes it a much more complex deal.""
"
1458,ORCL,"Wood's educated guess? Google. He says it wants to bolster the cloud services it offers businesses. Google ended Q1 with $65.4 billion in cash.
"
1459,ORCL,"Neither Google nor Salesforce responded to emails seeking comment.
"
1460,ORCL,"Wood, however, says a sale is unlikely.
"
1461,ORCL,"""I think it's a low probability,"" he said. ""The high probability is that this company remains independent. It's too big to be bought.""
"
1462,ORCL,"Others agree.

1463,ORCL,"Size is the biggest hurdle, says Koenig.
"
1464,ORCL,"""It's a very high bar and that is exactly why it may not happen,"" he said, ""but I think anything could happen here.""Why might Salesforce.com be sold? Decelerating revenue growth and market saturation, analysts say — and also a belief by some that the cloud software pioneer just might be at its apex.The No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software became the subject of takeover rumors after a Bloomberg report on April 29 said it has hired bankers to field offers, after receiving an unsolicited buyout offer from an unnamed company.Analysts have since namedOracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) as potential buyers.There are few possible suitors because of the size of Salesforce.com (CRM), which has a market cap near $47.5 billion.The company's annual sales have soared from barely $1 billion in fiscal 2009 to $5.4 billion for fiscal 2015 ended Jan. 31.Yet, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth has slipped from the high 30% range to the low 20% range in the past two years, and that lower growth is expected to continue, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. Salesforce is set to release fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Wednesday. The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for revenue from the April quarter to rise 22% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.5 billion.""I think they are decelerating in terms of new business activities probably faster than people realize,"" Koenig told IBD. ""It's not going to accelerate.""This fiscal year, analysts expect sales growth of 21%, down from 32% in fiscal 2015, 33% in fiscal '14, 35% in fiscal '13 and 37% in fiscal '12.Salesforce.com is sliding out of the high-growth group of tech companies, said a financial analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.""There is no double that we are past the peak growth, so does (Salesforce.com CEO Marc) Benioff want to tap out at the top? That's a possibility,"" the analyst said.But as a company gets bigger, smaller percentage growth inevitably follows. And growth will remain solid as it gains traction in new areas such as marketing services and data analytics, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore ISI.""They have a much broader product portfolio,"" Materne told IBD. ""They are just now starting to penetrate the enterprise in a more meaningful way. And you look at their revenue base in international markets and they still have plenty of growth potential there.""I just don't see a huge deceleration in the near term for these guys.""But Koenig says Salesforce's sales team is having some troubles despite the hiring of former Oracle executive Keith Block as company president and head of sales in June 2013.But sales team execution issues may not be the only issue crimping its sales growth, Koenig says.""A bigger factor is simply that while the market is not yet mature, I think it's saturated,"" he said.That is, many companies still have to move toward the cloud, he says, but Salesforce already might have converted most of the companies that had used older CRM systems from Siebel Systems, an enterprise software giant that Oracle bought in 2006 for $5.8 billion.

"
1480,ORCL,"Aerospike has its work cut out for it with rivals that include FoundationDB, acquired in March by a little company called Apple (AAPL), not to mention longtime database powers like market leader Oracle (ORCL).
"
1481,ORCL,"As an analyst, Goldmacher got to witness several boom-and-bust Internet periods, including the dot-com boom in the late 1990s and the recent flurry of enterprise software IPOs.
"
1482,ORCL,"He recently spoke with IBD about his new company and the changing Internet.
"
1483,ORCL,"IBD: How does the original Internet boom compare with today's market?
"
1484,ORCL,"Goldmacher: In the original boom, the Internet was new and poorly understood. Replicating any business model on the Internet seemed like a great idea. Now, entirely new business models have created the same enthusiasm. Nobody would have ever imagined a Snapchat or an Uber doing brand-new things. Some of these businesses are delivering phenomenal results in dramatic market adoption or actual profitability.
"
1485,ORCL,"IBD: Who is leading the Big Data and cloud markets?
"
1486,ORCL,"Goldmacher: In the data world, you don't have a public company leading the charge this time. You have extremely well-funded private companies like MongoDB, Cloudera, DataStax and Hortonworks (HDP), which was well-funded before going public.
"
1487,ORCL,"In the cloud, Salesforce.com (CRM) kicked down the door and let everyone else through. Now, you have a different lineup of infrastructure players. Oracle, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Sun Microsystems and EMC (EMC) were the four horsemen of the Internet. But they are becoming increasingly marginalized. They have become too big, staid and vested in defending legacy businesses to really innovate and disrupt themselves.
"
1488,ORCL,"IBD: Did Oracle and SAP (SAP) wait too long to adopt the cloud and a subscription-based model?
"
1489,ORCL,"Goldmacher: They had a very deliberate choice to make: ""Do we completely reinvent the business, rewrite the technology and our financials in order to go after this market? Or do we let other people innovate and layer that innovation through M&A?""

"
1492,ORCL,"Goldmacher: It's predicated on M&A. They are getting into some compelling markets, like marketing automation, that are pretty much only being written in the cloud. (But) there will be other parts of their business that will never be cloud or certainly won't be cloud for a very long time.
"
1493,ORCL,"IBD: Is the NoSQL database market a threat to Oracle's relational database market?
"
1494,ORCL,"Goldmacher: It's a material threat. You have more contemporary technology in the NoSQL market at more compelling prices because so much functionality is delivered through open source that it is often free, so you are seeing most new projects being developed in some sort of NoSQL software.
"
1495,ORCL,"IBD: What is the difference between NoSQL and Oracle's relational database?
"
1496,ORCL,"Goldmacher: The major difference is a lot of these NoSQL technologies are more cost-effective and flexible to write applications that can handle the new requirements of the explosion in data.
"
1497,ORCL,"IBD: How does Aerospike differentiate itself from the crowd of NoSQL vendors?
"
1498,ORCL,"Goldmacher: Within NoSQL you have subdivisions. The subdivision we participate in gives you the ability to write and read data to a database very quickly. Because we run in flash (optimized for storing data in flash, or solid-state, drives), you need a lot less hardware, so we are much more cost-effective.
"
1499,ORCL,"IBD: How does Apple's acquisition of FoundationDB affect Aerospike?
"
1500,ORCL,"Goldmacher: It's really exciting for us, because companies like Apple are so innovative around the technologies they use to support their business. By purchasing FoundationDB, they will be able to go from 75,000 servers to around 10,000. It gives Apple next-generation technology to continue to innovate.

1520,ORCL,"Size isn't the be-all and end-all of the business world, although it has its perks. The bigger you get, the more likely you are to score the kinds of deals that can help you get even bigger.Executives at NetSuite (N) can attest to that. The company provides cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and e-commerce services, mainly in the U.S. and Europe.Its products include NetSuite, a platform for financials/ERP, CRM, professional services automation (PSA) and e-commerce capabilities that automates processes across departments; and NetSuite OneWorld, used to manage organizations with different currencies, tax rules and reporting requirements.Clients come from a variety of industries, ranging from distribution and wholesale to computer software, manufacturing, telecom services, retail, financial services and health care.Roughly three-quarters of its business comes from the U.S. Its competitors include tech heavyweights Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Microsoft (MSFT).Technology Growth StoryWhile NetSuite doesn't have nearly the size of those companies, it has grown a lot bigger in recent years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to post $553.8 million in revenue this year. That's up from about $415 million last year and $236 million as recently as 2011.NetSuite has strung together nine straight quarters of 30% or better year-over-year revenue growth — a tribute to its ability to land bigger deals with bigger clients, says NetSuite spokeswoman Jennifer Gianola.While the company used to focus exclusively on small and midsize businesses, it now is signing large enterprise customers.""During our most recent quarter, we had a record number of deals greater than $1 million, and our OneWorld product had a record ASP (average sales price),"" Gianola told IBD. ""These are indications that larger organizations are moving to the cloud on NetSuite.""Big-Company DealsD.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews said much the same thing in a recent report, noting that NetSuite ""continues to gain traction in larger companies domestically.""Andrews cites San Francisco-based home furnishings retailer Williams-Sonoma (WSM), which last year selected NetSuite's SuiteCommerce product as the multichannel retail and business management platform for its global expansion into Australia.Prior to signing on with NetSuite, Williams-Sonoma ""had three different legacy systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce and call-center transactions,"" he noted. ""By utilizing NetSuite as a next-generation platform, it was able to consolidate the activities of four separate brands into a single back-end solution.""Overseas markets hold particular promise for NetSuite, he said: ""Internationally, we believe companies of all sizes can benefit from OneWorld's multicompany, multicurrency functionality immediately, given the more heterogeneous business, tax and regulatory environment.""Condensing In The CloudNetSuite's main selling point is its ability to help clients condense their operations over the cloud, Gianola says. ""The value proposition is looking at companies that really want to run products and services in one system. A lot of product companies are becoming service companies, and we are a great solution for them.""More of those companies are choosing to go with NetSuite over other firms.""(NetSuite) will continue to gain ERP market share in the midmarket from Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and Sage,"" said Jeff Houston, analyst at Barrington Research. ""We also anticipate it will keep moving upstream (to enterprise customers) due to its OneWorld product.""One of NetSuite's advantages is that it already has a cloud-based ERP system, while other players in the field are still developing theirs.""The fact that it takes so long to write/build this type of system speaks to the complex issues legacy software vendors face when competing with effective cloud products,"" Andrews noted.He points out that it took NetSuite about 10 years to build its OneWorld product, and Oracle around eight years to completely rewrite its software for the cloud.Because of this long lead time, Andrews said, investors should be able to find out about potential competitors ""long before they might impact the growth trajectory of NetSuite.""That growth trajectory was on display during the third quarter, when NetSuite logged a 34% year-over-year sales increase to $143.7 million, edging past consensus analyst views. Earnings climbed 22% to 11 cents a share, topping views. It was the fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth.NetSuite reported its Q3 results after the close on Oct. 23. The next day, its shares popped 11% to 103.61. The stock has since pushed higher and now trades near 107.The company signed 360 new customers during the third quarter, and its ASP rose more than 40% year over year. It also had two key product announcements.One of the products, Services Resource Planning, joins ERP and PSA in enabling project-based businesses to run their entire business life cycle — including project management, resource management and time-and-expense management — in a unified solution, according to a note from FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi.The other new product, SuiteGL, ""adds a general ledger component to NetSuite,"" Seyrafi said. ""And later this year, NetSuite will roll out its next-generation user interface.""Meanwhile, NetSuite's $50.5 million buyout in July of Venda, a London-based e-commerce company, gives it a chance to expand its footprint in Europe, Gianola says.""We acquired a a great team of people, a great product and great customers,"" she said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect NetSuite to post full-year EPS growth of 27% in 2014 and 42% in 2015.

1521,ORCL,"After the recession wore down local government spending, the pace has picked up again, releasing pent-up demand for projects that were stuck on the back burner.
"
1522,ORCL,"Tyler Technologies (TYL), which provides information management software and services to local governments, has cashed in on the spending uptick with solid financial growth and major contract wins. On Thursday after the stock market close, the company will join the S&P MidCap 400 index, a bump up from its place on the S&P SmallCap 600.
"
1523,ORCL,"Tyler, based in Plano, Texas, calls itself the largest national provider of integrated software systems and information technology services exclusively focused on the public sector. Its products streamline and automate critical business operations for cities, counties and schools to improve productivity and trim costs.
"
1524,ORCL,"The company's portfolio includes enterprise resource planning (ERP) management, which involves all financial processing of payroll, records management and other processes to run an organization. It also provides systems and software to automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property.
"
1525,ORCL,"On the judicial front, Tyler's Odyssey court-case management system can track case status, process fines and fees, and generate court documents. There's software to help manage jails and case management for prosecutors and law enforcement. And Tyler's public safety offerings provide computer-aided dispatch and records management. 
"
1526,ORCL,"Earnings Powerhouse
"
1527,ORCL,"Tyler has turned out double-digit earnings gains in all but three of the past 16 quarters and double-digit revenue increases for 12 quarters.
"
1528,ORCL,"In the third quarter, earnings climbed an especially brisk 43% year over year to 59 cents a share. Revenue leapt 20% to $128.7 million. That followed a 21% year-over-year revenue gain the prior quarter, which marked the company's strongest increase since Q3 2012.
"
1529,ORCL,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year EPS climbing 38% to $2.09 a share. It would follow a 51% surge in 2013. The analysts expect an 18% rise in 2015 and a 19% gain in 2016.
"
1530,ORCL,"What's been driving Tyler's growth? After seeing slower growth in 2010 and 2011 as budget issues caused local governments to pull back on spending, Tyler is benefiting from improved market conditions, CFO Brian Miller told IBD.
"
1531,ORCL,"""With the economy returning to a better environment — and local governments in many cases have made adjustments to their spending — the market has improved in general over the last couple of years, and we now characterize (it) as normal — not robust or explosive,"" Miller said.
"
1532,ORCL,"Local governments are replacing ""worn out"" systems with new ones from Tyler, he adds. And these purchases are ""nondiscretionary.""
"
1533,ORCL,"""If a system reaches the end of life, it's a fairly high priority to replace it,"" Miller said.
"
1534,ORCL,"Northland Capital Markets analyst Scott Berg added, ""There's some pent-up demand (for ERP solutions) being pushed through the system, and a replacement cycle is underway.""
"
1535,ORCL,"Time For New Software
"
1536,ORCL,"Berg notes that many local governments upgraded their ERP systems for Y2K in 1998 and 1999, and ""they are now hitting a replacement cycle for those 10- to 15-year-old systems.""
"
1537,ORCL,"Overall, the local government software market is growing at a single-digit pace, Miller says. But Tyler, he adds, has been increasing its revenue at about a 20% pace the last couple of quarters, and the growth has been all organic.
"
1538,ORCL,"Miller attributes the company's fast pace to its ""very strong competitive position.""
"
1539,ORCL,"""We're clearly winning more than just our share of new business,"" Miller said. ""We attribute that in part to a significant increase in our spending on product development in 2010 and 2011.
"
1540,ORCL,"""We did it at a time when a number of our competitors were reducing their R&D spending.""
"
1541,ORCL,"He added, ""Today we're enjoying a very high competitive position and very high win rates.""
"
1542,ORCL,"A Deal Sealer
"
1543,ORCL,"In general, Tyler's win rate is in the 60% range, notes Miller, which means that it's selected for over 60% of the opportunities it pursues. The firm has a little over 11,000 installations of its software in the U.S.
"
1544,ORCL,"Berg considers the company to be the leading provider of software systems for local and county governments. He notes that rivals include Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and several smaller, privately held companies, such as public sector software company New World Systems.
"
1545,ORCL,"What sets Tyler apart, adds Berg, is its variety of products anted software applications. And that the products address a variety of segments in the local government market — such as software for school systems and for courts — in addition to ERP.
"
1546,ORCL,"""That's unique,"" he said. ""Everybody it competes against (addresses) only a single segment, typically.""
"
1547,ORCL,"Miller says that Tyler is also unusual among public companies in that it focuses exclusively on the public sector and primarily on local governments.
"
1548,ORCL,"The company's main strength, he says, is its ""deep domain expertise"" while in contrast, rivals such as Oracle serve a lot of vertical markets.
"
1549,ORCL,"""We are much deeper in terms of functionality and features (of our products) than they are,"" he said. ""That's also reflected in our people. In addition to developing and selling software, we perform all the professional services such as consulting and training, supporting the software with our own people.""
"
1550,ORCL,"Management's growth strategy includes expanding the company's presence in larger governments and ""winning bigger opportunities,"" says Miller, noting that Tyler has had a lot of success on that front.
"
1551,ORCL,"The success includes a contract valued at around $32 million that the company landed with the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The court selected Tyler's Odyssey court-case management software to modernize court processes and optimize resources. The contract, announced in June, includes software licenses and professional services.
"
1552,ORCL,"Miller says that in roughly the last 18 months, 28 counties in the Golden State have signed contracts for new court case systems, and Tyler has won 25 of those deals for a total value of about $84 million.
"
1553,ORCL,"Tyler's growth strategy is primarily organic, but the firm does strategic buys to broaden its offerings.
"
1554,ORCL,"One key buy was the 2012 acquisition of EnerGov Solutions, a provider of enterprise permitting, land management, licensing and regulatory software to government agencies. Miller estimates EnerGov's annual sales will double this year from the roughly $9 million in business that it had when Tyler acquired it.
"
1555,ORCL,"Tyler is a part of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, which also includes IBM (IBM),Epam Systems (EPAM) and CDW (CDW). The group ranks No. 17 in performance among 197 that IBD tracks.

1560,ORCL,"Manhattan Associates upgrade
"
1561,ORCL,"Despite its small size vs. giants such as Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), for business software maker Manhattan Associates (MANH) growth won't be a problem, Raymond James said last week as it raised its rating to strong buy from outperform and lifted its price target to 46 from 42.
"
1562,ORCL,"Manhattan's warehouse management software is building momentum as companies modernize supply chain management.
"
1563,ORCL,"It cleared an eight-month cup-with-handle base with a 40.25 buy point on Nov. 13. It's up about 9% since, extended above its 50-day and 200-day averages. Manhattan, which is also on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, hit an all-time high close Wednesday at 43.84.
"
1564,ORCL,"Texas Roadhouse tasty profits
"
1565,ORCL,"The barbecue steak, ribs, chicken and fish restaurant company is known for big portions of food and fun in a comfortable atmosphere. Revenue and profit have also sizzled lately. With gas prices below $2 a gallon in some places and unemployment the lowest in years, the full-service chain is positioned to continue growing.
"
1566,ORCL,"It too sports a 99 Composite Rating. Texas Roadhouse stock moved sideways for most of 2014, but it shot up nearly 6% on Nov. 4, a day after it reported higher earnings and revenue and issued bullish 2015 guidance. Shares rose to an all-time high 34.89 close last Friday.
"
1567,ORCL,"Acorda adding new drugs
"
1568,ORCL,"The specialty drugmaker until recently got 90% of its revenue from Ampyra, a drug that launched in 2010 to help multiple sclerosis patients walk. In late October Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) closed on its $525 million acquisition of Civitas Therapeutics, which has a proprietary drug-delivery technology. Its lead candidate is an inhaler that delivers L-dopa, the standard treatment for Parkinson's disease.
"
1569,ORCL,"Acorda is another stock that bounced around most of 2014. But after four quarters of double-digit sales and profit growth, it took off on Sept. 22, and has risen 47% since to close at a new high 44.23 Tuesday before consolidating on Wednesday.
"
1570,ORCL,"Impax Labs on the hunt
"
1571,ORCL,"Another small specialty drugmaker making waves is Impax Laboratories (IPXL). It's growing fast via acquisitions. In October it announced its latest purchase, Tower, which it bought from RoundTable Healthcare for $700 million. At an analyst conference in San Francisco Tuesday, CEO G. Frederick Wilkinson said the company is ""aggressively hunting"" for new acquisitions.
"
1572,ORCL,"Impax climbed nearly 12% on Jan. 8 after it announced FDA clearance for Rytary, an extended-release oral medicine to treat Parkinson's. Showing unusual strength, it didn't consolidate after that and has closed higher the last seven sessions in a row, at a fresh high of 37.15 Wednesday.

"
1583,ORCL,"Ellison will step down as CEO after 37 years, Oracle (ORCL) said after Thursday's market close. Co-Presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd will become co-CEOs. They'll still report to Ellison, who becomes chairman and chief technology officer.

"
1585,ORCL,"But the tech giant itself hasn't been doing that well. Oracle said late Thursday that fiscal Q1 earnings rose just 5% vs. a year earlier to 62 cents a share minus items. Revenue climbed 3% to $8.6 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of 64 cents on sales of $8.77 billion.

It is making a tough conversion from collecting large payments for licenses to its data base and other software products to the cloud where that version of its software is sold on a monthly subscription. Oracle is also waiting for a wider customer adoption of its 12c database software released more than a year ago while hoping for better returns from its hardware products.

""The reality is they were late to the cloud and (Ellison) is leaving at a time when Oracle is struggling to get this thing moving in the right direction.""

1604,ORCL,"""They are ramping; we are not anywhere near peak adoption yet,"" he told IBD. ""It should start to help by November.""
"
1605,ORCL,"Oracle also posted year-over-year growth declines across its hardware portfolio. Revenue from hardware systems fell 8% to $1.16 billion. Related services revenue fell 7% to $855 million.
"
1606,ORCL,"Oracle is hoping for growth from its engineered systems that includes its software in one package, White says.
"
1607,ORCL,"""The point they are focused on is engineered systems,"" he said. ""That is the key; that is only a piece of the hardware but it's a piece that growing very rapidly.""Oracle's future remains cloudy, and going forward the business software giant won't have Larry Ellison at the helm.Ellison will step down as CEO after 37 years, Oracle (ORCL) said after Thursday's market close. Co-Presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd will become co-CEOs. They'll still report to Ellison, who becomes chairman and chief technology officer.""I am going to continue doing what I have been doing over the last several years and they are going to continue what they have been doing over the last several years,"" Ellison said on a conference call with analysts.But the tech giant itself hasn't been doing that well. Oracle said late Thursday that fiscal Q1 earnings rose just 5% vs. a year earlier to 62 cents a share minus items. Revenue climbed 3% to $8.6 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of 64 cents on sales of $8.77 billion.Oracle also gave cautious guidance for Q2: EPS of 66-70 cents while sales are flat to up 4%. Wall Street had forecast 74 cents and revenue up nearly 5%.Oracle also announced a $13 billion stock buyback, about 7% of shares outstanding.That may have limited losses, but the stock still fell 2% in after-hours trading. It closed the day up 1% to 41.55.Still Chasing CloudsOracle is clearly in a transition mode. It is making a tough conversion from collecting large payments for licenses to its data base and other software products to the cloud where that version of its software is sold on a monthly subscription. Oracle is also waiting for a wider customer adoption of its 12c database software released more than a year ago while hoping for better returns from its hardware products.Oracle has now posted 12 consecutive quarters of single-digit sales gains or outright declines.""It has been a very rocky road for the company in the last few years in terms of consistent growth and getting the top line back to the point where investors start to buy back into a reaccelerating growth story,"" Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets. ""The reality is they were late to the cloud and (Ellison) is leaving at a time when Oracle is struggling to get this thing moving in the right direction.""Oracle's biggest challenge is its move to the cloud where it's competing with giants such as SAP (SAP) as well as smaller, faster-growing rivals such as Workday (WDAY) and Tableau Software (DATA).SAP ConcursSAP stepped up its cloud capabilities late Thursday, with an $8.3 billion, $129-a-share deal to buy Concur Technologies (CNQR), a maker of cloud-based expense accounting software.But Oracle's size and skill shouldn't be underestimated, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""They are No. 1 in database and middleware and No. 2 in enterprise applications and they have got this strategy of engineering hardware and software together — that is very compelling and no one else can do it,"" he said.""We are focused on becoming No. 1 one in the cloud ... and to do that we need to increase our growth rate and that is exactly what we are doing,"" said Ellison on the call.Software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue rose 32% to $337 million. Infrastructure-as-a-service revenue climbed 26% to $138 million.But still a sliver of overall revenue.Revenue from software license updates and product support grew 7% to $4.73 billion. New software license revenue fell 2% to $1.37 billion.Total software and cloud revenue leapt 6% to $6.57 billion.Oracle's 12c will likely be a catalyst for revenue growth, but not yet, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.""They are ramping; we are not anywhere near peak adoption yet,"" he told IBD.

1685,ORCL,"Paycom opened five new sales offices in Q1, for 35 in total, all in the U.S. Paycom hires a lot of recent college graduates, with some work experience under their belts, and then trains them, Macdonald says.
"
1686,ORCL,"Pricing is based on the number of customers' employees and the number of apps utilized. Davis figures that Paycom would get $20 per month per employee if all its apps were utilized, up from a starting point of around $10 or less per month. However, that could take some time.
"
1687,ORCL,"""Right now it's a race to see who can get the customers,"" he said. ""It's like an open field and everyone is trying to get as many customers as they can. Once you land them they are sticky because it's a pain to switch.""

"
1700,ORCL,"DiFucci notes that some investors are concerned about the impact of low oil prices on employment in some of Paycom's mature offices in oil-patch markets.
"
1701,ORCL,"But in a Q4 conference call on Feb. 10, CEO Richison said Paycom had not seen any impact from changes in the oil price.Employees are required to work, but they also make work for their employers, who need to process payrolls, comply with regulations, track and dispense benefits and programs — and more.Enter the outsourcers. As more companies decide to put all the data and technology that goes into human resources management on the Internet or ""cloud,"" opportunities are rising for nimble providers of cloud-based solutions.One of the fastest growing of these so-called human-capital management, or HCM, cloud providers is Paycom Software (PAYC). It helps businesses automate and manage what it calls the ""complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement.""Founded in 1998 by CEO Chad Richison, Paycom has diversified from its roots in payroll processing into a broader range of HCM applications.Since the company went public in April 2014 at an offering price of 15, its stock has more than doubled. Revenue last year soared 40% to $151 million.Working New AnglesA majority of Paycom's revenue still comes from payroll processing. But now payroll is a starting point: the firm upsells customers higher-margin HCM products that handle such things as talent acquisition and time and labor management.In December, Paycom launched a new ""dashboard"" to its existing compliance solution on the Affordable Care Act to navigate the new employer mandate that went into effect in January. Earlier this year Paycom rolled out a new ""learning management"" system.Paycom targets midsize companies with employees of 50 to 2,000. But some customers are larger, including three added in the fourth quarter. One longer-standing client employs more than 8,000.Paycom's services are delivered as a single software-as-a-service application, making use of a single, multi-tenant database. It's a relatively low-cost solution but one that still allows for decent returns, analysts say.""A lot of SaaS companies of this size are losing money. This company is making money, though not much,"" said Jim Macdonald, an analyst with First Analysis Securities.Small as that profit is, it is growing. In Q4, the company earned $3.1 million, or 6 cents per share, vs. a slight loss a year earlier.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q1 earnings of 8 cents a share, up from 3 cents a year earlier. They see a 47% gain in full-year earnings to 28 cents on a per-share basis, up from 19 cents in 2014.In contrast, Paylocity (PCTY), which is viewed as Paycom's closest like-kind rival, has mostly logged quarterly losses, though revenue is growing at a fast clip.Revenue in Paycom's fourth quarter jumped 45% year-over-year to $44 million, the highest percentage gain in a long string of strong double-digit increases. Analysts expect revenue to climb another 31% this year to $197.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Sales People And SoftwareMuch of Paycom's success has to do with its integrated software, says Richard Davis, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity.""But in the end a lot of it has to do with paying attention to customers,"" Davis said. ""It's good software with very good sales people.""The (sales reps) at Paycom are hustling. They're out knocking on doors. It's as old fashioned as any American business out there.""Racing For CustomersPaycom opened five new sales offices in Q1, for 35 in total, all in the U.S. Paycom hires a lot of recent college graduates, with some work experience under their belts, and then trains them, Macdonald says.Pricing is based on the number of customers' employees and the number of apps utilized. Davis figures that Paycom would get $20 per month per employee if all its apps were utilized, up from a starting point of around $10 or less per month. However, that could take some time.""Right now it's a race to see who can get the customers,"" he said. ""It's like an open field and everyone is trying to get as many customers as they can. Once you land them they are sticky because it's a pain to switch.""Companies typically switch payroll/HCM vendors every five to 10 years, he says.At the end of 2014, Paycom served more than 12,000 clients and stored data for around 1.6 million of their employees.Its high customer retention rate — steady lately at 91% — is ""more reflective of an enterprise customer base and demonstrates the strategic value of Paycom's solutions,"" Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a research note.Another successful cloud-focused firm is Ultimate Software (ULTI), which saw revenue rise 23% in 2014 to $505.9 million.Not to be left behind, much bigger incumbents with legacy technology are expanding into cloud solutions.

Long-time directors Dave Marquardt and Dina Dublon have chosen not to seek re-election and will retire at the end of their current terms after Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting.The quarterly payout will rise from 28 cents to 31 cents.

IBD at the time reported speculation that Ballmer's exit could spur higher Microsoft dividends.Microsoft's raised dividend works out to an annualized yield of 2.65%, up from 2.4%. That's still below Cisco Systems' (CSCO). Cisco boasts a 3% yield. The networking giant has a higher dividend yield than other big-cap techs, including Apple (AAPL), IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL).

1711,ORCL,"Before founding software company Veeva Systems in 2007, Peter Gassner was certain of two things.He wanted the technology to be cloud-based and to address critical issues for a specific industry. He decided to focus on life sciences.""We could have picked something else, like oil and gas. But that's the one we picked. For one thing, it's a big industry and I like big industries. I knew there was a massive need for good cloud solutions,"" he told IBD.Turned out to be a good idea —Veeva (VEEV) is one of the most successful cloud-based software companies around. Not only has revenue been growing in double digits, it's also profitable.""Cloud companies are usually growing but not usually profitable,"" said Gassner, who is Veeva's CEO. ""We know who we are making products for. It's not a guessing game. So we can have lower sales and marketing costs.""It helped that co-founder and president Matt Wallach built the life science business at Siebel Systems, since acquired by Oracle (ORCL).""He had relationships with all these pharmaceutical companies and said, 'Here's a better version,'"" said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. ""A lot of (Veeva's) business is replacing old Siebel systems.""Building SteamVeeva has more than 200 pharmaceutical and biotech customers. They include more than 30 of the 50 largest drug companies worldwide, and range from drug giants such as Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly (LLY) to emerging biotech outfits.One of Veeva's customers is Gilead Sciences (GILD), the maker of Hepatitis-C wonder drugs. Gilead has been buying more products from Veeva as it grows and expands worldwide, Gassner says.With plenty of customers, Veeva keeps expanding coverage, or users, in those companies and selling them more add-on modules.""That is driving growth and it is why Veeva has high margins,"" Barnicle said. And ""unlike Salesforce.com (CRM), they don't have to grab new customers. They're going to the same customer and selling them more.""Gassner has key contacts from a past employer. He was senior VP of technology at Salesforce.com, charged with building its software-as-a service, or SaaS, platform.CRM Software Drives RevenueVeeva's core Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, software is built on the Salesforce.com platform.""Veeva is Salesforce.com's preferred partner for pharma and biotech,"" Gassner said. ""We are a sales channel for Salesforce.com and a partner.""CRM software accounts for about 90% of Veeva's revenue, which is expected to top $300 million this year.According to research firm Gartner, CRM software revenue worldwide grew in double digits in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, vertical or industry-specific software comprised the largest segment of the enterprise software market, at $107 billion, or 26% of the total.Most of that software is still focused on client servers rather than the cloud, or Internet, Gassner says. ""We're bringing it from client servers to the cloud. There's tremendous opportunity and we're just at the early stage of it.""Veeva's revenue in fiscal 2013 grew 111% to $129.5 million and 62% in to $210.2 million in fiscal 2014, which ended in January.Revenue in the second quarter, which ended July 31, rose 53% to $75.7 million.Net income in the quarter jumped 69% to $12.4 million, or 9 cents per share. Though the company went public in October 2013, it figured EPS in the earlier period amounted to the equivalent of 6 cents a share.Veeva's stock is up more than 40% from its IPO price of 20. After rising at first, shares dipped to 17 in May. But they rebounded sharply after Q2 results were announced on Aug. 28. That day, the company raised its forecast for the full year to $300-$303 million from $277-$282 million previously.Per-share earnings guidance for the year was upped to 30-31 cents from 26-28 cents. Analysts expect Veeva's earnings to come in at 31 cents, for a 35% gain over last year. They see growth of 23% and 32% the next two years, according to Thomson Reuters.Managing Clinical TrialsManagement said the firm made ""great progress"" in the quarter on a second product category called Veeva Vault.Veeva built its own infrastructure for Vault, which focuses on content management for processes such as clinical trials, quality management, manufacturing and sales and marketing.More than 10 new Vault customers were added in Q2, including the second top-10 drug company that signed on for Vault's clinical trial product.""It's the fastest part of the business,"" Barnicle said of Vault. Similar to how Veeva's CRM software replaces Siebel's, Vault is replacing the ""old content management systems"" used in life sciences, Barnicle says.Tracking More DataVeeva's third and newest product line is called Network, a cloud-based solution integrated into the firm's CRM platform to help customers track data on their health care customers.William Blair analysts estimate that Vault and Network offerings could expand Veeva's market opportunity from roughly $700 million to as much as $3.8 billion. The upper target was based on expansion potential of its Network database to other regions of the world beyond the U.S. and China.Veeva's largest market is in the U.S., followed by Western Europe and Asia — especially China and Japan.William Blair analysts expect Veeva's revenue to reach $1 billion by the end of 2020.Veeva is far from the only company offering health care-specific technology. But the William Blair analysts said in their recent initiation report on Veeva that the ""vast majority"" offer on-premises products or use an isolated or single-client hosting model.""We believe these legacy vendors will lose the innovation, speed to market and price battles,"" they wrote.One chief rival is Cegedim, a global tech and services firm focused on health care. Cegedim's CRM business is being acquired by IMS Health (IMS). William Blair estimates that around 40% of Cegedim's seats use on-premises technology.Gassner sees the pending acquisition as a positive for Veeva. ""There will be disruption and we will benefit from that,"" he said.

1769,ORCL,"A better asset than knowledge? The ability to learn. How strivers always seek:• Keep up. What you knew yesterday may not apply tomorrow, thanks to quickly advancing technologies like the Internet of Things and smart robots.""It's going to shorten the shelf life of knowledge,"" said Edward Hess, author of ""Learn or Die.""A company's operational excellence and ability to innovate depend on savvy thinking.""Being smart is not knowing everything anymore. It's knowing how to learn,"" Hess told IBD.• Stay open. Intuit (INTU), one of a handful of companies that Hess studied, has taken an aggressive approach to becoming a learning organization. To boost thinking, the software firm launched a ""Design for Delight"" approach to innovation in 2007. It emphasizes being open-minded, exploring options and experimenting rapidly.Last year, Intuit founder Scott Cook urged staffers to ponder: ""Surprises happen, and sometimes that is the market speaking out to you, telling you something you didn't know.""• Mix it up. We're conditioned to look for similarities and make connections. ""We're not trained to look for aberrations or anomalies,"" Hess said. But that's exactly what you should do for insight. He likens the process to taking a puzzle apart and putting together pieces that don't fit. Innovation comes from ""connecting things in different ways.""• Predict downfalls. How about theoretically killing off your company? That's what's done with a premortem model of thinking.""The easiest way to do this is to write a corporate obituary of the death and demise of XYZ company,"" Hess said. By predicting failure, you better grasp what could go wrong and how to recognize warning signs. ""You have created some memory traces. You'll be more likely to see these things coming.""• Take a moment. ""So much of learning is about slowing down to think ... and listening without ego,"" Hess said. Before proceeding with a plan, smart executives pause to visualize how it will go. ""They ask: What doesn't feel right?""Called a recognition-primed decision model, this approach makes time for chiefs to notice red flags.• Replay it. For another way to cogitate, Hess recommends the Army's After-Action Review.It prompts soldiers post-mission to ask what happened, what didn't work, what worked well, what could be done better. For professionals, ""it should be standard procedure every day,"" Hess said.• Start from zero. ""Why are you often at your best when you are new to an undertaking, doing something for the first time?""Author Liz Wiseman posed that question in ""Rookie Smarts: Why Learning Beats Knowing in the New Game of Work.""Newbies realize that they don't know enough. Wiseman lived that phenomenon at Oracle (ORCL) as a young executive charged with building a corporate university.With little direction and no grand vision, she talked to anyone who would help close her knowledge gap. ""Mine was a humility born of desperation,"" she wrote.• Step lightly. What did Wiseman learn from that successful effort?Lacking knowledge and experience, rookies are open to exploring new concepts.They benefit from taking the hunter-gatherer approach: seeking out experts and gaining their insights.Unsure of the correct path forward, smart pioneers take small, calculated steps and pause to make sure they're on track.

Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.

1812,ORCL,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
1813,ORCL,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
1814,ORCL,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
1815,ORCL,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!

1817,ORCL,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
1818,ORCL,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
1819,ORCL,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.

1821,ORCL,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
1822,ORCL,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
1823,ORCL,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
1824,ORCL,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
1825,ORCL,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
1826,ORCL,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
1827,ORCL,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
1828,ORCL,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
1829,ORCL,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
1830,ORCL,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
1831,ORCL,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
1832,ORCL,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
1833,ORCL,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
1834,ORCL,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
1835,ORCL,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
1836,ORCL,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
1837,ORCL,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
1838,ORCL,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
1839,ORCL,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
1840,ORCL,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
1841,ORCL,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
1842,ORCL,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
1843,ORCL,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
1844,ORCL,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
1845,ORCL,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
1846,ORCL,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
1847,ORCL,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
1848,ORCL,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
1849,ORCL,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
1850,ORCL,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
1851,ORCL,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
1852,ORCL,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
1853,ORCL,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
1854,ORCL,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
1855,ORCL,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
1856,ORCL,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
1857,ORCL,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
1858,ORCL,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
1859,ORCL,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
1860,ORCL,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
1861,ORCL,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
1862,ORCL,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
1863,ORCL,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
1864,ORCL,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
1865,ORCL,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
1866,ORCL,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
1867,ORCL,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
1868,ORCL,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
1869,ORCL,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
1870,ORCL,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
1871,ORCL,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"
1872,ORCL,"And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.
"
1873,ORCL,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!IBD: And at Fidelity?Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value.

1875,ORCL,"Apple (AAPL) could quadruple its total addressable market over the next five years as it expands into new markets, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a bullish research report Monday.Huberty reiterated her outperform rating on Apple stock and raised her price target to 160 from 133. She said Apple needs to be evaluated as a ""platform company,"" rather than a tech hardware firm.Other tech platform companies include Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), she said.Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) also fit that bill, she points out.Apple stock was flat, near 128, in afternoon trading on the stock market today but is up more than 15% this year, boosted by a strong holiday-quarter earnings report. Apple stock hit a 119.85 buy point, out of a flat base, on Jan. 29.""Apple has the world's most valuable technology platform,"" she said. Apple customers are loyal and willing to pay a premium for its products, Huberty said. They also spend at least twice as much on digital downloads as owners of Google Android-based devices, she said.""A strong platform becomes a virtuous cycle, as many users buy multiple devices ('halo effect') and more software and services, which in turn attracts more developers, merchants and partners,"" Huberty said. ""This improves the whole ecosystem, which helps Apple attract and lock in new users.""Apple's current products and services address user needs in about 33% of their day, but that could increase to 75% as it enters new categories like cars and TVs, she said.""Our analysis of how users spend their time suggests cars, TVs and health are significant opportunities that Apple will attack in coming years,"" Huberty said. ""Americans over 15 years old on average spend 5% of their time traveling, most in private cars in our estimate. As autonomous cars come to market in the next 5 years ... this time will become available to consume and create content and services.""Cars could become the fourth screen, after PCs/tablets, smartphones and TVs. Similarly, Americans spend 12% of their time watching TV, and another 40% sleeping and 7% eating and exercising, activities which can be addressed with TV and wearable products.""Apple's total addressable market could reach $3.4 trillion by 2020, vs. $800 billion today, she said.""We see the potential for Apple to quadruple its total addressable market (TAM) over the next five years,"" she said. ""While the largest opportunities — TV and autos — are further out, we see Apple expanding its TAM near term with Apple Watch and services, like Apple Pay and streaming music.""The success of Apple Watch will be key to convincing investors of the platform story and TAM expansion opportunity, Huberty said.After Apple Watch, the company is likely to bolster its services offerings with a new subscription streaming music service, Huberty said. Streaming music could add $6 billion in services revenue and nearly $1 billion in operating income, she said.

1880,ORCL,"Hewlett-Packard going splitsville could lead to a marriage down the road to EMC or some other suitors.
"
1881,ORCL,"The computer giant early Monday said it would split into two separate companies, one focused on PCs and printers and the other on products and services for companies and other enterprises.
"
1882,ORCL,"While each company individually would still be huge, at more than $50 billion in annual sales, cleaving HP (HPQ) into two halves clearly could help facilitate a sale, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.
"
1883,ORCL,"HP reportedly had merger talks with storage systems leader EMC (EMC) earlier this year.

1884,ORCL,"EMC wouldn't want the PC or printer business, says White, ""so now they have the flexibility"" to acquire the enterprise business.

1905,ORCL,"That could help a possible sale of that business, says analyst Kreher. ""The PC environment has improved markedly in the last 12 months,"" he said.Hewlett-Packard going splitsville could lead to a marriage down the road to EMC or some other suitors.The computer giant early Monday said it would split into two separate companies, one focused on PCs and printers and the other on products and services for companies and other enterprises.While each company individually would still be huge, at more than $50 billion in annual sales, cleaving HP (HPQ) into two halves clearly could help facilitate a sale, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.HP reportedly had merger talks with storage systems leader EMC (EMC) earlier this year.EMC wouldn't want the PC or printer business, says White, ""so now they have the flexibility"" to acquire the enterprise business.Enterprise M&A More LikelyThe enterprise group is the more likely takeover candidate, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities. ""Enterprise is where the M&A activity is going to occur, vs. the PCs and printing segments,"" he told IBD.Others agree.""The enterprise segment would likely be the first to go,"" said Bill Kreher, an analyst for Edward Jones. ""I think EMC is a takeover candidate, given the rumors of HP and EMC's discussions earlier this year.""HP's combination hardware-software products that compete with rivals such Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) offer upside for EMC, says Kreher.""If (EMC is) going to go with these more integrated solutions, then HP has an offering for basically every technology that is available, whether it's storage or hardware or networking,"" he said.HP plans to complete the split by Oct. 31, 2015, the end of its next fiscal year.HP stock, which touched a 40-month high of 38.25 on Sept. 4, rose 4.7% Monday, to 36.87.The company is midway through a five-year restructuring effort launched by then-new HP CEO Meg Whitman in May 2012, with the goal of reigniting HP growth. Hurt by slowing sales in its printer business, which had been its longtime profit center, HP's year-over-year revenue fell 11 consecutive quarters before the company eked out a 1% rise last quarter.Whitman had long advocated keeping the company together, and she was brought in shortly after a brief, failed attempt to sell the PC business. Enterprise rival IBM (IBM) had sold off its PC business to China's Lenovo a decade ago.Divide And ConquerNow, Whitman says the situation has changed. In a conference call Monday with analysts, she said the split would help efforts to reaccelerate growth.""Separating into two companies will enable each management team to have a sharper focus on the opportunities that the different markets represent,"" she said. ""We think it is the right time to be able to do this.""The move follows a similar announcement last week from eBay (EBAY), to spin off its PayPal online payment services unit into a separate company.

Earnings are due Nov. 5 after the close.The fast-growing, multibillion-dollar data analytics software market is a crowded space, and Tableau Software (DATA) is smack dab in the middle of it.According to a recent report from market tracker IDC, global sales of business analytics software are expected to reach $59.2 billion in 2018, up 57% from 2013.Tableau is regarded as one of the leaders in data analytics and visualization software, holding its own against mounting competition from Salesforce.com (CRM), IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL), among others.Earlier this month, Salesforce.com announced its Wave data analytics software. In September, IBM announced a new visual data analytics software product.Tableau was founded in 2003 by Christian Chabot and two Stanford computer scientists. Goldman Sachs brought the company public 10 years later at 31 a share.In the second quarter, earnings surged 400% from a year earlier, and sales rose 82% to $90.7 million. International sales still make up a relatively small portion of total revenue but rose 100% in the second quarter.Alongside its strength in international markets, Tableau is making inroads in the enterprise market. In the second quarter, the company closed 157 sales orders greater than $100,000. It also added more than 2,200 new customer accounts in the quarter.Fund sponsorship is solid. Two top-performing Fidelity funds had a position at the end of the third quarter: Fidelity Magellan Fund and Fidelity OTC Portfolio .Chartwise, Tableau is still deep inside a long consolidation that started in late February. However, the stock has been consolidating gains for just over six weeks. Aggressive investors might consider a buy point of 78.52, 10 cents above its Sept. 12 intraday high. A hefty amount of overhead supply, though, remains.Shares closed Monday at 77.71, down 19 cents. Earnings are due Nov. 5 after the close.

1983,ORCL,"The move by QAD (QADA) to the cloud is seen helping the company accelerate its revenue and make it more competitive with larger rivals in the enterprise resource planning software market.In a research report Monday, Richard Davis, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity, said the company's transition will also help boost its customer based faster than before. Davis initiated coverage of the company with a buy rating and a price target of 23.""QAD is a long-standing ERP firm that is in the early stages of a transition to (the) cloud that we believe could almost double both revenue and, via operating leverage, pretax margins over a decade without adding a single new customer (7% and 15% compound average growth rate, respectively),"" Davis wrote. ""These numbers could be a baseline if QAD grows its customer base faster than we expect or makes a few tuck-in acquisitions — both of which seem to us like reasonable assumptions.""QAD makes enterprise resource planning software geared to manufacturing industries, focusing on the car, consumer products, food and beverage, technology, industrial and life sciences industries. It has over 2,000 customers and says its software is deployed in more than 4,000 locations in 90 countries.Davis was one of three analysts to open coverage on the Santa Barbara, Calif.-based company Monday. William Blair & Co. initiated with an outperform rating and Stifel Nicolaus with a buy rating.QAD was up 1% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 20. QAD stock, publicly traded since late 2010, on Jan. 2 came within pennies of its all-time high of 23.07, touched last June.The company could find success continuing its focus on the manufacturing sector, Davis says.""The enterprise vendors, such as Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), are much larger and are also focused on large, enterprise-wide deals across many industries,"" he wrote. ""QAD, in contrast, focuses solely on the manufacturing industry, with a few solutions tailored to verticals within manufacturing.""This type of specialization is typically not found from enterprise vendors, and even with customizations, the level of expertise that QAD brings to manufacturers cannot usually be matched.""

2025,ORCL,"Tibco Software's lack of traction in cloud computing is a prime reason the enterprise software company will likely wind up in the hands of a private equity firm rather than being bought by a larger software company such as Oracle or SAP, some analysts say.Tibco (TIBX), a leading provider of infrastructure software, early Monday announced it had agreed to be sold for $4.3 billion, or $24 a share, to Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm focused on software, data and tech-enabled businesses.The news comes nearly a month after Tibco said it hired Goldman Sachs to look at strategic options, including pursuing potential acquirers.Vista's purchase price is a 23% premium to Tibco's Friday closing price. The companies expect the deal to close next quarter.Tibco stock rose more than 21% Monday to 23.65.Like its industry overall, Tibco is transitioning its business model from collecting a large upfront software licensing fee to a software-as-a-service model, where users access the software as needed via the Internet cloud.The cloud transition also is a top priority for licensed-software giants Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), but Tibco failed to move fast enough to the cloud, says Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""And that is probably why there was no interest from Oracle or SAP,"" Wood told IBD.Earnings DropTibco's sales growth has slowed the past two years, and earnings were down the past year, as the company struggled through a poor economy, internal sales execution issues and a maturing market for its core business as it expanded into new areas such as business analytics software.The company earlier this month reported Q3 earnings and a fiscal Q4 forecast that missed Wall Street estimates. Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 31 fell 6% from the year-earlier quarter while its EPS ex items plunged 50%.Tibco had become a leading provider of middleware that acts as a glue for developing applications. The company's big push into data analytics came with its 2007 acquisition of Spotfire for $195 million.But in analytics and elsewhere, Tibco faced increasing competition from Oracle, IBM (IBM) and smaller cloud vendors, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.""Tibco's market position with respect to the cloud was almost nowhere,"" Koenig said. ""It was a number of problems that really crept up on them and kind of snowballed over the last couple of quarters.""Tibco's challenges emerged as CEO Vivek Ranadive led an investment group that purchased the NBA's Sacramento Kings.Ranadive in May 2013 reached a deal to pay $347 million for a 65% interest in the team.The Kings' acquisition and the exit of top executives such as CFO Sydney Carey, who left last year, weighed on the company, Koenig says.""There is ample evidence to say that Vivek was not minding the store, at least not as well as he should have been, with him spending quite a bit of time on his basketball endeavors,"" Koenig said. ""And Tibco had not been very good at bringing in outside talent to shore up executive departures. Their bench was getting thinner and thinner.""SAP's announcement Sept. 18 that it would acquire Concur Technologies (CNQR), a maker of cloud-based travel and expense software, for $7.4 billion underscores the desire of the legacy software leaders to build stronger cloud businesses.Oracle, SAP and others want to appeal to a growing number of business software customers that prefer to pay monthly subscriptions rather than large upfront license fees, analyst Wood says.""There is less appetite from buyers for these older license models,"" he said.Large companies such as Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), IBM and SAP will likely focus on acquiring cloud data analytics software vendors in the near future, Bhavan Suri, an analyst for William Blair & Co., said in a research report Monday.""We believe that a number of pure-play business intelligence vendors will ultimately be acquired by some of the larger vendors that need analytics front ends for their existing data warehousing/integration stacks,"" Suri wrote. ""We believe that some of these larger vendors will look to achieve greater participation in the next-generation business intelligence space as the transition from legacy solutions continues, and that they will likely acquire as they have done in the past.""For its fiscal Q3, revenue for Tibco's core infrastructure business fell 26% following a 29% drop in Q2. And its optimization business, which is primarily Spotfire, fell 7% in Q3.Tibco is feeling the effects from data analytics rivals that include Tableau Software (DATA), Koenig says.""In the analytics business, Tableau has taken the market by storm and squeezed Spotfire,"" he said.

Tencent, which trades in the U.S. over the counter, rose less than 1%.Investors clamored for Alibaba Group on Friday, sending its stock up 38% in heavy volume on its first day of trading following its record-setting IPO.The stock opened at 92.70, far above its offering price of 68. After rising to 99.70 and falling to 89.95, Alibaba (BABA) closed at 93.89.It ended the day as one of the world's most valuable tech companies, with a $231 billion market capitalization.If Alibaba were in the S&P 500, its market cap would be the 12th largest, just above Procter & Gamble (PG) and Verizon (VZ), according to Fact Set Research. Among techs, it's bigger than IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL), but far below that of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), the S&P 500's top three techs.In the Internet-Retail subindustry in the S&P 500, Alibaba would rank No. 1 in market value ahead of Amazon.com (AMZN), Priceline (PCLN), Netflix (NFLX) and others.Alibaba received $8.2 billion in net proceeds from the IPO, building its cash and equivalents to about $17.5 billion. With its long-awaited IPO done and loads of cash in the bank, there are plenty of frontiers to be conquered. The company has made clear it has ambitions to expand beyond China.USA, But Not Today""This IPO is recognition of their dominant position in China but Alibaba has made clear it has global ambitions,"" said Bill Whyman, analyst at International Strategy & Investment. ""China is a very competitive market, and I'm sure Alibaba will invest to protect its home marketplace first,"" he said.While Alibaba has made several investments in relatively small U.S. Internet firms that focus on Amazon and eBay (EBAY) markets, it's unlikely Alibaba would make a major push into America at this time, he said.""I expect them to have more success pushing into markets like Russia, Brazil and Southeast Asia rather than trying to take on Amazon in the U.S.,"" Whyman said.The China e-commerce giant initially sold 320.1 million shares, of which more than 271 million traded.Underwriters plan to exercise their option for an additional 49 million shares, according to media reports. That would lift the proceeds raised to $24.3 billion and replace the 2010 IPO of Agricultural Bank of China as the world's largest-ever IPO.Battling TencentThe largest U.S. IPO of a China company prior to Alibaba was the May 22 debut of JD.com (JD), which raised $1.8 billion, according to Renaissance Capital.Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), chief rival of Alibaba, owns about 20% of JD.com, which has an Amazon-like business model.Tencent dominates the social media and messaging market in China with WeChat, but is going after Alibaba's core e-commerce business with various joint ventures. Alibaba is doing the same, going after Tencent.Alibaba has a 30% stake in Weibo (WB), which offers a service similar to Twitter (TWTR).Analyst Youssef Squali at Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Alibaba on Friday with a buy rating and price target of 90.""We believe that a differentiated pricing model, strong brand and unmatched scale give Alibaba an unfair competitive advantage relative to peers both in and outside China,"" Squali wrote.Yahoo (YHOO), with a 22.4% stake, was expected to sell 140 million shares, 26% of its total stake, generating about $9.5 billion in gross proceeds, or $6 billion after tax.Yahoo has said it will return about half to shareholders, while the rest will likely be used primarily for acquisitions, Squali wrote.

The stock closed at 30.10, up 20%.The company is riding a new wave in sales and marketing techniques. Older methods — including cold calls, spam email, popup ads and other forms of disruptive advertising — have been increasingly rendered ineffective by consumers with call blocking and Internet filters. Consumers are recording TV shows and speeding past commercials. Traditional methods of advertising are having less influence on consumer buying decisions, according to HubSpot.""People no longer live, work, shop and buy as they did a decade ago,"" HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan told IBD. ""People now live in a social media world, a world of Google search and the blogosphere. About 70-80% of the consumer decision process happens online, which is a radical shift in the way people used to shop and buy.""Customers are increasingly selecting their own communication channels, relying heavily on the Internet and social media.HubSpot provides a cloud-based sales and marketing software-as-a-service (Saas) platform designed to help businesses generate customer leads and turn them into sales. Applications provided by HubSpot let businesses monitor, publish and track social media across Facebook (FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Twitter (TWTR) and Google (GOOGL). It can schedule messages and post on multiple Twitter accounts and to groups on LinkedIn, Google+ and Facebook.""HubSpot is the iPhone of marketing, an all-in-one system that brings everything together,"" Halligan said.HubSpot also helps users develop their own blogs and improve their search-engine results. Its platform includes marketing automation, customer relationship management and data analytics tools.300 Companies In FieldKirk Adams, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, says that HubSpot fits into an evolving and fast-growing category known as marketing automation software. He estimates that about 300 companies are in this competitive market.""This space is seeing a new wave of marketing techniques, and HubSpot does a good job at it,"" Adams said. ""It's a large market, and there will be more than one winner. HubSpot does a good job of standing out in the crowd.""Rivals include Marketo (MKTO), which went public last year. Other companies offering products and services in this field include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM).HubSpot says that it has more than 11,620 customers in 70 countries. It uses a subscription model, with customers paying an average of $8,823 per year, HubSpot said.It targets businesses with 10 to 2,000 employees. Halligan says HubSpot's platform has increased sales leads of its customers by five times their average per month.Despite the fast growth, the company is not yet profitable. For the six months ended June 30, HubSpot revenue rose 46% from the year-earlier period to $51.3 million. But it reported a net loss of $17.7 million. It spent $33 million on sales and marketing, and $9.6 million on research and development.It's common for young companies, especially those in the SaaS field, to spend heavily, looking for a big payoff down the road.""It's a land grab,"" Halligan said, ""and we want to get as many customers as we can.""Adams said HubSpot estimates it will turn a profit by the end of 2016.""Software subscriptions typically take several years to become profitable on any given deal,"" wrote research firm IPO Boutique in a report, adding that it's the same with Marketo.

2171,ORCL,"Following a rebound year, F5 Networks touts security products as the main engine that will keep its revenue growing at double-digit rates.One question on Wall Street, though, is whether F5 Networks' (FFIV) security push will expand from the data center, where F5's application delivery controllers (ADCs) give it the inside track to win add-on business, to corporate firewalls that sit between private networks and the Internet.F5 Networks is the No. 1 seller of ADCs, electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks. It has not been big in firewalls.The so-called perimeter firewall market — the main type of firewall — is about $7 billion a year, says research firm Infonetics. But it's a crowded field, with Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) among the suppliers of firewall security products.Seattle-based F5 Networks says that it's sticking with a focus on data center security as opposed to firewalls, despite speculation otherwise.""The perimeter is going away,"" F5 CEO John McAdam said at the company's annual investor meeting last month. ""The cloud is going to change everything. We think being in the data center and understanding applications is a major advantage.""Cloud computing enables companies to share business resources with customers and suppliers via the Internet.Protects Against DDoS AttacksF5 in May acquired Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services that help protect websites from large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that make servers unavailable to users. In 2013, F5 Networks bought Israel-based Versafe. Its software protects Web applications from malware, fraud and phishing attacks.F5's security-related acquisitions go back to 2004 and likely are not done, analysts say. But F5 Networks has a checkered track record overall with acquisitions. One that never panned out as expected was its 2007 purchase of network storage vendor Acopia Networks.""Their M&A strategy appears to be focused on (smaller) tuck-ins, though there is always a possibility of a larger deal,"" said UBS analyst Amitabh Passi.At F5 Networks' investor day, McAdam said, ""We don't have a budget as such for M&A. We have a lot of cash, and we'll use the cash if we think we can basically get technology that's probably on our road map. ... Two areas that we've been more focused on than anything are security, No. 1, and service provider (telecom companies), No. 2.""In its fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, F5's revenue rose 17% to $1.73 billion. In the current fiscal year, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters model sales growth of 13% followed by 12% growth in fiscal 2016.McAdam called security ""probably our biggest growth driver for the next five years.""Some analysts are cautious.""While opportunities for F5 in security are encouraging, we think they are already discounted into consensus expectations and reflected in the current evaluation,"" Frederick Grieb, an analyst at Nomura Securities, wrote in a research report.F5's stock has shot up more than 45% in 2014.Jayson Noland, an analyst at R.W. Baird, said in a research report that F5 is making its name in security. ""Our channel discussions are generally positive on F5's security offerings,"" he wrote, ""though the company is not typically considered a primary security supplier.""F5's ADCs cost $50,000 to $300,000, depending on how many servers and how much traffic they handle. F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), which has a security-related pact with Palo Alto Networks, as well as Radware (RDWR) and A10 Networks (ATEN) .F5 Networks also sells software-based ADCs, or virtual ADCs, that run on low-end servers in data centers rather than on its own hardware. F5 has expanded into data center security by selling software modules from Versafe and Defense.Net that run on its ADCs.""F5 seems to be making a push toward more license/subscription revenue with both its core ADC platforms and security,"" said Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes in a research note.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, this month raised his price target on F5 stock to 163 from 153, ""to factor in the company's opportunity to continue expanding its security business in fiscal 2015. Overall, security software that is bundled with ADC appliances has increased to 36% of revenue from 30% last year.""In ADC security, F5 competes with Imperva (IMPV) and Verizon Communications (VZ), which sells a cloud-based Web application firewall.Imperva could be a more formidable rival if it's acquired by the likes of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), EMC (EMC) or Oracle (ORCL), speculates Jonathan Ho, analyst at William Blair.""Imperva and F5 are the leaders in data-center web-application firewalls today,"" Ho told IBD in an email. ""The WAF secures Web servers and is a completely different product than a perimeter firewall.""He says software modules that provide threat detection capability put F5 Networks in competition with Juniper and Fortinet (FTNT), more so than Check Point and Palo Alto Networks.""While F5 is a newer player, I see them as having distribution advantages since they have a broad (sales) channel, large installed base and established credibility,"" Ho said. ""As a smaller company, Imperva has a sole focus on security and a narrower set of products.""

2191,ORCL,"Oracle's road to the cloud is getting smoother, but more than a few potholes remain.Analysts have offered mixed assessments of the database leader since its annual OpenWorld conference Sept. 28-Oct. 2, where executives discussed new products in data analytics and mobile, along with moves to help the firm transition from a license model to a cloud subscription model in order to compete with Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY), SAP (SAP) and others.Oracle (ORCL) has some momentum, thanks to new cloud products such as platform-as-a-service middleware, 54% year-over-year cloud-based bookings growth in its fiscal Q1 ended Aug. 31 and a sales team that has expanded over the last few years, said J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group, in a report this month. He rates Oracle stock as positive.""We feel the bulk of the product and sales force investments around the cloud are complete,"" he wrote. ""We think Oracle is positioned to stabilize the one area that has caused most of the execution challenges in recent quarters, which should lead to improvements in overall growth execution.""Oracle's cloud revenue is growing fast, but it's still a small part of overall revenue.Oracle's missing Wall Street estimates the past two consecutive quarters has given investors pause, Rick Sherlund, an analyst for Nomura Securities, said in a research report this month. But he maintains a buy rating on the company.""Investors may be losing confidence in the pivot to the cloud,"" he wrote. ""We think it will be more a function of time to move the tanker after a late start to the cloud ... and Big Data.""Oracle is the No. 1 maker of database software, which comprises about half of its revenue. At OpenWorld, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said that the company fully expects to transition its database market share to the cloud.But some observers, including Karl Keirstead, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, aren't so sure. He has a hold rating on Oracle stock.""While Larry Ellison claimed that cloud database access could end up as Oracle's largest cloud offering, and while we concur that the data/business intelligence stack is now slowly moving to the cloud, we're not convinced that the database-as-a-service will be a material revenue source for some time,"" he wrote in a report.Oracle's cloud revenue accounted for only 5.5% of total revenue in Q1. But the company says that its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue rose 32% from the year-earlier period, while its infrastructure-as-a-service revenue rose 26%.Still, company executives have conceded that it could take three years to shift from the license model, where the company gets the bulk of its revenue upfront, to a subscription format, where it collects revenue monthly.The company aims to turn every annual $1 of support revenue related to its license agreements into $2.50 to $3 of annual subscription revenue in the cloud.Investors need patience, because Oracle is still far more entrenched in its license model than the cloud, Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James, said in a report this month while maintaining an outperform rating on Oracle stock.""The cloud is clearly a work in progress ... with organic cloud (software-as-a-service/platform-as-a-service) revenue growing an improved but still underwhelming 10% year-over-year by our calculation last quarter,"" he wrote.Oracle is creating a one-stop shop with new offerings in the cloud, including data analytics, mobile and database products.But it might not have enough offerings to be that one-stop shop, Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets, said in a report, though he rates the stock outperform.""We believe the company will need to improve execution and become more aggressive on the M&A front, as it is clear from its recent soft fiscal Q1 2015/fiscal Q2 2015 guidance that it needs to bulk up its product portfolio, e.g., cloud, Big Data and cybersecurity,"" he wrote.

2193,ORCL,"Cloud vendors have a new growth sector: financial institutions.More investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers and exchanges are expected to begin adopting cloud services after dismissing such a move in the past, mostly because of security concerns, says a report released last month.Financial firms have many reasons to adopt cloud services, but the biggest is the bottom line, says Virginie O'Shea, an analyst for Aite Group, the research and consulting firm that issued the report.""Cost pressures have gotten to such a point that it's a natural move for them to evaluate this,"" she told IBD. ""The financial markets are a tough place to be at the moment.""Other reasons why financial firms are turning to cloud services, Aite found, include the need to process more data with fewer staff. The industry has had tens of thousands of layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis.Aite culled its findings from interviews with 21 financial firms in March and April.By 2017, financial institution spending on cloud services will reach $3.2 billion, says the research firm, up 45% from 2013 and up 28% from the $2.5 billion expected this year.Still, only 5.7% of the total $43.5 billion in information technology spending expected by banks and related companies this year is going to cloud services, says Aite. That's up from 5% last year.The industry has been slow to adopt the cloud in part because of security concerns. By turning to vendors who provide services via the Internet cloud, financial institutions feared a lack of control.There are also concerns about performance issues in the cloud vs. using on-premises legacy software systems.But security and other issues have waned since 2008, O'Shea says, while the need to control costs has increased.Financial institutions for the most part ""are not making the money that they were used to pre-2008,"" she said. ""Previously, people were more willing to suck up those costs. Now, margins are so thin that the companies have to think about the long-term costs of everything and whether (their systems are) scalable for the future.""Industry Seeks Faster LaunchesFinancial firms say that their biggest data-management issues are the time that it takes to launch new services, the cost of storing data and the operational risks with their older processes.Many investment banks and other financial firms spread data management among several different legacy systems, O'Shea says, so storing and accessing all of it in a centralized cloud system will likely speed up the information flow. Using the cloud gives the institutions more transparency and flexibility, she says.Using cloud services can also improve efficiency and keep customers happy, says Robert Mahowald, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""It's the ability to do very quick transactions, such as fraud detection and pattern recognition,"" Mahowald told IBD.Moving to cloud services has become a competitive necessity, he says.Financial firms using the cloud are nearly equally divided among public cloud services hosted by outside firms, private cloud services where the companies maintain total control and hybrid cloud mixtures of the two.Many bigger institutions are testing the public cloud for some of their least important tasks.One example is Fidelity Investments. The financial services company has used a public cloud for testing data storage and access as it develops a private cloud for permanent use, Mahowald says.""They are OK with doing some of the burden and load function testing in the public cloud, but when they get to production scale, they want to bring it back in-house,"" he said.Much financial-institution cloud spending will focus on developing private cloud services, where security threats are less of an issue, O'Shea says.""That tends to be top-tier firms spending multimillions (of dollars), with the view that it will bring down the cost of ownership,"" she said.By 2017, global spending on private cloud system hardware and software will reach $22.2 billion, up from $12.3 billion in 2013, with a compounded average growth rate of 17.6% from 2012 to 2017, says IDC.IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the cloud-services providers most likely to benefit from the increased spending by financial firms on private clouds, says Mahowald.In public clouds, vendors likely to benefit include Amazon.com (AMZN), IBM, Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and Savvis, a unit of telecom firm CenturyLink (CTL).Besides public cloud offerings, all four sell dedicated, private cloud services that offer customers the greatest amount of control over the service and their stored data.One of the biggest drivers for private cloud services among financial firms is the ability to limit distribution of certain data to only certain offices or departments, O'Shea says. ""They want to keep control over it at a business level or at a business-unit level,"" she said.

2241,ORCL,"""Oracle, like other traditional, on-premise software vendors, will be financially disadvantaged over the short term as its upfront on-premise license revenues are cannibalized by the recurring cloud-based revenues,"" he wrote in a June 25 research note. ""Therefore, we model expected license revenues to be flat to down for the next two years (during) the transition.""
"
2242,ORCL,"Sherlund and Anthony's analysis dovetails with comments made by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison during a June 19 conference call to discuss earnings for fiscal Q4, which ended May 31.
"
2243,ORCL,"""During the transition selling those cloud subscriptions, what could have been a license is now recognized over time, so we are going to recognize the revenue more slowly,"" Ellison said. ""That's OK, because in the long term we make much, much more money, and we can effectively compete against this whole new array of competitors like Salesforce and Workday vs. the previous generation of competitors like SAP and IBM (IBM).""
"
2244,ORCL,"Oracle, though, faces a tough battle. Its sales and earnings last quarter disappointed, and not solely due to the cloud transition, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.
"
2245,ORCL,"""Customers are greenlighting more stuff in the cloud, and there are many vendors besides Oracle that are relevant in the cloud,"" Koenig told IBD.
"
2246,ORCL,"While 4% is the biggest year-over-year revenue growth that Oracle has posted in the past 11 quarters, the database leader's stock is up 6% for the year.
"
2247,ORCL,"12c Database Could Help
"
2248,ORCL,"Some investors hope that Oracle's 12c database, launched in July 2013, will spark its cloud business, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets. The product aims to help users consolidate databases in the cloud.
"
2249,ORCL,"""There are signs of optimism, but over the next six months Oracle will need to prove themselves in order for investors to further buy into the cloud story,"" Ives told IBD.
"
2250,ORCL,"With its Q4 earnings, Oracle for the first time released some details about its cloud revenue. It said that its combined SaaS and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) revenues rose 25% from the year-earlier period to $322 million, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of 3%, which included flat software license revenue.
"
2251,ORCL,"SaaS includes customer relationship management software, while PaaS is middleware.
"
2252,ORCL,"The company said that its infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) revenue rose 13%, to $128 million. Saas, PaaS and IaaS are the three main cogs of cloud computing.
"
2253,ORCL,"IaaS includes data storage. Amazon.com (AMZN) unit Amazon Web Services is by far the IaaS leader, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL) are among the top challengers.
"
2254,ORCL,"But the cloud isn't yet making rain for Oracle.
"
2255,ORCL,"""The cloud revenue was only 4% of total revenue in Q4,"" analyst Turits pointed out. ""It's pretty early stage, but we would like to see it bigger and growing faster.""
"
2256,ORCL,"Oracle briefed analysts last month at its Redwood City, Calif., headquarters about its move to the cloud. Oracle valued total annual cloud industry revenue at $74 billion.
"
2257,ORCL,"At the meeting, President Safra Catz downplayed the challenges of the transition, Sherlund says.
"
2258,ORCL,"""Catz emphasized that the transition to the cloud may be less disruptive than we may have assumed in our model of license revenues (flat to down over the next two years), given that the existing business has a long tail with renewal of large enterprise license agreements, and (she) did not subscribe to the view that the existing business would decline,"" he wrote.
"
2259,ORCL,"Oracle's beefed-up sales staff might help ease the transition. Sherlund says that the company appears to have fixed sales issues that had slowed its transition. The move to a cloud model from a license model marks a major change in the compensation system for sales staff.
"
2260,ORCL,"""Oracle has more than doubled its sales organization over the past two-three years, and we believe (the company) has over 2,000 dedicated sales people for its cloud apps,"" he wrote. ""The significant expansion of sales capacity and the recent broadening of SaaS product portfolio should provide good leverage for future growth.""Oracle's conversion from a longtime software licensor into a cloud software vendor won't happen overnight.The database leader must transition a salesforce long used to a system in which big companies and other enterprises pay upfront for one-year or longer licenses to use the software, which customers maintain in their own data centers on their own servers.In the cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, users pay monthly for what they need, and the vendor often maintains the software on its data centers, relaying software to customers via the Internet cloud.For a big, long-entrenched licensed-software seller such as Oracle (ORCL), the transition will be monumental, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.""It takes a lot to turn the battleship and transition a legacy (software) company into a cloud company,"" Turits told IBD. ""We believe they are hiring people to focus on cloud sales and that the incentive structure"" is being altered to speed the transition.""It takes a big push,"" he said. ""They are not there yet.""Oracle is following a trend that has found a number of nimble, fast-growing cloud vendors getting the jump on legacy vendors.Besides SAP (SAP), which has long battled with Oracle for the title of largest business-software provider and is also laboring to transition to the cloud, Oracle faces smaller, younger rivals such as Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY).The shift could take Oracle another three years, wrote Susan Anthony, an analyst for Mirabaud Securities, in a June 20 research report.""As the shift takes place, the software vendors' new license revenues will ... be replaced to some extent by the cloud-subscription model, which within three years will match the revenues that would have been generated by the equivalent perpetual license and, over five years, contribute significantly more,"" she wrote.Oracle faces at least 24 more months of pain, says Rick Sherlund, a Nomura Securities analyst.Cannibalization Will Hurt""Oracle, like other traditional, on-premise software vendors, will be financially disadvantaged over the short term as its upfront on-premise license revenues are cannibalized by the recurring cloud-based revenues,"" he wrote in a June 25 research note.

2262,ORCL,"The cloud computing trend has become a rainmaker for investors in Arista Networks, which went public in June and whose stock has doubled from its IPO price.
"
2263,ORCL,"Arista (ANET) makes cloud networking equipment that manages data traffic between Internet users and the data centers for big customers such as Facebook (FB), Yahoo (YHOO), Microsoft (MSFT) and eBay (EBAY).
"
2264,ORCL,"The more users such companies sign up, and the more they do online, the greater the demand for the kind of gear Arista produces.
"
2265,ORCL,"""Arista makes equipment that provides the infrastructure for Web 2.0 companies like Google (GOOGL) or Facebook to build their clouds on,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Inder Singh. ""Arguably, they make some of the world's fastest switching equipment. These guys have an edge in high-speed switching.""
"
2266,ORCL,"Internet giants aren't the only ones in need of what Arista makes. Singh expects that in the next five to 10 years, demand for high-speed switching equipment will expand to include many new end markets such as health care, media and the oil and gas markets.
"
2267,ORCL,"""I think we are seeing the tip of the iceberg in terms of demand for high-speed networks today, with more and more of these other parts of the economy embracing the technology over the next five years,"" Singh said.
"
2268,ORCL,"Switching Traffic
"
2269,ORCL,"Cloud-computing data centers have thousands of servers and storage systems connected by optical-fiber lines, routers and switches that can distribute software apps and data quickly across the Internet and wireless networks to smartphones, tablets and PCs.
"
2270,ORCL,"Arista's core product line consists of high-speed ethernet switches used to connect servers and other devices into a computer network so applications can be quickly deployed and cost-effectively updated, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"
2271,ORCL,"Its switching products incorporate its Extensible Operating System, or EOS software, which the company says is ""fully programmable and highly modular.""
"
2272,ORCL,"The ""programmability"" of EOS has enabled Arista to create software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation and network analytics, and help customers quickly integrate a wide range of apps, according to the SEC filing.
"
2273,ORCL,"The company declined to comment, with spokeswoman Amanda Jaramillo noting that Arista is still in a quiet period.
"
2274,ORCL,"Arista's biggest competitors are Cisco Systems (CSCO), the No. 1 provider of ethernet switches, and No. 2 Juniper Networks (JNPR).
"
2275,ORCL,"But Arista's differentiated technology is among the reasons investors like the stock, and it's why the company has successfully competed against Cisco and Juniper, analysts say.
"
2276,ORCL,"""Arista is one of the fastest growing companies in the networking market. They approach the switching market differently than their competitors and they've been taking market share,"" Singh said. ""That's appealing to investors.""
"
2277,ORCL,"Arista's approach differs from rivals in a few ways.
"
2278,ORCL,"The point that its EOS operating system is programmable makes it more flexible than ethernet switches from other companies, says Singh.
"
2279,ORCL,"""Arista's primary differentiation begins with its proprietary Unix-based Extensible Operating System, or EOS,"" wrote Northland Capital Markets analyst Jeff Kvaal in his report initiating coverage on Arista.

2282,ORCL,"Arista delivered an impressive performance in the second quarter, in its first financial report as a public company.
"
2283,ORCL,"It earned 35 cents a share, sailing past the 13 cents expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 65% to $137.9 million, handily topping views for $125.26 million.
"
2284,ORCL,"Strong customer demand for its products drove second-quarter results that exceeded consensus estimates, said Arista CEO Jayshree Ullal on a quarterly conference call.
"
2285,ORCL,"Analysts expect 2015 earnings to rise 13% to $1.37 a share from an estimated $1.21 in 2014. They see a 26% increase in 2016 and a 24% gain in 2017.
"
2286,ORCL,"While Cisco is ""by far"" the market share leader, ""increasingly Arista is really taking market share,"" said Singh, noting that Arista is the No. 3 player behind Juniper.
"
2287,ORCL,"How has Arista competed so well with its mighty rivals?
"
2288,ORCL,"""They are not a one-trick pony,"" said Singh. ""They have an entire portfolio of switching products.
"
2289,ORCL,"""In addition, rather than having different operating systems for different switches as some competitors do, Arista uses a single operating system, which makes it lower-cost and easier to use and operate their networks.""
"
2290,ORCL,"Arista was founded in 2004 and shipped its first products in 2008. From Dec. 31, 2010, to June 30, 2014, its cumulative end-customer base grew from about 570 to roughly 2,700.

2410,ORCL,"When David Tenney joined the Seattle Sounders as a fitness coach in 2009, the Major League Soccer team was struggling to manage a growing mass of performance data from its players.
"
2411,ORCL,"Information from wearable devices that track everything from a player's heart rate and central nervous system during practices, players' input about their fatigue levels and diet, and coaches' post-game ratings of player performance poured into the team's offices every week.
"
2412,ORCL,"The data volume became unmanageable, Tenney says.
"
2413,ORCL,"""We had three or four computers and different pieces of software and we tried to back everything up to an external hard drive,"" he said. ""But we reached a kind of critical mass point where it was ludicrous.""
"
2414,ORCL,"Early last year the Sounders turned to Tableau Software (DATA), a leading provider of data analytics software. Tableau's software helps the team assemble player data in easy-to-read charts for the coaching staff.
"
2415,ORCL,"This year the Sounders have a league-best record of 11 wins, 4 losses and 2 ties.
"
2416,ORCL,"Put Me In, Coach
"
2417,ORCL,"Software analytics aren't the only reason for the team's winning ways. But the software does help coaches decide which players to start and whom to put on the field in the final minutes of a close game, says Tenney.
"
2418,ORCL,"""We can tell from the data that this player hasn't coped well (during practice) and there is a higher probability that he is not going to play as well this weekend or he is going to be more at risk for injury,"" he said. ""Keeping your top players healthy is the best way to win games in a professional league.""
"
2419,ORCL,"Data analytics have become a big revenue driver for software providers as companies and enterprises look for better ways to manage and use their customer, vendor and other data.
"
2420,ORCL,"Tableau sprinted with year-over-year revenue growth in recent quarters north of 80%.
"
2421,ORCL,"Qlik Technologies (QLIK) and Tibco Software (TIBX) are also in the race.
"
2422,ORCL,"The business has required big investments by Tableau and Qlik in their internal operations. Both firms lost money in the latest quarter. Tibco has been hit with internal execution issues and tight competition in data analytics, most notably from Tableau.
"
2423,ORCL,"All three are fighting each other and bigger firms like SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) for a piece of the fast-growing market.
"
2424,ORCL,"By 2018, global data analytics software revenue is expected to reach $21.7 billion, up 64% from 2012, research firm Gartner said in a report released last month.
"
2425,ORCL,"Prices vary, but Qlik's software license (noncloud) starts at $1,350 per user per year.
"
2426,ORCL,"Few sports teams use data analytics software now. But the number is growing. Customers include the National Football League's Oakland Raiders, the National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning and the National Basketball Association's Portland Trailblazers and Sacramento Kings.
"
2427,ORCL,"How teams use the software varies. Some relegate the software to analyzing ticket and merchandise sales. Others are extending its use to the field, where it has become another tool for coaches along with tackling dummies and whiteboards, says Troy Anderson, vice president of worldwide inside sales for Qlik.
"
2428,ORCL,"""It's really taken off for us probably in the last 18 months,"" he said.
"
2429,ORCL,"Qlik data analytics software customers include teams in the NHL, NBA and NFL. None are willing to speak about how they use the software for game-day purposes. Teams are looking for any competitive edge over rivals, says Anderson.
"
2430,ORCL,"""These teams obviously want to win, and there is a tremendous competitive pressure and a tremendous compelling event that drives them to look for these solutions,"" he said.
"
2431,ORCL,"Sports teams have no problem collecting data. Players use wearable devices that track physical activity and sleep patterns. Some teams use player biological and injury data and player performance information from services such as Prozone that provide game-day data.
"
2432,ORCL,"The Kings use wearable devices, feeds from video cameras on the court and other data sources to follow players' moves during practices, says Ryan Montoya, the team's senior vice president of strategy, innovation and technology.
"
2433,ORCL,"""There is probably a list of five to 10 different inputs, everything from basketballs with sensors, shoes with sensors and apparel with sensors,"" he said. ""We think of it as a Lego block system where we keep on building.""
"
2434,ORCL,"As the number of data sources grows, so does the teams' need for analytics software, says Anderson.
"
2435,ORCL,"""They will want to mash it up for visualization and analysis, and that is really where they struggle,"" he said. ""They will typically try to do it with things like (Microsoft) Excel, but it will just get unruly.""
"
2436,ORCL,"Qlik provides a way for non-techies to crunch data without help from an information technology department, Anderson said: ""These are trainers, people who are really on the player side of things, so (the software has) got to be easy to use and intuitive.""
"
2437,ORCL,"While the software is designed to be used by nontech people, some companies and teams bring in other firms such as consultant Accenture to develop on-screen dashboards to view the data.
"
2438,ORCL,"The Kings began using data analytics software a year ago after tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadive became the team's majority owner. Ranadive is Tibco's CEO.
"
2439,ORCL,"Once the sale was final, data analytics became a staple in the front office and on the court, said Montoya: ""It's imperative and expected from our majority owner.""
"
2440,ORCL,"Tibco's Spotfire data analytics software helps the Kings' coaches compare and contrast data graphs on players' breathing, stress levels and other factors to get better insight on their health and athletic readiness, says Montoya.
"
2441,ORCL,"""They can do it on the fly, and that is something that has never been done before,"" he said.
"
2442,ORCL,"Similarly, Tableau's software lets Sounders coaches examine athlete performance data in a new way, Tenney said: ""Tableau really gives us a flexibility to create some visually very clear pieces of data that our coaches can grasp and really drive more informed decision making.""
"
2443,ORCL,"Does data analytics software help teams win?
"
2444,ORCL,"Tenney, now the Sounders' sports science and performance manager, says the team's record and a higher number of goals scored in the last 15 minutes of games this season are proof that data analytics are an asset.
"
2445,ORCL,"""Clearly, that utilization of data has helped us get the right players on the field at the right time to make us fresh at the end of the game,"" he said.
"
2446,ORCL,"Other users are a work in progress.
"
2447,ORCL,"Sacramento's past two seasons ended with identical records of 28 wins and 54 losses, well out of playoff contention.
"
2448,ORCL,"Data analytics could help improve that mark, Montoya says.
"
2449,ORCL,"""Think of us as a startup (company),"" he said. ""Last year was year one and this year is year two. We will continue to develop and improve over time, and data will help us do that.""
"
2450,ORCL,"Teams can't expect the software to guarantee victory, Anderson says.
"
2451,ORCL,"""It's that concept of marginal gains,"" he said. ""If you make a 1% difference in a bunch of areas, you are going to get something meaningful in the end.""
"
2452,ORCL,"Anderson says the Oakland A's baseball team's use of deep statistical analysis on players — depicted in the book and movie ""Moneyball"" — that produced consistently winning seasons for over a decade helped spur sports clubs' interest in data analytics software.
"
2453,ORCL,"Even so, analyzing athlete readiness, health and training data isn't the same as poring over player statistics, Tenney says.
"
2454,ORCL,"""It's a totally different ball of wax than the whole 'Moneyball' technical decisions and player metrics,"" he said.
"
2455,ORCL,"Yet there are similarities, Montoya says.

2481,ORCL,"Oracle's deal to acquire Micros Systems hits one of three industries targeted by the software giant to reaccelerate its revenue growth.The enterprise software maker on Monday said it's reached an agreement to acquire Micros Systems (MCRS), a provider of hardware, software and service for hotels, restaurants and retailers, for $5.3 billion, or $68 a share. The pending deal had been reported last week.Oracle (ORCL), the No. 1 database provider, has been scrambling to reinvigorate its growth in the cloud computing era, when instead of paying costly upfront license fees, companies and other enterprises pay a monthly fee for software service as needed.That the transition to the cloud will be tough for Oracle became more apparent last week when its Q4 earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations in a typically strong period for the company.Micros, which would be Oracle's biggest acquisition since Sun Microsystems in January 2010, is in one of the three segments — financial and telecom are the others — the company identified as main targets at its analyst day event last fall, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. He rates Oracle stock a buy.""They have been very clear that they have ambitions to go into these verticals,"" White told IBD. ""(Micros is) one of the lead players in hospitality, retail and restaurants. This is probably an area where (Oracle) can sell a lot of their cloud applications.""Single-Digit GrowthWith Oracle stuck in single-digit revenue growth, acquisitions might be the best way to reaccelerate growth, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets & Co. He rates Oracle stock outperform.""This was a company that was late to the cloud, as was evidenced last week (with its disappointing earnings and guidance) and its inconsistent performance the last few years,"" Ives told IBD. ""They need to fire up the M&A engine.""Acquisitions might be the best way for Oracle to boost its growth, agrees Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig, pointing to the $39 billion in cash and equivalents held by the company. He has a neutral rating on Oracle.""Oracle faces some secular challenges, and growth is becoming pretty minimal,"" Koenig told IBD. ""They have got to acquire companies; they have got to use their balance sheet.""Oracle targeted the telecom segment with last year's $2.1 billion acquisition of Acme Packet, a network gear maker for the telecom industry. Oracle last year also bought Tekelec, a maker of networking software, for an undisclosed price.Based in Columbia, Md., Micros says it has nearly a 10% share of the market for software, hardware and service for the hospitality industry. It pegs total sales of $14.1 billion for the industry last year.Micros had about $1.3 billion in revenue last year.The company says it has more than 567,000 customers and manages more than 330,000 active company systems in over 180 countries.For its fiscal Q3 ended March 31, Micros posted revenue of $348.9 million, up 11% from the year-earlier period, its biggest growth in four quarters. Earning per share minus items rose 16% to 72 cents, its best growth in six quarters.For the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect revenue of $360.5 million, up 9.7%, and EPS of 71 cents, up 14.5%.The customer numbers likely attracted Oracle, says Koenig.""It's about acquiring customers,"" he said. ""It helps Oracle move the needle on their growth rate.""Oracle expects the acquisition to close this year.The CRM ArenaMicros also gives Oracle access to another brand of cloud-based customer relationship management software that helps companies improve their work with customers.Oracle has been trailing several rivals in the hospitality and retail cloud segments, Ives says.""Oracle was definitely missing a piece of that market and having difficulty competing with the likes of SAP (SAP), NetSuite (N)and niche players like Demandware (DWRE),"" he said. ""So this bulks up the CRM piece and is a much more vertical focus around retail, a big reason why they are doing this deal.""The combination of Oracle and Micros will provide integrated products to help companies grow, Oracle Co-President Mark Hurd said in a statement.""Oracle has successfully helped customers across multiple industries harness the power of the cloud, mobile, social, Big Data and the Internet of Things to transform their businesses,"" Hurd said. ""We anticipate delivering compelling advantages to companies within the hospitality and retail industries with the acquisition of Micros.""Oracle's cloud acquisitions in recent years include Taleo, RightNow Technologies and Responsys.It acquired Taleo, a maker of talent-based software, for $1.9 billion in 2012.The company bought RightNow, a provider of customer service software, for $1.5 billion in 2012.And it bought Responsys, a maker of cloud marketing software service, for $1.5 billion in December.

2568,ORCL,"Investors had an unpleasant surprise for ServiceNow after the fast-growing enterprise software company released Q1 earnings late on April 23 that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The company also provided a stronger-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.Yet ServiceNow stock fell more than 6% on April 24, and fell the following two days as well.The investor reaction perplexed ServiceNow (NOW) CEO Frank Slootman, whose company is taking share from larger rivals including CA Technologies (CA) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) in IT service management software.""I don't think in all my years of doing this kind of thing that have I ever seen anything remotely close to it,"" Slootman told IBD . ""It all goes under the motto of 'no good deed goes unpunished.' Investor sentiment is in turmoil right now and it really has nothing to do with our business or our company.""ServiceNow's results, with sales up 62% from the year-earlier quarter, were exceptional, says Matthew Hedberg, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets.""They couldn't have done much more in the quarter,"" he said.But ServiceNow wasn't alone.Highflying software companies such as Tableau Software (DATA), Splunk (SPLK), Workday (WDAY) and Salesforce.com (CRM) have seen their stocks dive this year despite strong quarterly earnings and outlooks.Shares of ServiceNow were down 9% this year through Tuesday before rallying 16% the rest of the week. Salesforce's stock has declined 6%. Tableau, a fast grower in the data analytics market, is down 12% this year. Workday, a leader in the human capital management market, is down 3%. The Nasdaq composite index is up 3.5%.High ValuationsInvestors generally appear to be nervous about the high valuations in the sector — all of the above companies are in the red except Salesforce — rather than any specific fundamental issues, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners. Also, the young software stocks tend to move up and down more greatly than older legacy software stocks, he points out.""It's more of a general nervousness around some of the higher beta stocks and tech in general,"" he said.Older tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and HP are up this year despite recent quarters with decelerating or declining sales and EPS.Investors are placing a higher premium on size and stability rather than fast growth — for now, says Karl Keirstead, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.""You are seeing a growth-to-value rotation,"" he said. ""What is hurting Workday is the flipside of what is helping Oracle.""Splunk might the biggest victim among the highflier group.Splunk stock is down 37% this year, after falling 16% the day after its recent Q1 earnings soundly beat views.The magnitude of Splunk's sell-off is out of the company's hands, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""It's the cycle of the stock, the stock is in a bad mood,"" White said. ""There was really nothing in the (Q1) report that wasn't good. It was a very solid report.""Splunk raised its revenue forecast for the year from $400 million to $402 million-$410 million. Analysts had modeled for $406.9 million, slightly above Splunk's midpoint.The company's forecast could be construed as light, but there likely are bigger forces at work, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""The shorts are winning over the longs right now,"" he said. ""The issue there is a re-evaluation for these high-growth assets. Where that value should fall is what the market is trying to figure out.""Prior to the sell-off, on Feb. 26 Tableau's stock reached an all-time high of 101.86 a share, or 13 times above the $476.2 million that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project for 2015.Workday's peak price of 116.47 on Feb. 27 was roughly 19 times its expected revenue of $1.09 billion for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Splunk's all-time high of 106.15, set on Feb. 28, was 29 times the $547.5 million revenue that analysts had projected for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Those valuations have come down to earth. After Friday's close, Splunk's stock was trading near nine times revenue for its next fiscal year, with Workday at 13.5 times revenue and Tableau at eight times revenue.Over the past 15 years, ""growth company"" stocks have seen a mean average of eight times projected revenue, with anything near 20 among the highest, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.Those high valuations can make investors nervous, Ives says.""Once they start to sell off, it starts to be like yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater,"" he said.Where Is The Sweet Spot?As Deutsche Bank's Keirstead puts it, investors in cloud software companies are still struggling to find prices they are comfortable with.""You are seeing a re-evaluation of the growth software sector and that is why these stocks are struggling,"" Keirstead said.Legacy vendors, meanwhile, are up despite their own struggles.Oracle, Cisco and Microsoft are each up 11% this year, while HP is up 21%.All four companies are in various stages of some sort of reorganization or reprioritization, looking to recharge growth.Investors are attracted to these companies for varying reasons, Keirstead says.""In the case of Oracle, their total revenue growth rate in the most recent reported quarter was actually the highest in three years,"" he said.

Sales and marketing costs rose 37% to $639.3 million. ""Salesforce.com is still hiring new sales reps and investing in them,"" Keirstead said.

2611,ORCL,"Francisco D'Souza is used to surfing the big waves of change.He was born in Nairobi, Kenya; grew up in 10 other countries, including Panama and Congo; and had to learn languages just to survive in school.During the boom of the late 1990s, he helped launch the tech service firm Cognizant (CTSH), was its North American director through the tech crash of the early 2000s and became CEO in January 2007.Despite the recession that started late that year, D'Souza has overseen revenue growth from $1.4 billion to 2012's $7.4 billion while providing everything from software system integration to high-tech strategic consulting.Arvind Ramnani of BNP Paribas predicts that Cognizant's revenue will bulge to $8.9 billion in 2013 and $10.3 billion in 2014.Meanwhile, Cognizant's stock has rocketed 525% since late 2008.""I think the key to success in the business world today is to learn how to adapt rapidly,"" D'Souza, 45, told IBD.D'Souza is the son of an Indian diplomat, which meant the family moved to a different country every few years. His parents put their children in native schools instead of the international ones, favored by many foreigners, that minimized contact with the locals.Worldly""We learned to thrive in a flat world long before the term became in vogue,"" said D'Souza. ""My multicultural experience had a decisive impact on the way we consciously built Cognizant to serve a global marketplace.""His father bought him a computer when he was 13.Frank taught himself programming and in three years developed software to manage the inventory of a division of the Trinidad army.At 18 he worked as a teller in an international bank in Hong Kong during the day and went to the University of East Asia in Macau at night. The bank was using a punch-card system that was no longer supported by the vendor, so he helped implement a software program.A year later he worked with a small startup to invent a mass fax machine that could send out advertising for products and daily stock quotes, in the process learning the basics of entrepreneurship.After earning a bachelor's degree in business in 1991, D'Souza entered the MBA program at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. He had to take a job on campus to pay the bills, so he pulled all-nighters before tests and took power naps between classes.He dreamed of starting a tech company, but had no green card to let him stay in America as an entrepreneur. After graduation in 1992, he joined credit information provider Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) and went to Germany. The next year, he heard D&B wanted to focus on emerging markets, so he volunteered to help create a software service arm in Chennai, India.Originally called DBSS and servicing D&B's in-house needs, the unit was spun off as Cognizant in 1996 and the next year moved to Teaneck, N.J. It went public in 1998.Meanwhile, D'Souza got his green card, and from 1997 to 2003 he directed North American operations and business development, getting through the dot-com bust by doing information technology projects that bigger firms ignored.""One day, I might be out selling to prospective clients; the next, I could be figuring out how to process our payroll,"" he said.D'Souza's lesson is that marketing experience can be a great plus to help reach your career goals, no matter what they are. He served as chief operating officer from December 2003 to December 2006 before becoming CEO at 38.Cognizant rolled onto Fortune's ""100 Fastest-Growing Companies"" list from 2003 to 2012 and became one of the Fortune 500 in 2011.While it has big-name allies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and SAS, Cognizant faces competition from giants such as IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Cognizant does general business and management consulting, which can range from business process re-engineering to mergers-and-acquisitions program management. Its sweet spot is to address points where technology and operations intersect, such as integrating complex systems and implementing new applications.Cognizant operates in over 40 countries, but D'Souza cautions that keeping costs low for clients should not be the sole value when it comes to outsourcing.""Clients today need to address a dual mandate — driving costs down in their core business, while simultaneously innovating and transforming their business by leveraging the new SMAC stack,"" D'Souza said, referring to social mobility, data analytics and cloud service. ""With structural shifts in economy, business and technology, enterprises are forced to re-examine how they operate, moving from merely incremental levels of performance efficiency to building new digital business capabilities. In this context, not only do they need to run better; they need to run different.""GrowthCognizant has convinced so many C-level executives that it can do a superior job at reasonable prices while driving their innovation agenda that its client list has grown from 400 to 1,100 under D'Souza.His firm currently has more than 166,000 employees globally.""It has also doubled revenue per client over the past five years,"" wrote Ramnani. ""The trend is reflective of the value that Cognizant provides to its clients in an environment where they were consolidating their vendor relationships.""Cognizant's inroads into some industries are nothing short of stunning. Its customers include 27 of the top 30 global pharmaceutical companies, nine of the 10 leading biotechs, 12 of the biggest medical device makers, four of five online powerhouses, as well as six of the top 10 North American financial institutions and all top 10 in Europe.Part of the company's formula for gaining loyalty is deep experience with its Two-in-a-Box approach. One part of the team is a Cognizant business expert who has over 15 years' experience in that industry and works at the client's site. That specialist works with an IT specialist who has the same level of experience implementing projects.When the recession hit in late 2007, D'Souza decided to invest in growth. Meanwhile, rivals were cutting back.D'Souza told everyone at Cognizant to spend more time with customers and more effort in marketing to potential ones. Over the next few years, he traveled to meet many of them, showing that the company was committed top to bottom to making itself invaluable.Differentiating itself from tech outsourcing companies, Cognizant acquired consultancies and emphasized its long-term strategic advisory relationships.All For OneIn February 2012, D'Souza made a radical decision. The company was reorganized under three leaders to leave him free from day-to-day operational management to concentrate on future technology.With $3.36 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt, Cognizant is placing its bet on balancing its core revenue sources with a gamble on potential ones.Headed by President Gordon Coburn and group CEOs Rajeev Mehta and Chandrasekaran Ramakrishnan, Cognizant's services are divided into three horizons:• 1. The cash cow of application development, maintenance and testing, enterprise resource planning, data warehousing and business intelligence.• 2. Fast-growing management consulting, IT infrastructure management and business process.• 3. New technologies and markets such as Latin America.""D'Souza is risking both his own reputation and career,"" wrote Forbes India. ""But as Albert Einstein once said: Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.""D'Souza's lesson is that when things are going well, look for ways to break out to the next level.""I've seen CEOs who are strong in leadership or management, but Frank is truly rare in having such outsized capabilities in both,"" said Malcolm Frank, executive vice president and chief strategist at Cognizant. ""I've seen him build a galvanized sense of purpose across the entire company with a compelling long-term vision, then give us whiplash by immediately switching to work closely with a particular business unit, holding them to key metrics and deliverables in incredible detail.""

2641,ORCL,"Handling A Choppy Uptrend: Fifth In A SeriesDon't sneer at a base-on-base formation. You may think you're looking at an indecisive stock.But base-on-base patterns also appear for stocks whose biggest problem is a rough market.A stock forms a base. It doesn't even have to be a good base. As the stock rises, there's no guarantee the market will cooperate.And, after all, the broad market is the M in CAN SLIM. Without it, you're swimming upstream.So let's say the breakout faces a market that suddenly shifts into a correction. Or the market retains its uptrend, but in a rough and volatile fashion — like we've seen recently. That fresh breakout can easily stall in such situations.What then? The stock's run could be dead. But many of these stalled leaders go on to form a second base. Here's how you know it's a base-on-base:• Both bases are valid, although the first base can be flawed.• The high point of the second base is no more than 20% above the buy point from the first base.• The low point of the second base may dip slightly below the high point of the first base.Oracle (ORCL) showed a fine example in 1999 of how a breakout can run into a bad market, and how a stock can rectify an ugly base.Oracle built its first base of the eventual base-on-base from February through September 1. This cup-with-handle ran 49% deep and showed plenty of loose, sloppy trade.This was an ugly base, and you couldn't be blamed for letting it pass.Oracle broke out Sept. 3 2 and floated to a new trading range 3 as the broad market moved into a sideways mode. The low of this range, 39.88, undercut the prior base's high by 3%. Lovely.Seven weeks of consolidation tracked nicely with the Nasdaq. Then the market took off like an escaped convict, and Oracle was one of the leaders in what would become an historic run.The stock triggered the new buy point from its second phase of the base-on-base on Oct. 29 and Nov. 1, running past 47.04.So what did Oracle accomplish? By building a base-on-base, Oracle bided its time until the broad market provided the needed updraft. And that same base-on-base turned an ugly pattern into a tighter, neater base that you'd feel comfortable buying into.

"
2661,ORCL,"License growth has been an issue for Manhattan. Its year-over-year license revenue growth has fallen in four of its last seven quarters.
"
2662,ORCL,"One reason is its focus on large companies, particularly big retailers. On its conference call, Manhattan CEO Eddie Capel said pursuing million-dollar-plus contracts can impact revenue projections if deals take longer than expected to implement or if a contract signing is delayed from one quarter to the next.
"
2663,ORCL,""" ... we feel like we are seeing deals move out but not go away, and it's just becoming a bit more tricky quarter-over-quarter to forecast exactly when those particularly bigger deals are going to close,"" he said.

"
2665,ORCL,"""Big e-commerce retailers or retailers moving from just traditional brick-and-mortar to more e-commerce tend to be very complicated environments,"" he said.

Its year-over-year license revenue growth has fallen in four of its last seven quarters.One reason is its focus on large companies, particularly big retailers. On its conference call, Manhattan CEO Eddie Capel said pursuing million-dollar-plus contracts can impact revenue projections if deals take longer than expected to implement or if a contract signing is delayed from one quarter to the next."" ... we feel like we are seeing deals move out but not go away, and it's just becoming a bit more tricky quarter-over-quarter to forecast exactly when those particularly bigger deals are going to close,"" he said.Some transitions take longer than others, says Gartner's Klappich.""Big e-commerce retailers or retailers moving from just traditional brick-and-mortar to more e-commerce tend to be very complicated environments,"" he said. ""Their license-to-services ratio is probably always going to be a little lower than some other vendors, largely because of the market they go after.""Customers Include Cost PlusManhattan's customers include Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) unit Cost Plus World Markets, Adidas Group, Lamps Plus and Columbia Sportswear (COLM).Apart from its core warehouse management product, Manhattan also sells software systems to help companies manage their transportation systems. That accounts for roughly 30% of revenue.One way Manhattan can grow is by selling its transportation product to its warehouse customers, Schappel says. But he says its longer-term growth prospects are less certain.""Their biggest challenge is, where do they take their business? How do they grow their business, because the company is very anti-acquisition,"" he said. ""They are content with being a supply chain execution company and sketching out that vision.""More offshore expansion is likely, Klappich says.""They have been very strong in North America,"" he said. ""They need to take that and go to other parts of the marketplace and focus on their strength, which is starting from complex retail and e-commerce, and build on that.""

It's also rolling out data analytics software.Workday is leveraging the cloud, one of the fastest-growing areas of technology, to challenge Oracle and SAP, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. The incumbents also are moving more to cloud offerings, but they've lagged, Koenig says.""Workday is very small but they've got the entire Oracle and SAP base to feast on, and they are going to pick off a very significant piece of that base over time — there is no doubt about it,"" he said.Workday was co-founded by David Duffield, who is co-CEO. Duffield also founded PeopleSoft, another maker of HR software, which Oracle acquired in a hostile takeover in 2004.For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Workday reported a per-share loss, minus items, of 12 cents vs. a 39-cent loss in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a per-share loss of 17 cents.Revenue rose 76% to $127.9 million, where analysts had expected $117.6 million.The company also announced that it had added Yahoo (YHOO) co-founder Jerry Yang to its board.For the current quarter, Workday expects revenue of $133 million to $138 million, up 63% to 69%. Analysts had expected $128.9 million, or growth of 58%.Workday doesn't provide an earnings outlook. Analysts expect a per-share loss ex items of 18 cents vs. a 19-cent loss in the year-ago period.The company is growing its core HR business while attracting more users to its financial platform, Workday co-CEO Aneel Bhusri told analysts on a conference call.""We are translating our success in HR and moving it to financials,"" Bhusri said.Workday said it added 50 customers in Q3, including eight companies among the largest 2,000.Workday has emerged as the leading player among software-as-a-service companies that sell their products through a monthly or annual subscription via the cloud, says Scott Berg, an analyst for Northland Capital Markets.""It's the fastest-growing company in all of SaaS right now,"" he said.But growth comes at a cost.Workday's research and development costs rose 76% in Q3. Its sales and marketing expenses rose 66%.Recruiting more salespeople and systems integrators is necessary for Workday to continue to challenge Oracle and SAP, Koenig says.""They need to train and develop their sales force and third-party systems integrators,"" he said. ""Their market footprint is a lot smaller than their competitors.""Integrating its products is one key. The company is working on tightly integrating its human capital management software with its financial management product.That will be critical to attract larger customers, Berg says.""Until Workday is able to sell that properly, I don't think some customers (can) switch all their HR over to Workday,"" he said.

2782,ORCL,"Delivering meaningful growth for a large, big-cap firm is no easy feat. Microsoft (MSFT) had some lackluster quarterly sales figures in parts of the past two fiscal years, but top-line growth has firmed.The Redmond, Wash.-based company has now put in three straight quarters of double-digit revenue gains. In the seven quarters prior to that, Microsoft's sales grew from 3% to 8%. In one of those periods, revenue declined 8%.Although Microsoft is best known as a software firm, some of its growth is expected to come from the hardware side. During its fiscal Q1 2014 conference call, the firm said hardware sales are slated to jump 35% to 45% in fiscal Q2, boosted by its recently expanded line of Surface tablets and the next-generation Xbox One video game console, which will be released Friday.Rival Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 just went on sale last week.Microsoft's earnings were flat last year and are expected to dip in fiscal 2014 ending in June . But profit is slated to grow 9% in fiscal 2015. Microsoft has a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 8, signaling a steady stream of annual profits. The gauge runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).The stock fell Monday after being downgraded to underperform from neutral at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Shares remain in a buy zone from a breakout past a 36.39 buy point from a handle. Microsoft rallied 43% this year before easing recently.Microsoft currently pays a quarterly dividend of 28 cents a share or $1.12 annually. It has a yield of about 3%, which is larger that that of the S&P 500's by about half of a percentage point. Its yield is a little less than that of networking giant Cisco Systems' (CSCO) 3.2%, but more than double that of database software titan Oracle (ORCL).In September, Microsoft hiked its dividend by a nickel a share to the current 28 cents a share. The dividend will be paid Dec. 12 to shareholders of record Nov. 21.

2869,ORCL,"Some of tech's biggest giants might ultimately claim the largest share of the emerging multibillion-dollar Big Data market, though they are playing catch-up.Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) are scrambling to tackle Big Data and compete with nimble newcomers such as Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA).Big Data in general describes the large volume of data companies are accumulating from multiple sources in the digital age, and how to best manage and use that data with analytics software and services. (See related story, this page.)Tableau and Splunk are notching 50% to 70% quarterly year-over-year sales growth rates for their analytics software, which helps companies analyze their Big Data. But analysts say Oracle, SAP, HP and other big vendors will move deeper into the field, boosted by acquisitions.It will happen, but not overnight, says Dan Vesset, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""The (software vendors) realize this is real, this is the future,"" Vesset said. ""If you are not providing a solution that deals with large amounts of data, then you are going to be left out of a large segment of the market.""By 2014, we will see an acceleration of M&As, but it will probably take five years-plus (before large companies dominate Big Data).""Research firm MarketsandMarkets agrees, saying smaller firms offering analytics and business intelligence software will dominate in the near term before larger tech companies catch up.""Considering the complex ecosystem of the Big Data market, pure-play vendors such as Tableau, Karmasphere, Cloudera, Splunk, etc. are expected to reap the most benefit,"" the research firm told IBD via email. ""However, as Big Data solutions get commoditized, the demand for integrated Big Data solutions will increase and leading hardware and software vendors such as IBM (IBM), HP, Dell, Oracle, SAP and EMC (EMC) will gain substantial market share in the coming years.""The big boys already are jumping in. For example, in September SAP said it would acquire Kxen, a Big Data software analytics company. Terms weren't disclosed.Still, some of the young guns might survive long enough to challenge IBM and Oracle, says Aapo Markkanen, an analyst for ABI Research.""It's quite likely the new generation of Big Data firms like Splunk are going to make it,"" he said. ""Some of them will live up to the challenge, but not all of them.""Venture capital will aid the startups.Enterprise software firms have attracted $893 million in venture funding this year through August. That compares with $877 million for all of 2012 and $726 million in 2011, says IDC.But even a robust Big Data market can't support everyone, says IDC's Vesset.""These new guys are doing a lot of innovative and interesting things, but it's no different than any other market, whether it's soft drinks or cars,"" he said. ""Some of (the startups) may make it, but the vast majority will either be incorporated into bigger companies, remain small or go out of business.""Software to help with Big Data is needed because Big Data is getting ... bigger. Companies are becoming overwhelmed with the growing amount of data from data centers, websites, mobile phones, social media and other sources.Edmunds.com uses analytics software produced by Splunk to examine traffic trends, security concerns and other issues across four auto-related websites that it operates. Dell has used analytics software from privately held Ayata to improve its relations with customers by finding a better way to sift through data from thousands of customer service agents spread across multiple locations. The NBA's Portland Trail Blazers used data analytics software from privately held Ayasdi to better analyze statistics in order to improve its player drafts.Companies want solutions. And vendors want to cash in. And nobody on either side of that equation wants to be left out, says Douglas Laney, an analyst for research firm Gartner.""Vendors see it as a Gold Rush to be a provider of Big Data-related technology capabilities and services,"" he said. ""And companies are looking to take advantage of all of this data that is available.""In an August report, MarketsandMarkets said it expects global Big Data revenue to reach $46.34 billion in 2018 vs. $14.87 billion this year. This month, Gartner forecast Big Data spending near $55 billion in 2016, up from $33 billion this year. Last January, IDC said it expects Big Data to produce revenue of $23.8 billion in 2016.ABI Research says global revenue from Big Data could reach $114 billion in 2018, up from $31 billion this year.ABI says salaries account for 50% of the spending as Big Data vendors and their enterprise customers alike hire data scientists and other experts to find the best ways to leverage data.Professional services remain the top priority for Big Data spending for now, says Gartner's Laney.""We see almost a five-to-one demand for services compared to technology right now,"" he said. ""One-third of the organizations can't hire the type of talent they are looking for.""But spending on hardware and software systems will become more prevalent, Laney says.""Like with any new type of technology or concept it becomes very services-heavy at the beginning,"" he said. ""We are still in the early days ... Over time software is gaining ground.""

2871,ORCL,"Ruling the cloud services business is one road to glory for new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, but Amazon.com's leading Amazon Web Services stands in the way.AWS is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service, in which companies rent computers and data storage via the Internet cloud.In cloud services, Microsoft (MSFT) first targeted platform-as-a-services — applications, databases and software that run on cloud infrastructure — but it's been gaining traction as an IaaS provider.Emerging as a strong No. 2 to Amazon.com (AMZN) might be enough to win kudos from growth-hungry Microsoft shareholders, analysts say.Neither Amazon nor Microsoft breaks out cloud revenue in their financial results. Analysts have estimated 2013 revenue for AWS at $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, which they say represents a 50% to 70% jump from 2012.Microsoft's cloud revenue also is hard to nail down. BMO Capital Markets estimates it's a more than $1 billion business, but that includes license revenue from software Microsoft has retooled to operate on its Azure cloud platform.Nadella, who was executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group before being named last month to replace Steve Ballmer as CEO, played a lead role in moving Microsoft to the cloud, along with Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's former chief software architect, who left the company in 2010.Some analysts expect the Amazon-Microsoft rivalry to heat up as Nadella targets cloud computing growth.""Microsoft may need a strong No. 1 to chase, and they have that in Amazon,"" said James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""In the video console market, they had (Sony's (SNE) PlayStation, which helped them rise with Xbox.'Cloud-First World'""AWS views only Microsoft and potentially Google (GOOG) as their main (cloud) competitors. They're not really concerned about anyone else.""Nadella hasn't said much about any cloud rivalry since being named CEO. But in a letter to Microsoft employees, he wrote: ""Our job is to ensure Microsoft will thrive in a mobile and cloud-first world.""AWS and Microsoft face rivals besides Google in cloud computing services, such as IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), VMware (VMW) and Salesforce.com (CRM). IBM last year acquired IaaS vendor SoftLayer for about $2 billion. It also recently purchased Cloudant and plans to invest $1 billion in PaaS.2.5 Million ServersAWS and Microsoft, though, have strengths most rivals have trouble matching, analysts say.Amazon expanded into cloud computing as a way to efficiently utilize the massive e-commerce infrastructure it had built up for its own needs. According to one estimate, Amazon has mustered nearly 2.5 million computer servers to power its public cloud services.Microsoft, its PC and server software widely deployed in corporations, built its own in-house cloud infrastructure to support Office 365, Xbox Live, Bing and other products.Still, AWS is much bigger. And Oracle has moved faster than Microsoft in making cloud-related acquisitions, says Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund in a research report.""New management must drive much harder to the cloud,"" said Sherlund. ""It is not too late for either Microsoft or Oracle for PaaS. It is too late for them for leadership in IaaS; they can never catch AWS at the scale they operate.""Microsoft, like VMware, has been adapting as corporate data centers move to cloud technology, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard. VMware's virtualization software is widely used in corporate data centers to increase the flexibility and capabilities of computer servers.VMware and its majority owner, EMC (EMC), last year launched Pivotal Software, a cloud computing venture that is developing PaaS products that work on Amazon's public cloud platform.Windows-Only FocusMicrosoft's strategic focus is still on Windows Server and other legacy products, says Pritchard.""With a Windows-only focus, it will be difficult for Microsoft to complete broadly in IaaS. Instead, it must be successful reinvigorating developers around the Azure platform with (PaaS) offerings,"" wrote Pritchard in a research note.Forrester's Staten agrees it's vital for Microsoft to attract more software developers to create cloud apps.The early success of AWS was in making it easy for small and midsize businesses to tap computing resources via the Internet cloud that had only been available to large enterprises. AWS has more recently targeted large companies and other enterprises.Microsoft's ""walled-garden"" approach still aims at locking in customers to its software ecosystem, some analysts say.David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner, says Microsoft's Azure cloud platform still needs to invest more in the IaaS market, which is much bigger than the PaaS market.Customers pay IaaS service providers pennies an hour per server. Amazon has cut its cloud prices nearly 40 times since 2006. Since moving into IaaS last year, Microsoft has been cutting prices to match Amazon.""Microsoft has a long history of doing things its own way,"" Smith told IBD. ""But in IaaS, they're starting to focus on not just Microsoft OS, (by also focusing on) Linux and Java. I expect to see more of that kind of thinking in the cloud.""

2971,ORCL,"Workday (WDAY) stock hit a new high Tuesday after UBS hiked its rating on the company, saying its market capitalization eventually could rival that of its much-bigger, much-older rivals Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).
"
2972,ORCL,"Workday's Internet cloud-based software is used by companies and other enterprises for HR, payroll and financial management is disrupting the market, ""with little credible competitive threat over the medium term,"" UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a research report Tuesday. He hiked his rating to buy from neutral, and raised his price target on Workday stock to 100 from 85.

2973,ORCL,"Workday stock was up 5% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 88.75. It's the second day in the row the stock, which started trading in October 2012 at $28, hit a record high.

2974,ORCL,"Thill said Workday will get a boost this year by releasing its software component designed to manage recruiting. He also said its financial management support has matured to the point where it can fit the needs of the largest multinational corporations.
"
2975,ORCL,"Still, Workday has yet to record a profit. And its market cap is less than $16 billion, far behind Oracle's $170 billion and SAP's $100 billion. Those two are the largest providers of business software, and both have been expanding their own cloud-computing offerings.

2979,ORCL,"Information technology professionals these days talk more about clouds than do meteorologists.

2980,ORCL,"Takeover activity picked up in the second half of the year and the momentum should carry into 2014 as the U.S. continues to lead and Europe revives, according to M&A experts.
"
2981,ORCL,"Average monthly deal volume rose from 808 per month in the first half to 886 monthly in July through November, according to PwC, analyzing data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Activity has continued as 2013 winds down, with Ireland's Jazz Pharmaceuticals  (JAZZ) agreeing to buy Italy's Gentium for $1 billion while Oracle (ORCL) reached a $1.5 billion deal for cloud-based marketing software maker Responsys (MKTG).
"
2982,ORCL,"Takeovers have been especially brisk at home. U.S.-targeted M&A announced so far in 2013 comprised just more than $1 trillion, 11.5% over 2012, Thomson Reuters said. That's 43.4% of global M&A, the highest share in a dozen years, as the U.S. economy does relatively well while stocks boom.
"
2983,ORCL,"Overseas Deals Weak
"
2984,ORCL,"But worldwide, it has been a disappointing year for deal makers. Global M&A is down 5.7% vs. last year to $2.37 trillion, Thomson Reuters said. The number of deals fell to the lowest since 2005. Outside the U.S., M&A activity has fallen 15.6% to $1.34 trillion.

2985,ORCL,"Europe comprised 27.3% of global activity this year and Asia Pacific 22%, according to Dealogic.
"
2986,ORCL,"A survey of 1,000 M&A professionals, investors and advisers by accounting firm KPMG found that 56% of respondents said the U.S. will have the highest level of M&A in 2014.

2987,ORCL,"But many also see an active China merger market and expect Europe deals to perk up along with their economies.

"
2990,ORCL,"Business morale, low in the wake of the recession and sluggish recovery, appears to be on the mend. An E&Y poll of U.S. executives found that 41% of them expect to engage in acquisitions in 2014, compared to 23% who expected to take part in deals immediately prior to 2013.
"
2991,ORCL,"Training Wheels Coming Off
"
2992,ORCL,"The U.S. jobs market and manufacturing activity generally have shown some improvement, while fiscal drag and uncertainty from Washington are waning. The Federal Reserve has said it will start to taper its monthly bond buying program in January, perhaps signaling that the U.S. economy is ready for its training wheels to come off.
"
2993,ORCL,"Europe is growing again, albeit fitfully, after its longest recession since World War II. Although it hasn't been a great year for emerging economies such as India and Brazil, China continues to grow above 7% and its government is making moves to further liberalize its economy.
"
2994,ORCL,"Telecommunications and real estate have been M&A leaders this year. Telecom deals more than doubled to $266.4 billion. That's largely due to Verizon Communications' (VZ) $130 billion buyout of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.

2996,ORCL,"Health care M&A has had a down year due in part to the lingering uncertainties about ObamaCare. Deals are down 4.7% vs. this point in 2012.
"
2997,ORCL,"The money is there for M&A, with companies around the globe sitting on an estimated $6 trillion cash and the credit markets having healed from the recession. But one key ingredient has been missing: confidence.
"
2998,ORCL,"""Just because all the fundamentals are in place for a strong M&A market doesn't always mean it happens,"" said Brian Levy, an M&A partner at PwC. ""An uncertain economy with a bunch of geopolitical shocks, that makes CEOs and CFOs want to keep their cash close to the vest.""

3014,ORCL,"Three things stand out for big-cap CA Technologies (CA).First, the company's annualized dividend yield is 3.4%. Few stocks in its Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group can match that yield. Most stocks in the group don't pay a dividend.Second, CA is the second-biggest software maker for mainframes and technology infrastructure, according to researcher Gartner.While the big dividend pleases income investors, the word ""mainframe"" translates as ""old"" to growth investors. About 55% of sales are mainframe-linked.The third item, though, could be the most important.On Jan. 7, Michael Gregoire took over as CEO. Gregoire was the CEO at California-based Taleo when Oracle (ORCL) acquired the firm in 2012.Gregoire embraced the takeover because, as he said at the time, the move was best for the shareholders. Of course, Gregoire was a large shareholder himself, but that's exactly what savvy investors want.They want the CEO to think like a shareholder rather than like a mere jobholder.Can Gregoire refire CA?Gregoire inherited a company that hasn't seen revenue grow in double-digits for two years in a row (or more) since 1995-98. In the fiscal year ended in March, revenue fell 4%. The Street expects another 4% drop in fiscal 2014 and then 1% growth in fiscal 2015.At the earnings call Wednesday, Gregoire said acquiring new customers is key to jacking up sales. ""Over the past 12 months, we added more than 460 new logos,"" he said.Cloud revenue is another area that holds long-term potential for revenue growth. ""We're early days on this,"" he said, and the ""awkward part"" is that software as a service involves smaller transactions. ""So you don't really get to see that move the revenue needle in a short period of time.""

"
3070,ORCL,"Oracle broke out of that second base and staged the sort of performance that makes it one of the market's all-time winners.Second In A SeriesThe best stocks, much like the best athletes, can correct their basic flaws in form.If you see a top-rated stock building a faulty base, don't walk away in a snit. Keep an eye on that stock. First efforts often go awry.Often, the stock will repair itself by building a new, better structure. This can appear as either a base on base or a base within a base.Let's say the stock builds a cup with handle. The cup is too deep, the handle is too low, the entire base shows too much distribution. Any one of these flaws could be a deal killer. You're disgusted.If the stock can't do better than that, you'd be right to walk away. But keep looking. Maybe there's a breakout, and the stock stalls. If the stock rises less than 20%, and then backtracks and moves sideways, you may see a second base take form. In most cases, the stock would be building a base on base.Oracle (ORCL) formed a classic base on base in 1999. A cup with handle, which ran from February to September, was flawed 1. The cup's correction ran 49% deep, far too much for valid base. The left side was too steep, and the right side was even steeper.When Oracle's rise fizzled at 18% above its 39.91 buy point (chart shows 2-for-1 split in January 2000), you might have taken notice 2.

3109,ORCL,"Epam Systems (EPAM) is an example of a company seemingly in the right place at the right time.
"
3110,ORCL,"The information technology service provider is thriving on a resurging demand for IT offshore outsourcing, with much of its workforce in Central and Eastern Europe, offering an alternative to offshoring firms that do most of their work in India or China.
"
3111,ORCL,"The strategy is clicking. Its year-over-year revenue growth has hovered near 30% for the past seven quarters. This month, the company raised its guidance for the year and the just-completed Q3.

"
3113,ORCL,"Outsourcing Trend
"
3114,ORCL,"European and U.S. companies continue to look to cut their operating costs by outsourcing some IT services to lower-cost offshore areas, which is helping Epam, says Ashwin Shirvaikar, an analyst for Citi Research.
"
3115,ORCL,"""There is a general trend toward more offshore outsourcing in Europe and the U.S., and European companies had typically not outsourced before,"" Shirvaikar told IBD.
"
3116,ORCL,"Epam has used skilled recruiting and a focus on building up its software expertise to power its growth against bigger rivals such as Infosys (INFY) and Accenture (ACN).
"
3117,ORCL,"The company, which is slated to report Q3 results on Nov. 7, now says it expects revenue of $139 million to $140 million, or year-over-year growth of 26% to 27%, compared to its previous forecast of $135 million to $137 million.
"
3118,ORCL,"The company now expects earnings per share minus items of 42 or 43 cents, instead of its previous estimate of 41-42 cents. It posted a profit of 37 cents in Q3 2012.

"
3122,ORCL,"One element in Epam's favor is companies looking to expand beyond India for outsourced, skilled IT labor, Shirvaikar says.
"
3123,ORCL,"""Many of the large clients of these Indian (outsourcing) companies that went to India 10 to 12 years ago are saying we now have several thousand people in India doing our IT, and we probably need another location outside India from a risk management perspective,"" he said.

3124,ORCL,"In Q2, Epam's revenue from European clients jumped 33% from Q2 2012.
"
3125,ORCL,"Many companies in Europe are only now waking up to using outsourcing as a way to cut costs, Katri says.
"
3126,ORCL,"""In terms of what we call off-shoring adoption, continental Europe is extremely immature and less penetrated (than the U.K. and U.S),"" he said. ""And the economic reality of Europe is forcing many local companies to evaluate off-shoring options as a way to cut costs.""
"
3127,ORCL,"Software development remains Epam's largest source of revenue, accounting for 68% of total Q2 revenue. Epam's software group handles projects for such clients as SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL).
"
3128,ORCL,"Epam is holding its own in software development vs. Accenture and Infosys, says Shirvaikar. ""The difference is really that Epam is smaller, more focused and probably more nimble,"" he said. ""One company can't win everything.""

3141,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) recently increased capabilities of its Oracle Warehouse Management (“WMS”) Cloud offering. New features include introduction of ten additional languages, new user interface display and customized extensions as well as enhanced yard management to improve shipment tracking. All these features are anticipated to enrich the customer experience. Further, the simplified customized functionalities will reduce time and cost.Oracle integrated Oracle WMS Cloud with Oracle Inventory Management Cloud solution through Oracle Integration Service (“ICS”). This will accelerate the processes of Oracle Supply Chain Management (“SCM”) and Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) Cloud customers.With the improved bar code scanning capabilities, processing of both multi-element 1D and 2D barcodes will be possible.""The extended capabilities to Oracle WMS Cloud enable companies to gain greater visibility of inventory so they can implement more rapidly, reduce costs, optimize inventory levels and deliver consistent, high-quality customer experience,"" said Diego Pantoja-Navajas, vice president, WMS Product Development at Oracle.Customers will benefit a great deal from enhanced inventory visibility across the global scale of operations and improved logistics performance. The new capabilities are expected to aid Oracle to maintain its dominant position in both the cloud-based WM Systems and Transportation Management Systems.Notably, the company’s shares have lost 7.4% year to date, against the industry’s rally of 12.2%.What the Investors Need to Know?Oracle Cloud is witnessing traction. The company recently announced that Oracle Cloud will be leveraged by mobile start-up Virtual Artifacts. Oracle Cloud will aid Virtual Artifacts to introduce Hibe Mobile Application Network, a social network for mobile based apps. Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) capabilities will improve the way mobile users interact, transact and connect.Oracle University recently furnished new Oracle LaunchPad. It is an online learning tutorial platform to enable the customers to stay ahead of the curve with innovations in Oracle Cloud Applications.The improved capabilities of Oracle WMS Cloud also bode well. Moreover, overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market was projected to grow 18% through 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. This figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. Consequently, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Oracle’s investments in this space to aid long-term growth.To ConcludeOracle had announced the accessibility of its next-generation Cloud Platform services. The move is aimed at providing required programmability, performance and flexibility for rapid service deployment in the cloud economy.The latest addition to its cloud platform reflects the company’s focus on expanding cloud computing product portfolio inorganically. The strategy will enable the company to scale up cloud operations much faster. Through product expansion, it hopes to challenge the dominant position of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in both the Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) and (Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”).In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud services and license support revenues (60% of total revenues) for the quarter advanced 7% (5% in constant currency) to $6.77 billion.We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Zacks Rank &Stocks to ConsiderOracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology Inc.

3142,ORCL,"A successful portfolio manager understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks at the right time. Indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in its share price and strong fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short-lived. So, the stock has the potential to perform well in the long run.F5 Networks’ share price movement has been quite favorable. Its shares have returned 29.6% on a year-to-date basis compared with 18.8% increase recorded by the industry to which it belongs. Gaining Market Share With Continuous Product EnhancementF5 Networks, which provides products and services to manage Internet traffic worldwide, is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growth prospects of the application-networking market as enterprises cope with the rapidly increasing capacity and security demands of next-generation applications and architectures. Notably, the company enjoys a strong foothold in the Layer 4-7 content switching market.Additionally, the company is also taking steps to address the rising need of multi-cloud environment and better scaling of applications in an era where organizations are taking up digital transformation at an accelerated pace.To meet the requirement of the “per application based cloud decision” of companies, F5 Networks came up with per application VE solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. These offerings are meant to support web-application firewall and management of traffic. The benefits from these moves are likely to positively impact F5 Networks’ near-term results.F5 Networks is also looking to grab opportunities in the security market as it expects this to help increase its addressable market and revenue growth prospects. Moreover, a new product cycle and better execution will increase revenues and strengthen its market leadership.Acquisitions and Partnerships Aid GrowthF5 Networks has acquired as many as nine businesses over the years, enhancing its security capabilities and increasing its market share. The acquisitions have helped the company build an integrated security solution platform that provides continuous detection, prevention and remediation of security threats without increasing administrative costs.The buyouts have not only expanded F5 Networks’ product offerings but also brought in additional revenues. We believe the acquisitions will help it cope with the rapidly evolving Internet security market.Apart from this, the company also entered into a number of partnerships with companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), VMware, Inc., and HP Inc. to provide integrated application services for their Software Defined Networking (SDN) offerings.Further, the company also partnered with Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, VMware vCloud Air, Cisco ACI and many others to provide cloud-based application services and solutions.These alliances have increased access to new technology, helped innovative product development, beef up F5 networks’ cyber security suite, facilitated joint sales and marketing programs and improve its competitive dynamics.To ConcludeWe believe the company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and strong fundamentals. It has delivered positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of approximately 6%.Also, given its long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.3% and VGM Score of A, we believe that the stock still has much upside potential.F5 Networks currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3143,ORCL,"Headline worthy initial public offerings have been few and far between recently, and a few major tech companies have grabbed much of the IPO spotlight so far this year, including Spotify SPOT and Dropbox DBX. With that said, June could end up being the busiest month for IPOs in a long time, and this week is packed once again.Recent IPOsSpotify stock closed its first day of trading in early April at a price that valued the company at $26.5 billion, which helped it land as the eighth-largest tech IPO after one day of trading, directly behind Google and (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report). Aside from Spotify and Dropbox, Docusign Inc DOCU and Smartsheet SMAR were a few other notable 2018 tech IPOs.Meanwhile, many investors have been looking forward to IPOs from Uber and Airbnb. But those industry-changing tech companies look poised to wait until at least 2019 to go public—although Uber rival Lyft could reportedly go public in late 2018.Since the start of June, 22 companies have gone public, with 12 more expected to IPO this week. In fact, if all the planned initial public offerings are completed this week, it would be the busiest IPO month since June 2015, according to Renaissance Capital. So let’s take a look at a few of the bigger IPOs expected this week and quickly break down what the companies do.BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) - Deal Size: $600 million Exchange: NYSEBJ’s Wholesale is a membership-based grocery chain that operates over 200 stores across the East Coast, competing against the likes of Costco (COST  -  Free Report). The company was taken private by Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital Partners Ltd in 2011 for roughly $2.8 billion.BJ’s Wholesale reported annual sales of $12.75 billion last year and turned in a profit of $50.3 million. The company is set to go public amid changing times for the grocery industry. Yet, the talk of doom and gloom seems to have calmed down for the time being since Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Kroger KR have all proven their ability to fight back against likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks, WMT, COST, TGT, After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).The company’s IPO is expected to be priced between $15 per share and $17 per share, offering 37.5 million shares. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC  -  Free Report) is one of the lead underwriters.BrightView Holdings (BV) - Deal Size: $501 million Exchange: NYSEBrightView is a Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania-based commercial landscaping design and maintenance services company, which operates mostly in the U.S. BrightView works in an array of fields, including water management, golf, sports turf, snow and ice removal, and many more.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) is the lead underwriter for the company that plans to list 21.3 million shares at between estimated $22 per share and $25 per share.Domo (DOMO) Deal Size: $189 million Exchange: NasdaqDomo (DOMO) is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs this week, mostly because of its one-time standing as a unicorn company—a private startup valued at over billion dollars. However, its valuation has plummeted 75% from its last funding round. Domo noted that the middle of its IPO pricing is expected to be $20.50 per share.Domo is a company that investors might want to pay close attention to over the first couple of months as its real-time business data analytics software competes against the likes IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). The Utah-based company’s clients include Mastercard MA and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report). The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3144,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) has been a favorite with investors, courtesy of its strong fundamentals, growing cloud market share and positive earnings estimate revisions.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Key DriversOracle delivered stellar fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Moreover, revenues of $11.260 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.195 billion.Earnings increased 11.2% from the year-ago quarter. This can primarily be attributed to 2.9% growth in revenues which was toward the higher range of management’s guidance of 1-3%.Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud services and license support revenues (60% of total revenues) for the quarter advanced 7% (5% in constant currency) to $6.77 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Oracle Cloud PlatformOracle recently announced the accessibility of its next-generation Oracle Cloud Platform services. The move is aimed at providing required programmability, performance and flexibility for rapid service deployment in the cloud economy.The latest addition to its cloud platform reflects Oracle’s focus on expanding cloud computing product portfolio inorganically. The strategy will enable the company to scale up cloud operations much faster. Through product expansion, it hopes to challenge the dominant position of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in both the PaaS and IaaS.The overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market was projected to grow 18% through 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. This figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.IaaS is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in PaaS along with the massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is anticipated to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.Exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. Consequently, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Oracle’s investments in this space to boost long-term growth.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Oracle's current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.41 per share, up from earnings of $3.33 per share.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryOracle has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 6.3%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 9.8%.Oracle Corporation Price Oracle Corporation Price | Oracle Corporation QuoteZacks Rank and Key PicksOracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10.3%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

3145,ORCL,"Next week, we expect new economic reads on housing, consumer confidence and a fresh GDP revision for Q1. This week, we simply ride out the continuation of things we already know: a robust domestic economy and labor market, countered by a decoupling globally as the U.S. dollar strengthens further, as well as looming concerns about trade tensions between the U.S. and its main trading partners.Market futures are up at this hour, following a rough week for traders. In fact, the Dow is looking to break eight straight days of losses; nine straight for the blue-chip index would be the longest since Jimmy Carter was president. Solid earnings reports in the Tech sector from companies like Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) this week has kept the Nasdaq buoyant, and small-caps on the Russell 2000 have enjoyed a stress-free existence, relative to indexes that deal with current global headwinds.So what’s new? In Vienna, OPEC has just reached a decision to increase output of oil barrels per day — 1 million on the headline, but actually closer to 600K per day of “real” barrel output. The reason for this discrepancy is based on the inability of some OPEC members to increase production as much as others. In fact, ahead of the meeting Iran has already pushed back on the expected increase.An additional 600K barrels per day is not expected to affect oil prices on the global market, which is likely to come as somewhat of a disappointment to President Trump, who’d been sending a message to OPEC participants that he wants to see prices come down. However, not only are oil prices likely to stay in the $60s (WTI) or $70s (Brent) following this meeting (both major oil indexes are up more than $2 this morning), but the manner in which the consortium plans to discuss the production increase as “reducing cuts” rather than “adding production,” the better for opponents of the plan to save face as the meeting adjourns.How will this affect oil stocks? In the Zacks system, two super-majors currently carry Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings: Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A  -  Free Report). Chevron shares are up 2% in today’s pre-market, whereas Shell (a Netherlands-based company, not U.S.-based) is up 3.6%. Chevron is still working toward its year-to-date highs from mid-January; Shell has only pulled back from recent highs during this difficult June swoon, and notched its year-to-date highs a month ago.

3147,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered stellar fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Moreover, revenues of $11.260 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.195 billion.Earnings increased 11.2% from the year-ago quarter. This can primarily be attributed to 2.9% growth in revenues which was toward the higher range of management’s guidance of 1-3%.Structural ChangesThe company has adopted anew Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606 using full retrospective method.The company had recently launched a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) program which allows customers to move their existing on-premise licenses to the Oracle Cloud. In doing so, Oracle claims that licenses covered by the BYOL program can neither be defined as on-premise nor as cloud.Consequently, the company now reports its new software licenses under its new Cloud license and on-premise license segment. Further, the company merged its Cloud SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS along with its software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.Share Price MovementShares of the company went down more than 3% in after-hours trading.  In the past year, the company’s shares have gained just 0.4%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 34.5%.The share price decrease can possibly be attributed to the new accounting standard adopted by the company and the structural changes which it has undergone in the quarter. Oracle no longer intends to break out its cloud revenues and does not provide any guidance on SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS. This move is likely to enhance investor concern about the company's outlook.The share price movement was also impacted by tepid second-quarter earnings guidance, adding to the woes.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineOracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud services and license support revenues (60% of total revenues) for the quarter advanced 7% (5% in constant currency) to $6.77 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Under the previous reporting structure in last quarter, which was called total Cloud revenues were $1.7 billion.However, total cloud license and on-premise license decreased 5.4 to $2.48 billion year over year.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM came in at $2.2 billion in full year 2018. Fusion Apps advanced 62% for the full year, whereas, Fusion ERP was up 68% for the full year. Fusion HCM surged 65%.Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now fully available and is a key catalyst for the company. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).The company’s tech ecosystem is more than $21 billion and increased 5% for fiscal 2018. Database ecosystems were up 6%. During the quarter, database new license revenues increased 9%.The company also stated that its next-generation PaaS grew 45% for the full year and came in at $1.1 billion.Total hardware revenues were almost flat year over year and came in at $$1.11 billion. Services revenues decreased 1.2% to $883 million.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points (bps) to 52.9%.As a result, non-GAAP operating income during the quarter came in at $5.3 billion, up 4% from last year non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 47%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of May 31, 2018, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $67.3 billion, down from $70.45 billion sequentially. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $15.4 billion, while free cash flow was $13.7 billion.Share Repurchases & Dividends ContinueOracle repurchased around 106 million shares worth $5 billion during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, the company repurchased shares worth $11.5 billion and paid dividends of approximately $3.1 billion. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, payable on Jul 31, 2018.GuidanceFor the first quarter fiscal 2019, total revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 1-3% in constant currency.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be between 67 cents and 69 cents for the quarter, while in constant currency non-GAAP earnings is expected to be in the range of 68-70 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 72 cents per share.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings estimates for NVIDIA, Western Digital and Seagate are currently pegged at 10.25%, 19% and 18.9%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3148,ORCL,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.3% on +7.2% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, but the aggregate positive revision was primarily because of the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector, estimates for the quarter would be modestly down in the last 10 weeks.•    Estimates went up for the Energy, Technology and Retail sectors and went down for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Finance sectors.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +22.7% on +10.5% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1.•    Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues.  •    Earnings growth is expected to be in double-digit territory for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Autos and Conglomerates as the only sectors expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +30.5% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +20.5% earnings growth on +7.6% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19.9% on +6.1% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.4% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 19th, is $156.86. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $172.26 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.82 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season ExpectationsWe still have a few weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season takes center stage; that will happen with the JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) earnings releases on July 13th. Taking nothing away from the big bank results, but the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with the recent Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports part of the 5 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +18.3% from the same period last year on +8% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +134.3%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15%.  Estimates for the quarter have modestly moved up since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But estimates had actually been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2 as well. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.While estimates for Q2 as a whole haven’t moved much, they haven’t been that static at the sector level, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors going down and estimates for 7 sectors going up. On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Autos, Construction, Consumer Staples, Finance, Aerospace, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming two periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

On the negative revisions side, estimates for the Conglomerates, Autos, Construction, Consumer Staples, Finance, Aerospace, and Consumer Discretionary sectors have been cut.On the positive side, the Energy sector really stands out, but estimates for the Technology and Retail sectors have gone up as well. Excluding the positive revisions to the Energy sector’s Q2 earnings estimates, aggregate estimates for the index would be modestly down since early March.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming two periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

3150,ORCL,"Two market leaders in their respective industries -- software and cloud services giant Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) and transportation logistics major FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) -- also reported fiscal Q4 2018 earnings results after the bell today. Keeping in mind we're coming off a regular trading day rife with worry over a possible trade war brewing between China and the U.S., which may have some impact on stock price results even after earnings results are released.Initially upon releasing fiscal Q4 results, Oracle shares had shot up 4%, though over the past several minutes the stock has begun to sell off from that point. Quarterly numbers were quite favorable, however: earnings of 99 cents beat the Zacks consensus estimate by 5 cents, and beat the year-ago number by 11.2%. Revenues also topped expectations to $11.29 billion from the $11.19 billion analysts had been looking for.Cloud services brought favorable year-over-year comps of 8% to $6.8 billion, which is good because Oracle had found itself slipping behind cloud-based services competitors of late. And following a robust surge in stock prices early this year, Oracle is still attempting to claw back. Guidance on the upcoming conference call ought to bring clear sentiment, especially regarding cloud-based expectations, but for now market reaction is fairly muted. For more on ORCL earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated FedEx also outperformed expectations on the headlines: $5.91 per share vs. the $5.72 expected on $17.3 billion in sales vs. the $17.19 billion estimated were favorable for the global delivery firm. Earnings results, year over year, climbed roughly 40%, while operating margins grew 3.6%. This marks the third straight earnings beat for FedEx.Due to adjustments being made on the company's retirement plan accounting, initial full-year 2019 guidance numbers were not released with the earnings data today. Also, with the shadow of a potential trade war creeping in, FedEx may be one of those companies most deeply affected by a major rift between shipping U.S. and Chinese goods. Shares are up moderately following the results, but, like Oracle, FedEx still has a ways to go to reach its 52-week highs realized in January of this year.

3153,ORCL,"Shares of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) dipped on Wednesday, one day out from the release of the technology giant’s quarterly financial report. This slight drop could signal that investors are worried about Microsoft, or the company could have simply fallen victim to the larger market downturn. Let’s take a look at some of Microsoft’s quarterly estimates and fundamentals to see what’s really going on.Microsoft stock has climbed 37% over the last year and 4% in the last four weeks. The company has also expanded its reach within new tech industries as it looks to move far beyond its traditional Office business in order to better compete with the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).These new growth areas include cloud computing and artificial intelligence. With that said, investors need to know if Microsoft’s expansion is set to help or hurt the company this quarter. Furthermore, they should understand how Microsoft has performed in the past to help gauge if the stock looks like a buy ahead of earnings.Latest Outlook & ValuationMicrosoft’s quarterly revenues are expected to climb 9.1% to reach $25.71 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. At the other end of the income statement, Microsoft’s quarterly earnings are projected to surge 16.4% to hit $0.85 per share.Of course, top and bottom line growth estimates are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Microsoft reports its quarterly financial results on Thursday. We can also turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.According to these consensus estimates, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business revenue is projected to reach $7.70 billion. This would mark a nearly 14% climb from the year-ago period when the company reported cloud revenue of $6.76 billion. Meanwhile, its More Personal Computing unit is expected to pop roughly 5% from $8.84 billion to $9.29 billion.Lastly, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes unit revenue is expected to hit $8.76 billion, up 10% from the $7.96 billion the company reported in the prior-year period.Furthermore, Heading into Wednesday, Microsoft was trading with a Forward P/E of 24.2, which marked a slight discount compared to the “Computer - Software” industry’s average of 25.5.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance Microsoft has to surprise investors with better-than-expected earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Microsoft is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.90%. Therefore, MSFT is a stock that could top quarterly earnings estimates.Surprise HistoryMicrosoft’s earnings surprise history and the effect that these surprises have had on its share prices are two other important factors to consider ahead of the tech power’s earnings report.Microsoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Microsoft Corporation QuoteWe can see that Microsoft has posted strong earnings results recently, topping quarterly estimates in seven of the trailing eight periods. The company also boasts an average earnings surprise of 18% over the last four quarters.  On top of that, these beats often led to positive momentum immediately following Microsoft’s quarterly earnings release.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Microsoft stock has turned positive in six out of these last eight windows.Microsoft is scheduled to report its quarterly financial results after market close on Thursday.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

3154,ORCL,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 11.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ORCL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsOracle delivered modest third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, revenues of $9.776 billion came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate figure of $9.771 billion.Earnings increased 20.3% from the year-ago quarter. This can primarily be attributed to 6% (2% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was higher than management’s guidance of 2-4%.Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenue compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% (29% in constant currency) to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% (4% in constant currency) to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineCloud SaaS revenues advanced a significant 33% (31% in constant currency) year over year to $1.151 billion. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues surged 28% (24% in constant currency) to $415 million.On-premise software revenues (66% of total revenues compared with 67% in the year-ago quarter) increased 4% (flat at constant currency) to $6.4 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM soared 65%. Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now fully available and is a key catalyst for the company. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).Software license updates and product support revenues were almost $5.027 billion, up 6% (1% in constant currency). On a combined basis, on-premise support and SaaS revenues were up 8%.Total hardware revenues slipped 3% (down 7% at constant currency) year over year to $994 million. Services revenues decreased 2% (6% at constant currency) to $796 million.Operating DetailsCloud Software as a service margin came in at 67% as compared with 65% reported in the year-ago quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS margin came in at 35% as compared with 46% reported in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 140 basis points (bps) to 56.1%. The decline was due to lower hardware, Software license updates and product support and research & development expenses, which were down 10%, 17% and 2%, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 44%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Feb 28, 2018, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $70.45 billion, down from $71.58 billion sequentially.

The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, payable on May 1, 2018.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter, total revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 1-3% and 0% to (2%) in constant currency.Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 19% and 23% (17-21% in constant currency), much lower than 32% (29% in constant currency)  reported in the last quarter.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be between 92 cents and 95 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 90 cents per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 19% and 23% (17-21% in constant currency), much lower than 32% (29% in constant currency)  reported in the last quarter.Further, higher investments on IaaS platform will affect gross margin expansion in the near term.Oracle recently announced the accessibility of its next-generation Oracle Cloud Platform services. The move is aimed at providing required programmability, performance and flexibility for rapid service deployment in the cloud economy. We believe, the company’s cloud platform will be one of its key revenue generating businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.The latest addition to its cloud platforms reflects Oracle’s focus on expanding cloud computing product portfolio inorganically. The strategy will enable the company to scale up its cloud operations much faster. Despite expanding its foothold in the cloud space, the presence of already established players like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft in both the PaaS and IaaS may remain a potential headwind.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst.Oracle is gaining traction in its cloud business as evident from its third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance, which benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenues compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total cloud revenues is currently pegged at $1.71 billion, while total software revenues are currently pegged at $9.27 billion, up 9.8%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Oracleis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Oracle’s Earnings ESP is -0.35%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Oracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which when combined with earnings ESP of -0.35% makes surprise prediction difficult. As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3159,ORCL,"In a bid to expand its cloud platform, Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) announced the accessibility of its next-generation Oracle Cloud Platform services. The move is aimed at providing required programmability, performance and flexibility for rapid service deployment in the cloud economy.Oracle’s Cloud Platform, which includes Oracle Mobile Cloud Enterprise, Oracle Data Integration Platform Cloud, and Oracle API Platform Cloud, will enable organizations to better manage business and help reduce risk.Users can benefit from the enhanced performance, favorable cost, reliable security and innovation offered by these solutions.We believe, the company’s cloud platform will be one of its key revenue generating businesses in the coming days.The company’s Cloud Platform helps enterprises extend SaaS applications and migrate from existing on-premises applications to the cloud. Its cloud solution provides a broad portfolio of public cloud services including software-as-a-service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), DaaS and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).The latest addition to its cloud platforms reflects Oracle’s focus on expanding cloud computing product portfolio inorganically. The strategy will enable the company to scale up its cloud operations much faster. Through product expansion, Oracle hopes to challenge the dominant position of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in both the PaaS and IaaS.Cloud ProspectsThe overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market was projected to grow 18% through 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. This figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.IaaS is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in PaaS along with the massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.Exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. Consequently, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Oracle’s investments in this space to boost long-term growth.Oracle’s Strong Hold in CloudOracle is gaining traction in its cloud business as evident from its third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance, which benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenues compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Oracle Corporation QuoteBottom LineWe note that partnerships with the likes of Accenture are helping the company rapidly expand its cloud-base clientele. Further, anticipated strong demand for the next-generation autonomous database supported by machine learning will bolster competitive position against Amazon’s AWS.However, management provided soft outlook for the cloud business, which will remain an overhang on the shares in the near term. Further, higher investments on IaaS platform will affect gross margin expansion in the near term.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOracle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology Inc.

3160,ORCL,"For most folks, an earnings season means the 4 to 6 week period at the end of each calendar quarter when earnings announcements dominate market headlines. For us, however, who have to monitor and record each and every earnings release, the definition and duration of each earnings season isn’t that simple. Take for example, the 8 S&P 500 members coming out with quarterly results this week.Since we are still a couple of weeks away from the end of the June quarter, most folks would assume that all of these reports represent the tail of the 2018 Q1 earnings season. The reality is that all of these reports get counted as part of the Q2 earnings season. For example, the Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) reports on Wednesday are for those companies’ fiscal quarters that ended in May, which will form part of our Q2 earnings tally. Looked at this way, the Q2 earnings season actually got underway with the Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report) earnings releases with the tally reaching almost two dozen S&P 500 members by the time the big banks (unofficially) kick-off the earnings season on July 13th.The weekly reporting calendar (below) for the S&P 500 index clearly shows that we still have another four weeks to go before the Q2 earnings season really takes off.Expectations for Q2Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +7.9% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors. This would follow +24.3% earnings growth in 2018 Q1 on +7.2% revenues, the highest growth in almost 7 years.The chart below plots the evolution of Q2 earnings growth expectations. As you can see, the growth rate has ticked up a bit, but nowhere near the impressive positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.But as the chart above shows, we didn’t see much in positive revisions. In other words, while the overall growth picture remains very strong – there is no other way to describe +18.2% quarterly earnings growth - there is not much improvement in expectations for Q2 and beyond. The recent strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flattish aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail. Estimates have gone up the most for the Energy sector, reflecting momentum in oil prices. Excluding the gains made in the Energy sector, the aggregate revisions picture for the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.The table below shows the summary picture for Q2, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q14 (please note that we have not officially closed the books on Q1 yet, as 2 index members still have to report quarterly results).The chart below compares current Q2 earnings growth expectations with what was actually achieved in the preceding 5 quarters and what is expected in the following 3 quarters.Please note that while the Q2 growth pace represents a deceleration from the preceding quarter’s impressive level, the overall level of total earnings is in record territory, as the chart below shows.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

3165,ORCL,"The technology sector seems fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble. This is especially true as the ultra-popular Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) hit record highs on Jan 9, surpassing the peak of the dot-com era in March 2000. The surge in chipmakers as well as FAANG stocks led to the 18-year record performance (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).The sector has been investors’ darling over the past couple of years given that the expanding economy and solid job prospects provide a nice boost to the economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. Additionally, the emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence (AI) as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Further, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are driving the stocks higher. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. In fact, the top five U.S. hoarders are Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s.According to the Consumer Technology Association, the tech industry is expected to reach a record $351 billion this year, up 3.9% from 2017. It also expects U.S. sales of connected devices to rise 6.6% to 715 million units this year (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Music and video streaming services will likely be the hot category fetching in revenues of $19.5 billion while maturing technologies like ($62.9 billion), laptops ($28.4 billion), digital TVs ($22.1 billion), automotive electronics ($15.9 billion) and tablets ($12.5 billion) will contribute about half of the total revenues. Emerging technologies are expected to rake in $6.4 billion in wearables, $4.5 billion in smart homes, $3.8 billion in smart speakers, $1.2 billion in virtual reality and $1.2 billion in drones.Investors seeking to ride the hottest trends could bet on the following ETFs. All of these make for an excellent pick this year.AI Powered Equity ETF (AIEQ  -  Free Report)This is an actively managed and the world’s first AI ETF seeking long-term capital appreciation within risk constraints commensurate with the broad market U.S. equity indices.

Per a Forrester report, CallidusCloud, Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Apttus were the leading CPQ solution providers in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Briefing about SAP S/4HANASAP S/4HANA platform has witnessed continued strong market traction. It has proved to be a solid profit yielder, fueled by an increase in cloud subscriptions as well as support revenues in recent times. During its last reported fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company gained 1,000 additional customers, with more than 40% being new, propelling its revenues. S/4HANA, has established itself as a mission critical control center for businesses pursuing digital transformation.Gigya Acquisition Deserves a Special MentionSAP is striving to expand its CRM offerings. Notably, SAP had concluded the acquisition of Gigya, an established player in customer identity and access management, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The buyout was aimed to boost SAP’s Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions.SAP Front Office Suite will now comprise Gigya solutions, CallidusCloud solutions and SAP Hybris capabilities.To ConcludeSAP’s human capital management applications remain a key catalyst, with Success Factors Employee Central surpassing the 2,300-customer base at the end of the fiscal 2017. SAP’s resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth drivers. The company constantly upgrades the existing products and launches fresh ones to expand its customer base, consequently offering a competitive edge over peers.SAP SE Revenue (TTM) SAP SE Revenue (TTM) | SAP SE QuoteHowever, dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters and flat customer spending projections have affected the company’s performances. Also, over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances besides general economic slowdowns, which have adversely affected consumers’ purchasing power. Currency fluctuations in many of the company’s key markets are also hurting its financial performance.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSAP presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

3167,ORCL,"Shares of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late, and even crafted a 52-week high of $135.71 yesterday. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2019 results. Also, encouraging second-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 7% since it reported fiscal first-quarter results on May 29. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Salesforce has returned 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17.7%.Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter revenues were up 25% year over year to $3 billion and came ahead of management’s guided range of 2.925-$2.935 billion. The reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.94 billion as well. Rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions and acquisition synergies led to the splendid top-line results.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 74 cents per share, trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The figure increased more than twofold from the year-ago quarter.In fact, Salesforce beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.7%. Backed by the impressive results, the company has issued an upbeat outlook for the second quarter as well as full fiscal.Let’s take a look at what factors are driving Salesforce’s back-to-back robust quarterly performances.Buyouts Buoying Top LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the past two years, the company has closed or was in the midst of as many as 16 acquisitions, worth billions of dollars, including its latest biggest-ever buyout agreement — MuleSoft. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship-management solution-providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to continue driving Salesforce’s top-line performance in the quarters ahead.Expanding International Business With PartnershipsSalesforce still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, the company noted that its partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon and Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand Salesforces’ international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which had been curbing its growth potentials. However, in 2016, Salesforce decided to utilize the geographical reach of other data-center service providers in order to expand its international business.The company’s first partnership in this space was with Amazon Web Services in 2016, followed by the next alliance with Alphabet last November. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company won several deals due to its international-expansion initiatives.Partner Program Adding CustomersStellar growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. Notably, the company’s partner certification has witnessed five-time growth over the past four years and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforces’ activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with more than 11,800 skilled consultants.The company added and strengthened its relationships with some notable customers during the fiscal first quarter such as Citi, Philips and Santander UK, SoftBank and LUXA among others. We expect the trend to continue and drive the overall financial performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3168,ORCL,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) is focused on reinforcing its presence in the cloud industry. The company has announced that Amazon Neptune, which was unveiled at the end of last year, is now available to the general public.Amazon Neptune is a graph database service that helps the application developers to build graph based application which requires access to unstructured data with millisecond latency.Further, the service enables the developers to query connected datasets by storing and navigating the data efficiently. This is more advanced than the services provided by the relational databases. Further, it utilizes standard APIs which eases the running of an application.AWS’ service portfolio expands with the addition of Amazon Neptune. The service will help AWS to gain further traction in the market with the growing demand for graph databases in the cloud industry.The company is likely to witness growth in the adoption rate of AWS on the back of an expanding portfolio, consequently aiding top-line growth.Notably, shares of Amazon have returned 39% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 21.1%.Strengthening Competitive PositionWith the latest move, the company is likely to gain competitive edge against its peers.Graph database is an emerging trend in the cloud industry. It provides storage of data in graph format, which includes nodes, edges and properties. Tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are widely adopting this database for data management.Consequently, Amazon’s AWS has immense growth opportunities in the market with Amazon Neptune. Notably, it will compete against the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).Last year, Microsoft Azure introduced Azure Cosmos DB which is a multi-model graph database that manages data efficiently. It also uses APIs to connect and query the datasets.IBM also launched its graph database last year, which is based on open source technologies. Further, Oracle’s has its own graph database, which is also gaining traction. The company is now emphasizing more on self-driving database by leveraging the power of graph database.AWS Gaining TractionWith improving service offerings, AWS continues to perform well in the market. Last quarter, it maintained dominant position in the market. Per the data from Synergy Research, it acquired 33% of market share which came well above the shares of Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.Recently, Amazon teamed up with Kaleido, which is a provider of blockchain business cloud service. The partnership will help the AWS customers to manage their blockchain projects at a higher speed.Amazon Neptune has already been previewed by Samsung, Thomson Reuters, Pearson, Intuit, Siemens, AstraZeneca, FINRA, Blackfynn and Amazon Alexa and the companies have provided strong feedback.Nevertheless, AWS’ clientele is expanding significantly. It has acquired three clients in this month. They are Verizon, Oath and Ryanair. Last month, Shutterfly also migrated its infrastructure to AWS.Additionally, companies like GoDaddy, Cox Automotive, NextGen Healthcare, Amway, LG Electronics selected AWS during the first quarter, by the end of which customer base totaled 10K.We believe Amazon’s strong focus toward innovation will continue to benefit the company’s market position in the long haul.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3169,ORCL,"Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) is streamlining its subscription business, but the good news is marred by continuing trouble with publishers over GDPR, investigations by ACCC and fears about impact of India’s antitrust ruling. Further details-Revamps/Relaunches Music Streaming ServiceAlphabet, which includes YouTube in its Google business, appears to be in the process of simplifying its many music and video offerings.So now, it has a well-tiered array with YouTube Music being the ad supported bottom tier; followed by YouTube Music Premium, which is an all-you-can-eat music service for $9.99 that compares with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Music and Spotify (SPOT  -  Free Report); and YouTube Premium, which includes all the benefits of YouTube Music Premium (ad-free, playlists, download, music recommendations, standalone mobile app, etc) plus original content for $11.99.YouTube Red is scrapped and Google Play Music will likely follow suit given that users automatically gain access to YouTube Music Premium. It isn’t clear where YouTube TV fits in but maybe it’s the ad supported version of original videos.This clarifies the services for customers and also helps the company to focus on the three different segments of the market that have their own opportunities and strengths. It also helps the company fine tune its AI-based recommendations.Management doesn’t talk about the number of subscribers but YouTube is already the go-to site for music lovers all over the world. This change seems to define YouTube’s original content ambitions (the recently launched Karate Kid sequel, Cobra Kai, appears to be a taste of things to come) as it takes on companies like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). Yes, it feels unlikely today, but this is a company with a lot of cash to throw at content and the need to diversify its revenues away from advertising, where competition is increasing every day from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon, with privacy and antitrust issues intensifying as we speak. As YouTube's global head of music, Lyor Cohen says, it also isn’t a winner-win-all kind of business, so there’s no reason to think YouTube won’t do very well.Publisher Trouble Continues as GDPR Kicks InGoogle held a closed door meeting with publishers at its New York HO with other publishers attending through video conferencing at its offices in San Francisco, Washington D.C., Chicago, and London. But the four big trade groups including the News Media Association, European Publishers Council, News Media Alliance and Digital Content Next, representing 4,000 publishers declined to attend after which Google sent individual invites to about a 100 publishers.Google explained its position as co-controller of the data collected and reinforced the fact that publishers would have to obtain user consent. Attendees also received an FAQ and letter after the meeting.The four bodies wanted a written communication from Google about the responsibility it was shouldering with respect to the data collected. If Google doesn’t specify this, they could be held liable under GDPR for misuse of the data collected.However, Google has earlier said that its control over data usage is limited by its agreements with publishers. So it didn’t respond to this demand but said that it would be aligning its advertising tools with that of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe’s and IAB Tech Lab’s Transparency & Consent framework. This is actually good news for publishers because IAB’s framework is an attempt to standardize data collection and usage in the GDPR era.Australia Investigates Data CollectionProbably smarting from the fact that it still hasn’t seen victory over Google in its longstanding dispute over Java, Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) continues to trouble the company. It has now complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) that the Android OS sends location data to Google servers that the consumer is then charged for by the telecom company.It says that the location data is sent whether or not location services are turned on. Google has of course denied the allegation, saying that location services can be turned off by the user if they choose and that it has the permission of users to collect data to improve the services it offers.It added that “Google is completely focused on protecting our users’ data while making the products they love work better for them. Users can see what data is collected and how it’s used in one easy place, My Account, and control it all from there… Any location data that is sent back to Google location servers is anonymized and is not tied or traceable to a specific user”It also accused Oracle: “Like many of Oracle's corporate tactics, this presentation is sleight of hand, not facts, and given that Oracle markets itself as the world's biggest data broker, they know it.” Oracle didn’t respond to this.Both the ACCC and Australia’s Privacy Commissioner are investigating Google’s practices.India Antitrust SetbackThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) ruled in February that Google had abused its dominant position in search to restrict its publisher partners from entering into agreements with other search services to thereby squeeze rivals out of the market. At the time, Google said that the ruling wouldn’t have a significant impact on its business.But in appealing the ruling, the company says that it ""requires Google to change the way it conducts business in India on a lasting basis and the way it designs its search results page in India,"" and added that ""If Google is restricted from entering into certain types of contracts while the appellate review is conducted, Google will be irreparably harmed."" Meanwhile, matchmaking website Matrimony.com, which first brought the case in 2012, has also appealed the decision saying that the $20 million penalty on Google was too small. RecommendationGoogle shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3170,ORCL,"Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) shares have moved down 4.9% in the last month. Here are some of the stories that helped offset the negative news flow on China-Cozying Up With PublishersGoogle has launched a news reading service called Subscribe with Google to capitalize on publishers’ recent disenchantment with Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), as it started increasing focus on posts from family and friends. There are 17 initial partners including FT.com, The Washington Post, McClatchy Company publications and others.What’s more, Google has agreed to transfer 95% of what is generated to publishers, except for subscriptions coming through the Google Play Store, in which case they’ll get a smaller 85%. But this is still significantly higher than the 70% paid out to date.Its advanced artificial intelligence capabilities will also offer a “propensity to subscribe” tool, with a News Consumer Insights dashboard providing additional reader analysis to identify subscription opportunities.It’s also creating a Disinfo Lab with Harvard's Kennedy School and along with Poynter Institute, Stanford University and the Local Media Association, it is launching an organization called MediaWise that will focus on developing digital literacy in the youth.Google has earmarked $300 million over three years that it will use to support various projects facilitating the digitization of journalism.  Meanwhile in the EU, Google has asked publishers to obtain permission on its behalf to collect and use personal information for ad targeting as required by the soon-to-be-enforceable GDPR. This is being read in different ways, but Google would likely be in the position of both the controller and processor of that data.Under GDPR rules, the party determining the purposes and means of personal data processing is a “controller” with the party actually doing that work on its behalf according to its guidelines being the “processor.” Since the controller is required to ensure that processor contracts are in compliance, it could mean additional paper work and complexities for publishers.Supporting RetailersGoogle has been working with leading retailers including Target, Walmart, Ulta Beauty, Costco and Home Depot to launch a system that can help customers search and buy products across a range of devices including voice-activated ones.The service is enabled through product listing across Google Search, Google Express shopping service, inside the Google Assistant app for smartphones and on smart speakers like the Google Home. So customers can add to their carts no matter where they are or which Google device they appear to be using at the time.Google can also bring additional online shopping experiences to these retailers including things like1-click re-ordering, personalized recommendations and basket-building that Amazon offers, especially on its Echo devices.The initiative will help retailers take on Amazon and will generate additional revenue for Google.Moving the Driverless Car ForwardIn another sign that the company is ready to diversify the cars in its fleet, Waymo announced that it would start testing up to 20K of the newly-launched Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicles within the first two years of production for inclusion in its next fleet by 2020.Jaguar's I-PACE is the first electric vehicle from India's Tata Motors.Earlier, it hinted that an agreement with Honda Motors was afoot. Other companies that could work with the company include Volkswagen and Hyundai Motor.The developments are encouraging given that Uber’s self-driving car killed a pedestrian in Arizona earlier this month that resulted in the suspension of its testing license in the state and calls for regulation of self-driving cars. Toyota Motors also withdraw its self-driving test vehicles on these concerns. Waymo remains extremely confident however, and is on track to launch a self-driving taxi service in the Phoenix, Arizona area within a few months, before a broader rollout.Separately, Google’searly-stage venture fund Gradient Ventures led a $6 million funding round in Scotty Labs, a nine-person startup focused on remote control of self-driving cars.And in New Zealand, Google founder Larry Page’s investment in Kitty Hawk appears to be paying off with the company unveiled Cora, a flying taxi with speeds of up to 150 kmh (93 mph), a range of 100 kilometers and vertical takeoff. Others in the flying car race include Chinese firm EHang, Airbus and Uber.Managing the StreetIndia has denied permission to Google to roll out its Street View service in the country citing security concerns. Google was looking to make the service, which offers a panoramic view of streets and their surroundings, available as part of its Google Maps and Google Earth apps.Figuring out street addresses in rapidly expanding or unplanned municipalities is however a major challenge for digital businesses, which may be looking to deliver goods and/or services purchased online. Increasingly, this messes with logistics and costs both time and money.  So Google, Amazon, startups and others are working on solutions. Google for example has launched what it calls a “plus code,” which comprises a ""six-character + city"" format that can be generated, shared and searched by anyone, including third-party apps.Another tool it unveiled is called Smart Address Search, which uses machine learning to help a user find a location on the basis of nearby landmarks. It also helps people locate long and complicated addresses. Other Imp News-The court has allowed Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) to revive its multi-billion Case Against Alphabet over JavaEven as China prepares to attain AI leadership by 2025, 3,031 Alphabet employees  petitioned the company to get out of the Pentagon’s AI program that harnesses AI for video analysis that could improve drone targetingAlphabet is working with farmers to determine how AI can be used to improve crop yields.Google successfully pulled Shopify from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) as the company has now chosen the Google Cloud for most of its infrastructure needs although it will continue to use Amazon for some thingsAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3171,ORCL,"A successful portfolio manager is aware of the importance of having well-performing stocks in one’s portfolio. Indicators of a stock’s consistent performance include a rally in share price and robust fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short lived. The stock has the potential to perform well over the long run.Accenture’s share-price movement has been quite encouraging. In the last one year, its shares have appreciated 34.5%, while the industry to which it belongs to recorded a decline of 30.5%.What’s Driving Accenture?Accenture is one of the leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services in the world. The company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and robust fundamentals. It delivered a positive earnings surprise in three out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3%.Last quarter, Accenture reported sturdy year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings. The year-over-year upswing was primarily driven by its continued focus on innovative product roll outs, continued investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions.Furthermore, Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. The company closed 37 acquisition deals worth approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017. Also, over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies, including start-ups.These acquisitions have helped the company enhance its product offerings and penetrate into newer markets, thereby contributing to the company’s top line. We believe its acquisition strategy will have a positive impact on Accenture’s top-line performances in the upcoming quarters.Apart from acquisitions, Accenture’s strategic partnerships with companies like Google, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) have also been key catalysts.  Partnerships have always helped the company fortify its presence across segments like IT security, customer-relationship management and consulting, in turn bolstering its revenues. We expect the company to retain this bullish momentum, backed by its continued focus on operational efficiency.Bottom LineGiven that the company’s long-term earnings per share growth rate is 10% and has a VGM Style Score of A, we believe the stock still has much upside potential. We can essentially filter the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3172,ORCL,"The Wall Street logged the strongest year since 2013 with the S&P 500 gaining 19.4% and the Dow Jones capping 25.1% gains last year, with the highest-ever number of record closes. Blockbuster corporate earnings and the resurgent global economic growth were the major catalysts in driving the stocks throughout the year.Growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, buoyed by an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and high consumer confidence. Notably, the economy expanded at the fastest clip in three years in best back-to-back quarters with at least 3% GDP growth and unemployment at the lowest level of 4.1% since December 2000. Americans are highly optimistic about the economy, with consumer confidence hovering near the highest level in 17 years (read: 7 Biggest ETF Stories of 2017 to Continue in 2018).This combined with the optimism over the biggest tax overhaul in decades has raised the appeal for riskier assets. The new tax structure will save billions in the corporate world, boosting earnings and reflation trade. It would further spark a wave of share buybacks, dividend hikes and mergers & acquisitions. All these suggest that an eight-year bull market still has legs and will strengthen the second-largest bull run in the history.If these aren’t enough, oil price has also rebounded strongly to $60 per barrel and will continue rising given easing global supply cut and increasing demand. Nevertheless, North Korea tensions, Brexit concerns, Fed aggressive rates hike, Washington turmoil, mid-term elections and overvaluation fears might weigh on the stock performance.Given this, we have highlighted a pack of ETFs that look to outperform in 2018 given the current trends.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA): This ETF, tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has been the biggest beneficiary of the rotation in leadership in the large-cap domestic space and Trump’s pro-growth policies. The index has moved up 5,000-points this year — the biggest annual gain in its history. The bullish trend is likely to continue this year. With AUM of $22.3 billion, the fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 8 ETF Predictions for 2018).SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report): The banking sector will enjoy the dual tailwinds of lower taxes and rising rates. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, tax cuts would add 16% to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18% in 2019 while AB Bernstein sees earnings per share jumping 12-20% at large banks and 15-25% at mid-caps banks in 2018. Tax reform may result in a further rise in interest rates that would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. KRE is one of largest and the most-popular ETFs in the banking space with AUM of over $4.3 billion and a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook (read: ETFs to Bet on the Final Tax Bill: What Hot, What's Not).First Trust Nasdaq Oil & Gas ETF (FTXN  -  Free Report): The energy sector is poised for a surge given that the historic OPEC output cut deal has started to pay off with the global oil market on its way toward balancing, by draining out some of the excess inventory. The oil market has returned in a state of backwardation, where later-dated contracts are cheaper than near-term contracts, after three long years. This signals that the oil market is tightening and demand is robust, paving the way for an oil rally. FTXN seems a compelling choice as it measures the performance of the most liquid oil and gas securities from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index screened through volatility, value and growth. The fund is overlooked by investors with AUM of just $4.2 million. It carries a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (read: Oil ETFs Head-to-Head: BNO vs. USO).Vanguard Small-Cap Growth ETF (VBK  -  Free Report): The corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% is a big boon to small caps as these pay higher taxes with a median effective tax rate of 31.9% compared with 28% for the S&P 500 companies and 23.8% for the blue chip Dow Jones stocks. Additionally, a strengthening economy will provide further boost to these pint-sized stocks that are closely tied to the U.S. economy and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. VBK, with AUM of $7 billion, targets the growth corner of the small-cap segment and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Best Small-Cap ETFs of 2017 with Huge Upside in 2018).iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report): Defense ETFs are poised to surge from a steep $700 billion increase in military spending, nuclear threats from North Korea, and higher demand from commercial aviation. ITA has AUM of $4.9 billion and a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF (IYW  -  Free Report): The technology sector will continue its hot streak in 2018 buoyed by repatriation tax holiday plan, which allows tech titans to bring back its offshore cash home at a reduced rate. Per Moody’s, the top five U.S. hoarders are from the technology sector, namely Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), which hold 88% of their money overseas. This would propel the stock prices of these companies higher. IYW has the largest concentration on these firms with a combined 42.7% of assets. As such, the ETF, having AUM of $4 billion and Zacks ETF Rank #1 with a Medium risk outlook, has a huge potential upside (read: 5 Tech ETFs That Crushed FANG ETFs in 2017).iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF (DIVB  -  Free Report): This ETF has shown strong momentum since its debut in early November 2017, accumulating nearly $2.6 million in AUM and will likely to do so in 2018. This is because it invests in U.S. companies that return capital to shareholders by paying dividends or buying back their stock. And new tax structure will lead to increased buybacks and fatty dividends.First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (FXD  -  Free Report): Solid job additions, slowly rising wages and rising consumer confidence are allowing consumers to spend extra money on a wide range of products. Further, lower tax rates for both corporates and individuals would lead to more savings that in turn boost discretionary spending. Notably, the new tax rates for individuals are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% compared with the current structure of 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%. That said, FXD looks like an intriguing pick as it follows an AlphaDEX methodology and ranks stocks in the space by various growth and value factors, eliminating the bottom ranked 25%. The fund has AUM of $508.9 million and a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3173,ORCL,"Shares of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) opened higher on Friday one day after the company posted quarterly earnings results that topped expectations. Now, as investors begin to assess Microsoft’s financial report in greater detail, let’s look at how one of its legacy businesses is still thriving while the company dives further into new growth areas.Microsoft’s adjusted quarterly earnings surged 36% from the year-ago period to hit $0.95 per share, which handily topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85 per share. Meanwhile, the company’s overall revenues also beat our estimate and popped 16% to reach $26.82 billion.Some of this growth can be attributed to the tech powerhouse’s effort to expand its offerings as the personal computer and related software industry slips. “Our results this quarter reflect the trust people and organizations are placing in the Microsoft Cloud,” CEO Satya Nadella said in the company’s quarterly earnings statement.“We are innovating across key growth categories of infrastructure, AI, productivity, and business applications to deliver differentiated value to customers.”Microsoft’s push into artificial intelligence and other new tech spaces will help the firm compete against fellow industry giants such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) going forward. But while Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business impressed, Microsoft Office continued to prove its worth.  Productivity and Business ProcessesMicrosoft’s Productivity and Business Processes unit contains Office products, cloud services, LinkedIn, as well as its Dynamics CRM businesses. The company reported overall Productivity and Business Processes revenues of $9.01 billion. This marked a 17% climb and also topped our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate of $8.76 billion.Breaking the Productivity and Business Processesbusiness unit down further, Office commercial products and cloud services revenue increased by 14%. One of Microsoft’s most notable acquisitions in recent years, LinkedIn, saw its revenue surge 37%.Two of the top three individual businesses that saw the biggest growth were Office 365 commercial and Dynamics 365. Office 365 revenue, which is made up of widely popular Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other applications, soared 42%—the third largest individual climb.Microsoft’s growing cloud-based CRM and ERP segment, Dynamics 365, was the second biggest mover, with revenues skyrocketing 65%. Clearly, investors should be pleased to see that the company has been able to expand the Productivity and Business Processes unit, while newer segments, such as Intelligent Cloud continue to climb.With that said, Intelligent Cloud’s Azure segment was the biggest individual climber, posting 93% growth. Investors should also note that Microsoft’s two other key business units, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing, both topped our NFM consensus estimates.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3174,ORCL,"Shares of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) climbed in after-hours trading on Thursday after the company reported strong quarterly earnings results. But aside from the tech giant’s top and bottom line beats, investors need to understand how its specific business units performed during Microsoft’s fiscal third quarter.Microsoft posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share and overall revenues of $26.82 billion, both of which beat our Zacks Consensus Estimates. Both also marked year-over-year gains of 36% and 16%, respectively, which are hardly insignificant for a company of its size and age.Still, investors need to focus on the company’s individual business segments as Microsoft tries to expand far beyond personal computers and related software into growth areas such as artificial intelligence. This expansion is expected to help Microsoft better compete with the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) going forward.With that said, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit is one of the company’s fastest growing and most important businesses. Intelligent CloudMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit contains its server and enterprise products, including the quickly growing Azure segment. Our exclusive Zacks non-financial metrics consensus estimate file called for quarterly Intelligent Cloud revenues to climb roughly 14% to hit $7.70 billion.Intelligent Cloud revenue actually climbed 17% to reach $7.79 billion. The unit’s server products and cloud services revenue popped 20% from the year-ago period, while enterprise services revenue rose 8%. Investors should also be pleased to note that Azure revenue soared 93%, after skyrocketing 98% last quarter.For the first nine months of Microsoft’s current fiscal year, Intelligent Cloud revenues are up over 15% to $22.61 billion. This key business unit is likely to become even more valuable going forward as cloud computing counties to proliferate.It is also worth noting that Microsoft’s other two key business units, Productivity & Business Processes and More Personal Computing, both topped our NFM consensus estimates.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3175,ORCL,"Shares of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) closed lower on Wednesday, just one day before the release of the historic tech power’s quarterly financial results. Microsoft has performed well over the last year, but heading into its earnings report, investors should know what to expect from the company’s specific business units.Microsoft stock has surged 37% over the last year at a time when the global demand for personal computers—and related software—has plummeted. Instead, investors have rewarded Microsoft for its expansion into different growth sectors, from artificial intelligence to cloud computing.The company now has its sights set on competing against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) in the cloud computing industry, while it also aims to become a larger player in the IoT space. With all that said, let’s look at what is in store for Microsoft this quarter.Microsoft’s quarterly revenues are expected to climb 9.1% to reach $25.71 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, on the other end of the income statement, Microsoft’s quarterly earnings are projected to surge 16.4% to hit $0.85 per share.Key Business Segment EstimatesBut of course, earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be looking at when Microsoft reports on Thursday. In fact, it is possible that any post-earnings momentum Microsoft might experience could be driven by the performance of its three primary business segments: Productivity & Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.Microsoft’s Productivity & Business Processes unit includes the company’s Office, Office 365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics CRM businesses, which are hugely important. With that said, Productivity & Business Processes revenues are expected to hit $8.76 billion, according to these NFM consensus estimates.This would mark 10% growth from the $7.96 billion Microsoft reported in the prior-year period. Last quarter, Productivity and Business Processes revenues surged roughly 24% to $8.95 billion.Moving on, another segment that investors should pay close attention to is Microsoft’s growing Intelligent Cloud business, which contains its server and enterprise products, including Azure. This unit is projected to climb about 14% from $6.76 billion to reach $7.70 billion.In the previous quarter, Intelligent Cloud revenues hit $7.79 billion, which marked a 15% climb. Investors should note that Azure revenue skyrocketed 98% last quarter.Lastly, Microsoft’s More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, Gaming, Devices, and Search businesses, is expected to report revenues of $9.29 billion. This would mark a roughly 5% surge from the $8.84 billion Microsoft reported in the year-ago period.More Personal Computing posted revenues of $12.17 billion last quarter, which marked a roughly 2% expansion. Investors should note that the massive sequential decline is largely due to holiday period sales.Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Microsoft’s actual results!More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3176,ORCL,"The first quarter of 2018 was a bumpy ride for the overall technology sector, thanks to the slew of bad news, which includes the Russian hacking of computers at the 2018 Olympics, data misuse scandal at Facebook (FB), and the first casualty by a driverless car. Despite a highly volatile market, Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock which marked a remarkable run in the first quarter of 2018.In fact, Salesforce’s shares appreciated 13.8% in Q1, substantially outperforming 5.4% growth recorded by the industry. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK  -  Free Report) return was just 2.3%, and all major indices, including Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500, ended the quarter in red. In the year-to-date period, the stock has gained 16.9%.Salesforce is the fastest growing enterprise software company, which in fiscal 2018, achieved the milestone of $10-billion sales mark. Furthermore, looking at the company’s strong fundamental growth drivers, we are confident of its ability to reach the long-term target of $20-$22 billion in revenues by fiscal 2022.Therefore, we believe the company has huge growth potential and investors should stay invested in the stock for better returns. Let’s look at the reasons behind this optimism.Acquisitions Driving Revenue GrowthAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the last two years, the company has closed or was in the midst of as many as 16 acquisitions, worth billions of dollars, including its latest biggest-ever buyout agreement — MuleSoft. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship-management solution-providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to drive Salesforce’s top-line performance in the quarters ahead.Partnerships Stoking International GrowthSalesforce still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, the company noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon and Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which had been curbing its growth potentials. However, in 2016, the company decided to utilize the geographical reach of other data-center service providers in a bid to expand its international business.The company’s first partnership in this space was with Amazon Web Services in 2016, followed by the next alliance with Alphabet last November. During third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company won several deals due to its international-expansion initiatives. Companies like National Australia Bank, BP, Group PSA and Hitachi picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation. It is most likely that the company will continue winning international deals which will drive its top- and bottom-line results over the long run.Partner Program Adding CustomersTremendous growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. Notably, Salesforce’s partner certification has witnessed five-time growth over the last four years and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with more than 11,000 skilled consultants.Notably, a number of big organizations, including Siemens, ABB, Deutsche Bahn and BBVA became Salesforce’s partners during fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. We expect the trend to continue which will drive its overall financial performance.Bottom LineGiven the solid fundamental growth drivers, we consider that Salesforce is one such technology stock which is worthy of remaining in investors’ portfolio. The stock has grabbed the spotlight with its striking performances on the back of solid earnings results and robust growth projections. Keeping this in mind, we perceive that investing in this stock will yield higher returns. Long-term expected EPS growth rate for the stock is currently pegged at 24.2% which is substantially higher than the industry average of 12%.Currently, Salesforce has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

3177,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) filed a lawsuit, almost eight years back, against Google, accusing it of infringing on the company’s patented Java technology. The lawsuit alleged that Google had used Java Application Programming Interfaces (API) illegally to develop the Androidoperating system (OS). Recently, Oracle released a statement which affirmed that it has won the lawsuit per Federal Circuit verdict.Google was accused of copying 11,500 lines of Java code unfairly into its core Android OS. Per the court, as revealed by Associated Press, Google earned $42 billion till date from advertising revenues via Android, since the first Android-phone was marketed in 2008. When a free-to-use resource generates significant amount, it does raise eyebrows.Brief HistoryInitially, both the parties were anticipated to settle claims. However, till 2012, the jury could not reach a consensus whether Google’s usage of APIs fell under the “fair use” clause “which permits copying under limited circumstances.”Oracle’s damage expert claimed $8.8 billion as compensation for profits made by Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), in addition to $475 million for damages in March 2016. However, Alphabet was relievedafter being acquitted in May 2016 by the U.S. jury.Still, Oracle remained adamant to its claim and appealed to the Federal Circuit court for a second trial.What’s in the Offing?Per Reuters, the case was sent to a U.S. judge for trial. The judge is handed over the task to determine the compensation that Oracle must receive from Alphabet’s unit.Meanwhile, Google is performing calculations on its own and might challenge the verdict by appealing to the Supreme Court.What Investors Need to KnowShares of Oracle returned 2% in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 index growth of 10.8%. The computer software giant, Oracle is elated and claims that copyright protection provides programmers with incentives to innovate. It might be successful in gaining royalty for Google’s use of Java.Oracle is well on its path of a step-by-step cloud transition. The move is benefitting the company, which is reflected in the recent earnings report. We feel that Oracle stock is promising, given the future prospects of clouds.Management anticipates SaaS gross margin to eventually rise to 80% in the long haul. According to an IDC market report, SaaS will remain a dominant cloud computing category, capturing nearly two-thirds of all public-cloud spendings in 2018.In the past 7 days, fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 estimates were revised upward, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising significantly from 93 cents to 94 cents per share. The figure reflects year-over-year growth of 2.26%.Oracle is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock and carries a VGM Score of B.Meanwhile, Google is going to be hurt along with other software developers. In conclusion, Android might become expensive.Notably, shares of Alphabet returned 18.5% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 index growth of 10.8%. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of B. Google spokesman, Patrick Lenihan informed, ""We are disappointed the court reversed the jury finding that Java is open and free for everyone. This type of ruling will make apps and online services more expensive for users.”Key PicksThe Ultimate Software Group, Inc. (ULTI  -  Free Report) and DST Systems, Inc.  are other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the Computer-Software industry. Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3178,ORCL,"Holding onto shares of Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) might not be a good option at the moment. Its shares have lost 0.27% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 9.62%. Further, shares of Oracle went down more than 9%, yesterday, following its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.The decline stemmed from the soft cloud outlook. Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 19% and 23% (17-21% in constant currency), much lower than 32% (29% in constant currency)  reported in the last quarter.Intensifying CompetitionOracle’s slowing cloud growth is indicative of an ominous outcome whereby the company might be completely overwhelmed by competitors. The company faces significant competition in most of its operational markets (database, applications, storage, cloud computing) from the likes of Dell-EMC, IBM, HP, Microsoft, Sybase, SAP, Salesforce.com, Workday and Teradata.The trend toward consolidation is increasing competition for the company in most of these markets. To differentiate products here, large vendors are entering into alliances or partnerships to offer integrated and differentiating solutions. As a result, Oracle continues to face severe pricing pressure and lengthy sales cycles in its core business, which is hurting profitability. We note that the company is a late entrant in the field of cloud computing and consequently is expected to face tough competition going forward. This stiff competition is expected to hurt margins and will make revenue growth difficult, going forward.Other Possible TroublesWe believe that Oracle’s business model transition will hurt revenue growth over the next couple of years. The company expects to gain a significant part of its revenues from SaaS compared with legacy on-premise licensing business. However, SaaS revenues will not be recognized upfront as in the case of license business, which will hurt top-line growth in the near term.Further, higher investments on IaaS platform will affect gross margin expansion in the near term. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind.Total hardware revenues in the last reported quarter also slipped 3% (down 7% at constant currency) year over year to $994 million. Services revenues decreased 2% (6% at constant currency) to $796 million.We believe that the ongoing transition to cloud will make it difficult for the hardware segment to perform well on a standalone basis. Although engineered systems are expected to drive growth, we believe that lower hardware volumes will continue to hurt top-line growth over the next couple of years. Moreover, hardware is significantly lower margin business that will keep margins under pressure, going forward.Bottom LineOracle is currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could change if analysts revise their estimates to match the company’s slightly more upbeat earnings guidance. Improved analyst sentiment might kick start the stock after its post-earnings selloff, so investors should keep their eyes on that as a potential bullish indicator.Nevertheless, ORCL has turned out to be a volatile stock recently, considering the aforementioned factors, it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio, at least for now.Key PicksFew better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3179,ORCL,"Shares of Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) dropped more than 9% in morning trading Tuesday after the company reported its latest quarterly financial results yesterday afternoon. The software giant’s new figures were mixed, and investors clearly felt unsatisfied. But is this a post-earnings overreaction? Is now a great time to buy ORCL on the dip? Let’s take a closer look.Latest ResultsFor the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Oracle witnessed adjusted earnings per share of $0.83, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.72. Meanwhile, the company saw revenue figures of $9.77 billion, coming in just below our consensus estimate of $9.79 billion.Total revenues were up 6%. Segment wise, Cloud and On-Premise Software Revenues climbed 8%, while Cloud Software as a Service revenues soared 33%.In Oracle’s earnings conference call, CEO Safra Catz told analysts that the firm expects to report adjusted earnings of $0.92 to $0.95 per share and revenue growth of 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter. Heading into the report data, our Zacks Consensus Estimates were calling for earnings of $0.90 per share and revenue growth of 2.6%.But the real concern for investors is Oracle’s slowing cloud growth. Management guided for total cloud revenues to improve between 19% and 23% in Q4, which is sluggish compared to the 32% growth it saw this quarter—and even worse considering the 51% and 44% rates it witnessed in Q1 and Q2.Possible ProblemsOne potentially troubling outcome related to Oracle’s slowing cloud growth is that the firm will be swallowed up by competitors. Oracle is decreasing its dependency on software sales for corporate datacenters, but on-premises revenues still accounted for 66% of total revenue in the latest quarter. Meanwhile, cloud platform as a service and cloud infrastructure as a service generated about $415 million in sales, up just 28% year over year.Compared to the market-leading cloud infrastructure service from Amazon (AMZN), Amazon Web Services, Oracle looks tiny. In the most recent quarter, AWS saw revenue growth of 45% to touch $5.11 billion.Lackluster MomentumOracle’s inability to stick out from the rest of the tech crowd also reflects itself in its stock’s lack of momentum. With Tuesday’s losses factored in, ORCL is up just 3% over the last year, which looks especially lackluster in the face of what has been an incredible run for the rest of the tech sector—especially Oracle’s large-cap competitors.Value Play?Based on Monday’s closing price, Oracle was trading at just 17x forward 12-month earnings, marking a discount to its industry’s average. Tuesday’s 9% slump will drag the stock even further into value territory. However, ORCL has been a rollercoaster ride over the past 52 weeks, and it likely won’t see the steady and volatility-free returns that value investors prefer.Bottom LineOracle is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could change if analysts revise their estimates to match the company’s slightly more upbeat earnings guidance. Improved analyst sentiment might kick start the stock after its post-earnings selloff, so investors should keep their eyes on that as a potential bullish indicator.Nevertheless, ORCL has proven to be an up-and-down stock recently, and with legitimate concerns lingering about its ability to compete in a crowded cloud computing landscape, some investors may want to stay away.Want more market analysis from this author?

Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 6.4%.

3181,ORCL,"Paylocity Holding (PCTY  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 220.1%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 22% and a market cap of $3.03 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to retain in their portfolio if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Paylocity, a provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management (HCM) software solutions, is gaining from its regular investments in SaaS technology.Over the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services contributed significantly to its revenues. Hence, regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovation, will continue to boost the company’s top line.Notably, Paylocity stock has gained 30.2% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 27.7%.We believe that accelerated adoption of the company’s robust portfolio has aided the company’s financials. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s revenues came in at $113.4 million, reflecting an increase of 25.6% year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $111 million.Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) Paylocity Holding Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Paylocity Holding Corporation QuoteApart from the organic enrichment of the portfolio, management is extremely optimistic about the acquisition of BeneFLEX. This new buyout has added a host of benefit administration related solutions and is expected to drive its revenues further.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from existing players like Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Paychex, Inc., (PAYX  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) among others remains a major headwind.

3183,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered modest third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. However, revenues of $9.776 billion came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate figure of $9.771 billion.Earnings increased 20.3% from the year-ago quarter. This can primarily be attributed to 6% (2% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was higher than management’s guidance of 2-4%.Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16% of total revenue compared with 13% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 32% (29% in constant currency) to $1.57 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 8% (4% in constant currency) to $7.98 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Shares Decline on Soft OutlookShares were down 7.2% in after-hour trading following the results. In the past year, the company’s shares have gained just 15.8%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 37.9%.The decline stemmed from the soft cloud outlook. Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 19% and 23% (17-21% in constant currency), much lower than 32% (29% in constant currency)  reported in the last quarter.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineCloud SaaS revenues advanced a significant 33% (31% in constant currency) year over year to $1.151 billion. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues surged 28% (24% in constant currency) to $415 million.On-premise software revenues (66% of total revenues compared with 67% in the year-ago quarter) increased 4% (flat at constant currency) to $6.4 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM soared 65%. Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now fully available and is a key catalyst for the company. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).Software license updates and product support revenues were almost $5.027 billion, up 6% (1% in constant currency). On a combined basis, on-premise support and SaaS revenues were up 8%.Total hardware revenues slipped 3% (down 7% at constant currency) year over year to $994 million. Services revenues decreased 2% (6% at constant currency) to $796 million.Operating DetailsCloud Software as a service margin came in at 67% as compared with 65% reported in the year-ago quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS margin came in at 35% as compared with 46% reported in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 140 basis points (bps) to 56.1%. The decline was due to lower hardware, Software license updates and product support and research & development expenses, which were down 10%, 17% and 2%, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 44%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Feb 28, 2018, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $70.45 billion, down from $71.58 billion sequentially. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $15.19 billion, while free cash flow was $13.3 billion.Share Repurchases & Dividends ContinueOracle repurchased around 81 million shares worth $4 billion during the quarter. Over the last 12 months, the company repurchased shares worth $7 billion and paid dividends of approximately $3.2 billion. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, payable on May 1, 2018.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter, total revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 1-3% and 0% to (2%) in constant currency.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be between 92 cents and 95 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 90 cents per share.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Few better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corp.

3185,ORCL,"Five9, Inc. (FIVN  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results tomorrow. The company has a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, coming up with an impressive average positive earnings surprise of 193.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Five9 is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Five9 carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -26.3%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, we note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 30 days.However, the company is likely to continue reporting top and bottom-line growth on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter earnings is pegged at 3 cents, which indicates a massive improvement from the year-ago quarter’s breakeven earnings. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $55.1 million, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Five9, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Five9, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Five9, Inc. Quote Factors to ConsiderFive9 offers a virtual contact-center cloud platform that acts as a hub for interaction between clients and customers. The company has strong partnerships with industry leaders such as Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Zendesk, and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report). These partnerships have enabled it to offer greater flexibility, enhanced experience and cloud-based solutions to consumers. This is likely to have generated incremental revenues through higher customer reach.It should be noted that the cloud-based contact-center solution industry has been witnessing growth for the past several quarters, as organizations are looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support. We believe Five9’s cloud contact-center software, along with the ongoing execution, places the company in a great position to capitalize on this opportunity. Consequently, this is anticipated to reflect in the to-be-reported quarterly results.Moreover, the company’s continued focus on expanding its product portfolio is anticipated to have bolstered the top-line performance.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3187,ORCL,"The technology sector has been the star performer of 2017 with the S&P 500 Information Technology Index gaining 37.6% compared with a gain of 19.8% for the S&P 500 Index.Inside The SurgeThe combination of strong corporate earnings and the soaring FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — has been the major driver of the stellar performance. Notably, cutting-edge technology such as autonomous cars, cloud computing, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence are fueling exceptional growth in the sector, offsetting struggling traditional businesses like PCs and smartphones.Encouraging fundamentals like improved overseas demand and a rising interest rate scenario are also adding to the strength. Further, Trump’s new tax structure, which allows companies to bring back cash held overseas at lower rates, are propelling the stocks higher. Per Moody’s, the top five U.S. hoarders are from the technology sector, namely Apple, Microsoft, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) Alphabet, and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), which hold 88% of their money overseas.Moreover, the industry is benefiting from an astronomical surge in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin that has pushed semiconductor stocks to record highs.

3188,ORCL,"On Dec 6, we issued an updated research report on Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report), a Redwood City, CA-based enterprise-grade database, middleware and application software provider.Oracle, which enjoys a dominant position in the enterprise software and database management system (DBMS) software market, is gaining ground in the cloud sector as well.However, the business model transition will adversely affect the company in the near term as revenues from SaaS are recognized later against upfront revenues from legacy on-premise licensing business. Additionally, increased spending for the transition negatively impacts margins.Oracle stock has gained 25.9% year to date, underperforming the 31.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Key FactorsOracle’s next-generation autonomous database, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Among infrastructure, DBMS is expected to record strong growth driven by Big Data and digitalization initiatives. We believe that Oracle’s leading position in the DBMS software market will make it the primary beneficiary of this increased spending.Moreover, Oracle is gaining from a significant momentum of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. It is winning market share against salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report), which is a significant growth driver. We believe the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Oracle Corporation QuoteBoth its software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products are anticipated to  witness robust growth over the next few years as enterprises increasingly transition to the cloud. According to an IDC market report, SaaS will remain the dominant cloud computing type, capturing nearly two thirds of all public cloud spending in 2017 and roughly 60% in 2020. To tap this massive opportunity, Oracle introduced a number of Cloud Platform services in the last few quarters that will not only help personalize SaaS applications, which are currently in demand but also support easy migration of on-premise applications to Oracle Cloud.However, the late revenue recognition from a SaaS based business model will be a drag on the top line. Moreover, additional spending on PaaS and IaaS will keep margins under pressure in the near term. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the cloud business from Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a concern for the company.Zacks RankOracle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3189,ORCL,"We have hit a lull as far as earnings reports go, and Wall Street’s attention has shifted from tax benefits and strong guidance to international trade debates and continued turnover at the White House. Still, Q4 earnings season was strong across the board, and as several major companies with non-traditional calendars report in the coming days, investors will hope that this trend continues.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of March 19.1. Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report)Software giant Oracle is scheduled to release its latest quarterly financial results after the closing bell on March 19. Continued adoption of cloud infrastructure has been a growth catalyst for Oracle, but the company’s stock has proven to be much more volatile than many of its tech peers. Shares of ORCL are up just 15% over the past year, and patient investors have endured significant up-and-down swings over that time.Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, we expect Oracle to report revenues of $9.8 billion and adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 5.5% and 4.4%, respectively. Last quarter, cloud revenues surged 44%, so investors will want to pay close attention to this segment when Oracle reports. 2. Nike, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report)Athletic apparel behemoth Nike is slated to announce its latest quarterly earnings details after the market closes on March 22. Headwinds at major retail partners and shifting consumer habits have put pressure on companies like Nike, but the company’s remarkable brand portfolio and market share should support results. NKE is carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) into its report date.According our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, Nike is projected to report adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents, down more than 23% from the year-ago period. However, expected revenues of $8.8 billion would mark an improvement of 4.7% year over year. 3. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report)Red-hot semiconductor memory solutions company Micron is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on March 22. Micron has skyrocketed on the back of rising demand for its memory chips, as well as improvements to its own operations. The stock has gained more than 130% over the past year and is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ahead of its report.Our Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron to report adjusted earnings of $2.76 per share and total revenues of $7.23 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 206.7% and 55.5%, respectively. Want more market analysis from this author?

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Oracle is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORCL in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORCL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.44% heading into earnings season.Oracle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Oracle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

3191,ORCL,"Cloud computing has been one of the most well-known drivers of growth in the technology industry over the last few years. And while the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) hog the headlines, IT behemoth Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) is currently one of the largest cloud computing firms in the world.Oracle also competes directly with Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report) and has seen its cloud revenues climb recently. Last quarter, its cloud sales surged 44% to hit $1.5 billion.In the current quarter, the company is expected to see its overall sales climb by 5.51% to hit $9.79 billion. Oracle is also projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings hit $0.72 per share, which would mark 4.35% growth from the year-ago period. Still, investors need to consider a few more metrics to understand if the company is poised to top this estimate.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Oracle currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.79%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of ORCL’s Q3 results. When paired with the company’s current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) standing, investors should consider the stock as one that could be poised to top estimates.Investors should also note that Oracle has topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 7.49%.Oracle is set to report its Q3 fiscal 2018 earnings results after market close on Monday, March 19.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3192,ORCL,"Mirroring a banner 2017, this year is likely to be a great one for mega tech stocks. Big tech companies are hitting record-highs of late, with shares outpacing the S&P 500 since its nadir on Feb 8.President Trump has delivered historic relief to tech majors by lowering tax rates. This in turn is boosting profit margins. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT), which connects various devices to the cloud, is expected to be a huge growth driver for tech majors. Given the bullishness, sound large-cap tech stocks continue to be popular among sell-side analysts.  How Did Tech Bigwigs Fare?Tech heavyweights continue to influence the U.S. stock market,  for good reason. Investing in large-cap tech stocks turned out to be a winning strategy, especially during the recent bout of gyration that sent the stock market into correction.In fact, the much-loved tech sector rallied 9% year to date, while the broader S&P 500 went up just 3.4%. Mega-sized tech names like the FAANG stocks — Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — contributed the lion’s share and recently hit intraday record highs.Amazon, in particular, jumped more than 30% since the start of the year and contributed almost fifth of the gains in the S&P 500, per Silverblatt.Sell-Side Analysts Back Big TechsSolid performance by tech bigwigs compelled sell-side analysts to root for them. These stocks are recording rapid earnings and revenue growth that forced brokerage firms to take note.Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote to investors “net buy ratings of major tech players remain extremely high relative to history.”Giant Tech Stocks to Make Billions Under Tax PlanThe Republican tax overhaul policy is providing the much-needed windfall to large tech companies. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. This extra cash is helping the companies pursue a combination of share buybacks, dividend payouts and M&A activities.Let us not forget, tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying hefty corporate taxes on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under the latest tax reduction plan.The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force for big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest. Tech Companies to Get BiggerNotable Internet companies like Amazon and Facebook are expected to grow at a fast pace on a significant rise in revenues in the near term. They are expected to take advantage of the large number of advertisements and e-commerce that will still move online.Substantial growth in cloud computing and the IoT, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launch of complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech will keep rolling.5 Tech Behemoths to BuyBanking on the aforesaid positives, tech majors are poised to see higher earnings. These stocks have, thus, become a tempting option for investors.

3193,ORCL,"Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 28. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this customer relationship management solution provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, Salesforce has delivered positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 6.5%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Salesforce is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Salesforce currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.51%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 33 cents, which is 17.9% higher than the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 28 cents. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.81 billion, up 22.6% from the prior-year quarter tally.Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.Acquisitions Boosting Top-Line GrowthAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the last two years, the company has closed as many as 14 acquisitions worth billions of dollars, including its biggest ever buyout — Demandware. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship-management solution-providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to drive Salesforce’s fiscal fourth-quarter top-line performance.Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuotePartnerships Stoking International GrowthSalesforce still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, the company noted that its partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which had been curbing its growth potentials. However, in 2016, the company decided to utilize the geographical reach of other data-center service providers to expand its international business.The company’s first partnership in this space was with Amazon Web Services in 2016, followed by the next alliance with Alphabet last November. During third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company won several deals due to its international-expansion initiatives. Companies like National Australia Bank, BP, Group PSA and Hitachi picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation. It is most likely that the company will continue winning international deals which will drive its fiscal fourth-quarter top- and bottom-line results.Partner Program Adding CustomersTremendous growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. Notably, Salesforce’s partner certification has witnessed growth of five times over the last four years and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with more than 11,000 skilled consultants.Notably, a number of big organizations, including Hilton, DuPont and ASTACar have become Salesforce’s partners during the fiscal third quarter. Analysts covering the stock believe the fiscal fourth quarter will witness the same trend, thereby bolstering the company’s top-line performance.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3194,ORCL,"Workiva Inc. (WK  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 22.Although the company reported loss in each of the trailing four quarters, it surpassed the Zack Consensus Estimate, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 45.29%.Last quarter, the company reported a loss of 23 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 29 cents.Revenues increased 16.5% year over year to $52.1 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51 million.The company’s intuitive cloud platform, Wdesk, which is used for collecting, integrating, managing and analyzing business data, continues to gain traction and is expected to aid top-line growth in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Workiva continues to expand its existing customer base with its accounting, SOX and compliance software. Moreover, continued investment in Wdesk platform and a widening partner ecosystem are expected to drive growth.Workiva stock has gained 94% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 26.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Guidance & EstimatesFor fourth-quarter 2017, total revenues are anticipated between $53 million and $53.4 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $53.3 million. Non-GAAP operating loss is expected in the range of $8.8-$9.2 million.Workiva expects negative operating cash flow in the fourth quarter due to the timing of the payment of certain annual cash bonuses.Non-GAAP net loss is expected in the range of 22-23 cents per share.Factors at PlayWorkiva enjoys steady demand for its products from many foreign private Issuers. During the quarter, the company announced the adoption of Wdesk by ArcelorMittal Belgium for the purpose of tagging data with XBRL for filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). This will help the business to enhance its foothold in the data reporting business.Workiva has a strong customer base with its SOX related applications being adopted by the likes of Fastpath, Hi-Crush Partners, Dr Pepper Snapple and 2U among others in 2017. The partnership with EisnerAmper will further boost the company’s top line and provide it with a competitive edge against peers like Xero, Vivid Reports and Intacct. It will also help in the smooth implementation of financial controls related to Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX).Research firm Gartner mentioned in one of its reports that the cloud application infrastructure services market is expected to rise from $8.8 billion in 2017 to $14.8 billion in 2020. Thus, Workiva’s cloud platform is anticipated to benefit from growth of the segment.Workiva also entered into a strategic partnership with Business Wire, a globally recognized name in press release distribution and regulatory disclosure. The partnership intends to streamline the process of submission of earnings releases and other financial disclosures by companies directly to Business Wire.However, intensifying competition from peers like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), SAP Business One, Adaptive Planning and OIKOS Treasury Suite is a concern for the company.Workiva Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Workiva Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Workiva Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Workiva is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Five9 beat earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 200%.EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 4 cents per share. We note that the company broke even in the year-ago quarter. Estimates have remained stable in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $52.2 million, up roughly 18.1% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsWe believe the company’s strong partnerships with the likes of industry leaders such as Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Zendesk, and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Dynamics 365 have enabled it to offer customers greater flexibility, enhanced experience and cloud-based solutions. This in turn is expected to positively impact revenues.As organizations are increasingly looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support, the cloud-based contact center solution industry has been witnessing accelerated growth over the past few quarters. Five9’s ongoing execution has placed it well to capitalize on this opportunity.

3196,ORCL,"The financial world is seeing its hottest streak with the best start in many years, fueled by skyrocketing U.S. markets. The surge came despite global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tensions. The euphoria surrounding the new U.S. tax legislation, robust corporate earnings and optimism on global growth are acting as the key catalysts.A massive $1.5-trillion tax cut will create an economic surge, boosting job growth and reflation trade. It will further accelerate earnings, leading to increased dividend and buyback activities. Additionally, the tax repatriation will allow companies to bring offshore cash back home, paving the way for increased mergers and acquisitions. A combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data also bolstered the appetite for riskier assets (read: 8 Power-Packed ETFs for 2018).Further, rising rates in the United States as well as the end of cheap money era internationally is boosting investors’ confidence in strengthening economies, thereby leading to further growth in the stock market.Given this, we have highlighted some investing ideas that could prove extremely beneficial for investors this year in the bullish market:Make Trending Sectors Your FriendTechnology and financials have been at the heart of the rally this year. Technology stocks will continue to benefit from encouraging industry fundamentals and Trump's repatriation policy. Per Moody’s, the top five U.S. hoarders are from the technology sector, namely Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), which hold 88% of their money overseas. On the other hand, financial stocks will enjoy the dual tailwinds of lower taxes and rising rates. Tax reform may result in a further rise in interest rates that would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).While the two sectors are crowded with a number of top-ranked ETFs, the most popular are State Street funds — Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report) — and Vanguard funds —Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT and Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH  -  Free Report). All these have Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).Bet on U.S. Small CapsThe corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% is a big boon to small caps as these pay higher taxes with a median effective tax rate of 31.9% compared with 28% for the S&P 500 companies and 23.8% for the blue chip Dow Jones stocks. Additionally, a strengthening economy will provide further boost to these pint-sized stocks that are closely tied to the U.S. economy and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market.While there are several options in this space that would gain from the tax cut, a bunch of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ETFs, namely Vanguard Small-Cap Growth ETF VBK, iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF (IJT  -  Free Report) andVanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF VIOG could be excellent picks (read: Best Small-Cap ETFs of 2017 with Huge Upside in 2018).Go GlobalAlthough the U.S. stock market has been skyrocketing, international investing looks tempting given cheap valuations and threats of political instability in the United States. Additionally, the monetary policy tightening outside the United States, strong growth in the Euro zone, improving Japanese economy and remarkable growth in emerging markets are adding to the strength.As such, investors should go global to take advantage of a surge in both domestic and international markets. This can easily be done through the ultra- popular funds — Vanguard Total World Stock ETF VT, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF VEA and iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI  -  Free Report). These have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).Focus on Pure Trump PlayThe tax reform has boosted the confidence in Trump’s ability to deliver on his other promises this year. Now, Trump will move to other campaign promises like dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act as well as boosting military and infrastructure spending. Trump has promised to spend a trillion dollar on rebuilding highways, bridges, hospital and other U.S. infrastructure during his campaign. He has also promised to revive U.S. manufacturing and rehabilitate the country’s aging infrastructure.Given this, investors should bet on Trump trade and Republicans with the new ETFs, namely EventShares U.S. Tax Reform ETF TAXR, EventShares Republican Policies Fund GOP and Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF PAVE (read: 8 New ETFs of 2017 to Explode in 2018).Add Value to Your PortfolioTax reform will prompt investors to rotate out of growth and into value stocks as these have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, Trump’s protectionist stance, and mid-term elections would raise the appeal for value investing.Value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts. In fact, these stocks outperform the growth ones across all asset classes when considered on a long-term investment horizon and are less susceptible to trending markets. Some of the popular ones in this space like iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF IWD, Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report), iShares S&P 500 Value ETF IVE and Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR  -  Free Report) are worth a look. These funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (read: Value Investing Set to Shine on Tax Reform: 5 Cheap ETFs).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3197,ORCL,"CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 30. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT management software company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and posted in-line results in the other occasion. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.6%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 60 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.08 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe expect CA’s go-to-market sales strategy and acquisitions to drive the fiscal third-quarter top-line performance.Let’s discuss the aforementioned factors one by one.CA has adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions, including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.Furthermore, acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio. The company, last year, completed the acquisition of Automic Holding GmbH and Veracode. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. These are some of the broad-based acquisition strategies adopted by the company in the recent past. We believe the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.Apart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company has been leveraging cloud computing in a bid to enable organizations to source the best components — internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more — to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.Further, the company is focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.On the other hand, heightening competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as exposure to Europe remain near-term headwinds.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 60 cents. The combination of CA's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CA Inc.

3198,ORCL,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, Salesforce stock has gained 37.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 22.5%.Aspects In Favor of SalesforceContinuing its earnings streak for the sixth consecutive quarter, Salesforce posted splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also came ahead of management’s guided ranges. Quarterly revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.Significant increase in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the top-line results. During fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in its activities. Accenture has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.A number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, selected Salesforce solutions during the quarter to drive their digital transformation.Furthermore, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and christened itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone in such a short span of time, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE.Most recently, Salesforce entered into an agreement with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run its software in the latter’s Canadian data center. This has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian market. Similarly, Salesforce is planning to do similar thing in Australia, in order to tap growing opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region.The company also won several deals of late owing to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.The higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions are encouraging. We consider the rapid adoption of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform to be a positive. Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts. Additionally, strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are anticipated to prove conducive to growth over the long run.In view of increasing customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm, Gartner, acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. Also, just recently Forbes named Salesforce the most innovative company in the world again. We believe that the rapid adoption of Salesforce’s platforms indicates solid growth opportunities in the ever-growing cloud computing segment.Promising GuidanceThe company provided an encouraging guidance for fiscal third quarter and raised outlook for the full fiscal as well. For the fiscal third quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 23-24%.The guided range was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. Further, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 36-37 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 35 cents.Furthermore, the company raised revenues and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues are now anticipated to come in the range of $10.35-$10.40 billion (mid-point $10.375 billion), up from the previous projection of $10.25-$10.35 billion (mid-point $10.3 billion), representing 23-24% year-over-year increase. It also comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.28 billion.Similarly, Salesforce now projects non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.29 and $1.31. This compares with the previous guidance range of $1.28-$1.30 on non-GAAP basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.30, in line with the mid-point of management’s non-GAAP guidance range.The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 26%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.1%.Risks PersistWe note that the Salesforce currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 469.15. This level compares unfavorably to some extent with what the industry witnessed over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 409.46 and is toward its higher end of the valuation range over this period. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/E perspective.In addition, currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments in international expansion and data centers could hurt the bottom line.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times.

The company also provided an encouraging guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2018.We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably, in the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of Paylocity’s revenues. Consequently, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the top line in the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have positive impact on its forthcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, which specializes in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) , Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) remain major headwinds.Currently, Paylocity carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3201,ORCL,"It has been an up-and-down week around the global markets already, and now that we have reached “hump day,” some investors might be in need of some midweek motivation. And in honor of Salesforce’s (CRM  -  Free Report) earnings announcement last night, this week’s edition of Wednesday Wisdom will feature words from the cloud king himself, Marc Benioff.Benioff started developing software as a kid and was reportedly raking in nearly $1,500 from royalties on his self-made computer games in high-school. After spending the first 13 years of his career at Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Benioff left to found Salesforce, which would quickly become the worldwide leader in customer relations management software.Just last night, Salesforce reported that it recently became the first enterprise cloud software company to break the $10 billion revenue run rate, and there’s no doubt that Benioff’s dynamic leadership was a major catalyst for this historic accomplishment (also read: Salesforce Posts Earnings and Revenue Beats, Solid Guidance).Benioff is, without question, one of the software industry’s titans, and like the great minds of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Larry Ellison, investors tend to listen when he speaks. So as earnings season wraps up and the technology sector remains relatively hot, let’s take a look at three Benioff quotes that every tech investor should benefit from.While this quote was likely aimed at the entrepreneurs and would-be-Benioffs of the world, it is also useful for tech investors to keep in mind. Are you just finally getting a grasp on the importance of the Internet of Things and self-driving cars? Great, but you can bet it won’t be long until the next big thing comes along, and you better be ready to adapt again.Again, here we see Benioff speaking to the up-and-comers and dreamers throughout the industry. Benioff believes in the value of the beginner’s mind—the kind that is fresh, inspired, and without hesitation. This is important for seasoned investors to remember too. Even if you’ve been trading stocks for years, the ability to approach your investment ideas with the excitement of a beginner can keep your portfolio crisp.Of course, this is easier said than done, but its meaning remains the same. As investors, we must have an eye on the future at all times—and we must be able to adapt to changes. What’s the point of predicting something will happen if you don’t have a winning strategy to profit from it?Want more advice from the investing greats?

3202,ORCL,"Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 37 cents, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 52%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.65 billion, up 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthFor the last few years, Salesforce has been keen on building partnerships to expand its international operations. Its partnership with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is very crucial and the company, during its last earnings conference call, stated that the collaboration has helped it gain businesses overseas.It should be noted that earlier Salesforce used to run its software at the company’s data centers, which was curbing its growth potential. However, last year, the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business. In addition, Salesforce plans to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.In the last few months, Salesforce has entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian and Australian data centers. This has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian and Asia-Pacific markets.During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several deals due to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation. It is most likely that the company will continue winning international deals which will drive its fiscal third-quarter top- and bottom-line results.Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteAcquisitions Driving RevenuesAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the last two years, the company closed a number of takeovers worth a combined deal value of more than $4 billion. Last year alone, the company made as many as 12 takeover deals, including its biggest ever buyout — Demandware — concluded in July 2016. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship management (CRM  -  Free Report) solution providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to drive Salesforce’s fiscal third-quarter top-line performance.Salesforce Partner Program Adding CustomersTremendous growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.Notably, a number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, picked Salesforce solutions during the fiscal second quarter to drive their digital transformation. Analysts covering the stock believe that the fiscal third quarter will witness the same trend, thereby bolstering its top-line performance.Furthermore, during the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and named itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone so fast, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3203,ORCL,"The Trade Desk Inc. (TTD  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 35 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Moreover, the figure improved 45.8% from the year-ago quarter.Total revenues were $79.4 million, up 50% from the year-ago quarter. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $77 million. The strong growth reflects improving contribution from mobile (In-App, Video and Web), which accounted for 40% of total customer spending.Based on the solid results, management raised 2017 guidance, which however, failed to appease investors. Shares have declined more than 18.4% in the last two trading sessions.We believe that the downside reflects management’s cautious approach regarding lower spending from some large advertisers. However, Trade Desk noted that the advertisers have become selective in spending their ad-dollars. Their growing preference for programmatic advertising bodes well for the company in the long run. The Trade Desk Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Trade Desk Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Trade Desk Inc. Quote Nonetheless, the selectiveness can delay spending, which doesn’t augur well for Trade Desk in the near term.Additionally, some companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) and retail industries are reducing their advertising budgets to relieve margin pressure. This doesn’t bode well for Trade Desk in the near term.Further, the company stated that events like the bankruptcy of Toys “R” Us does affect the growth trajectory (although in small amount) in the near term.Nevertheless, we note that the stock has returned 74.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 23.9% rally of the Internet Services industry. Quarter DetailsOmni-channel solutions continue to be the bread and butter segment for Trade Desk as the industry keeps gradually shifting to transparency and programmatic buying. On a year-over-year basis, Mobile in-app, Mobile video and Connected TV improved 77%, 140% and 159%, respectively.Native spending was very strong in the reported quarter, surpassing the level attained through 2016. Customer retention rate was 95% in the reported quarter.Region-wise, Germany, the U.K. and Southeast Asia grew 131%, 82% and 123% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Seoul surged 260%, while Singapore grew 123% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted EBITDA surged 47.3% year over year to $24.4 million, driven by higher revenues.Reported operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, surged 520 basis points (bps) to 76.8% in the quarter. The upside can be attributed to higher technology and development expenses that soared 280 bps from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, platform operations expenses surged 220 bps. Further, general & administrative (G&A) expenses increased 170 bps.These were partially offset by a 150-bps decline in sales & marketing (S&M) expenses.As a result, reported operating margin contracted 520 bps from the year-ago quarter to 23.2%.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2017, Trade Desk anticipates revenues of $101 million and adjusted EBITDA of $34 million.Trade Desk currently anticipates revenues at $306 million, up from the previous guidance of $303 million, for 2017. Management expects adjusted EBITDA to be $90 million, up from $88 million.For 2018, Trade Desk expects spend in connected TV to increase by more than 100%.Moreover, international growth is anticipated at approximately double the U.S. business. Management expects footprint to expand, particularly in China.Further, the amount of third-party data usage is expected to increase in 2018. Management believes that partnerships with companies like Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report), Acxiom Corporation (ACXM  -  Free Report), Lotame and others will drive growth next year.Zacks Rank & Key PickTrade Desk carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Autohome Inc. (ATHM  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a stock worth watching in the same sector. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth for Autohome is currently pegged at 18.8%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

3204,ORCL,"Continuing its earnings streak for the sixth quarter in a row, Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) posted splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also came ahead of management’s guided ranges. Quarterly revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.The world’s leading CRM platform provider reported non-GAAP earnings of 33 cents per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents, as well as the company’s guidance range of 31-32 cents. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 24 cents, mainly driven by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, partially offset by increased number of outstanding shares.Looking at the last quarter’s strong results and encouraging outlook for the next quarter and fiscal 2018, we believe that the stock will likely see upside movement during today’s trading session. Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Salesforce has returned 35.8% during the said time frame compared with the industry’s gain of 22.4%.Before discussing the fiscal second-quarter results in detail, here are some important business highlights of the quarter.Q2 Business HighlightsTremendous increase in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.A number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, picked Salesforce solutions during the quarter to drive their digital transformation.Furthermore, during the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and named itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone so fast, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report).Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthThe company still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft or Oracle composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, Salesforce noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS), entered over the past year, have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which was curbing its growth potentials. However, last year the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business. In addition, Salesforce has planned to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.Most recently, Salesforce entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian data center. This has opened up  fresh prospects in the Canadian market. Similarly, Salesforce is planning to do similar thing in Australia, in order to tap the growing opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region.During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several deals due to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.Having discussed the fiscal second-quarter business highlights, let’s now turn to the financial results.RevenuesSalesforce continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The company’s revenues of $2.562 billion not only jumped 25.8% year over year, but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.514 billion. Furthermore, reported revenues came above the guided range of $2.51-$2.52 billion (mid-point: $2.515 billion).The improvement is primarily attributable to rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, drove the year-over-year upside in revenues.Now, coming to its business segments, revenues at Subscription and Support climbed about 25.6% from the year-ago quarter to $2.369 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues surged almost 28.3% to $193.1 million.Geographically, the company witnessed constant currency revenue growth of 24%, 31% and 27% in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.MarginsSalesforce’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $1.967 billion, up 26.1%. Additionally, gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 76.8%, primarily due to solid revenue growth, which was partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure development, including the expansion of the international data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 22.3% from the prior-year quarter to $1.585 billion. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to 61.9% from 63.7% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily because of efficient cost management.Salesforce posted non-GAAP operating income of $381.3 million compared with the year-ago figure of $263.6 million, while operating margin advanced 200 bps to 14.9%. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating margin was mainly driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income grew 41.4% year over year to $240.9 million, while net income margin expanded 100 bps to 9.4%. The benefit from improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on net income margin was partially offset by elevated interest and other expenses.Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSalesforce exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $3.50 billion compared with $3.22 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $1.569 billion compared with $1.439 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Total deferred revenue, as of Jul 31, 2017, was $4.82 billion, up 26% on a year-over-year basis.During the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $1.561 billion. Moreover, Salesforce generated free cash flow of $1.276 billion in the first half.GuidanceBuoyed by better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, the company provided an encouraging guidance for the fiscal third quarter and raised its outlook for the full fiscal as well. For the fiscal third quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 23-24%.The guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. Further, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 36-37 cents. On a GAAP basis, the same is anticipated to come between 4 cents and 5 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 35 cents.Furthermore, the company raised its revenues and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues are now anticipated to come in the range of $10.35-$10.40 billion (mid-point $10.375 billion), up from the previous projection of $10.25-$10.35 billion (mid-point $10.3 billion), representing 23-24% year-over-year increase. It also comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.28 billion.By completing this target, the company will achieve the $10-billion mark in revenues faster than any other enterprise software company.Similarly, Salesforce now projects non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.29 and $1.31, while GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 7-9 cents. This compares with the previous guidance range of $1.28-$1.30 on non-GAAP basis and 6-8 cents on GAAP basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.30, in line with the mid-point of management’s non-GAAP guidance range.Our TakeSalesforce reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, wherein both top and bottom lines fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as marked significant year-over-year improvement. The company continues to witness solid growth in revenues. The robust revenues were primarily backed by growth across all its business segments and the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform.Going ahead, the company’s upbeat outlook for the full fiscal signifies that it will continue to witness growth throughout the fiscal. Additionally, the fiscal third-quarter revenue outlook is impressive. We are also encouraged by the fact that the company will achieve $10 billion in sales in fiscal 2018.The higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions during the reported quarter were encouraging. We consider the rapid adoption of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform will be a positive. Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts. Additionally, strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are anticipated to prove conducive to growth over the long run.In view of increasing customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm, Gartner, acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. Also, just recently Forbes named Salesforce the most innovative company in the world again. We believe that the rapid adoption of Salesforce’s platforms indicates solid growth opportunities in the ever-growing cloud computing segment.Salesforce currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3205,ORCL,"On Tuesday, markets celebrated one of the best sessions in months. Gains came on the back of reports that Trump’s core team had taken crucial steps toward framing a tax reforms package. Skepticism over  chances of such proposals gaining legislative passage continues to exist. But investors seem to be clued in on the idea, since its one they haven’t priced in yet.If such tax reforms are indeed implemented, one of the key beneficiaries would be companies with substantial overseas cash reserves. Trump has promised to offer such companies a lower one-time rate on their offshore earnings. Investing in leading companies which are part of the S&P 500 and set to gain from this proposal surely makes for a smart move at this point.Focus Shifts to Tax ReformA Politico magazine article on Tuesday claimed that President Trump, his close associates and his legislative leadership have made substantial progress toward framing tax reform proposals. Several options related to both individual and business taxation are being discussed at this point. These include proposals to impose restrictions on deductions for mortgage interest payments and abolish interest deductions for businesses.New proposals are also likely to propose deductions for investments made by small businesses on new facilities and equipment. Of course, a great degree of skepticism exists about the Trump administration’s ability to push through such a plan. The White House continues to deal with a raft of controversies, the most recent of which is Trump’s heavily criticized response to the events at Charlottesville.Corporate Tax Proposals at an AdvantageStrategas Research Partners’ head of policy Daniel Clifton believes that more progress has been made on proposals related to corporates. Clifton hinted that rules for individuals may not see much tinkering at this stage, with a mortgage deduction proposal likely to be excluded. Instead a lower rate of corporate tax is likely to be put forward.  This would apply to both domestic and overseas earnings.Additionally, deductions for foreign companies with U.S. operations on items such as rent and interest are likely to be abolished. The idea behind new corporate proposals is to cut existing rates and counterbalance such a move by doing away with deductions. Clifton added that there have been discussions around abolishing interest deductions on corporate debt as well. But he believed that ultimately only a small cut in the amount that may be deducted may come about.Companies with Overseas Reserves to BenefitAt this stage, reports and discussions around tax reforms on overseas profits center on a cut in rates. But what had caught investor imagination at a point earlier in the year, and is likely to do so again, is Trump’s proposal of “deemed repatriation” rates. Such a proposal envisioned a one-time rate of 10% on overseas earnings, far lower than the 35% rate which would normally apply.Cash repatriated in such a manner could be utilized for the purposes of dividends, buybacks, capital expenditure and acquisitions. The most prominent beneficiaries of such a proposal would be tech behemoths from the U.S. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) alone hold a combined $427 billion of cash overseas.Our ChoicesThe proposal to offer an attractive one time rate or even a lower rate of tax on overseas cash reserves is likely to benefit a number of companies. Those with the largest cash piles stand to gain the most of course. The likely impact of such a proposal can be gleaned from the fact that the top 50 overseas cash hoarders from the S&P 500 together hold $925 billion overseas, according to Bloomberg.This is nearly $118 billion more than the amount held a year ago. Picking stocks from the S&P 500 likely to gain from such a proposal makes for a profitable option at this point.

3208,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 70 cents per share and revenues of $9.63 billion comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents and $9.555 billion, respectively.Earnings increased 14.8% from the year-ago quarter. This was primarily driven by 6% (4% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was in line with the high end of management’s guidance of 4-6%.Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (15.9% of total revenue compared with 11.9% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 44% (43% in constant currency) to $1.52 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenues increased 9% (7% in constant currency) to $7.83 billion.We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Shares Decline on Soft OutlookShares were down 6.6% in after-hour trading following the results. The decline can be attributed to soft cloud outlook.  Cloud revenues including Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are expected to grow between 21% and 25%, much lower than 44% reported by Oracle in the last quarter.Notably, Oracle’s stock has gained 26.8% year to date, underperforming the rally of 39% of the industry it belongs to. We believe that a slowdown in the cloud momentum can further drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineCloud SaaS revenues advanced a significant 54.9% (53% in constant currency) year over year to $1.123 billion. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues surged 20.7% (19% in constant currency) to $396 million.On-premise software revenues (65.5% of total revenues compared with 67.8% in the year-ago quarter) increased 2.9% (1% at constant currency) to $6.3 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM soared 65%.Software license updates and product support revenues were almost $4.953 billion, up 4% (2% in constant currency). On a combined basis, on-premise support and SaaS revenues were up 9%.Total hardware revenues slipped 7% (down 9% at constant currency) year over year to $940 million. Services revenues increased 1% (flat at constant currency) to $856 million.Operating DetailsCloud Software as a service margin came in at 66% as compared with 59% reported in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 160 basis points (bps) to 56.4%. The decline can primarily be attributed to lower hardware and research & development expenses, which were down 9.1% and 2.3%, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 200 bps from the year-ago quarter to 44%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Nov 30, 2017, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $71.58 billion, up $66.89 billion sequentially. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $14.58 billion, while free cash flow was $12.54 billion.Share Repurchase & Dividend ContinuesOracle increased the share repurchase authorization program by $12 billion. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, payable on Jan 24, 2018.GuidanceFor the third-quarter, total revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 2-4%.Earnings are anticipated to be between 68 cents and 70 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind. The high-end of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, which was pegged at 72 cents.Our TakeThe company provided encouraging second-quarter results, with both the top and bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favourable.Oracle is benefiting from significant momentum in its SaaS and PaaS offerings. This has also helped in improving the company's competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report). We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth. This is further evident from the expanding customer base.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).However, higher investments on IaaS will affect gross margin expansion in the near term. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind.Currently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked technology stocks worth considering are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Intel have a long-term EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 8.4%, respectively.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Research & development (R&D) expenses, sales & marketing (S&M) expenses and general & administrative (G&A) expenses increased 22.2%, 6.1% and 11.8%, respectively.The higher operating expenses reflected increases in compensation, travel and consulting expenses and continuing investment on developing the platform.Operating loss was $9.1 million, unchanged from the year-ago loss figure.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowWorkiva exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $77.8 million, an increase of $4.9 million from the previous quarter.

3211,ORCL,"When Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) started Prime Day three years ago, it was viewed as little more than a sales gimmick, similar to what Alibaba BABA does for Singles Day on November 11. But fast forward to today and you get the depth of the strategic planning.The third quarter is typically a quiet one for the retailer, so it’s a time that Amazon could afford to experiment with. And what could be better for sales than an offer for all-you-can-eat access to video streaming, music, e-books, free two-day shipping and more?Of course, all good things come at a price, and Prime, as this service is called, comes for $99 a year after a month’s free trial, or $10.99 a month, or, if you're a student with a valid .edu email, at half price or $5.49 a month for the months that you use it (after a six-month trial). Or, if you only want Prime Video, it’s available at $8.99 a month. But that isn’t all. Amazon makes it a point to shower Prime members with other deals and steals to ensure that they stick with it.Prime is a way for Amazon to incentivize people to buy from Amazon, and indeed, once you’ve paid for a benefit like free two-day shipping (or quicker on occasion), you’re likely to make the most of it. So Amazon decided to create a promo to sell this loyalty program. That’s what Prime Day is all about.Amazon had all the time and resources to service extra sales in what was earlier a pre-holiday lull. Moreover, selling Prime memberships at this time was a good way to ensure stronger sales in the holiday season that followed.In the just-reported quarter, Amazon reported very strong sales that were attributed mostly to the spillover effect of Prime Day, particularly in international markets where penetration is lower. Whole Foods, which benefited from more aggressive pricing, cross selling private label products on Amazon and integrating Prime rewards with Whole Foods, contributed $1.28 billion in the partial quarter since the acquisition closed. Other things like the pull-in of the Diwali season in India and the Souq acquisition also contributed.No wonder that eMarketer recently estimated Amazon’s share of the U.S. ecommerce market at 44% in 2017 and its share of the total U.S. retail market at 4%. Amazon made 38% of ecommerce sales last year, so this is a huge gain, and evidence of the way it’s sales continue to gain momentum. eBay’s share of ecommerce was estimated at a mere 6.8%, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) 3.6%, Walmart another 3.6%, followed by Best Buy, Macy’s, Wayfair and Costco.The bottom line: Prime is Amazon’s biggest competitive advantage and there’s a lot of momentum building around it.  It’s the main reason that North America sales grew 35% and international sales grew 29% in the last quarter, the strongest growth in recent quarters. The retail business isn’t where Amazon makes its profits however and for all its revenue strength, operating profits in North America continues to decline while international continues to post losses. That’s because investment for expansion and market share continues at a blistering pace.AWS is the main profit center, where Amazon has outsmarted Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and just about everybody else. That business reported operating profit growth of 38% in the last quarter.Amazon shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which could change following its stellar results. But you can instead see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3212,ORCL,"The technology sector in the United States performed exceptionally well in the third quarter. A rally in tech shares saw the tech-laden Nasdaq breach its 50th record close of this year on the last trading day of the quarter. Further, increased investment in technological R&D has also bolstered the sector’s growth.Moreover, tech shares have posted stupendous earnings throughout this fiscal and we expect this momentum to continue in the near term. Lastly, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation policy is bound to make tech companies wealthier and hence we suggest investing now. This is why it would be prudent to invest in tech mutual funds at this point.Robust Technological Developments and Excellent EarningsAnother reason why the tech stocks have outperformed the industry could be the emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearable devices, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, and artificial intelligence. Strong earnings from tech stocks throughout 2017 have also been pivotal in boosting the sector higher.The Q3 earnings season is at full throttle and we believe the bullish trend in tech is likely to continue as tech behemoths, particularly FAAMG stocks — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — are all set to report this week. We expect the FAAMG family to report robust earnings in Q3, while the broader tech sector is expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues. Acceptance of the Budget Blueprint Will Bolster Tech SharesIn a 51-49 vote late Thursday, the Senate approved the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018. Economists believe that such a move ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes could soon be rewritten. Meanwhile, market watchers continue to pour money into Internet and tech companies, and the most basic thing that is driving them at this point is taxes. Trump has promised to deliver historic relief to corporate America by lowering tax rates. The corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%.Another major reform proposed is the repatriation of trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas by the companies with global operations for one-time tax (reportedly 10%). Moreover, in 2004, the Bush administration attempted a similar repatriation tax holiday for bringing in overseas cash reserves for a one-time tax of 5.25%. A number of companies repatriated an amount exceeding $300 billion.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners. (Read More)5 Best Performing Technology Mutual FundsHere, we have highlighted five technology mutual funds flaunting a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Moreover, these funds have encouraging third-quarter and YTD returns. Additionally, the minimum initial investment is within $5000 and net assets are above $50 million. Splendid earnings and more than favorable economic conditions make the tech sector a hotbed of money.Moreover, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation policy is deemed to improve the overall financial health of tech companies.

Remember, the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers. Unlike most of the fund-rating systems, the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance, but also on the likely future success of the fund.Putnam Global Technology Y PGTYX seeks growth of capital over the long run.

3213,ORCL,"Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 16, after the closing bell. This online discount retailer’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the trailing four-quarters. This translates to an average negative surprise of 0.41%.Let’s delve deeper on how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as well as for fiscal 2017 has declined by a penny to 14 cents and 66 cents respectively, over the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.49 billion for the said quarter and $10.4 billion for 2017.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not show that Vipshop is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Vipshop has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 14 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vipshop Holdings Limited QuoteFactors Influencing the Quarter Vipshop has been struggling with higher promotional activity, primarily in its retail outlets and higher mix of lower-margin products. These have been negatively impacting the company’s margins. Additionally, macroeconomic slowdown in China and increasing competition in the retail space remain as concerns. The headwinds are also well reflected in the share price performance of the company. Shares of Vipshop went down 7.7% over the past six months while the broader Computer and Technology sector gained 10.5%.Despite a difficult macroeconomic environment, Vipshop has been delivering improved top-line results in the past few quarters. This was primarily driven by the addition of new customers. The company has also been witnessing the addition of younger and more Internet- and mobile-savvy shoppers to its customer base. Vipshop plans to target these expanding demographics, in addition to offering products tailored for shoppers in various age groups. The company will also focus on delivering more personalized products and services to customers. We remain hopeful that such efforts would aid Vipshop’s performance in the forthcoming periods and facilitate overcoming industry related challenges.Do Computer and Technology Stocks Interest You?

3214,ORCL,"Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted loss of 6 cents per share which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 10 cents per share.Non-GAAP earnings during the quarter came in at 9 cents per share compared with a loss of 1 cent reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarter DetailsThe company’s revenues came in at $76.1 million, reflecting an increase of 27% year over year, and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74 million. The year-over-over increase was driven by new client addition, existing client growth and additions to HCM product suite.The top line was also backed by a 27% surge in recurring revenues (96% of total revenue) and a 30.6% increase in implementation and other revenues.The company’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $47.1 million, up 32.5% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 240 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.9%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Paylocity reported non-GAAP operating income of $5.5 million as compared with a loss of 21k reported in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin during the quarter came in at 7.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are pegged at $41.9 million, up 14.5% year over year. As a percentage of revenues non-GAAP operating expenses contracted 600 bps year over year to 55.2%.Consequently, non-GAAP net income during the quarter was $5.1 million compared with a loss of $0.393 million reported in the year-ago period.Paylocity exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $86.5 million compared with $101.5 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.7 million compared with $2.2 million in the previous quarter.Paylocity has no long-term debt. The company generated $62 million of cash flow from operational activities during the 12 months ended Jun 30, 2016.GuidanceThe company provided outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2018. For first-quarter fiscal 2018, Paylocity expects revenues in the range of $80.3–$81.3 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $80.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $12–$13 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of 10–12 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 2 cents.For fiscal 2018, Paylocity anticipates revenues in the range of $368–$370 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $369.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA is projected in the range of $71–$72 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected within 78–80 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 31 cents.Share PriceIn the last one year, shares of Paylocity yielded a negative return of 4.8%, underperforming the industry, which gained 6.8%.Our TakePaylocity’s both top line and bottom line for the fourth quarter increased year over year. The company also provided an encouraging guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2018.We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably, in the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of Paylocity’s revenues. Consequently, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the top line in the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have positive impact on its forthcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, which specializes in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) remain major headwinds.Currently, Paylocity carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3215,ORCL,"Shares of Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) rallied to a 52-week high of $151.14 yesterday, eventually closing a bit lower at $150.69. Notably, the stock has returned 28.7% year to date, outperforming its industry’s gain of 25.4%.The rally can be attributed to the company’s sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio through acquisitions and partnerships. Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. The company closed 37 acquisition deals worth approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017. Also, over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies including start-ups.

3216,ORCL,"2017 has been a banner year for the U.S. stock market and the trend is likely to continue next year. The tax reform will act as a major driving factor for stocks coupled with strong corporate earnings and accelerating economic growth in many parts of the world.As Christmas tree symbolizes good tidings, let’s build a similar tree for stock-loving investors that could rake in big gains in 2018.Starting with the base – the most valuable portion of the tree – the technology sector seems  to be a perfect fit here as it is placed in the top 6% among the 16 broad Zacks sectors. Within the Industry classification, Semiconductor – General is expected to outperform. Being a cyclical sector, it tends to move higher with market rallies. New areas such as autonomous cars, cloud computing, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence continued to fuel exceptional growth.Intel INTC having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) seems an excellent pick. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 19 cents for the next year over the past 90 days and falls in the Industry having a Zacks Rank in the top 1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stocks that can form the leaves of the tree are Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) from the basic materials sector and Acco Brand Corporation ACCO from industrial products sector. Both the sectors are expected to benefit from Trump’s pro-growth policies, especially big spending in infrastructure and thus carry a sector Rank in the top 13%.Westlake Chemical has a Zacks Rank #1 and is part of an industry with a Rank in the top 10%. It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of $1.32 for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected growth rate of 21.67%. On the other hand, Acco Brand saw positive earnings estimate of 4 cents for the next year over the past 90 days, with an expected earnings estimate of 6.98%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Industry Rank in the top 1%.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)For the top layer, we have selected the energy sector, which is expected to be the largest contributor to 2018 S&P 500 earnings with 33.3% growth. HollyFrontier Corporation HFC seems an intriguing pick in this sector having a Rank in the top 25%. The stock saw solid earnings estimate revision of 79 cents for the next year over the past 90 days with an expected earnings growth rate of 20.87%. It has a Zacks Rank #1 with an Industry Rank in the top 20%.At the very top is the star stock of 2017 with a Zacks Rank #1. XOMA Corporation XOMA has soared nearly 692% this year so far with room for more upside next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved up from a loss of $1.31 to a loss of 42 cents. Rising earnings estimates indicate analysts’ optimistic view on earnings, indicating higher chances of outperformance. Additionally, the stock boasts a solid Industry Rank in the top 45%.Now that we are done with the tree’s structure, it’s time to decorate it with bells, candies, lights and chocolates. For these, we can concentrate on areas expected to benefit most from the tax reform.Bells and candies could be the companies that are poised to benefit from tax policies to bring offshore cash home at reduced tax. The top five U.S. hoarders are from the tech sector - Apple AAPL, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) - that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s. Drug makers like Amgen Inc. AMGN, Gilead Sciences GILD, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) also stash huge cash offshore and are likely to gain from tax repatriation policy. All these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Banking stocks could be the fairy lights on the tree that will light up on the dual tailwinds of rising rates and tax cuts. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, tax cuts will add 16% to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18% in 2019 while AB Bernstein sees earnings per share jumping 12-20% at large banks and 15-25% at mid-caps banks in 2018. While there are several choices, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and Industry Rank in the top 34%. The company is expected to generate double-digit earnings growth next year.Small cap stocks that pay the highest effective tax rate could be the sweet treats, as these will be the biggest beneficiaries of the corporate tax cut. According to Thompson Reuters data, companies in the Russell 2000 pay a median effective tax rate of 31.9%, while larger multinationals in the S&P 500 pay 28% and 30 mega-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average pay 23.8%. Additionally, these tend to outperform in a rising rate environment. Given this, a spread of top-ranked stocks with 2018 double-digit earnings growth potential include Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD  -  Free Report), Farmers & Merchants Bancorp Inc. (FMAO  -  Free Report), Geopark Ltd GPRK and PetMed Express Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). All these stocks doubled this year.And voila, the tree is up! May it bring in bountiful returns for investors with the jingle of Santa’s bells.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to expenses related to Automic and Veracode acquisitions.The company’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was approximately $263 million as compared with $283 million reported in the year-ago quarter.CA exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.822 billion compared with $2.771 billion in the previous quarter.

The company continues to expect total revenues to increase 4% in constant currency. Total revenues are now anticipated to increase 5% in reported basis. This translates reported revenues to $4.22-$4.25 billion at Sep 30, 2017 exchange rates. Previously the company anticipated revenues to increase 4% on a reported basis.

However, it provided a positive view for fiscal 2018.We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by the company will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.CA has also adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps to lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.Apart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing to enable organizations to source the best components — internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more — to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.The company is also focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.Meanwhile, increasing competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) along with exposure to Europe remain the near-term headwinds.CA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3218,ORCL,"CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT management software company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in to-be-reported quarter. Notably, CA has delivered positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 7.6%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 62 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.05 billion, up slightly 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe expect CA’s acquisition and go-to-market sales strategies to drive the fiscal second-quarter top-line performance.Let’s discuss the aforementioned factors one by one.Acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio. The company in 2017 so far has completed the acquisition of Automic Holding GmbH and Veracode. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. These are some of the broad-based acquisition strategies adopted by the company in the recent past. We believe the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.Furthermore, CA has adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CA Inc. QuoteApart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing in a bid to enable organizations to source the best components — internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more — to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.Further, the company is focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.On the other hand, heightening competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as exposure to Europe remain near-term headwinds.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 62 cents. The combination of CA's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Avnet, Inc. (AVT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3219,ORCL,"The technology sector has been the best-performing sector this year with the ultra-popular Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) gaining 26.2% in the year-to-date time frame versus the gain of 15.7% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY  -  Free Report).The outperformance came on the back of soaring FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report). The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones and virtual reality devices as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts (read: Invest in FANG Stocks With These ETFs).With the global economy gathering strong momentum, technology stocks will continue to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation. The twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are driving the stocks higher. This is because the tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's proposed tax reform policy. In fact, the top five U.S. hoarders are Apple, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s.Further, most of the tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment. Adding to the strength is a pick-up in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.If this wasn’t enough, tech is one of the leading sectors of the S&P 500's profit growth resurgence.

3220,ORCL,"Solid second-quarter earnings provided a fillip to the U.S. equity market despite political turmoil both at home and abroad. A similar shot in the arm is expected in the third quarter, with American corporations showing signs of strength on the back of an improving economy.Both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace in September, while the U.S. economy is growing close to the range expected by President Trump and some other Republicans. A clearer view of last month’s labor market data shows that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten.The third-quarter earnings season, unofficially, begins mid-October. It is seen as the biggest catalyst for the broader markets that could help major indices continue their winning streak. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season. Here, we should also bear in mind that better-than-expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price, which eventually enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts (read more: 5 Top Large-Cap Earnings Growth Stocks to Buy Now).Q3 Earnings OutlookEarnings have been pretty strong so far this year. Earnings growth in both the first and second quarter for the S&P 500 companies was in double-digits. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) expects such companies to top forecasts in the third quarter as well, which will take the S&P 500 closer to the 2,575 mark by the end of October. The benchmark index is currently trading at around the 2,544 mark. Morgan Stanley’s forecast would mean additional gains of 1.2% by the end of the month. Further, the banking giant expects the broader gauge to end the year at around 2,700.Total third-quarter earnings are expected to be up 2.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues. Expectations of earnings may not be excessively high, but, still looks solid as economic indicators shows positive signs.  Strong Economic BackdropA key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13-year high in September, while non-manufacturing activity rallied to a 12-year high. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. The non-manufacturing gauge was at 59.8% last month, as compared with 55.3% in the prior month (read more: U.S. Manufacturing Activity Hits 13-Year High: Top 5 Winners).      Additionally, U.S. GDP expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investments drove the upside.September jobs report, in the meanwhile, showed the first monthly decline in payrolls in seven years. Investors, however, mostly ignored the surprise contraction which was led by unprecedented events such as hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Let’s not forget that even during such trying times, the unemployment rate remained at a 16-year low and wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high.Potential Gainers & Losers of Q3             The energy sector, in particular, is expected to record the strongest growth in the third quarter. Total earnings for the sector are expected to grow a whopping 121.9% on 17.2% higher revenues. The energy sector is benefitting from an uptick in oil prices, which is gaining strength as demand is strong in Europe and the United States. Needless to say, the oil market has been suffering owing to oversupply concerns for quite some time now.As per the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand grew by 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. The IEA also revised the growth estimate for this year upward to 1.6 million bpd.Earnings for the technology sector are set to grow 9.7% from the same period last year. Substantial growth in cloud computing and the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launches of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics are cited to be some of the reasons that have boosted the sector in recent times.Improved chances of some form of tax reform making it through the house also benefitted the technology sector. Tech behemoths like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas. The tax plan seeks to encourage such multinationals to bring those profits back to the United States by cutting the tax rate.Industrials sector, in the meanwhile, is expected to rise in mid-single digits. High profits are also expected from conglomerates and construction segments as well. But, bank earnings are expected to disappoint mostly due to persistent deceleration in loan growth and soft trading revenues.

On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% year over year. The increase can mainly be attributed to acquisition synergies and an increase in software fees.Revenues from Subscription and maintenance (80% of total revenue) decreased 1.1% and revenues from Professional Services (7% of total revenue) decreased 2.6% year over year. However, Software fees and other revenues (13% of total revenue) surged 38.5%.Moreover, on a segment basis, revenues from CA’s Mainframe Solutions declined 3% on a year-over-year basis to $536 million.

As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP income from continuing operations before interest and income taxes was down 200 basis points (bps) to 37%, primarily due to higher operating expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year over year to $642 million, while as a percentage of revenues, it increased 180 bps year over year to 62.6%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to expenses related to Automic and Veracode acquisitions.CA’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was approximately $256 million as compared with $269 million reported in the year-ago quarter.CA exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.771 billion compared with $2.971 billion in the previous quarter.

Considering the exchange rates as of Jun 30, 2017, this translates to the range of $1.09–$1.14 billion.Our TakeCA reported stellar first-quarter results and provided an encouraging fiscal 2018 guidance.We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.CA has also adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps to lower costs, thereby improving the bottom line.Apart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing to enable organizations to source the best components – internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more – to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.The company is also focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.Meanwhile, increasing competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and HP Inc.

3222,ORCL,"Workiva Inc. (WK  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. Although the company reported loss in each of the trailing four quarters, it has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate on all occasions, resulting in an average positive surprise of 36.12%.Last quarter, the company reported a loss of 14 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 25 cents. We note that the loss has also narrowed sequentially in the last three-quarters.The improvement can be attributed to growing top-line, which has increased sequentially over the same time frame. In the last quarter, revenues also increased 16.5% year over year to $51.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51 million.For second-quarter 2017, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $48.1–$48.6 million. Non-GAAP net loss is anticipated to be in the range of 20–21 cents per share.Notably, shares of Workiva have gained 43.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 17.4% rally. The outperformance can be attributed to improving results as well as increasing adoption of Workiva’s intuitive cloud platform, Wdesk.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWdesk continues to gain traction and is thus a key growth driver for the company. In the latest ""Magic Quadrant for Cloud Financial Corporate Performance Management Solutions” report, market research firm Gartner puts Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant, which indicates  its strong growth potential.Workiva enjoys steady demand for its product from state and local government and universities. In the first quarter, Wdesk was used to create and submit 75% of all Inline XBRL filings as well as 53% of all XBRL facts with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This reflects the company’s growing dominance in XBRL and Inline XBRL.Moreover, the Wdesk platform has high growth opportunities in Enterprise Risk Management, which is evident from the significant increase in customers. The company also clinched significant customer wins in the Sarbanes-Oxley market. Key partnerships with the likes of Host Analytics, Armanino and FastPath are likely to boost its business and consequently its performance.However, competition is intensifying in the cloud-based enterprise management and auditing software-as-a-service (SaaS) space with the presence of companies like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), SAP Business One, Adaptive Planning and OIKOS Treasury Suite. Additionally, investments in technology and talent will take time to contribute meaningfully to its top line in our view.Workiva Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Workiva Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Workiva Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Workiva is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Workiva’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 31 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Workiva’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +6.06% and a Zacks Rank #1.

3223,ORCL,"ServiceNow Inc. (NOW  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26. The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 31.54%.Last quarter, the company reported a loss (including stock based compensation) of 18 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 16 cents.However, revenues of almost $424 million surged 38.6% year over year to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $409 million. ServiceNow won 28 new deals greater than $1 million in net new annualized contract value (ACV), and 26 net new Global 2K customers. Renewal rate was 97% in the reported quarter.The shares have massively outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 21.3%, the stock returned 47.8%. We believe that the company’s expanding product portfolio, increasing multi-product customer base and strong renewal rate are the key growth drivers.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderServiceNow enjoys a dominant position in the IT Service Market (ITSM) and IT Operations Market (ITOM). The company is also penetrating the non-ITSM markets like human resource and security solutions by launching new products and services. The size of its total addressable market is increasing given the rise in G2K as well as non-G2K customer base.Moreover, the company is going in for strategic acquisitions in order to innovate and expand its product portfolio, which in turn is expected to accelerate revenues.However, ServiceNow faces stiff competition in the non-ITSM market from well-established players like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and salesforce.com. Its lack of exposure to a growing economy like China remains an overhang. Modest growth in professional service business is another headwind.The company has also been incurring losses over a period of time. Thus, price control in order to stay competitive in the market will weigh heavily on its top line.ServiceNow, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ServiceNow, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ServiceNow, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ServiceNow is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

3224,ORCL,"On Jul 12, IBM Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The downgrade can be attributed to an inconsistent revenue growth trajectory, slow transition to cloud, increasing competition and sluggish IT spending.We believe that IBM’s significant investments into “Strategic Imperatives” – cloud computing, mobile, cognitive technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) – will take some more time to post credible top-line growth. Until then, we expect share price movement to remain muted.Notably, IBM shares have massively underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index has gained 8.5%, the stock has registered a negative return of 7.4%.Strategic Imperatives: Slow Transition Impact ResultsIBM is under pressure due to its time-consuming business model transition, which is negatively impacting results. Despite significant investments, the company is yet to gain a dominant position in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Hosted private cloud market.Per data from Synergy Research, IBM lagged well behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in these markets at the end of first-quarter 2017.Meanwhile, market research firm Gartner put IBM in the “Visionaries” quadrant along with Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Alibaba Cloud in its latest Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service, Worldwide report. This reflects execution problem at IBM, which is evident from sluggish revenue growth. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are touted as the “Leaders.”IBM Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteApart from cloud computing, IBM has been gearing up to be a major force in the AI market with Watson. Despite expanding product offerings, partnerships, deal wins and significant investments, Watson has failed to be a game-changer – what many investors hoped it to be – at least in the near term.Moreover, the Blockchain initiatives are still at nascent stages to contribute meaningfully to top-line growth. Further, sluggish IT spending and stiff competition in most of the markets are significant headwind, in our view.Stock to ConsiderRed Hat (RHT  -  Free Report) with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is a stock worth considering in the broader sector.

3225,ORCL,"Shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report) have been struggling lately. The stock has underperformed its industry in the first eight months of the year. The stock has depreciated 12.4%, as against the industry’s rally of 25.1% in the same period.  Apart from other headwinds that is limiting bottom-line growth, the frequent management changes at Citrix also do not seem to bode well as far as investors’ confidence in the stock is concerned. Last week, Citrix announced the appointment of Mark J. Ferrer as its executive vice president and chief revenue officer.  Also, the company announced a change in the composition of its board by roping in Dr. Ajei S. Gopal. Gopal as the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of ANSYS Inc. ((ANSS  -  Free Report)).Additionally, Citrix has been making frequent changes to its CEO position. In July 2017, the company appointed David J. Henshall as its new president and CEO. Henshall has succeeded Kirill Tatarinov as the CEO. Notably, Kirill Tatarinov had joined Citrix from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report).In fact, the appointment of Henshall implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years. Only time will tell, whether the appointment of Henshall yields the desired results as Citrix expects to increase its profitability and find favor with shareholders.The frequent management changes apart, Citrix’s bottom line has been hurt by high costs as well. Declining revenues from products and licenses also pose a severe challenge to the company.  However, strong Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues are boosting the company. Citrix apart, other players in the SaaS market include the likes of Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

While the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings, it disappointed investors with a bleak outlook.Oracle Q1 Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at 62 cents, a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 12% year over year. Revenues increased 7% year over year to $9.2 billion and were above our $9.02 billion estimate.The company’s long process of shifting to the Web-based cloud computing business is now paying off more than offsetting the decline in legacy business. Cloud software platform sales climbed 51% from the year-ago quarter to $1.5 billion and accounted for 16% of total revenue. Notably, Oracle is selling more cloud software platforms than any other company in the world and has grown three times faster in a year, gaining an edge over the software ace Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report). This indicates super-fast growth in cloud computing business (see: all the Technology ETFs here).For the fiscal second quarter, the world’s largest database software maker expects total revenues to grow 2-4% on a constant currency basis, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate growth of 4.73%. This is because cloud sales are expected to increase 39%-43%, lower than the growth of 51% in the recently reported quarter, suggesting a slowdown to the soaring cloud business. Further, the company expects earnings per share of 64-68 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents, reflecting some concerns in the company’s future growth.The disappointing guidance pushed down shares of Oracle as much as 5% in the aftermarket trade. Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a solid Industry Rank in the top 41%. However, the Value and Growth Style Score is unimpressive at C and F, respectively.ETFs in FocusGiven this, ETFs with the highest allocation to this software giant look to be big movers this week and in the next.

"
3228,ORCL,"The top and bottom lines of the income statement - sales and net income - get all the attention these days. 
"
3229,ORCL,"But what about the ""middle"" lines - gross and operating profit? 
"
3230,ORCL,"Much like a middle child, these often get overlooked. However, they can tell a very important story. 
"
3231,ORCL,"Gross profit is simply a company's revenue minus the direct costs of producing its goods or services. Among other things, this can signal whether or not a company is able to raise its prices along with its input costs. 
"
3232,ORCL,"This is especially important in today's environment where soaring commodity prices are dramatically raising production costs for many companies. Companies with strong pricing power can raise their prices to offset the higher costs. Those without it cannot. 
"
3233,ORCL,"The other middle line to consider is operating profit. Operating profit takes gross profit and subtracts operating expenses such as selling, general and administrative costs. This lets investors know how efficiently a company is being run. If its operating expenses are growing significantly faster than revenue, for instance, this could be a signal that management isn't keeping a close eye on its costs. 
"
3234,ORCL,"Gross and operating profit are often expressed as a percentage of total revenue, giving you gross and operating margins. The bigger the margins, the better. 
"
3235,ORCL,"Wide Margins, Wide Moats
"
3236,ORCL,"Corporate profit margins are heavily influenced by the industry they're in, so it's important to compare them with their peers. Tech companies will tend to have much higher margins than retailers, for instance. 
"
3237,ORCL,"Some companies manage to consistently produce wide profit margins, however. More often than not, these businesses will have at least one of the four types of competitive advantages: Consumer (control over pricing), Producer (proprietary production technologies), Economies of Scale (lower long-run average costs), and External (government regulation). 
"
3238,ORCL,"These competitive advantages must be constantly monitored and maintained in order to fend off competition, and if a company continually generates wide margins and fat profits, you can bet it will attract competitors. 
"
3239,ORCL,"Ridiculous Margins, Reasonable Prices
"
3240,ORCL,"More often than not, high-margin, wide-moat businesses will trade at premium valuations. There are, however, companies with durable competitive advantages and strong growth prospects trading at very reasonable prices. For the long-term investor, these could be great buying opportunities. 
"
3241,ORCL,"I ran a screen for companies with 5-year average operating margins greater than 25% and net margins above 20%, along with the criteria that current margins must be greater than their 5-year averages (i.e., margins must be expanding). The stocks must also have a Price/Earnings/Growth (PEG) ratio below their industry average. 
"
3242,ORCL,"Here are 4 of my favorite names from the list: 
"
3243,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) 
"
3244,ORCL,"Operating Margin (5-yr average): 29.6% 
"
3245,ORCL,"Net Margin (5-yr average): 23.6% 
"
3246,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 0.9 
"
3247,ORCL,"Oracle is the world's largest enterprise software company and also provides computer hardware products and services since acquiring Sun Microsystems in January 2010. Its software segment, which still represents around 68% of total revenue, has seen strong margin expansion over the last few years due in large part to growth in its wildly profitable Software License Update and Product Support division. 
"
3248,ORCL,"After paying the Government its cut through taxes, Oracle keeps almost 24 cents in net profit for every dollar of revenue it takes in. The company also has very low capital expenditure requirements, and thus generates tons of free cash flow. In fiscal 2011, for instance, Oracle produced $10.8 billion in free cash flow, up 27% year-over-year. This allowed it to repurchase a whopping $1.2 billion in shares. 
"
3249,ORCL,"Earnings estimates have been steadily climbing higher over the last several months. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. Shares seem like a bargain at just 13x forward earnings. 
"
3250,ORCL,"Visa (V  -  Free Report) 
"
3251,ORCL,"Operating Margin: 33.2% 
"
3252,ORCL,"Net Margin: 30.0% 
"
3253,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 1.0 
"
3254,ORCL,"Visa is a global payments technology company and one of the most recognized brands in financial services. The company doesn't actually issue credit cards to consumers, it simply acts a payment processor. When a cardholder swipes a credit card, Visa processes the payment by facilitating the authorization, clearing, and settlement of the transaction on its proprietary networks. 
"
3255,ORCL,"Thanks to the financial crisis and knee-jerk government regulation (never waste a good crisis, right?), Visa's stock price has whipsawed since it went public in early 2008. While the company faces regulatory headwinds, fears may be a bit overblown. Analysts have been steadily raising their earnings estimates over the last several months due in large part to better clarity over the regulation's impact. 
"
3256,ORCL,"In the meantime, Visa continues to do what it does best: making piles of money. Revenue has been soaring both domestically and abroad as more and more consumers migrate away from cash and checks. Moreover, the actual cost of processing those payments is relatively small compared with what it charges in revenue. As a result, Visa has kept an average of 30 cents of every dollar it takes in after all expenses, including taxes, over the last five years. Over the last 12 months, this has increased to 40 cents. 
"
3257,ORCL,"The company also has very little capital expenditures and thus generates exceptionally strong free cash flow. It spent $2.8 billion in the first 9 months of fiscal 2011 buying back stock. Shares trade at just 15.3x 12-month forward earnings, well below its historical average of 19.7x. 
"
3258,ORCL,"PotashCorp (POT)
"
3259,ORCL,"Operating Margin: 26.6% 
"
3260,ORCL,"Net Margin: 26.5% 
"
3261,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 1.1 
"
3262,ORCL,"PotashCorp produces potash, phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer nutrients. Surging demand in the emerging markets is driving prices and volumes for PotashCorp's products higher. For being in the commodity business, the company posts remarkably high profit margins. This is mostly due to the fact it is the world's largest potash producer and has significant pricing power over the product. 
"
3263,ORCL,"For the first six months of 2011, the company's potash segment earned an incredible 68.9% gross profit. Potash accounts for about 50% of the company's total revenue. What's also impressive is that total operating expenses represented just 4.9% of sales. As a result, every dollar in revenue that PotashCorp earns becomes 35 cents in net profit. That's about three times the industry average. 
"
3264,ORCL,"With earnings estimates surging after better than expected second quarter results, shares seem very reasonably priced at 15.9x forward earnings. PotashCorp is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock. 
"
3265,ORCL,"Google (GOOG) 
"
3266,ORCL,"Operating Margin: 27.0% 
"
3267,ORCL,"Net Margin: 25.9% 
"
3268,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 1.1 
"
3269,ORCL,"Google is a search engine giant that derives 96% of its revenue from ads placed on its websites. Companies continue to shift away from traditional advertising sources and towards Google's popular pay-per-click AdWords program. 
"
3270,ORCL,"Google's high margins and low capital expenditures make for substantial free cash flow. Over the last 12 months the company generated nearly $8 billion in free cash flow and currently has over $39 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books. Hopefully it makes good use of that money. 
"
3271,ORCL,"Valuation seems very reasonable at 19.4x forward earnings. Three and a half years ago, Google was trading around $715 per share and had trailing earnings of $4.2 billion. Today, it's trading around $605 per share and has trailing earnings of $9.0 billion. 
"
3272,ORCL,"The Bottom Line
"
3273,ORCL,"Investors should look beyond just the top and bottom lines and consider what's in between: the gross and operating margins. For the long-term investor concerned with competitive advantages, look for wide, and expanding, margins. These four companies all fit that criteria - and are reasonably priced.

3275,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered strong first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 62 cents per share and revenues of $9.21 billion comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents and $9.03 billion, respectively.Earnings increased 12.3% from the year-ago quarter and were better than the company’s guided range of 59-61 cents. This was primarily driven by 7% (6% in constant currency) growth in revenues that was in line with the high end of management’s guidance of 4-6%.Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud revenues (16.2% of total revenue versus 11.4% in the year-ago quarter) advanced 51.3% (60% in constant currency) to $1.49 billion.Moreover, total cloud and on-premise software revenue increased 8% in constant currency to $7.41 billion. Management noted that 80% of Oracle’s trailing 12-month software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Oracle Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Oracle Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteWe believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future. The expanding customer base that includes the likes of AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Liberty Mutual Insurance, Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) and others is a key catalyst.Shares Decline on Soft OutlookShares were down 4.5% in after-hour trading following the results. The decline apparently reflects soft outlook. Earnings are anticipated to be between 64 cents and 68 cents for the quarter, with a positive impact of couple of cents from favorable currency tailwind.The high-end of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, which was pegged at 69 cents.Moreover, cloud growth outlook was unimpressive. Cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow between 39% and 43% (41% and 45% in the U.S. dollars), much lower than 51.3% reported by Oracle in the last quarter and 64.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Oracle’s stock has gained 37.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 27.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. However, a brake in the cloud momentum can drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineCloud software as a service (SaaS) revenues advanced a significant 61.6% (62% in constant currency) year over year to $1.09 billion. Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) revenues surged 29.2% (28% in constant currency) to $403 million. Cloud deferred revenues surged 53%.On-premise software revenues (64.2% of total revenue versus 67.6% in the year-ago quarter) increased 1.6% (1% at constant currency) to $5.92 billion reflecting continued higher attachment rates of software support and renewal rates.ERP surged 90% organically. Management stated that Fusion HCM soared 109%, which was double the growth rate of Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report). Database as a Service was up 53% from the year-ago quarter. CX also increased double digits organically.On Oct 1, Oracle is set to launch the next-generation database, which will be a totally autonomous system supported by machine learning. The company will be offering public Cloud service level agreements (SLAs) for the Oracle database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. This practically signifies less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (AWS).Per Oracle, PaaS infrastructure, business analytics and data integration revenues were up 28%, 130% and 221%, respectively.Software updates and product support revenues were almost $4.95 billion, up 2% in constant currency. On a combined basis, on-premise support and SaaS revenues were up 17%.Total hardware revenue slipped 5.3% (down 6% at constant currency) year over year to $943 million. Services revenues increased 6.4% (up 5% at constant currency) to $860 million.Operating DetailsSaaS gross margin was 67%, significantly higher than 59% reported in the year-ago quarter. PaaS and IaaS gross margin was 43% down from 58% posted in the year-ago quarter due to continued investments on geographical expansions.Operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 160 bps to 58.9%. The decline can primarily be attributed to lower software license updates and product support, hardware, services, sales & marketing and research & development expenses, which were down 40 bps, 50 bps, 40 bps, 80 bps and 60 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 160 bps from the year-ago quarter to 41.1%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Aug 31, 2017, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $66.89 billion, up $819 million sequentially. Trailing four-quarter operating cash flow was $14.8 billion, while free cash flow was $12.6 billion.Share Repurchase & Dividend ContinuesOracle bought back 10.2 million shares for a total of $500 million in the quarter. In the last 12 months, the company repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of 2 billion and paid out dividends of $2.8 billion.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, total revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 2%-4% in constant currency (4%-6% in the U.S. dollars). Favorable exchange rate will help revenues by at least 3%.  Oracle expects SaaS gross margin to improve in fiscal 2018 and hit 80% sometime during fiscal 2019. As the company gains scale, management expects PaaS and IaaS gross margins to expand significantly.Currently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The updated product offers new features such as user-driven scenario modeling, next-generation mobile and social analytics and complete customer control.

3277,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on Dec 14. Notably, the company has beaten estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 6.76%.Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 62 cents, which increased 12.3% on a year-over-year basis and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents.Further, revenues of $9.21 billion increased 7% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of $9.03 million.Expect What?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 68 cents compared with 61 cents in the year-ago period.

3278,ORCL,"We have hit a lull as far as earnings reports go, but there are still several noteworthy companies set to announce their latest results in the upcoming week. Q3 earnings was strong across the board, so it will be interesting to see whether these reports will continue that trend and inspire strong trading for the remainder of the calendar year.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of December 11.1.       Verifone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report)Verifone is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the market closes on December 12. Verifone still holds a dominant position in the payments industry, but upstarts like Square (SQ  -  Free Report) and local competitors in emerging markets like China and India have seized key growth opportunities. Shares of PAY have gained just 2% so far this year.Heading into its report date, Verifone is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Our current consensus estimates are calling for earnings of 43 cents per share and revenues of $472.18 million. These figures would represent year-over-year growth rates of +43.61% and +0.98%, respectively.Profits should be supported by the company’s ongoing restructuring program, which was expected to save the company about $30 million this year. Investors will want to focus on the status of this plan, as well as any further restructuring initiatives the company might start. 2.       Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report)Costco is slated to report its most recent quarterly financial results after the closing bell on December 14. This big-box retailer has not been immune to its industry’s challenges, but shares have returned a respectable 17% so far this year, mostly thanks to a 15% surge over the past 12 weeks.According to our latest consensus estimates, Costco is expected to report earnings of $1.35 per share and revenues of $31.29 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth rates of +14.96% and +11.34%, respectively. The company has surpassed earnings estimates in two consecutive quarters.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is currently sporting a positive Earnings ESP of 1.64%, meaning that our proprietary method of identifying potential surprises is signaling that we could be in store for a beat. 3.       Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report)Oracle is scheduled to announce its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes on December 14. Thanks to intense competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle has struggled to keep pace recently and has underperformed its industry on a year-to-date basis. Nevertheless, the stock is up over 26% in 2017.Heading into its report date, Oracle is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Our latest consensus estimates are calling for the company to report earnings of 68 cents per share and revenues of $9.55 billion. If these estimates hold up, they would represent year-over-year growth rates of +11.94% and +5.35%, respectively.Oracle has met or surpassed earnings estimates in five consecutive quarters. Investors should also note that the company has been slowly gaining ground in the cloud computing world, so growth in its SaaS and PaaS platforms will be key. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3279,ORCL,"Oracle Corp (ORCL  -  Free Report) impressed once again, delivering its fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise on March 24.
"
3280,ORCL,"The Sun Microsystems acquisition is proving to be a good move, as revenues in the Hardware Systems segment were up a remarkable 258% in Q3.
"

3283,ORCL,"On March 24, the tech giant posted third quarter 2011 EPS of 51 cents, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents.
"
3284,ORCL,"Total revenues were up 35% in constant currency. The Sun acquisition is proving to be a great move as Hardware Systems revenues were up a whopping 258%. The segment now accounts for 19% of overall revenues.
"
3285,ORCL,"The Software segment, which accounts for 68% of revenue, increased 17%.

3288,ORCL,"Estimates have begun rolling in off the strong quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is currently $2.01 per share, representing 26% growth over 2010 EPS. The 2012 consensus estimate is at $2.23, equating to 11% earnings growth.
"

"
3297,ORCL,"The valuation picture looks attractive with shares trading at 16.0x forward earnings, a significant discount to the industry average of 24.1x. It sports a PEG ratio of 1.1.

3299,ORCL,"Earnings Preview 3/18/11
"
3300,ORCL,"The fourth quarter earnings season is over, but now we are starting to get a few first quarter reports (and a few stragglers for the fourth quarter, many of which are ADRs). That makes for a very light overall earnings week. A total of just 76 firms are due to report. However, an unusually high number of those are members of the S&P 500 -- 17.
"
3301,ORCL,"The fourth quarter earnings season was a strong one, and this week should start to provide clues if that will be true for the first quarter as well. The firms reporting this week include: Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Walgreen’s (WAG).
"
3302,ORCL,"It will be a moderate week for economic data. Not a lot of reports, but the ones we will get are important, including both New and Used Home Sales, new orders for Durable Goods and the final look at GDP growth in the fourth quarter. With a very light week for earnings, and a fairly weak week for economic data, the markets will probably be focused on the international crisis du joir and on the budget negotiations.MondayExisting Home Sales are expected to dip to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million from 5.36 million. What is more significant will be the level of inventories, and if the January months of supply rate of 7.6 months can continue to decline. While down from last summer, the level is still extremely high and indicates strong downward pressure on home prices. That really is what to watch in the existing home sales numbers, since the amount of economic activity generated by an existing home changing hands is not really that big a deal. Home prices are a very big deal. Unfortunately, it looks like they are falling again.TuesdayNo major economic reports are expected.WednesdayNew Home Sales are expected to edge up to an annual rate of 288,000 from 284,000. While a 1.4% increase might look OK, it is coming off an extremely depressed base. In fact, the lowest nine months of New Home Sales on record have been in the last nine months, and if the consensus estimate is hit, make that ten of ten. It is hard to overestimate the importance of New Home Sales to the overall economy, especially in the early stages of an economic recovery. The low level of New Home Sales (and hence the low level of homebuilding activity) is the principal reason that this recovery has been so anemic. Every home built generates a huge amount of economic activity that feeds through the entire economy. With the possible exception of the GDP report, this is the most important economic data of the week.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. After being extremely erratic over the holidays, they have started to fall significantly, but are still bouncing around a bit. Last week they fell by 16,000 to 385,000. I would expect the downward trend in claims to continue next week. The consensus is looking for a minor decline to 384,000. A level of 385,000 seems pretty good compared to the experience of the last few years. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims were locked in a tight “trading range for most of 2010. We now appear to have broken out of that trading range to the downside. This could well indicate that the economy is about to start producing a significant number of new jobs. The four-week moving average (which smoothes out the week-to-week noise) was under the 400,000 for the third week in a row. Historically that has been an inflection point at which the economy starts to add significant numbers of jobs. Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 80,000 to 3.706 million. That is down 988,000 from a year ago. I would expect a further decline this week. Some of the longer term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. But those don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 54,000 to 4.303 million, and are down by 1.690 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.954 million, which is up 181,000,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.769 million below year ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!  Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.New Orders for Durable Goods are expected to have risen by 0.9% in February. That would be on top of a 2.7% rise in January. These numbers are frequently revised, and most forecasters think that the January numbers are more likely to be revised up than down. The January increase was due to a big percentage gain in orders for Transportation equipment, most notably civilian aircraft. Those orders had fallen to nearly nothing in December, so it was mostly a “division by zero effect. That is an extremely “lumpy area for new orders, as just a few jumbo jets can swamp order growth or declines for the rest of the economy in any given month. Excluding transportation equipment, orders actually fell by 3.6% in January. That number is also likely to be revised to show a smaller decline. For February, growth of 1.8% is expected. Changing the base can have a significant effect on the month-to-month change, and are worth paying attention too.FridayWe get the final look at the Big Kahuna, GDP growth in the fourth quarter. While that might be a bit of “old news, it is the most comprehensive measure of how well the economy is doing. In the first look, GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.2%, but the second peak at the data showed a big downward revision to just 2.8% growth. While that was a acceleration from the 2.6% in the third quarter, it was widely seen as being a disappointment. The quality of the growth was, however, far better than that of either the second or third quarters. The growth came from higher consumer spending and an improvement in net exports, not from simply re-stocking of inventories. The composition of growth is just as important and the overall level of growth. For the final look at the data, the consensus is looking for a small upward revision to 2.9% growth.

3304,ORCL,"It's no secret that corporations are sitting on huge piles of cash these days. In fact, by the latest count companies have close to $2 trillion in cash and other liquid assets on their books.
"
3305,ORCL,"While it's understandable that companies are a little gun-shy after the recent economic downturn, as the economy improves the issue becomes: what do these companies do with all of that dough?
"
3306,ORCL,"That's not a bad problem to have.
"
3307,ORCL,"Companies with lots of cash on hand are able to capitalize on various investment opportunities fairly easily. They can make acquisitions or grow organically without going to the costly debt or equity markets in order to fund their growth. And if they do seek financing, investors will require much lower rates of return than if the company was cash-strapped.
"
3308,ORCL,"Secondly, companies with plenty of cash can reward shareholders through stock buybacks or dividend payments. This is especially true of mature companies. Larger companies have fewer growth prospects, so it makes sense to return an increasingly large portion of earnings to shareholders.
"
3309,ORCL,"Think about Microsoft (MSFT) in the 1990s compared to the 2000s. The company grew tremendously for several years, but inevitably that growth slowed. Now the company rakes in the dough and pays out a decent amount to its shareholders. It began paying a dividend in 2003 and paid a special dividend of $3.00 per share in 2004. The company recenty raised its quarterly dividend 23%. Expect more dividend hikes in the future.
"
3310,ORCL,"Wal-Mart (WMT) is in the same position. Although sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 7.8% since 2000, the retail giant has increased its dividend at a 17.6% annual clip.
"
3311,ORCL,"Hoarding a little bit of cash isn't a bad idea though. Savvy companies, just like savvy households, keep some cash on hand as a safety net in case of an emergency. Companies with a defensive cash position and little or no debt survived the Great Recession, while many without a cushion did not. That means additional market share for the surviving firms.
"
3312,ORCL,"Although companies may not be earning much of a return sitting on so much cash, they're in a great position to make some smart acquisitions, invest in value-added projects, pay out a juicy dividend, or survive an Armageddon-like downturn.

3357,ORCL,"The Dow amassed 331.7 points to close at a record on Nov 30, finishing above the psychological 24,000 level for the first time in its history. Such a stellar rally was buoyed by increased hopes of tax reforms following Senator John McCain’s statements. McCain’s is seen as an important vote in getting the new tax code implemented. This represents the fifth 1,000-point milestone for the blue-chip index, which has gained nearly 22.8%, this year.Markets have been mostly bullish this year and this can be owed to prospects of likely reforms in the U.S. tax code and stupendous corporate earnings. Moreover, the U.S. economy has been burgeoning with more than 3% growth for two consecutive quarters. Finally, unemployment is at a 17-year low at 4.1%. Under such circumstances, we suggest you invest in mutual funds whose major holdings include companies from the top 10 components of the Dow.Tax Bill Clears the SenateThough the Senate passed the Republican Tax Bill by a narrow margin, this victory takes Trump closer than ever to delivering on the “promise” that was the cornerstone of his campaign — a new U.S. tax code. A cut in domestic tax rates would mean that banks and big financial institutions, which are weighed down by a hefty tax load, would benefit greatly.The Bill permanently slashes the corporate tax rate to 20%. Further, the tax repatriation provision allows big companies with global operations to bring back trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas. Finally, the Bill repeals the individual mandate of Obamacare in a bid to provide the citizens of the United States the freedom to choose from a variety of health plans and relieve them of the penalty for not having a health insurance.Moreover, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation policy is likely to improve the overall financial health of tech, drug and biotech companies. Such a tax holiday would allow large-cap corporations to bring back profits for one-time tax. Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. (Read More)Top Performers of the Dow Dow’s journey past 24,000 has been largely possible due to strong performances of some of its top components. Such companies include Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report).Caterpillar has witnessed an improvement across all regions with construction, mining and energy reporting the best performances year to date. This was buoyed by higher sales in Asia Pacific and North America. Improved order rates and backlog will fuel growth in Construction Industries. Moreover, Trump’s plans of increasing the infrastructural spending would boost Caterpillar’s revenues since it is expected to play a major role in the national infrastructure plan.Boeing's share price has outperformed the industry's rally over the last year. The aero-giant’s share price has increased 82.6% in the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 34.8%. Internationally, the company is witnessing strong demand for its commercial as well as defense products, such as fighter jets, the rotorcraft line-up and 737-based military derivatives.Apple posted strong growth in the last quarter, on the back of steady iPhone sales, spurt in Services segment and a resurgent Macs and iPad business. Moreover, business in India and China saw massive reacceleration driven by iPhone, Services and Mac sales.Goldman Sachs has experienced higher revenues on continued momentum in its investment banking business. Also, the company’s well-diversified business and its focus to capitalize on growth opportunities through strategic moves have boosted its gains. The company has also benefited for the past few years from its successful expense-reduction initiatives.JPMorgan's shares have outperformed the industry over the past six months. The bank’s efforts to control expenses, the improved rate scenario and rising loan demand should continue to benefit its financials. Finally, JPMorgan has been streamlining its businesses and focusing on core operations. The company continues to consolidate its branch network (down 3% year over year) with an increased focus on digitalization.On year-to-date (YTD) basis, share prices of Caterpillar, Boeing, Apple, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have gained 51.3%, 78.8%, 45.9%, 2.7% and 21.6%, respectively.5 Best Funds to Invest InThe question here is: why should investors consider mutual funds? Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds (read more: Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money).Here, we have highlighted five mutual funds whose major holdings include companies from the top 10 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

3358,ORCL,"The hottest sector, technology, is the worst victim of tax reform developments. Stocks in this sector have been on a wild ride over the past one week with most of them piling up huge losses. This is because investors are flocking to companies expected to get a bigger boost from the tax reform, which is on its way. It is now pending only the consolidated bill and the final signature by Donald Trump within Christmas (read: Senate Passes Tax Bill: 5 ETFs to Buy Now).Notably, this year’s top performing sector slid about 4% over the past week. The ultra-popular Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) shed 1.7% over the past five days compared with losses of 0.3% for the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report) and 1.3% for Nasdaq ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report). XLK saw outflows of about $540 million in the same period.How Tax Reform Could Hurt The Sector?According to S&P Global data, the technology sector pays an effective tax rate of 18.5% — the third lowest among U.S. large caps. As such, a reduction of tax rate to 20% would not really benefit the sector. Additionally, the retention of the corporate alternative minimum tax in the Senate version of the tax bill as well as the R&D tax credit is a concern for tech firms (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).As tech companies spend higher on research and development, they claim tax credits. However, by lowering the corporate tax rate, it might be harder for them to get this benefit. All these factors are weighing on investors’ sentiment on the technology sector.ETF PerformancesAmong the worst performers over the past week, semiconductor ETFs declined the most with PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL  -  Free Report) plunging 8.8% and 8%, respectively. The hottest ETFs of this year — Guggenheim China Technology ETF (CQQQ  -  Free Report) and KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB  -  Free Report) — also fell about 8% and 7%, respectively.The other poor performers were PowerShares DWA Technology Momentum Portfolio (PTF  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Software ETF PSJ, each losing about 7% (read: Tech ETFs & Stocks Tumble: Is it a Solid Entry Point?).What’s Ahead?Technology is still the best-performing sector this year, having generated twice the returns as the S&P 500 index through the first 11 months of the year. The outperformance is likely to continue heading into the New Year, given expectations of strong earnings, improved overseas industry demand, and innovative technologies.The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, and artificial intelligence will continue to fuel growth for the sector. With the global economy gathering strong momentum, technology stocks will continue to outshine and be less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation (read: 7 Top-Ranked Tech ETFs on Unstoppable Rally).Though the tech titans will benefit less from corporate tax cuts, they hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. Tech giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) combined have nearly $500 billion cash and cash equivalents held overseas, according to recent regulatory filings.Further, a pick-up in the economy and better job prospects will provide a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Moreover, after a brutal decline, most tech stocks have become cheap at current levels, offering a nice entry point for investors. As a result, investors could do some bargain hunting on ETFs that have become value picks. Most of the tech ETFs have a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting outperformance in the coming months.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3359,ORCL,"Symantec Corporation ((SYMC  -  Free Report) recently announced that the principal components of its Integrated Cyber Defense platform are now accessible through Oracle ((ORCL  -  Free Report) Cloud Marketplace. Symantec is already a Gold-level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN).Notably, in an era when organizations are rapidly shifting to cloud infrastructure, security breach related issues are turning out to be the primary concern. The recent cyber-attacks namely Wannacry and NotPetya have further boosted the need to secure sensitive data. This has paved the way for growth of companies like Symantec that deal with cloud security solutions.Moreover, the world is rapidly advancing toward the augmented version of private and public cloud, better known as hybrid cloud technology. This ensures cost effective storage and operations. The flexibility offered by the process can be scaled up per the client’s request, making it more lucrative.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform also offers similar services that combine the flexibility of public cloud with the detailed control and security of on-premises infrastructure. Symantec’s Cyber Defense platform addresses both on-premise and cloud security including the likes of Control Compliance Suite, Data Center Security, Data Loss Prevention, Endpoint Protection, Cloud Data Protection, and Protection Engine related solutions.We believe the combination of Oracle’s cloud infrastructure with Symantec’s cloud security based expertise will provide consumers with an enhanced experience. This will expand Symantec’s market presence, thereby boosting its top line going ahead.Symantec Corporation Revenue (TTM) Symantec Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Symantec Corporation QuoteSymantec in Cloud Security MarketIn a recent report, AB Newswire quoted WiseGuyReports.com that stated that the Cloud Security Market is expected to experience a 20.1% CAGR and reach $13.272 billion by 2022 from $5.314 billion in 2017.We believe the company’s techniques related to protection and management of confidential data, threat detection and end point protection along with its popular brands in security and utilities, including Norton Anti-Virus, Norton Internet Security and Norton System Works make it well equipped to grab the projected growth opportunity.Additionally, the company’s recent acquisitions of Fireglass and Skycure have also strengthened its Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, thereby solidifying its foothold in the industry.Furthermore, Microsoft’s ((MSFT  -  Free Report) recent announcement of its cloud platform Azure assisting Symantec in delivering Norton branded security software products to a customer base of over 50 million is another positive. We expect all these initiatives to be key catalysts for the company’s revenues, which increased 26.7% year over year in the last reported quarter.However, increasing competition in the cloud-based security industry from the likes of Check Point Software Technologies, Proofpoint and CyberArk Software remains a concern for the company.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSymantec has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A top-ranked stock in the sector is Intel Corporation ((INTC  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3361,ORCL,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.67, representing year-over-year growth of 5.4%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $9.24 billion, up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Accenture’s fiscal first-quarter result is likely to benefit from acquisitions and strategic partnerships.Let’s now discuss the aforementioned factors in detail.Acquisitions Expand Offerings & Global ReachAccenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. The company closed 37 acquisition deals worth approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017. Also, over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies, including start-ups.These acquisitions have helped the company enhance its product offerings and penetrate into newer markets, thereby contributing to the company’s top line. We believe the company’s acquisition strategy will have a positive impact on Accenture’s fiscal first-quarter top-line performance.Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Accenture PLC QuotePartnerships Bringing in Additional RevenuesApart from acquisitions, Accenture’s strategic partnerships with companies like Google, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) have also been key catalysts.  These have helped the company strengthen its product portfolio.In August 2017, the company entered into a partnership with Apple where the firms joined forces to create a mixed team of designers, programmers, and other Apple experts, within Accenture Digital Studios units in select locations around the world. The team will focus on developing tools and services for building iOS apps as per the requirements of Accenture’s clients across different industries. We believe this partnership will help Accenture enhance its digital transformation capabilities and bring in additional revenues.Partnerships have always helped the company fortify its presence across segments like IT security, customer-relationship management and consulting, thereby bolstering its revenues. We expect the company to retain this bullish momentum, backed by its continued focus on operational efficiency.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Accenture is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the stock fulfils the Zacks criteria for this to happen, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Accenture currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.49%.

3362,ORCL,"Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) signed a deal to scoop up Aconex Ltd for A$1.56 billion ($1.19 billion) in cash in an effort to expand into the rapidly-growing cloud market. The company expects the deal to be wrapped up in the first half of 2018. The completion of the buyout offer is subject to fulfilment of customary closing conditions.Aconex is an Australia-based company which makes cloud-based software to build construction projects to collaborate and share documents. The company has more than 70,000 customers and its cloud-based software has been used in 70 countries on 16,000 projects.If completed, the deal will provide an end-to-end cloud-based project management solution that would enable customers to successfully plan, build, and operate construction projects.According to the press release of Oracle, the deal is worth A$7.80 per share, representing a 47% premium over Aconex’s Friday closing price of A$5.29 per share.  Moreover, Aconex shares went up 44%, yesterday, following the news.In addition to Aconex, Oracle has also acquired companies such as Texture, Opower and Primavera to increase competitiveness in the cloud market.Mike Sicilia, SVP and GM, Construction and Engineering Global Business Unit of Oracle said, “With the addition of Aconex, we significantly advance our vision of offering the most comprehensive cloud-based project management solution for this $14 trillion industry.""Shares DeclineShares of Oracle were down 3.7% yesterday, attributed mainly to soft cloud outlook. Notably, the company’s stock has gained 27.6% year to date, underperforming the rally of 40% of the industry it belongs to. We believe that a slowdown in the cloud momentum can further drag down the stock price in fiscal 2018.Hence, Oracle has been resorting to acquisitions in order to step up its shift to the cloud. In doing so it acquired NetSuite Inc. in a deal valued at approximately $9.3 billion, or $109 per share last year.Bottom LineOracle is benefiting from significant momentum in its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. This has also helped in improving the company's competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report). We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth. This is further evident from the expanding customer base.Going forward, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).However, higher investments on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) will affect gross margin expansion in the near term. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind.Currently, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked technology stocks worth considering are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Intel have a long-term EPS growth rate of 10.3% and 8.4%, respectively.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3363,ORCL,"After the closing bell yesterday, software giant Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 results. While the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings, it disappointed investors with a bleak outlook.Oracle Q2 Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at 70 cents, a couple of cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 14% year over year. Revenues increased 6% year over year to $9.63 billion and were above the estimated $9.55 billion.The company’s long process of shifting to the Web-based cloud computing business is now paying off more than offsetting the decline in the legacy business. Cloud software platform sales climbed 44% from the year-ago quarter to $1.52 billion and accounted for 16% of total revenues. However, it is well below Reuters expectation of $1.56 billion (see: all the Technology ETFs here).For the fiscal third quarter, the world’s largest database software maker expects total revenues to grow 2-4% on a constant currency basis, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4.23% growth. This is because cloud sales are expected to increase 21-25%, lower than growth of 44% in the recently reported quarter and analyst expectation of 42% increase, suggesting a slowdown in the soaring cloud business. Further, the company expects earnings per share of 68-70 cents, which is also below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents, reflecting some concerns in the company’s future growth.The disappointing outlook pushed shares of Oracle down as much as nearly 7% in aftermarket trade with elevated volumes. Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a dismal Industry Rank in the bottom 35%. The Value and Growth Style Score is impressive at B and A, respectively.ETFs in FocusETFs with the highest allocation to this software giant look to be big movers this week and in the next, as investors digest its scores and views.

These acquisitions have helped the company enhance its product offerings and penetrate into newer markets, thereby contributing to the company’s top line.Most recently, the company signed an agreement with Altima to add to its digital marketing capabilities. Another notable acquisition in this domain was that of Karmarama, which also aided the company in adding a major client namely luxury car manufacturer Maserati to its client base.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC QuoteOther Strategic InitiativesApart from acquisitions, Accenture’s strategic partnerships with companies like Google, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) have also been key catalysts.  Recently, the company entered into a partnership with Apple.

3365,ORCL,"At times, it is prudent to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long-term gains. Though the stock faces several headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Further, during the year-to-date period, the stock has gained 0.01%, against the industry’s loss of 3.9%.What’s Going in HPE’ Favor?HPE reported modest fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 29 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and also came toward the higher end of management’s guidance range of 26-30 cents. Further, the figure jumped 26.1% on a year-over-year basis.The better-than-expected bottom-line performance was primarily owing to cost savings, lower tax rate, favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software-spin merger.HPE reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services) of $7.660 billion, up 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $7.324 billion.We consider that divestment of Software division is in best interest of HPE. The company has sold this division to British firm, Micro Focus, in a cash-stock deal worth $8.8 billion. HPE has received $2.5 billion in cash and the remaining consideration in the form of a 50.1% stake in the combined company. The software division generated fiscal 2016 revenues of $3.2 billion, down 11.8% from fiscal 2015 level. Moreover, it includes the highly controversial Autonomy acquisition that was mostly written down by the current CEO Meg Whitman.It also includes other buyouts like Mercury Interactive and Vertica. Consequently, by selling assets which are not doing well and have limited growth potential, the company will be able to mobilize resources to the fast-growing areas of the cloud such as software defined networks (SDN), and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure.Moreover, the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective. This is because HPE currently trades at a forward P/E of 11.18x compared with the industry group average of 76.30x, which signifies a huge upward potential.The stock’s long-term earnings per share growth rate is 6.6% and it carries a VGM Style Score of A.Concerns RemainIn a sudden move, Meg Whitman has decided to step down as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HPE, leaving the company in the middle of its restructuring phase to cut costs and focus on high-margin businesses.Whitman has been replaced by Antonio Neri who also serves as the current president of HPE.  Whitman will continue to function as a member of Board of Directors. Antonio will function as the CEO of HPE effective from Feb 1, 2018.Moreover, the company issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for first-quarter 2018. HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 20-24 cents (mid-point: 22 cents), which was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.The company also provided outlook for  2018. HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $1.15-$1.25 (mid-point $1.2). The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.17.We remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart overall performance in the near term.Further, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to woes.Our TakeWe are encouraged by the company’s massive restructuring initiatives. On one hand, it is offloading low-margin business such as Software, which, in our opinion, will improve the company’s margins over the long run. On the other hand, it is enhancing capabilities in the hybrid IT model as evident from the recent agreements to acquire SimpliVity and Cloud Cruiser. We believe the company’s focus on hybrid IT model will drive growth over the long run.We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest investors to hold on to the stock at the moment.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA has a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.2%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

3366,ORCL,"Workiva Inc. (WK  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7. Although the company reported loss in each of the trailing four quarters, it surpassed the Zack Consensus Estimate on all occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 48.21%.Last quarter, the company reported a loss of 14 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents.Revenues increased 14.8% year over year to $49.4 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $48 million.For third-quarter 2017, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $50.4-$50.8 million. Non-GAAP net loss is anticipated to be in the range of 29-30 cents per share.The company’s intuitive cloud platform, Wdesk, which is used for collecting, integrating, managing and analyzing business data, continues to gain traction and is expected to aid top-line growth in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Workiva stock has gained 65.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 29.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWorkiva is enjoying steady demand for its product from state and local government and universities. The company announced during the quarter that Wdesk has been adopted by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) for the purpose of creating the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for its $330 billion worth fund.During the quarter, Workiva partnered with EisnerAmper, one of the top 20 advisory and accounting firms in the United States. The duo will be working toward making the documentation process easier and less time consuming for EisnerAmper’s clients related to internal controls and other risk and governance processes. It will also help in the smooth implementation of financial controls related to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act’s regulations.Recently, Workiva also entered into a strategic partnership with Business Wire, a globally recognized name in press release distribution and regulatory disclosure. The partnership intends to streamline the process of submission of earnings releases and other financial disclosures by companies directly to Business Wire.However, intensifying competition from peers like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), SAP Business One, Adaptive Planning and OIKOS Treasury Suite is a concern for the company.Workiva Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Workiva Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Workiva Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Workiva is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Workiva’s Earnings ESPis 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 31 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Workiva’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA Corp.

3367,ORCL,"If you are still holding on to shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Dropping Hewlett PackardEnterprise can maximize investor’s portfolio returns as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past one year, and has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Although the entire industry to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to, has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has lost 43.3%, as compared with the industry’s decline of 20.1%.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking the company down.Why Hewlett Packard Enterprise Should be AvoidedFor the full year 2017, we have seen seven estimates moving south in the past 30 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to drift downward, going from $1.43 per share a month ago to current level of $1.40.Additionally, Hewlett PackardEnterprise has seen seven downward estimate revisions against only one revision in the opposite direction for the current quarter. This has led to the consensus estimate declining to 28 cents per share from 39 cents in the past 30 days.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter.The company also issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 26-30 cents (mid-point: 28 cents), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.As the company concluded its spin-merger of the Software business in the recently reported quarter, it adjusted the outlook for fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.36-$1.40 (mid-point $1.38), down from $1.46-$1.56. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46.Adding to the woes, the company posted an average negative earnings surprise of 0.58%.We remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Also, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.So, it may not be a prudent decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3368,ORCL,"Would Apple (AAPL) survive without Steve Jobs?
"
3369,ORCL,"It's a grim question, but it's one that investors are asking themselves after it was recently announced that Jobs would be taking another medical leave of absence.
"
3370,ORCL,"Investors shouldn't panic - for now at least. Although Jobs won't be running the day-to-day operations, he will still be involved in major strategic decisions at the company. And it's his strategic decisions that have led Apple to stratospheric heights. The company's ability to skate to where the puck is going, not to where it has been, is the result of Steve Jobs' leadership and vision.
"
3371,ORCL,"Apple also has an excellent team set in place that has taken over for Jobs during his other health-related absences. Back in 2004, Jobs left the company to battle pancreatic cancer and also took medical leave to recover from a liver transplant in the first half of 2009. In both cases, Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook successfully managed the day-to-day operations while marketing chief Phil Schiller and industrial design king Jony Ive continued to deliver hot new products.
"
3372,ORCL,"But what happens when Steve Jobs finally leaves for good?
"
3373,ORCL,"Apple will survive, but it won't be the same company. Steve Jobs is Apple. Odds are a new leader will make decisions that will take the company down a different path, and the new Apple won't have the same cachet it has today (of course, even with a visionary like Jobs, eventually Apple's growth has to level off).
"
3374,ORCL,"This is exactly what happened for several years to The Walt Disney Co (DIS). Granted, the company is a powerhouse once again, but it struggled for years to regain its ""magic"" after Walt died in 1966.
"
3375,ORCL,"Some CEOs are so synonymous with their companies that it's almost impossible to imagine the company surviving without them. But why is it that some companies have been able to successfully manage the departure of their larger-than-life founders while others have failed?
"
3376,ORCL,"A lot of it depends on their business model. Apple and Disney's success hinges upon creativity, innovation and an almost mystic-like feel to their products that is almost impossible to replicate without their famous founders.
"
3377,ORCL,"On the other hand, there are companies like Wal-Mart (WMT) that have been successful after the founder steps away. Sam Walton was a visionary when he started his everyday low-price retailer. But as the company expanded and gained buying power, it was able to offer even lower prices, and the company continued to thrive after his death in 1992.
"
3378,ORCL,"So what companies today would continue to thrive if their famous founders were to leave? Here are 4:Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)
"
3379,ORCL,"Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com in 1994. What started as an online bookstore has grown into the largest online retailer in the world. When the dot-com bubble burst, many online retailers went belly up, but Bezos was able to successfully navigate the company towards profitability.
"
3380,ORCL,"Can the company thrive without Time's Man of the Year (1999)? I think so. Amazon has become the Wal-Mart of online retailing (it attracts more than twice as much traffic as walmart.com), and more shoppers are moving away from traditional brick and mortar stores and towards Amazon. This is inevitable with or without their fearless leader.
"
3381,ORCL,"It is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.
"
3382,ORCL,"Oracle Corp (ORCL  -  Free Report)
"
3383,ORCL,"CEO Larry Ellison, the world's sixth richest man, has a larger-than-life persona. He has been at the company's helm since he founded it back in 1977. The company, best known for its flagship product the Oracle Database, is the third-largest in terms of software revenue in the world, behind Microsoft and IBM.
"
3384,ORCL,"But Oracle is expanding beyond enterprise software. It acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 and has nearly $25 billion in cash and short-term investments, so expect more acquisitions in the future. As the company becomes more diverse, it will also become less reliant on Ellison.

3386,ORCL,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report)
"
3387,ORCL,"From one Oracle to the next - Warren Buffett. Berkshire's famous Chairman and CEO has grown the company into one of the largest and most respected in the world. Buffett has used the ""float"" from the company's insurance operations to finance his savvy investments.
"
3388,ORCL,"Much has been made of who will replace him once the octogenerian finally departs. In October, the company announced 39 year-old hedge fund manager Todd Combs would eventually replace Buffett as its Chief Investment Officer. But certainly no one could replicate Buffett's investing success going forward, so Berkshire is doomed, right?
"
3389,ORCL,"Not necessarily. Because Buffett likes to own entire companies, he has grown Berkshire into a diversified holding company of more than 50 businesses. Berkshire is so large that each additional acquisition has less and less impact on Berkshire's bottom line.
"
3390,ORCL,"It is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.

3391,ORCL,"The Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW  -  Free Report)
"
3392,ORCL,"Charles Schwab founded his company in San Francisco in 1971. In 1975, he began offering discount brokerage, and the rest is history. Chuck already stepped down as CEO in October 2008 but remains Chairman of the Board.
"
3393,ORCL,"Although new CEO Walt Bettinger has some big shoes to fill, is it that difficult to picture the company surviving without its founder?

The move led to deep unrest among investors, causing shares to plunge around 7% on Nov 22.Coming to the price performance, the stock has lost 3.1% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 2%.Whitman has been replaced by Antonio Neri who also serves as the current president of HPE.  Whitman will continue to function as a member of Board of Directors in HPE.

In fact, under Whitman’s leadership, HPE has achieved a major milestone in becoming a stronger, more focused company, which can compete and win in today’s market.Under Whitman’s leadership, the company restored its balance sheet, strengthened operations and enhanced customer satisfaction.  Post separation from HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), the company also made innovative moves to focus and strengthen portfolio. Moreover, Whitman orchestrated the spin off and mergers of HPE’s Enterprise Services and Software businesses, as well as strategic acquisitions including Aruba, SGI, SimpliVity and Nimble Storage.HPE’s TroubleRecently, the company reported not-so encouraging fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny while the top line missed the same. Moreover, the view provided by the company was also not worth an applause.HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 20-24 cents (mid-point: 22 cents), which was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.The company also provided outlook for fiscal 2018. HPE expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.15-$1.25 (mid-point $1.2).

In our opinion, if any one that could succeed Whtiman, the name is Antonio. Neri’s appointment is a sound choice, given his profound experience in the company over the years.

3398,ORCL,"The sudden return of volatility to global stock markets has created buying opportunities in large-cap tech stocks as the sector’s investors look to rebound from recent selloffs. The world’s tech leaders have dominated Wall Street over the past two years, and now, investors might have a fresh chance to buy a few previously red-hot stocks at a discount.Of course, this recent volatility has made some investors hesitant, with bearish traders quick to draw similarities between this latest tech rally and the infamous dot-com bubble of the late 90s and early 2000s.However, unlike the dot-com bubble, there is real earnings and revenue growth fueling this tech rally. In fact, the average P/E ratio of our “Computer and Technology” sector currently sits at 21.3, which compares favorably to the dot-com era’s average that routinely soared into the 200s.Another interesting trend in today’s tech rally is that, rather than obsessing over the next big thing, investors seem to rewarding tried-and-true brands for their respectable growth. This means that some of the strongest tech stocks are the household names that consumers already know and love.With that said, check out these three blue chip tech stocks to buy now:1. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report)Amazon does not need much of an introduction, but investors should always remember that the company has its hands in much more than just the e-commerce business that brought it fame. The Seattle-based firm is now a legitimate brick-and-mortar retailer, cloud computing provider, entertainment media publisher, and more. AMZN is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Amazon’s track record speaks for itself, as shares have gained nearly 70% in the trailing one-year period. The stock has shrugged off market-wide volatility and continues to test new highs. Earnings are expected to improve by a staggering 180% this year, with sales surging nearly 34%. AMZN is a staple stock that should appease investors looking for near-term strength and long-term, buy-and-hold gains. 2. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report)Thanks to its strategic investments in datacenters and artificial intelligence, Nvidia has emerged as one of Wall Street’s most popular stocks. Of course, the company’s industry-leading GPUs remain its backbone and are the number one choice for PC gamers worldwide. Nvidia shares have gained over 57% within the past year, and since the stock is still sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it is showing few signs of stopping.Nvidia is still in an aggressive growth cycle, with current estimates calling for the firm to see EPS and revenue growth of 61% and 36%, respectively, this fiscal year. And of course, Nvidia has made a habit out of crushing expectations. Management is also improving its finances, generating cash flow growth of nearly 67%. Valuations are stretched, but investors should be willing to pay a premium for a company with Nvidia’s proven success and continued potential. 3. Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report)Facebook found itself at a bit of an impasse earlier this year as its handling of user data garnered significant public and regulatory scrutiny. But the company never felt much in terms of actual regulatory action, and so far, its revenue growth has significantly outpaced new costs associated with upping security and vetting content.FB is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and looks like one of the internet industry’s top picks once again. Earnings and revenue are expected to improve by 24% and 41%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, the stock has a PEG of just 1.1, so investors are getting a good price for that earnings growth. Plus, at 25.6x forward earnings, FB is the cheapest it has been in quite some time. Want more market analysis from this author?

3399,ORCL,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) reported modest fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny while the top line missed the same.The company’s non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations of 29 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and also came toward the higher end of management’s guidance range of 26-30 cents. Further, the figure jumped 26.1% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 23 cents from continuing operations, compared with 19 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, it compared favorably with the guided range of a breakeven to earnings of 4 cents.The better-than-expected bottom-line performance was primarily owing to cost savings, lower tax rate, favorable other income and expense as well as transactions in connection with Software-spin merger.Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Consequently, Hewlett Packard considers Enterprise Services as a discontinued operation since the fiscal second quarter, and the year-ago quarter’s results have also been adjusted accordingly.Additionally, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter. Per the company, this quarter “represents adjustment to net periodic pension cost resulting from remeasurements of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise pension plans in connection with the spin-off of the software business, Seattle SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Seattle SpinCo, Inc. with Micro Focus International plc and the spin-off of the enterprise services business, Everett SpinCo, Inc., and the merger of Everett SpinCo, Inc. with Computer Sciences Corporation.”Before diving into the quarter’s details, it is to be noted that the company in its separate press release announced that its current CEO Meg Whitman will step down, but will remain on the HPE Board of Directors. Effective from Feb 1, 2018, current President Antonio Neri will become president and CEO of the company.Following the news, shares of HPE declined more than 5% in after-hours trading, on Nov 21. Moreover, tepid earnings guidance for first quarter and fiscal 2018 negatively impacted the share price.Quarter in DetailRevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group and Financial Services) of $7.660 billion, up 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $7.324 billion. However, quarterly revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.714 billion.Adjusted for currency exchange rates and divestures, the company’s revenues from continuing operations were up 11% year over year.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s performance in the Americas stayed constant mainly due to steady core compute and higher networking which was offset to some extent by softer organic storage results.

3400,ORCL,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), yesterday, reported encouraging third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line not only came ahead of its estimates but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, the company recorded impressive year-over-year growth in revenues, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s non-GAAP earnings of 31 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents and also came ahead of management’s guidance range of 24-28 cents. However, the figure plunged 22.5% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of 15 cents from continuing operations, as against $1.43 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, it compared favorably with the guided range of a loss of 2 cents to earnings of 2 cents.Per the company, the better-than-expected bottom-line performance was mainly “due to cost savings, software performance and favorable other income and expense.”Notably, during second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company closed the spin-merger of its Enterprise Services business. Therefore, Hewlett Packard considers Enterprise Services as a discontinued operation since the fiscal second quarter, and the year-ago quarter’s results have also been adjusted accordingly.In addition, the company completed the pending spin-merger of its Software business in the fiscal third quarter. However, in this quarter, results include the full business of this division.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteQuarter in DetailRevenuesHewlett Packard Enterprise reported revenues from continuing operations (which includes Enterprise Group, HPE Financial Services and Software businesses) of $8.209 billion, up 2.5% from the year-earlier quarter’s revenues of $8.005 billion. Quarterly revenues comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.566 billion.The year-over-year growth was mainly driven by “better execution and a compelling portfolio”, which was partially offset by heightened commodities pricing pressure and unfavorable exchange rates. Adjusted for currency exchange rates and divestures, the company’s revenues from continuing operations were up 6% year over year.During the fiscal third quarter, the company witnessed uneven global demand across all regions. In the United States, sales, excluding Tier 1 servers, grew on the back of elevated sales of core servers and strong growth in networking business. However, the storage business witnessed a soft performance. Europe made a turnaround this quarter, registering year-over-year growth, mainly attributed to strong performance in “Germany and broad stabilization across Western Europe.” Additionally, the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region recorded growth, with stellar performance in Japan, China and India.Segment wise, revenues at the Enterprise Group were up 3% from the year-ago quarter to $6.8 billion. Adjusting for divestures and currency, segment revenues came in at 3%. While revenues from Servers were down 1%, Storage, Networking and Technology Services were up 11%, 16% and 1%, respectively.Software revenues declined 3% to $718 million. Adjusted for divestures and currency, the segment’s revenues were down 2%, when compared with the prior-year quarter. Revenues from Support and Professional Services dropped 2% and 23%, respectively. License and SaaS revenues, however, grew 2% and 7% year over year, respectively.Financial Services revenues were up 10% to $897 million. The segment’s net portfolio grew 2%, but financing volume dipped 8% year over year.Operating ResultsHewlett Packard Enterprise’s gross margin contracted 340 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 33%. This year-over-year contraction was mainly due to competitive pricing, elevated DRAM pricing, unfavorable currency, as well as stranded costs and short-term dilution from the recent acquisitions.Moreover, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin descended 150 bps to 8.4%, primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by a decline in non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHewlett Packard Enterprise ended the fiscal third quarter with $7.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down from $8.1 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt at the quarter end was $14.527 billion compared with $11.904 billion recorded in the last quarter.During the quarter, Hewlett Packard Enterprise generated $891 million of cash flow from operational activities. Free cash flow was $428 million. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, the company generated $63 million of cash flow for operational activities.Additionally, during the reported quarter, the company returned $732 million to its shareholders, of which $625 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise returned $2.259 billion to its shareholders, of which $1.936 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.GuidanceThe company issued a disappointing bottom-line guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 26-30 cents (mid-point: 28 cents), which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company guides the bottom line to be in a range of breakeven to earnings of 4 cents.As the company completed its spin-merger of the Software business in the recently reported quarter, it adjusted the outlook for fiscal 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise now expects non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 in the range of $1.36-$1.40 (mid-point $1.38), down from $1.46-$1.56 (mid-point $1.51). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46. On a GAAP basis, the company now projects the bottom line to be in the range of a loss of 7-11 cents. Earlier, the company’s guidance was in the range of a loss of 3 cents to earnings of 7 cents.However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise estimates free cash flow to be negative $1.8 billion in fiscal 2017.Our TakeAfter two back-to-back quarters of dismal performance, Hewlett Packard Enterprises reported encouraging fiscal third-quarter results, which indicates that the company’s contrarian strategy is in the right direction.The stock’s after-hour trade performance reflects that the better-than-expected quarterly results have reinstated investor’s optimism. Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained approximately 5% during yesterdays’ after-hour trading session.Notably, although the entire industry, to which Hewlett Packard Enterprise belongs to, has been underperforming, the stock is among the worst performers. During the year-to-date period, the stock has lost 39.3% of its value, as compared with the industry’s loss of 19%.During the conference call, the company’s chief executive — Meg Whitman — hinted that it will continue to look for “opportunity to create an internal structure and operating model that is simpler, nimbler and faster.” This indicates that we may see Hewlett Packard Enterprise becoming even smaller with spin offs, or acquiring assets to enhance its capabilities in the hybrid IT model.Nonetheless, we remain slightly cautious about the company’s near-term prospects due to the three main challenges it is currently facing — heightened pressure from unfavorable currency exchange movements, elevated commodities pricing and some near-term execution issues. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Also, macroeconomic challenges and tepid IT spending remain other concerns. Competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) adds to its woes.Currently, Hewlett Packard Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Iteris, Inc. (ITI  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3401,ORCL,"Earnings Preview 12/10/10
"
3402,ORCL,"The third quarter earnings season is over, and we will actually start to see a handful of fourth quarter reports next week, those with November fiscal ends. Only 63 firms will report, but 6 of those will be S&P 500 firms.
"
3403,ORCL,"We define any fiscal period ending in November, December and January to be the fourth quarter. While there are a not a lot of reports, the reports we get will provide some early clues on the fourth quarter. The firms reporting this week include: Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Discover (DFS  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) and Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL). That is an interesting cross section of the market that may provide clues to the overall direction of the economy.
"
3404,ORCL,"While things will be quite on the earnings side, the same is not true of the economic data front. Inflation will be in focus to start the week as the PPI comes out on Tuesday followed by the CPI on Wednesday. We will also get data on Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization, housing Starts and the leading economic indicators. In addition, we have a Fed meeting.  MondayNothing of significance.TuesdayWe get the Producer Price Index (PPI). It has been running higher than the Consumer Price Index for several months now, particularly on the headline level. Headline PPI is expected to come in at an increase of 0.5% up from 0.4% in October. Excluding food and energy, the rise is not expected to be as big, but to also show more acceleration, with a rise of 0.3% only partially reversing the 0.6% drop in October. Those numbers are for finished goods. The report will also show data further up the production pipeline, which could warn of higher inflation down the road.Retail Sales are expected to rise by 0.8%, which is a healthy showing, but down from the very strong 1.2% increase posted in October. The October increase was, however, driven by a sharp rise in Auto sales (relative to September). Stripping them out, overall sales rose just 0.4% in October. Sales ex-autos are expected to accelerate to 0.6% growth.The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee is almost universally expected to keep the Fed Funds rate in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been in for over two years now. There should not be any major announcements out of the meeting like there was with the announcement of QE2 last meeting. The market will, however, probably look very closely at the Fed policy statement for any changes from the last meeting.WednesdayThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been extremely well behaved of late, rising just 0.2% in October. Stripping out food and energy prices, inflation has been even more subdued, unchanged not only in October, but for the last three months in a row. In November the consensus is looking for the headline number to again rise 0.2% while the core barely breaks into positive territory with a 0.1% rise. That would actually be good news as it would diminish the threat of actual deflation.The Empire State Manufacturing Index, one of the “mini ISMs is expected to bounce back to a reading of 2.9% from an extremely and surprisingly weak showing of -11.14 in October. Any reading over 0 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity in New York State. The expected reading would mean positive but very slow growth, but that is better than the fairly sharp contraction last month. On the other hand, it has been a long time since New York State was a manufacturing powerhouse. This is an index that is best tracked in conjunction with the other regional mini ISMs.Industrial Production is expected to have increased by 0.3% after being unchanged in October. The overall Industrial production number can sometimes be a bit misleading. It includes utility output, which is highly weather dependent. Thus it is important to look not only at the overall number, but the change in manufacturing output. The October number was actually much better than the unchanged reading would indicate as it included a 3.4% drop in Utility output. Manufacturing output increased by a healthy 0.5% on the month.Capacity Utilization is reported along with Industrial Production. This is a highly underrated economic indicator and deserves a lot more attention than it gets in the press. Effectively it is measuring the employment rate of our physical capital, the way the employment report measures the utilization of our human capital. Overall capacity utilization is expected to rise to 75.0% up from 74.8% in October. That is much better than the 70.7% reading we saw a year ago, but is still historically low and indicating recessionary conditions. A healthy economy has capacity utilization around 80%, so we are about half way back to normal on this measure. As with the Industrial production number it is important to look at the Manufacturing only utilization as well as the overall, since there can be weather related changes in utility utilization. The October unchanged overall reading masked a rise to 72.7% from 72.3% in manufacturing. That was offset by a drop to76.6% from 79.8% in Utility Utilization. I suspect a return to more normal utility utilization will lead to a bigger than expected increase in overall capacity utilization.ThursdayNew Claims for Unemployment Insurance have been trending down recently, but erratically. Last week the four-week moving average (which takes out some of the week to week volatility fell to its lowest level since August 2008. The actual reading for the week was 421,000, down from over 500,000 in mid-August. It looks like we have finally moved out of the “trading range that initial claims have been stuck in for most of the year. That is very good news if it continues. We probably have to get down to under 400,000 and stay there to start to make a serious dent in the army of the unemployed, but at least we are making a serious move in the right direction. A small rebound for the week would not surprise me, but the four week moving average will probably continue to decline.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 191,000 to 4.086 million. That is down 1.219 million from a year ago. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks, but even extended claims have started to decline as well. Federally paid extended claims fell by 393,000 to 4.507 million, and down 120,000 from a year ago (the first year over year decline in this economic cycle). Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.298 million, which is down 612,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.249 million below year-ago levels. The big unknown is if those people are actually finding new jobs, or simply slipping into abject poverty with no income at all. Extended benefits are made up of four tiers, and the ability to move on to the next tier ended on 11/30. Reinstatement of that ability is dependent on the overall tax deal being ratified, which is likely, but not a certainty. Look for a big drop in extended claims next week simply from benefits expiring. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.Housing Starts are expected to rebound to an annual rate of 545,000, up from 519,000 in October. That is still a simply awful level of housing starts. Then again with the last six months being the lowest six months in history (back to 1963), there is simply not a big need to increase housing starts. There is still a huge inventory overhang of both new and existing homes, particularly relative to recent sales rates. Still, normally residential investment, of which new home construction is the biggest part, has historically been the locomotive that pulls the economy out of recessions and that locomotive has been derailed this time around. A rebound in housing starts could indicate that housing is getting back on track, and that could indicate much more robust economic growth as we move into 2011. It would not take very heroic absolute levels of housing starts to generate very robust percentage increases from current levels.The Philly Fed index, another regional “mini-ISM is expected to drop to 14.1 from a surprisingly robust 22.5 in October. That would still indicate a healthy rise in manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic area, but not quite as fast as last month.The index of leading economic indicators is expected to show an increase of 1.2% up from a 0.5% increase last month.FridayNo numbers of any particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceENZO BIOCHEM    ENZ        201010 ($0.08) ($0.05) 0 20101213 BTO $4.92 FUELCELL ENERGY FCEL       201010 ($0.13) ($0.21) -7.14 20101213 AMC $1.32 GOLUB CAPITAL   GBDC       201009 $0.29  N/A 3.57 20101213 BTO $17.02 LAKELAND INDS   LAKE       201010 $0.12  ($0.03) 400 20101213 AMC $9.05 SPARTECH CORP   SEH        201010 $0.06  $0.15  -118.52 20101213 AMC $9.86 ADDVANTAGE TECH AEY        201009 N/A $0.07  N/A 20101214 BTO $3.78 APPLD SIGNAL    APSG       201010 $0.22  $0.27  18.18 20101214 AMC $34.46 BEST BUY        BBY        201011 $0.60  $0.53  36.36 20101214 BTO $42.00 COMPOSITE TECH  CPTC       201009 N/A N/A N/A 20101214   $0.26 CSP INC         CSPI       201009 N/A ($0.04) N/A 20101214 BTO $5.12 FACTSET RESH    FDS        201011 $0.84  $0.74  2.5 20101214   $94.49 HOVNANIAN ENTRP HOV        201010 ($0.69) ($2.99) 32.08 20101214 AMC $4.36 IMPERIAL SUGAR  IPSU       201009 ($0.02) ($1.35) -1500 20101214 BTO $13.87 INTEGRATED ELEC IESC       201009 ($0.44) ($0.20) -1533.33 20101214 AMC $3.24 INTL ASSET HLDG IAAC       201009 N/A $0.08  52.63 20101214 AMC $23.76 NATL TECH SYS   NTSC       201010 $0.11  $0.11  -37.5 20101214 BTO $7.57 NEVADA GOLD&CAS UWN        201010 N/A ($0.03) N/A 20101214 AMC $1.08 PANTRY INC      PTRY       201009 $0.71  $0.60  38.24 20101214 BTO $20.13 PNI DIGITAL MED PNDMF      201009 $0.05  $0.05  N/A 20101214 DMT $1.74 SANDERSON FARMS SAFM       201010 $1.71  $0.96  -17.11 20101214 BTO $42.20 SYNERGETICS USA SURG       201010 $0.03  $0.02  N/A 20101214 AMC $4.50 THE9 LTD-ADR    NCTY       201009 ($0.37) ($0.35) 15.38 20101214 AMC $6.41 AAR CORP        AIR        201011 $0.36  $0.34  16.67 20101215 AMC $27.07 ABM INDUSTRIES  ABM        201010 $0.43  $0.39  0 20101215 AMC $24.77 APOGEE ENTRPRS  APOG       201011 ($0.10) $0.39  -80 20101215 AMC $12.71 CROSSROADS SYS  CRDS       201010 N/A $0.03  N/A 20101215   $0.97 HERMAN MILLER   MLHR       201011 $0.28  $0.20  -11.54 20101215 AMC $23.43 JOY GLOBAL INC  JOYG       201010 $1.15  $1.16  10.78 20101215 BTO $78.36 NORDSON CORP    NDSN       201010 $1.37  $0.85  16.07 20101215 AMC $85.77 PURE BIOSCIENCE PURE       201010 N/A ($0.05) N/A 20101215 AMC $2.53 RENTECH INC     RTK        201009 ($0.02) ($0.03) -200 20101215 DMT $1.38 WILLIAMS CTRLS  WMCO       201009 $0.09  $0.05  100 20101215 BTO $11.11 WPCS INTL INC   WPCS       201010 N/A $0.05  -83.33 20101215 AMC $2.88 ACCENTURE PLC   ACN        201011 $0.75  $0.67  4.76 20101216   $44.61 ACTUANT CORP    ATU        201011 $0.34  $0.20  10.71 20101216 BTO $27.26 BIO REFERNC LAB BRLI       201010 $0.30  $0.25  3.57 20101216   $20.68 DISCOVER FIN SV DFS        201011 $0.41  $0.12  34.29 20101216 BTO $18.77 FEDEX CORP      FDX        201011 $1.31  $1.10  -0.83 20101216 BTO $94.09 GENL MILLS      GIS        201011 $0.78  $0.77  1.59 20101216 BTO $35.67 GIGAMEDIA LTD   GIGM       201009 $0.03  ($0.04) -1800 20101216 BTO $1.55 HEICO CORP      HEI        201010 $0.40  $0.34  18.92 20101216 AMC $55.82 LUBY'S INC      LUB        201011 N/A ($0.10) -80 20101216 AMC $6.10 MARCUS CORP     MCS        201011 $0.07  $0.04  0 20101216 BTO $14.30 NEOGEN CORP     NEOG       201011 $0.26  $0.20  8.7 20101216 BTO $38.99 NORDION INC     NDZ        201010 $0.01  ($0.10) -1100 20101216   $10.97 ORACLE CORP     ORCL       201011 $0.43  $0.37  11.43 20101216 AMC $29.26 PIER 1 IMPORTS  PIR        201011 $0.14  $0.02  0 20101216 BTO $10.46 QUIKSILVER INC  ZQK        201010 $0.07  $0.02  166.67 20101216 AMC $5.68 RESEARCH IN MOT RIMM       201011 $1.64  $1.10  8.15 20101216 AMC $61.29 RICKS CABARET   RICK       201009 $0.14  $0.19  -55 20101216 AMC $7.22 RITE AID CORP   RAD        201011 ($0.13) ($0.10) -12.5 20101216 BTO $0.92 SCHIFF NUTRITN  WNI        201011 $0.12  $0.20  8.33 20101216 BTO $8.75 SCHOLASTIC CORP SCHL       201011 $2.19  $2.29  -66.67 20101216 BTO $30.56 SMART MODULAR   SMOD       201011 $0.11  $0.06  30 20101216 AMC $6.45 STEELCASE INC   SCS        201011 $0.14  $0.04  60 20101216 AMC $10.19 STEWART ENTRP A STEI       201010 $0.07  $0.05  -14.29 20101216   $6.23 TAKE-TWO INTER  TTWO       201010 $0.27  ($0.04) 200 20101216 AMC $12.05 TORTOISE ENERGY TYY        201011 ($0.12) N/A N/A 20101216   $26.95 WINNEBAGO       WGO        201011 $0.02  ($0.05) 466.67 20101216 BTO $12.10 XENONICS HLDGS  XNNH       201009 N/A $0.00  N/A 20101216 BTO $0.45 BEACON ENTERPRS BEAC       201009 N/A ($0.12) N/A 20101217   $0.42 CARNIVAL CORP   CCL        201011 $0.33  $0.24  12.24 20101217 BTO $43.74 WOLFORD AG ADR  WLFDY      201010 N/A $0.24  N/A 20101217   $3.04 My apologies for missing the last two weeks.

3405,ORCL,"The bull market that started in 2009 is expected to go strong this year. This optimism largely stems from the Santa Claus rally, which is being felt way ahead of Christmas. This year’s holiday season started on a solid note as consumers have stepped up their online purchases. But, it’s the Senate Republican’s approval of the rewrite of the U.S. tax code that is likely to drive the equity market higher.Further, encouraging economic backdrop and higher consumer confidence in recent times also painted a rosy picture. Thus, it’s time to invest in solid stocks that are likely to make the most of the bullish sentiments.December: The Best Month for InvestorsHistorically, the month of December has been the best for the S&P 500 investors. While it has been the second best for the Dow and the Nasdaq, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks also tends to perform well starting mid-December going into January.The table shows December’s monthly return for the S&P 500 from 1964-2016:MonthAverage ReturnJan0.9%Feb0.1%Mar1.2%Apr1.5%May0.2%Jun0.0%Jul0.4%Aug-0.1%Sep-0.4%Oct1.0%Nov1.1%Dec1.4%(Source: Topdown Charts, Thomson Reuters)In fact, all the major indices more or less have yielded an average return of at least 1.8% in the final month of the year since 1987, per CNBC analysis using Kensho. This is entirely because of the Santa Claus Rally or the rise in prices in the final six days of the year. This term was first coined by market analyst Yale Hirsch in 1972 in The Stock Trader's Almanac.But, many market pundits have been using the term to refer to the period from the beginning of December, or even as early as Black Friday, to Christmas. And this time around, markets have gained on strong holiday sales and, there you have it, a Santa Claus rally. Consumers have also shown confidence in their financial future and are prepared to spend more. This is usually what triggers a Santa Claus rally.Santa Claus Rally Drives Holiday SalesAbout 174 million Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend, surpassing the estimated 164 million, according to the National Retail Federation. Cyber Monday, in fact, registered the largest online shopping day in U.S. history. Online sales crossed the $6.6 billion mark by the end of the day, reflecting a rise of 16.8% from the same period last year.Lest we forget, around $5.03 billion was spent online on Black Friday, reflecting an uptick of 17% from last year. Small Business Saturday and Sunday (Nov 25 & 26) also recorded combined online sales of $5.12 billion, up 10% from the year-ago levels.Senate Passes Sweeping Tax Overhaul BillThe Senate voted 51-49 to approve the Republican tax bill. It’s a major policy change that will create big winners and help markets maintain the decade-long bull run.The bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, marking the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates. Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Let us also not forget, tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.As the Senate approved the tax bill, small-cap stocks will also tend to surge. After all, such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30% for quite some time, while their large-cap counterparts are paying close to 25%.Gearing Up for a Solid End to 2017: 5 BuysCourtesy of positive seasonal trend, solid holiday sales and Republicans’ approval of the nearly $1.5-trillion tax rewrite, we are lined up for a strong year-end rally. The economy had already seen the fastest growth in three years in the third quarter, which highlights its resilience toward devastating events like the recent hurricanes.Hence, it will be prudent to invest in five of the best stocks in the market that can make the most of this bullish sentiment. Such stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

3408,ORCL,"It is going to be one very busy and volatile week.
"
3409,ORCL,"The main event is the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. This is will be a one-day meeting with a statement due out around 2:15 ET. Expectations call for the Fed to cut the federal funds rate by as much as 50 basis points, though I think the cut will be 25 basis points. As important as the size of the rate cut will be, which is not guaranteed to happen, the wording in the statement will matter too. Any language judged to be overly hawkish or that signals the pace of growth is slowing too rapidly will cause some turmoil. Bluntly put, there is a lot of room for error. A ""sell on the news"" reaction to an otherwise favorable rate cut and statement is also not out of the realm of possibilities.

3410,ORCL,"Four of the leading investment banking firms will be reporting fiscal third-quarter results. Lehman Brothers (LEH) is scheduled for Tuesday morning.

Profit forecasts have been falling for all four firms.
"
3411,ORCL,"Friday is a triple witching day, meaning stock options, index options and futures contracts will all expire. Combined, these expirations can lead to increased volatility. In addition, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, starts that evening. As a result, trading volume could taper in the afternoon and some of Friday's volatility could start on Thursday.

3413,ORCL,"Monday: The New York Fed's Empire State Index will be released in the morning.

Two companies are scheduled to report including S&P 500 member Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report)
"
3414,ORCL,"Tuesday: Lehman Brothers will report before the bell and will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET. August PPI will be released in the morning, giving the Fed one additional reading on inflation. The FOMC will release its statement around 2:15 (possibly, a few minutes earlier or later). In addition to Lehman, eight companies will report earnings including S&P 500 members AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report)
"
3415,ORCL,"Wednesday: August CPI, housing starts and building permits will be released in the morning. Morgan Stanley will report as will 13 other companies, including S&P 500 fellow member General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report).
"
3416,ORCL,"Thursday: Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs will report before the start of trading. (BSC was the only major brokerage firm to miss second-quarter expectations and profit forecasts have been falling ever since.) The Conference Board's index of leading indicators and weekly initial jobless claims will be published in the morning. In addition to BSC and GS, earnings reports from 15 other companies have been confirmed including S&P 500 members ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report), Circuit City (CC), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).
"
3417,ORCL,"Friday: Stock options, index options and futures contracts all expire. The Philadelphia Fed will release the results of its latest manufacturing survey around lunchtime. One company is confirmed to report. Yom Kippur starts at sundown.
"
3418,ORCL,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21General Mills recently revealed that it generated ""good sales and earnings per share gains for its fiscal 2008 first quarter"". The company guided for sales growth above its previous forecast of low single-digit growth and for earnings per share of about 81 cents per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate five cents higher to 81 cents per share. GIS matched fiscal fourth-quarter expectations after previously topping estimates for 10 consecutive quarters. General Mills is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 19, before the start of trading.
"
3419,ORCL,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21
"
3420,ORCL,"As I stated previously, forecasts for Bear Stearns have been falling ever since the company missed second-quarter expectations. During the past three months, fiscal third-quarter profit projections have plunged 35% to $2.22 per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish at $1.70 per share, reflecting cuts by two brokerage analysts within the past seven days. Bear Stearns is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 20, before the start of trading.
"
3421,ORCL,"Lehman Brothers easily surpassed fiscal second-quarter expectations after coming up a penny shy during the first quarter. Profit forecasts for the fiscal third-quarter have dropped materially over the past 30 days with nine of the 14 covering brokerage analysts lowering their projections (including two within the past week). The current consensus estimate of $1.60 per share is 21 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at $1.47 per share. Lehman Brothers is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 18, before the start of trading.

3427,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) has returned over 21% year to date, reflecting increasing earnings estimates, a successful acquisition strategy, and the release of the Oracle Database 11g. 
"
3428,ORCL,"Full Analysis
"
3429,ORCL,"Oracle Corporation, the worlds largest enterprise software company, engages in the development, manufacture, distribution, servicing, and marketing of database, middleware, and application software. The company operates in five segments: New Software Licenses, Software License Updates and Products Support, Consulting, On Demand, and Education. The company distributes its products and services to resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, Internet service providers, network integrators, and independent software vendors.
"
3430,ORCL,"On Jun 26, this Zacks #1 Rank stock reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 36 cents per share, up from 29 cents in the prior-year period and two cents above expectations. The release marked the sixth consecutive quarter in which profit has increased by at least 20%. Adding fuel to the fire, management promised to boost earnings by at least 20% annually for the next two years. Driving the strong earnings growth, revenues totaled $5.83 billion, up 20% from last year. As testament to the companys strength, sales of new product licenses surged 17% to $2.48 billion, above managements estimates of a 5% to 15% increase. Full-year earnings rose to 81 cents per share, up 26% from the prior year. Revenues rose 25% to a record $18 billion. 
"
3431,ORCL,"Since year-end 2004, Oracle has acquired over 30 software makers, spending more than $25 billion in the process. Company CEO, Larry Ellison, commented that Oracle intends to continue its aggressive expansion strategy. In addition, Oracle has been the largest vendor of heavy-duty database software for years, owning 47.1% of the market compared with only 21.1% for IBM, its closest rival. Earlier this month the company introduced Oracle Database 11g, the newest and highest quality software product Oracle has ever announced. The product is widely expected by analysts to drive a 20% rise in stock price over the next year.  
"
3432,ORCL,"Following Oracles second consecutive earnings surprise, analysts raised full-year 2008 estimates to $1.15 from $1.10. Next years estimates have steadily trended higher as well and currently stand at $1.33, up from $1.23 three months ago. In addition, Zacks ranks the company a number one out of 114 companies in the Computer Software category.  
"
3433,ORCL,"Over the last two years, ORCL has performed remarkably well, soaring 40.4% in 2006 and over 21% for 2007, well above the major market indices. After soaring to new highs in November of last year, the stock retraced its gains by roughly 20% before finding support against the 200-day moving average. Since then, ORCL has taken off, surpassing resistance and going on to make new 52-week highs. 
"
3434,ORCL,"The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (""the Fed"") will hold a two-day meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The Committee's statement is expected to be released at about 2:15 p.m. (plus or minus five minutes) on Wednesday. The target for the federal funds rate should be left unchanged at 5.25%.
"
3435,ORCL,"What could change is the language used in the statement. Core inflation is moving down towards the upper end of the Fed's perceived comfort range, though food and energy prices remain high. Resource utilization is basically unchanged from the last meeting. The adjustment in the housing sector is still ongoing. The economy appears to have picked up steam in the second quarter based on the ISM and Philadelphia Fed surveys. At the same time, a correction in the bond market has occurred, sending yields considerably higher. It seems likely that these two last factors will weigh on the committee's discussions and could cause a change in the statement's language. Obviously, any change in wording will be scrutinized by the financial markets.
"
3436,ORCL,"The Fed's June meeting is not the only event on the economic calendar. May home sales data kicks off this week with existing home numbers due out on Monday and new home numbers due out on Tuesday. The Conference Board will publish its June consumer confidence survey on Tuesday. Wednesday features May durable goods orders. The final revision to first-quarter GDP data will be published on Thursday. Friday is packed with May personal spending and income, May construction spending, June Chicago PMI and the final June University of Michigan consumer confidence survey.
"
3437,ORCL,"The emphasis on interest rate moves will remain amplified because of a relative lack of catalysts from the equity markets. The end of the fourth quarter could bring some window dressing from portfolio managers, but this should not have a significant impact on the overall weekly returns. The number of estimate revisions has been falling and while some companies could provide updated guidance, nothing more than a nominal increase in the overall number of estimate revisions is expected, at best.
"
3438,ORCL,"The earnings calendar won't help much either. Only 45 companies are scheduled to report quarterly results (16 are S&P 500 members). Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) could have some influence on tech stocks, though the current trend in estimate revisions does not suggest either company is going to revise guidance upwards. The housing sector will also get additional focus with KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reporting.
"
3439,ORCL,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 25 - June 29Monsanto (MON) recently raised its full-year earnings guidance to between $1.75 and $1.80 per share, an increase of 15 cents per share. As part of this new guidance, the company expects fiscal third-quarter profits to be about $1.00 per share. All of the covering brokerage analysts promptly adjusted their forecasts, resulting in full-year and third-quarter consensus estimates of $1.81 and $1.00 per share, respectively. So, where is the room for the upside? MON has topped expectations during the past two quarters by an average of five cents per share, leading to the possibility that the company was a bit conservative with its guidance. Monsanto is scheduled to report on Thursday, June 28, before the start of trading.
"
3440,ORCL,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of June 25 - June 29
"
3441,ORCL,"The fact that earnings estimates have been falling for Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) should not come as a surprise given the housing slump. Fiscal second-quarter profit forecasts are down two cents from a month ago to eight cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bearish at four cents per share. What is notable, however, is that the full-year consensus earnings estimates for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 are declining - a sign that brokerage analysts do not expect optimistic guidance either. LEN has topped expectations once and missed expectations once during the past two quarters. Lennar is scheduled to report on Tuesday, June 26, before the start of trading.
"
3442,ORCL,"Concerns about falling chip prices seem to be weighing on the quarterly forecasts for Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report). During the past 30 days, about one-third of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their projections by seven cents. The revisions have resulted in a new fiscal third-quarter consensus estimate of a loss for a loss of 20 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bearish and calls for a loss of 30 cents per share. The semiconductor company has missed twice over the past three quarters. Micron Technology is scheduled to report on Thursday, June 5.

3447,ORCL,"Oracle Corp (ORCL  -  Free Report) recently announced notable changes in its Internet of Things (IoT) Cloud offerings. The product portfolio now includes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning features that strengthen digital twinning i.e. simulation of physical devices and the interconnection between those virtual version of the devices that is termed as digital threading.Per the enhancements, users will now be able to access analytical insights from the connected devices. From an entrepreneurial perspective, these processed data will be valuable for increasing efficiency of the system and making new market opportunities accessible. This will in turn lead to higher and faster rate of return on investment (ROI) for consumers.We believe the company’s growing cloud market share, its dominant position in the enterprise software and database as a service market along with the gradually strengthening IoT market will be key growth drivers in the long run.Shares of Oracle have gained 33.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 26.4% rally.Oracle’s Presence in the IoT MarketThe company is slowly solidifying its foothold in IoT. Gemu, a world-wide manufacturer of valves is a major customer of the company’s IoT cloud service. Recently, Oracle announced collaboration with Mitsubishi Electric Corp. for the development of an IoT platform for advancement of automated manufacturing.In today’s connected world, organizations are engaged in optimization of their manufacturing processes. The new platform known as FA-IT Open Platform will be collecting, analyzing and utilizing data from all end points of the manufacturing units in real time, thereby increasing cost-effectiveness and efficiency. This is anticipated to be a significant step for Oracle as far as IoT is concerned.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Oracle Corporation QuoteGrowth Prospects and Key PlayersIn a recent report, Gartner mentioned that almost 8.4 billion connected “things will likely be used in 2017, reflecting a 31% increase from 2016.

Per MarketsandMarkets, the IoT market is anticipated to reach $561.04 billion by 2022 from $170.57 billion in 2017 at a CAGR of 26.9%.Oracle will face stiff competition from prominent names in the space including Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Cloud IoT and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS IoT. Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and IBM’s Watson Iot are also strong contenders in the field.

3448,ORCL,"Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) is taking another significant step to strengthen its position in the cloud services market. The company recently announced that it will hire more than 5K employees including engineers, consultants, sales and support people for expanding its cloud business.Cloud-based momentum has been a game changer for Oracle in recent times. We note that the company is a late entrant in the cloud computing market compared to its peers like IBM, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).However, the company’s rapidly expanding Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) portfolios have boosted the top line in the past few quarters. Notably, cloud revenues increased 64.1% year over year to $1.41 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. This led to a 3.3% increase in total revenue, which was also better than the guided range of (1%) to 2% for the fourth quarter.Shares of Oracle have gained 30.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 24.1% rally.Oracle Enhances Cloud OfferingsAccording to an IDC market report, SaaS will remain the dominant cloud computing service, with nearly two thirds of all public cloud spending in 2017 and roughly 60% in 2020. This presents significant growth opportunity for Oracle due to its dominant position in the Database as a Service market.Moreover, Oracle has introduced a number of cloud services like the retail merchandising solution, security solution over the last few quarters that have helped it to gain customers.However, with Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) still being one of the weaklings in the portfolio, the company is expected to spend more on it. This might affect gross margin in the near term. Nevertheless, the company anticipates SaaS gross margin to eventually rise to 80% in the long haul, thereby leading to an improvement in the bottom line.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Oracle Corporation QuoteCloud Takes Center StagePer a recent report by Gartner, the cloud shift will result in almost $1 trillion in information technology (IT) spending by 2020. Notably, all the big shot cloud service providers are gearing up to grab the opportunity.  Microsoft is reportedly planning a sales restructuring owing to its continuing shift to cloud. IBM recently announced the addition of four new data centers. It also unveiled cloud container service for Australian datacenters.Notably, cloud technology is increasingly being adopted at enterprises owing to its hyper-scalability and hyper-convergence. These enhance the flexibility of computing and enable flexible and cost effective storage and operations.We believe Oracle’s strategic initiatives to tap the accelerated growth of the cloud market are well paced. The new hirings will help the company aggressively market its products that will improve competitive position against the likes of salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday. Moreover, enhancement of its cloud offerings will boost its revenues and eventually markets share going forward.Zacks RankOracle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3449,ORCL,"The Dow has come a long way since Trump’s ascension to the post of the U.S. President. The blue-chip index was lingering at 18,000 at the time of Trump’s election on Nov 8, 2016. However, the index has surged 6,000 points and notched up about 80 record highs since then. This year, the benchmark has gained nearly 24.4%.The blue-chip index’s run has been powered by strong economic growth of more than 3% for two quarters in a row till the last reported one and stupendous corporate earnings. Moreover, optimism around Trump’s tax reform promises has acted as a necessary catalyst to overall gains so far this year. We suggest you place your bet on those stocks that have surpassed the Dow’s performance this year.U.S. Economy at Its Highest Rate of GrowthAccording to the latest report from the Commerce Department, the U.S. economy improved at an impressive annual rate of 3%. This came in above the consensus estimate of 2.6%, but below the second quarter figure of 3.1%. This also marked the first time since 2014 that the U.S. economy has expanded at a 3% annual pace for two consecutive quarters.The growth rate confirms the economy’s resilience toward devastating events like the recent hurricanes. The strength largely comes from vigorous business spending on equipment, a rebound in corporate profits and solid government spending.In October, consumer confidence increased from an upwardly revised level of 126.2 to 129.5, exceeding the estimated mark of 123.9. This is the highest level since the reading of 132.6 recorded in November 2000. Consumer confidence also improved on last month’s initial reading of 125.9, which was, at the time, the highest level in 17 years.During the fifth straight month of gains, the present situations index advanced from 152 to 153.9 while the expectations index increased from 109 to 113.3. A large part of this optimism can be attributed to consumer view on the job market. The section of consumers who expect job openings to increase over the next few months increased from 18.7% to 22.6% in November. (Read More)Phenomenal Corporate EarningsCorporate earnings have been outstanding throughout 2017. Much of it can be attributed to President Trump’s promise of introducing tax cuts. Such a claim can be supported by facts, particularly, when we find that there was an 8.8% year-over-year increase in business investment during the second quarter followed by 8.6% growth in the third.Companies have been optimistic about the likelihood of a slash in corporate taxes. This optimism comes from the fact that a tax holiday would allow large-cap corporations hoarding trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas to bring back profits for one-time tax.Prospects of a Tax Reform Fuel Market GainsThough the Senate passed the Republican Tax Bill by a narrow margin, this victory takes Trump closer than ever to delivering on the “promise” that was the cornerstone of his campaign — a new U.S. tax code.The Bill permanently slashes the corporate tax rate to 20%. Further, the tax repatriation provision allows big companies with global operations to bring back trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas. Finally, the Bill repeals the individual mandate of Obamacare in a bid to provide the citizens of the United States the freedom to choose from a variety of health plans and relieve them of the penalty for not having a health insurance.A cut in domestic tax rates would mean that banks and big financial institutions that are weighed down by a hefty tax load would benefit greatly. Moreover, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation policy is likely to improve the overall financial health of tech, drug and biotech companies.Tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. We expect the momentum to continue in Q4.Total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 8.8% from the same period last year on 6.8% higher revenues. This would follow 6.9% earnings growth on 6% higher revenues in Q3.Earnings growth is expected to be positive for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with earnings growth in double digits for six sectors — Energy (up 168.7%), Technology (13.1%), Construction (19.5%), Industrial Products (21.3%), Basic Materials (27.3%), and Autos (22.5%). (Read More)Buy These 5 Stocks that Outperformed the DowThe Dow has scaled to record highs this year, banking on steadily strengthening economy and upbeat corporate earnings. Trump’s business-friendly policies also gave a boost to the index. But we have selected such stocks that have even fared better than the blue-chip index.

3450,ORCL,"Symantec Corporation ((SYMC  -  Free Report) recently announced that the principal components of its Integrated Cyber Defense platform are now accessible through Oracle ((ORCL  -  Free Report) Cloud Marketplace. Symantec is already a Gold-level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN).Notably, in an era when organizations are rapidly shifting to cloud infrastructure, security breach related issues are turning out to be the primary concern. The recent cyber-attacks namely Wannacry and NotPetya have further boosted the need to secure sensitive data. This has paved the way for growth of companies like Symantec that deal with cloud security solutions.Moreover, the world is rapidly advancing toward the augmented version of private and public cloud, better known as hybrid cloud technology. This ensures cost effective storage and operations. The flexibility offered by the process can be scaled up per the client’s request, making it more lucrative.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform also offers similar services that combine the flexibility of public cloud with the detailed control and security of on-premises infrastructure. Symantec’s Cyber Defense platform addresses both on-premise and cloud security including the likes of Control Compliance Suite, Data Center Security, Data Loss Prevention, Endpoint Protection, Cloud Data Protection, and Protection Engine related solutions.We believe the combination of Oracle’s cloud infrastructure with Symantec’s cloud security based expertise will provide consumers with an enhanced experience. This will expand Symantec’s market presence, thereby boosting its top line going ahead.Symantec Corporation Revenue (TTM) Symantec Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Symantec Corporation QuoteSymantec in Cloud Security MarketIn a recent report, AB Newswire quoted WiseGuyReports.com that stated that the Cloud Security Market is expected to experience a 20.1% CAGR and reach $13.272 billion by 2022 from $5.314 billion in 2017.We believe the company’s techniques related to protection and management of confidential data, threat detection and end point protection along with its popular brands in security and utilities, including Norton Anti-Virus, Norton Internet Security and Norton System Works make it well equipped to grab the projected growth opportunity.Additionally, the company’s recent acquisitions of Fireglass and Skycure have also strengthened its Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, thereby solidifying its foothold in the industry.Furthermore, Microsoft’s ((MSFT  -  Free Report) recent announcement of its cloud platform Azure assisting Symantec in delivering Norton branded security software products to a customer base of over 50 million is another positive. We expect all these initiatives to be key catalysts for the company’s revenues, which increased 26.7% year over year in the last reported quarter.However, increasing competition in the cloud-based security industry from the likes of Check Point Software Technologies, Proofpoint and CyberArk Software remains a concern for the company.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSymantec has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A top-ranked stock in the sector is Intel Corporation ((INTC  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3451,ORCL,"Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) posted strong third-quarter fiscal 2018 results with the top and bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and management’s guided range. Quarterly revenues and earnings also improved year over year.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 39 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents and came ahead of its own guidance range of 31-32 cents as well. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 24 cents, mainly driven by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, partially offset by increased number of outstanding shares.So far this year, the stock has outperformed the industry. Salesforce has returned 58.9% compared with 35.7% growth of the industry it belongs to. Before discussing the fiscal third-quarter results in detail, here are some important business highlights of the quarter.Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthThe company still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, Salesforce noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS) last year have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers, which was curbing its growth potentials. However, the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business in the previous year. In addition, Salesforce has planned to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.Of late, Salesforce also entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian and Australian data centers. This, in turn, has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian and Asia-Pacific markets.During the fiscal third quarter, the company won several deals backed by its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Hilton, DuPont, National Australia Bank and Hitachi picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.Having discussed the third quarter business highlights, let’s now turn to the financial results.RevenuesSalesforce continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The company’s revenues of $2.68 billion jumped 24.9% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.648 billion. Furthermore, reported revenues came above the guided range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion).The improvement can be primarily attributable to rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, drove the year-over-year upside in revenues.Now, coming to its business segments, revenues at Subscription and Support climbed about 25.3% from the year-ago quarter to $2.486 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues surged almost 20.5% to $193.7 million.Geographically, the company witnessed constant currency revenue growth of 21%, 33% and 27% in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.MarginsSalesforce’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $2.038 billion, up 25.6%. Additionally, gross margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 76.1% primarily owing to solid revenue growth that was partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure development including the expansion of the international data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased up 18.6% from the prior-year quarter to $1.601 billion. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to 59.8% from 63% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily because of efficient cost management.Salesforce posted non-GAAP operating income of $436.9 million compared with the year-ago figure of $272.6 million while operating margin advanced 360 bps to 16.3%. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating margin was mainly driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income grew 66.4% year over year to $284.4 million while net income margin expanded 260 bps to 10.6%. The benefit from improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on net income margin was partially offset by elevated interest and other expenses.Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSalesforce exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.63 billion compared with $3.50 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $1.520 billion compared with $1.569 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter. As of Oct 31, 2017, total deferred revenues were $4.39 billion, up 26% on a year-over-year basis.During the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $1.687 billion. Also, it generated free cash flow of $1.290 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.GuidanceBuoyed by better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, the company provided an encouraging guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter and raised its outlook for the full year as well. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $2.801-$2.811 billion (mid-point: $2.806 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 22-23%. The guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79 billion.Further, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 32-33 cents. On a GAAP basis, the same is anticipated between 3 cents and 4 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 33 cents.Additionally, Salesforce raised its revenues and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues are now anticipated to come in the range of $10.43-$10.44 billion (mid-point $10.435 billion), up from the previous projection of $10.35-$10.40 billion (mid-point $10.375 billion), representing a 24% year-over-year increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $10.39 billion.By completing this target, the company is expected to achieve the $10 billion mark in revenues faster than any other enterprise software company.Similarly, Salesforce now projects non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.32 and $1.33 while GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 12-13 cents. This compares with the previous guidance range of $1.29-$1.31 on non-GAAP basis and 7-9 cents on GAAP basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.31.Our TakeSalesforce reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom lines fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as marked significant year-over-year improvement. Meanwhile, the company continues to witness solid growth in revenues. The robust revenues were primarily backed by growth across all its business segments and the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform.Going ahead, the company’s upbeat outlook signifies that it will continue to witness growth in near-term. Additionally, the fiscal fourth-quarter revenue outlook is impressive. We are also encouraged by the fact that the company will achieve $10 billion in sales in fiscal 2018.The higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions during the reported quarter are also positive. We consider the rapid adoption of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform will be a positive. Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts. Additionally, strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are anticipated to prove conducive to growth over the long run.In view of increasing customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm, Gartner, acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. Also, Forbes recently named Salesforce as the most innovative company in the world again. We believe that the rapid adoption of Salesforce’s platforms indicates solid growth opportunities in the ever-growing cloud computing segment.Salesforce currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3453,ORCL,"ServiceNow (NOW  -  Free Report) has been a favorite with investors, courtesy of its strong partnerships, global presence, rising share price and strong fundamentals. Shares of ServiceNow have gained 62.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 35.9% rally.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Key DriversThe share price momentum can primarily be attributed to growing adoption of the company’s platform and tools by 2000 (G2K) companies, as defined by Forbes. The company is also gaining from rapid penetration into the non-ITSM markets such as customer service, human resource and security.ServiceNow has been a dominant name in the IT service market (“ITSM”). The company is steadily winning market share amid the ongoing trend of replacing legacy on-premise systems with cloud-based processes, especially among G2K companies. The growing penetration at G2K customer base has been driving ServiceNow’s top-line, which has been exemplary, increasing at a CAGR of more than 70% over 2009-2016 time frame.Notably, with none of the customers exceeding 10% of revenues in the last couple of years, the customer base remains unaffected by the problem of customer concentration. Diversified clientele is another positive.Moreover, the company’s expanding product portfolio (including emerging products) and strong renewal rate (almost 98%), are the other key catalysts. Additionally, the popularity of its Customer Service Management product, launch of a new HR product and the availability of the Jakarta platform to all is anticipated to boost performance further.Acquisitions have also played an important part in ServiceNow’s growth trajectory over the years. The acquisitions of Neebula Systems (2014), BrightPoint Security and ITapp (both in 2016) has aided the company to expand product portfolio, particularly security and ITOM solutions. The recent buyout of DxContinuum will boost its predictive modelling capabilities, consequently expanding ServiceNow’s intelligent automation product portfolio going ahead. Also, the company's recently announced acquisition of Qlue, a developer of virtual messaging agents, is anticipated to enhance customer experience. Further, the announced acquisitions of Telepathy and SkyGiraffe are expected to enhance the company’s enterprise mobile experience.ServiceNow has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 18.6%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 39%.Risk RemainsHowever, in spite of an improving top-line, mounting losses and stiff competition in the non-ITSM markets from established players like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) remain concerns for the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksServiceNow currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3454,ORCL,"Next week will be one with very few market-impacting scheduled events. 
"
3455,ORCL,"The Federal Open Market Committee will hold a two day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. Rates are expected to remain unchanged, though the statement will be analyzed for any mention of the problems in the subprime market.
"
3456,ORCL,"Just slightly more than 70 companies are expected to report earnings next week, 11 which are members of the S&P 500. Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Fedex (FDX  -  Free Report) might have influence on market direction. The remainder, such as Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report), will grab some headline attention, but probably wont have much impact outside of their respective sectors.
"
3457,ORCL,"February housing starts will be released on Tuesday, the Conference Boards leading indicators index will be published on Thursday, and February existing home sales data will be issued on Friday. Winter weather in February may have impacted both starts and existing home sales. Outside of the weekly reports and, obviously, the Fed meeting, there is really not much else on the economic calendar.
"
3458,ORCL,"So what will move the markets next week? Sentiment. Daily fluctuations should continue, dependant on the news of the day and how the overseas markets fare. Traders still need to be willing to jump between going long and short. Investors will need to use prudence, but buying opportunities do exist.
"
3459,ORCL,"Its worth noting that despite Tuesdays drop, one-fourth of the companies within the S&P 500 index are trading within 5% of their 52-week highs. (14 closed Thursday at 52-week highs.) In other words, underlying bullish sentiment still remains. Part of the reason is that analysts continue to forecast the average company to grow earnings at a double-digit pace this year. M&A activity and stock buyback programs are also playing a role. Finally, the economy is still expected to grow. Yes, the problems in the subprime market are a concern, but so far, risk-aversion has yet to become the norm.

3469,ORCL,"Enterprise application software, SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) and technology giant International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) launched a jointly developed solution for the retail and consumer packaged goods industries. The solution will help to boost profitability as well as improve consumer experience.This is the first industry-focused solution that the two companies have launched since they formed a digital transformation partnership last year. Going forward, the companies also have plans to collaborate on SAP Model Company services – an end-to-end reference solution that accelerates the time to value and can be modified to cater to a specific line-of-business and industry.The co-developed solution will be able to radically improve planning and execution in a physical store by leveraging near real-time data.The collaboration between these two technology behemoths will bring together unique data sources, including IBM's cognitive capabilities on SAP Cloud Platform. Using IBM's cognitive services, IBM Metro Pulse offers details about weather, traffic, events and demographics and helps in addressing major industry challenges like on-shelf availability and demand-forecasting accuracy. This data will then flow through SAP Cloud Platform to unlock insights that can be executed upon in the right away. Thus, the solution will aid in decision making, using unique, near real-time market-demand signals, live business and a digital core to facilitate execution.However, it seems that in recent quarters, dull prospects of the global IT industry, as well as flat customer spending projections are affecting SAP’s performance. SAP’s business, being spread across the globe, is also vulnerable to the political, economical and regulatory risks. Over the past few quarters, many of the company’s emerging markets have faced general economic slowdowns, which adversely impacted their purchasing power. Also, currency fluctuations in many of its key markets are also adding to this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s woes.Over a month, the company’s stock has yielded a negative return of 0.6%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.7%. We believe that resiliency of its Cloud and Software business, presence of a large business network and strategic partnerships would help the company lure more clients, thus boosting its top line.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Xplore Technologies Corp (XPLR  -  Free Report). While Xplore Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Oracle came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.1% for the last four quarters, having beaten estimates twice over the last four quarters.Xplore Technologies has an excellent earnings beat history, having surpassed estimates each time over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 102.5%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

3470,ORCL,"Congress’s nonpartisan scorekeeper in tax matters, the Joint Committee on Taxation, declared that the House Republicans passed an overhaul of the U.S. tax code that slashes corporate tax rates on Thursday.Big banks will benefit immensely from the tax cut as this will likely bolster investments. Lower tax rates also drive after-tax earnings for tech behemoths as it leads to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and development, as well as mergers and acquisitions.Small-cap companies are poised to gain enormously as well, mostly because they have been paying more taxes than their counterparts. Thus, investors should focus on multinational financial and technology service providers, as well as small-cap players, that can make the most of the slashed corporate tax rate.Senate Passes Tax Bill House Republicans approved a monumental bill to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals. The bill cleared the House 227-205, without Democratic support. The Democrats believed that it is a give-away to the wealthiest Americans. 13 Republicans representing districts with an already high average state and local tax deduction also voted against the bill.Such a high tax deduction will be scaled back significantly under the House plan. Nevertheless, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that around 92% of Americans will pay less or the same taxes until 2023 under the new plan.Republicans, in the meantime, have been rooting for a change in tax codes for several years but have repeatedly failed to garner support in the House until Trump’s election. Trump said that such a bill is a “big, beautiful Christmas present” for families, while the White House press secretary said that “a simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach.”This has set the stage for Republicans to execute their ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to overhaul an outdated U.S. tax code, providing financial relief to families and making American businesses more competitive globally.Great for Banks & Tech CompaniesThe bill trims the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, making it the biggest one-time drop in big business tax rates ever.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut  to 20%.Lower domestic tax rates will also result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This could help boost the economy and may cause interest rates to rise. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Let us also not forget that tech behemoths Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Small Caps Rally on House VoteAfter the House passed the tax bill, small-cap stocks surged. After all, such companies have been paying taxes of more than 30% for quite some time, while their large-cap counterparts are paying close to 25%.Moreover, Trump’s call for more protectionism and less global trade boosted small caps that mostly generate less than 20% of its revenues from overseas. In contrast, large-cap companies typically generate more than 30% of their sales from abroad.The Russell 2000 Index, which comprises the smallest companies in terms of market capitalization, is up more than 27% since Trump was elected, while the S&P Small Cap 600 Index climbed more than 25% since the close of trading on Nov 8.Top 5 WinnersInvestors should double down on the hottest banking and tech bigwigs, as well as solid companies with smaller market capitalizations. We have, therefore, selected five relevant companies that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Eagle Bancorp, Inc.

3471,ORCL,"With a better than expected +8.2% GDP growth in the third quarter, and a market that appears to be recovering after a long hibernation, many analysts and investors are expected a nice pick-up for technology in 2004.  One of the spaces hoping to benefit the most is the immense computer software industry.  According to Nick Raich's  ""Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,""  the space enjoys a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.88, placing it 70th out of more than 200 countries.  While the level of improvement in IT spending varies from person to person, most agree that the future will be brighter than the dreary past and that investors stand to benefit. 
"
3472,ORCL,"According to a recent survey conducted by Gartner, Inc. and SoundView Technology Group, Inc., technology executives are becoming more confident of an uptick in their capital spending activities in 2004.  According to the report, small and mid-size businesses will lead the recovery.  Such a development would surely filter positively into the computer software industry.  
"
3473,ORCL,"However, many companies still seem unwilling to stick their necks out too far.  ""Spending should grow and look better in 2004,"" said Damien Rinaldi, analyst at First Albany Capital, ""but the provisional characteristics will not go away.""  By 'provisional characteristics,' Rinaldi means the more malleable state of budgets right now, as companies are still very interested in factors such as cutting costs.  Such a condition promises to keep uncertainty around as a companion of investors for a while longer.     
"
3474,ORCL,"Rinaldi's focus is on system management software, along with application development and deployment.  As far as system management software is concerned, the analyst says that this segment is not near the top of the priority list in the space.  Meanwhile, the latter group has experienced only a limited number of new product initiatives.  Rinaldi also stated that his space has seen a good deal of consolidation of late, and he expects that trend to continue and possibly accelerate in 2004.   
"
3475,ORCL,"""It's been middle-of-the-road through the year (2003),"" said Rinaldi.  ""Performance has been better than last year, but not without a few hiccups.""   
"
3476,ORCL,"It's because of those 'hiccups' in the space that investors need to be cautious before getting involved.  There will be chances to profit in the vast computer software industry, but only if you can find a good position in a strong company.  The rise in IT spending may not be as sharp or carry the breadth that many hope, but it looks to at least mark an improvement over 2003 that knowledgeable investors can use.  That's where the insight of analysts becomes crucial.  Regardless of the type of computer software company in which you are interested, analysts can steer you in the right direction and, more importantly, tell you why a certain company will rise above the rest.

Veritas achieved earnings of 21 cents per share, excluding items, for its quarter ended September 30, 2003 in late October.  The result beat the consensus by more than 23%.  However, Veritas was most proud of its revenue in the quarter, which reached a record $451 million, marking a +23% improvement over the year-ago result of $366 million.  Gary Bloom, Chairman, President and CEO of Veritas Software, stated, ""Our results further validate the strength of Veritas' business model, the increasing recognition of the value of the Veritas brand, and continuing signs of improvement in the buying climate for our products.""   
"
3482,ORCL,"Earlier this month, Veritas continued its relationship with Microsoft and announced the availability of Veritas Storage Foundation 4.0 for Windows, which integrates with Microsoft platforms to flexibly manage storage in Windows environments.  The company said its volume management and virtualization technology enables users to pool heterogeneous storage resources to increase availability.

3483,ORCL,"Only a few months ago, video game manufacturers enjoyed a lion's share of the All Stars' attention in the computer software industry.  While the growth for interactive publishers has been robust over the past decade, it is only a fraction of the expansive software arena, which generates more than $150 billion each year.  Now, with business conditions inching their way in the right direction, more and more analysts are feeling better about some of the bigger names in the field, such as  Microsoft  (NASDAQ:  MSFT ) and  Oracle  (NASDAQ:  ORCL ).  Currently, the computer software industry enjoys a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.98, which puts it 85th out of more than 200 industries, according to Nick Raich's  ""Weekly Earnings & Sector Update.""   Many analysts believe that computer software has passed the darkest days of this economic malaise, which leaves plenty of wiggle room for investors to make up some lost ground. 
"
3484,ORCL,"""Conditions have probably bottomed out, but we're not off to the races yet,"" said Dennis Wassung, research analyst at Adams, Harkness, & Hill, Inc.  According to the 5-Star analyst, the gradual improvement can be mainly attributed to the industry's customers feeling more comfortable with business.  At the height of the recession and economic downturn, customers would significantly curtail extracurricular spending in an attempt to cut costs in an environment that had become languid.  But these customers are now seeing signs of a more prosperous future that isn't quite here yet. This interim mode, however, can hold ample opportunities for investors.   
"
3485,ORCL,"Many indicators, including surveys from the Institute of Supply Management, back up the idea of an advancing space.  One of the best ways to study the progress of the industry is through the Dow Jones U.S. Software Index.  At the close on August 20, 2003, the index was at 457.51.  That puts the space only 15.20 points off of its 52-week high, and as much as 131 points off of the low.  That's pretty impressive growth for any industry that was seemingly caught in quicksand, and there's a great deal of expectations that this improvement will gingerly improve for the remainder of this year before hitting full stride next year.  Revenues for the software industry dropped -2% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2003.  While that many seem to be disappointing, it marks a substantial improvement upon the -8% decline experienced in the first quarter of 2003.    
"
3486,ORCL,"""I expect more of the same in the second half with slow but improving conditions,"" said Wassung.  The analyst expects a better time for the industry in 2004, as business conditions normalize and the industry's customers prepare to make new investments in a more complimentary environment.   
"
3487,ORCL,"There have already been some encouraging signs, spearheaded by Microsoft's fourth quarter report.  The industry bellwether posted better than expected revenue while raising its earnings expectation for the full year.  Microsoft certainly doesn't encompass every aspect of the software space, but it comes closer than any other company.  So analysts are always keeping a watchful eye on its progress.  Progress is also what investors are looking for after several years of lackluster performances from the industry.  While the tide hasn't turned completely yet, it certainly seems primed for an encouraging second quarter and, perhaps, a vibrant 2004.  What Do the All Stars Recommend? 
"
3488,ORCL,"The computer software industry may not yet be ""off to the races,"" but that only leaves time for investors to get on board.  However, it can be difficult to make intelligent moves in a space as large as this one, especially since many companies have yet to see any meaningful improvement.  The best consultants for this daunting task are the Wall Street analysts, who continually study the space and the possibility for investors.  Zacks tracks the analysts who cover the computer software industry and ranks them based on the performance of stocks recommended. Analysts with the best track record of success include:  Robert Breza  of A.G. Edwards;  K. Buttigieg  of Kaufman Brothers;  T.

"
3489,ORCL,"Below are the top-ranked stocks recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts.  Among them are two stalwarts of the industry, and three other companies that are using their innovation to carve a more prosperous future.  Use the following profiles as a first step in your venture into the space.  TradeStation Group, Inc.  (NASDAQ:  TRAD ) successfully combines software with investing.  The company believes that it has a significant advantage in the institutional, professional and serious, active trader markets.  Unlike conventional trading platforms, TradeStation is designed to transform the user's PC from a canned information tool to an interactive trading assistant - one that enables the trader to design, historically test and automate his or her own trading strategies.  The second quarter 2003 turned out to be very robust for the company, as TradeStation posted its third straight quarter of record net income by reporting 7 cents per share.  That result matched the consensus and was +600% better than the year-ago result of 1-cent.  Furthermore, total revenues improved by +22% to $15 million while brokerage revenues advanced by +30% to $12.7 million.  The company stated that record net income demonstrates that its active and institutional trader business model produces attractive profit margins as new accounts are added to a fixed infrastructure that requires minimal expansion as its business grows.  The second quarter's performance was so encouraging that TradeStation again boosted its annual net income estimate for 2003, by an additional +24% this time.   
"
3490,ORCL,"However, as with any software company, TradeStation's future lies in its ability to continually release new or updated products.  The company is now preparing for the release of TradeStation 7.2, which is the second quarterly update to the company's TradeStation 7.  In late July, the product received strong reviews when it was previewed at the International TradersEXPO in Chicago.  The update provides several new features and enhancements, such as full market depth quotes for the CME and CBOT electronic markets, new and enhanced drawing tools, and enhanced OptionStation capabilities, just to name a few.  TradeStation seems to have its hand on the pulse of the growing segment of online traders.  As the market continues to improve, this company could see even better interest in their services as more and more traders come back into the fold.  It's easy to see why four All-Star analysts recommend this company, which is the highest number of recommendations in the industry.  To further research TradeStation, click  TRAD .  Adobe Systems Incorporated  (NASDAQ:  ADBE ) is a provider of graphic design, publishing, and imaging software for Web and print production. It offers a market-leading line of application software products for creating, distributing, and managing information of all types. The company licenses its industry-standard technologies to major hardware manufacturers, software developers, and service providers, and offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes.  Adobe Systems reassured the market in late July by providing a promising third quarter of fiscal year 2003 intra-quarter update.  The company stated that all of its major geographic markets and its global Acrobat launch are on track.  The company believes it will achieve revenue and earnings per share within the target range of $300 million to $315 million and 22 cents to 25 cents (GAAP) respectively.  In its second quarter, reported in early June, Adobe Systems surpassed the consensus by two cents with pro forma diluted earnings of 28 cents per share on revenue of $320.1 million.  Both of those results came in at the higher end of raised target ranges.   
"
3491,ORCL,"The company is the leader in bringing sight and sound to computer users, and continues to fine-tune its market presence.  Most recently, Adobe Systems announced that Adobe® PostScript® 3 version 3016 software is now available to original equipment manufacturers for building high performance printing systems and print workflow solutions.  Furthermore, the company also recently introduced a new version of Adobe® Font Folio featured the Adobe Type Library in OpenType® format on one CD-ROM.  The product contains more than 2,000 fonts in OpenType format.  Such products and innovations keep this company on the forefront of not only its industry, by also many All Star lists.  To further research Adobe Systems, Inc., click  ADBE .  Microsoft Corporation  (NASDAQ:  MSFT ) develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of software products for a multitude of computing devices. Microsoft software includes scalable operating systems for servers, personal computers, and intelligent devices; server applications for client/server environments; knowledge worker productivity applications; and software development tools. The company's online efforts include the MSN network of Internet products and services and alliances with companies involved with broadband access and various forms of digital interactivity.  Microsoft is the undisputed leader of the computer software industry, and in its fourth quarter report from mid-July, the company reported better than expected revenue of $8.07 billion.  That result marked an +11% advance over the year-ago total of $7.25 billion.  Excluding charges, the company missed the consensus by a penny with diluted earnings of 23 cents per share, but that still marked an improvement over last year.  John Connors, Chief Financial Officer at Microsoft, stated, ""In fiscal year 2003, we reported double digit revenue growth in each of our businesses.  In the fourth quarter, sales came in better than expected, reflecting solid corporate and consumer demand for our products.""   
"
3492,ORCL,"Although the company still faces its fair share of challenges, the company expects diluted earnings of between $1.09 and $1.11 per share, excluding after-tax equity compensation expense of approximately 24 cents.  That result was above the company's previous expectation.  The company stated that it will focus on providing better customer value, growing opportunities, increasing its enterprise penetration and bettering its performance in emerging business.  To further research Microsoft Corporation, click  MSFT .  Symantec Corporation  (NASDAQ:  SYMC ) a world leader in Internet security technology, provides a broad range of content security solutions to individuals and companies. The company is a leading provider of anti-virus protection, Internet content and e-mail filtering, and mobile code detection technologies to enterprise customers.  There has never been a time when security was more paramount than today, which leaves Symantec in a good position for the future.  For its fiscal first quarter 2004, the company reported earnings of 41 cents per share on revenue of $391 million.  The earnings result beat the year ago total and surpassed expectations by 2 cents, while revenue advanced by +24%.  During the quarter, Symantec signed 152 contracts worldwide and its quarterly performance convinced the company to raise its earnings expectations for fiscal year 2004.  On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share were boosted by 8 cents to $1.96.   
"
3493,ORCL,"Symantec further stretched out its arms in its industry by purchasing a key security technology patent asset from Hilgraeve, Inc.  The patent covers in-transit scanning for malicious code, and the company said that it is fundamental to several security technology defenses, including antivirus technologies.  It is also an essential part of providing comprehensive protection against the growing the number of threats, according to the company.  John W. Thompson, Symantec's chairman and CEO, stated, ""In-transit scanning of multiple security signatures is a must-have component of an effective security solution and by purchasing this patent we are making sure that Symantec's products, technologies and customers are protected today and in the future.""  To further research Symantec Corporation, click  SYMC .  VERITAS Software Corporation  (NASDAQ:  VRTS ) is one of the leading independent suppliers of storage management software. The company's products assist businesses by making sure that their data is protected, can be accessed at all times, and can be managed and used in compliance with business policies. Since its products help to improve the levels of centralization, control, automation and manageability in computing environments, they allow information technology managers to be significantly more effective with constrained resources and limited budgets.  For the company's third quarter, VERITAS put together the best performance in its history.  Revenue in the quarter came in at a record $413 million, which represented a +13% growth over the year-ago result of $365 million.  Furthermore, non-GAAP diluted earnings were 19 cents per share, which was more than +26% better than the consensus.  The company finished the quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, while also authorizing the use of up to $300 million in a stock repurchase program.  ""We attributed our success to our market leadership, solid execution of our growth strategy, and diligent management of our business,"" said Gary Bloom, chairman and president of VERITAS. 
"
3494,ORCL,"Much like Symantec, VERITAS is benefiting from the surrounding environment.  One of the company's wedges include disaster recovery, which become very apparent last week with the blackout in the east coast.  Businesses that prepare for such events are better able to recover quickly and eliminate longer-term damage.  Furthermore, many analysts believe that VERITAS is well-positions in its markets.

3495,ORCL,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased from the year-ago quarter.The company’s adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) increased from $3.95 per share reported in the year-ago quarter to $4.97 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.69. The increase can primarily be attributable to robust top-line growth, strong operating performance and lower tax rate, partially offset by higher cost of revenues and share count.AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure generally used in the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) industry.Quarter in DetailTotal revenues were $1.152 million, up 24.6% from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.138 billion. This marked the 59th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong booking activity, Equinix's global platform, continued enterprise momentum and synergies from acquisition.Equinix continues to witness strong demand for cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing their networks. The company observed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Robust growth in the global Colocation and Interconnection platforms provided a boost to the top line.Moreover, solid performance in MRR (monthly recurring revenues) per cabinet, MRR churn rate (2.3%) and cross connect additions drove the top line. Recurring revenues came in at $1.089 billion (95% of total revenues), up approximately 24.2% from the year-ago quarter. Non-recurring revenues climbed 32.6% to $63.2 million (5% of total revenues).Revenues from the three geographic regions increased on a year-over-year basis as well. Revenues from the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 40.3%, 12.5% and 9.4% to $596.5 million, $338.8 million and $216.9 million, respectively.Gross margin was 67% flat on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to increased cost of revenues as a percentage of sales. Total operating expenses increased 12.2% to $224.2 million. Further, operating expenses decreased 210 basis points (bps) as a percentage of revenues to 19.5%.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $550.3 million, up 31%. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 47.7% as compared with 45.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. AFFO increased 37.7% to $391.3 million, during the quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquinix exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.629 billion. The company’s total debt principal outstanding was $10.12 billion as on Sep 30, 2017. It generated cash of $390.5 million from operating activities in the third quarter.GuidanceEquinix provided fourth-quarter guidance and raised full-year 2017 projections. For 2017, the company now anticipates revenues to be in the range of $4.355-$4.363 billion, reflecting an increase of 21% year over year (previous guidance was more than $4.317-$4.327 billion, pointing at an increase of 20% year over year). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.33 billion. The company now predicts adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.049-$2.057 billion (prior guidance was in the range of $2.038-$2.048 billion).The company now anticipates full-year 2017 AFFO to be in the range of $1.411-$1.419 billion, reflecting an increase of 31% year over year (previous guidance was in the range of $1.382-$1.392 billion, indicating an increase of 29% year over year).The company continues to expect cash gross margin for full-year 2017 to be approximately between 67% and 68%. Cash selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are now projected in the range of $883-$891 million (previous guidance was $868-$878 million).For the fourth quarter, Equinix expects revenues in the range of $1.187-$1.195 billion (mid-point $1.191 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be between $562 million and $570 million.Cash gross margin for second quarter is anticipated to be approximately 67%. Cash selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are projected in the range of $228-$236 million.Share PriceEquinix’s share price movement has been quite favorable. In the last one year, its shares gained 40.6% against a loss of 2.5% recorded by the industry.Recent ActivitiesThe company has made 13 new expansion facilities across all three regions amounting to $615 million. Acquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix. Worldwide, the company owns 190 IBX data centers across 48 markets and 24 countries.The company recently completed the buyout of an Istanbul-based data center from Zenium. The deal will help the company expand its data center business in Turkey. Per International Monetary Fund, Turkey has the world's 17th largest nominal GDP and a population of around 80 million. Consequently, expanding its facility in the city will attract more enterprises to opt for Equinix’s data center services, leading to revenue boost.Notably, Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Charter Communications, Alibaba, Baiduand Salesforce are major clients of Equinix.Our TakeEquinix reported stellar third-quarter results and issued an upbeat guidance. Further, the company provided strong revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and raised full-year 2017 projection. The company’s top and bottom-line results also improved on a year-over-year basis. Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services from corporations and benefits of Equinix's global platform. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals.The company is presently focusing on improving customer experience through the Equinix Customer One program. We are also optimistic on its recurring revenue model and expansion plans announced in March this year.Further, it operates across various geographical regions and is becoming increasingly popular among major players in the tech industry for data management, which should drive revenues going ahead.Notably, acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix. We expect the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo, to remain catalysts.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important components of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster revenues and profitability, going forward.However, intensifying competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT&T and CenturyLink Inc. may affect product pricing, consequently denting the margins.A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

3496,ORCL,"(0:45) - Cash Cow Investing Strategy(2:45) - How To Find Companies With Good Cash Flow Yields(5:00) - Is This Strategy A Replacement For Income Investing?(6:30) - Examples of Classic Cash Cows: Boeing and Oracle(8:40) - Pacer ETFs: COWZ Overview(10:50) - CALF ETF: Small Cap Approach(12:30) - Sector Breakdown for CALF and COWZ(14:00) - International Exposure With Cash Cow ETFs: GCOW and ICOW(18:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWhen analyzing a business, it is often said that ‘cash is king’, as it is hard to overstate the importance of cash flow to a healthy business operation.Due to this, some investors like to focus on companies that are doing a great job of generating excess cash flows. These kinds of companies have plenty of leeway to do all sorts of key business activities, including stock buybacks, dividend payments, or mergers and acquisitions. Having this level of freedom is a very valuable thing for a business, and you can see why these types of companies might make for intriguing stocks as well.For more insights on this topic, I recently spoke with Sean O’Hara, the President of Pacer ETF Distributors for this week’s edition of the Dutram Report. Pacer has a lineup of cash cow-focused ETFs, so he definitely recognizes the importance of watching this metric when it comes to investing.Way to Look at Free Cash Flow & Cash Cow CompaniesPacer doesn’t just focus on free cash flow though, as the company looks at free cash flow yield as one of the most important metrics. This ensures that you aren’t just getting the largest companies which are producing the most free cash flow, but those that are generating cash in a robust way when compared to their enterprise values.While this might sound a little intimidating, remember that the idea is to find companies that are producing robust cash levels and have plenty of options for their business at their disposal. Sean and I also discuss some ‘classic’ cash cow companies, and they are some big names that you have definitely heard of, including Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) to name a few. We discuss how these two have become such great examples of cash cows, and why companies like these end up being such solid investments.ETF ApproachPacer’s focus goes beyond a company or two in this market, as they have four cash cow ETFs that have market-crushing free cash flow levels. For their flagship product, the Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ  -  Free Report), this results in a free cash flow yield for the index of close to 8.5%. This compares very favorably to what we see for something that tracks the Russell 1000, such as IWB, as the free cash flow yield there is just 3.6%.This tilt towards free cash flow also helps with a few other key value metrics, namely PE and dividend growth. COWZ ends up having a higher three-year dividend growth when compared to the Russell 1000 index, while the PE is just 13.4, a huge discount from the 22.7 we see for the benchmark, so value investors might find something to like in this approach as well.Sean also walks us through why this strategy results in more of a value-focus, and how the approach plays out for the small cap world with their US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 ETF (CALF  -  Free Report). In the small cap market, this has an even more dramatic impact on some value metrics, though we also talk about the sector concentration that results from this technique too.Finally, we also discuss how this strategy works in the international market, specifically with the company’s Developed Markets International Cash Cows 100 ETF (ICOW  -  Free Report) and its Global Cash Cows Dividend ETF (GCOW  -  Free Report). Sean talks about the key differences between these two, as well as how a cash cow-focused approach holds up across the globe.

3497,ORCL,"Tableau Software, Inc. (DATA  -  Free Report) has acquired ClearGraph, a three-year-old Palo Alto startup that helps in discovering and analyzing enterprise data through processing natural language queries.Tableau's technology allows users to easily see trends in database information using interactive visualizations. Meanwhile, ClearGraph’s technology allows users to find out data with using simple voice search and commands. Consequently, the acquisition will enhance Tableau’s capabilities will enable people to discover data through voice command also on its platform, attracting a wider range of new users.In future, Tableau intends to integrate this technology with its own products. ClearGraph team will join Tableau’s Palo Alto office and focus on integrating its technology with Tableau’s software.Per the company, “ClearGraph's unique natural language query technology stores semantic data in knowledge graphs that can expand and learn over time.” So, it does not require technical training, as the system can infer users’ intent.We believe that the recent acquisition of ClearGraph will aid Tableau in better competing with other players such as Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Power BI which already have this capability.It is worth mentioning that over the years, Tableau has been making efforts in order to enhance the machine learning abilities of its data visualization tools. Notably, Tableau introduced its first “smart” features in the 10.3 version of its software in May, with appurtenance learning-driven features.Apart from this, Tableau Software has undertaken a number of initiatives to boost sales productivity and align marketing efforts to drive growth. During first-quarter 2017, the company introduced new subscription pricing for all of its products, including Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server and Tableau Online. It claims that this new pricing model reduces initial investment costs, allowing customers to more easily deploy its software at scale.Going ahead, we believe that rising demand for business analytics tools is anticipated to benefit Tableau Software. Further, the company has been seeing strength in its offerings like the hybrid data architecture platform.However, competition from giants such as IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) poses a significant threat.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3498,ORCL,"Joining the fast-growing blockchain technology league, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), last week introduced its product under its HPE Mission Critical Blockchain group. The product, which is anticipated to be commercially available by early 2018, has been named as Mission Critical Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).Built-in partnership with enterprise software firm R3 and based on as-a-service concept, the latest offering will provide enterprise customers necessary hardware to run their own blockchain operations or in partnerships with clients. Per media sources, the company’s DLT is faster, reliable, secure, and can be used on a larger scale than other available blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.With the recent product launch, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has joined the race with competitors like IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) in the blockchain technology space. Launching its service nearly a year and a half ago, IBM leads the space. On the other hand, Microsoft provides blockchain tools through its Azure cloud, while Oracle rolled out its service this October.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteBlockchain is believed to be the next game changer in the tech sector. The technology is primarily used for tracking transactions related to digital assets or documents, particularly in industries like banking, financial services and insurance.In the last few years, adoption of the technology has increased due to the fact that DLT, on which blockchain is based, ensures secured data storage and transmission. As every member involved in the consortium using the data can see the changes made, a breach is unlikely. This makes the process even more trustworthy.Moreover, the decentralized database puts a check on hacking and double counting, thereby bringing down the possibilities of monetary losses via cyber crime.Citing Gartner’s forecasts, Hewlett Packard Enterprise revealed that blockchain technology will generate $176 billion in business value by 2025.Given the huge prospect in blockchain technology space, we appreciate Hewlett Packard Company’s move, which, we believe, will provide a new area of growth.Hewlett Packard Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3499,ORCL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Oracle Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.7. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Oracle Corporation’s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint (which is 15.3) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 29.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Oracle Corporation’s P/CF ratio of 17.1 is slightly lower than the industry average of 20.5, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Oracle Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ORCL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 15.7, which is considerably better than the industry average of 24.2. Clearly, ORCL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Oracle Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D. This gives ORCL a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter consensus estimate has not seen any earnings momentum in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dipped 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Oracle Corporation Price and Consensus  Oracle Corporation Price and Consensus | Oracle Corporation QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineOracle Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 41% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3500,ORCL,"Tableau Software Inc. (DATA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2. The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 146.07%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 300%. Revenues increased 7% year over year to $212.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $211 million.For third-quarter 2017, the company expects revenues to be in the range of $213–$223 million, representing 6% year-over-year growth (at the midpoint of this range). Non-GAAP operating income is projected to be in the $5-$13 million range and non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of 4-11 cents per share.We note that the company’s shares have increased 88.7% on a year-to-date basis, substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 29.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Factors to ConsiderWe believe that rising demand for business analytics tools is expected to benefit Tableau Software. Further, the company has been seeing strength in its offerings like the hybrid data architecture platform.Notably, the company has undertaken a number of initiatives to boost sales productivity and align marketing efforts to drive growth.Tableau completed the acquisition of ClearGraph in the September quarter. The buyout will aid the company in better competing with other players such as Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Power BI, which already has this capability.The introduction of new subscription pricing in April for all its products, including Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server and Tableau Online is expected to fuel subscriptions. The company claims that this new pricing model reduces initial investment costs, allowing customers to easily deploy its software at scale.However, competition from giants such as IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) poses a concern.Tableau Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tableau Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Tableau Software, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

3501,ORCL,"The Senate has finally passed the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018, ironing out difficulties in the path of President Trump’s historic tax reform plan. Trump believes that such an opportunity to benefit the middle class by slashing corporate tax rates comes once in a lifetime. Markets rallied after this development as investors believe that a tax cut will boost the U.S. economy over the long term.Tax Reforms to Boost GDPThe latest report from Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) reveals that the new tax plan will drive the economy to new heights. According to the report, a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% will lift the annual GDP growth rate to as high as 5%; the projected range lies between 3% and 5%.As per Business Insider, the U.S. GDP growth rate was 7.4% in 1984, after which it never touched 5%. In fact, since 1980, the rate crossed the 4.5% mark only thrice. It should be noted that with a lower corporate tax rate, companies will accumulate more disposable income to invest in the domestic market and thereby create more jobs. This will pave the way for further economic growth.Tech & Bank Bigwigs Set to GainAccording to Moody's, as much as $1.3 trillion in cash has been stored by U.S. firms overseas in order to avoid paying the stiff corporate tax rate. The five top cash hoarders in the country — Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. , Cisco Systems, Inc  and Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report)  — have stockpiled 88% of their cash outside the country, notes CNNMoney. A cut in rates will encourage these companies to repatriate cash, boosting the U.S. economy substantially.Banks also bear a huge tax burden. Among all the sectors representing the S&P 1500 index, financials contribute 25% of tax liabilities, per KBW Research. The investment banking firm believes that the tax rate cut will help Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) boost their earnings by 20%.Per Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the consumer staples sector paid the second highest taxes in the S&P 500 index last year — at a rate of 29.1%. Thus, lower taxes will massively benefit consumer staples companies like Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Unilever PLC (UN  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp.  (SYY  -  Free Report). Tyson Foods sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tax Plan Might Increase Debt BurdenThere has been a prolonged debate on whether the baby boomers generation will become a major burden for the Social Security system. Baby boomers are all those who were born between 1946 and 1964, accumulating almost 76 million people at present, according to media resources. Media reports also claim that this generation will make it to the list of full retirement benefits by 2031.Meanwhile, CNBC claims that Trump’s tax reform will lower revenues by $1.5 trillion in the next 10 years for the U.S. government. Investors should know that, according to The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, out of $3.9 trillion spent in fiscal 2016, more than $3.3 trillion was funded by the government. Hence, only a nominal amount was borrowed.However, in the coming years, the government will need to borrow more to support Social Security. In other words, Trump’s tax plan to stimulate the domestic economy will increase the debt burden considerably, raising questions about its sustainability.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

3502,ORCL,"Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Aug 1. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with a positive earnings surprise of 9.22%. However, it remains to be seen if Thomson Reuters will be able to keep its earnings surprise streak alive this time.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Thomson Reuters is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate for the company and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 51 cents. So, the difference – the Earnings ESP – is 0.00%.Thomson Reuters Corp Price and EPS Surprise  Thomson Reuters Corp Price and EPS Surprise | Thomson Reuters Corp QuoteZacks Rank: Thomson Reuters carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors this QuarterDuring the quarter, Thomson Reuters collaborated with Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) to launch ONESOURCE. This is a global tax technology solution, which is incorporated with Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Cloud.  It will enable companies to comply with all their real-time tax calculations needs. This solution will help Thomson Reuters boost its sales.In the previous quarter, Thomson Reuters completed its acquisitions of Clarient Global LLC and Avox Limited. This deal expands its risk-management footprint and its ability to provide a best-in-class standard of customer solutions by integrating both businesses into its portfolio of risk management, compliance and data offerings. The impact of the deal is likely to be seen in the to-be-reported quarter.Management remains optimistic about the company’s future performance, given its constant endeavors to implement core strategies and progress toward achieving its financial goals. We believe that its cost-containment efforts, share buyback plan and impressive performance of the underlying subscription revenues (which account for most of the total revenue) bode well. However, adverse currency fluctuations may play a spoilsport in the quarter to be reported.The company’s core subscription businesses continued to perform well and it is encouraging to see its Financial business reporting positive organic revenue growth. The company has been working to achieve its earnings target for 2017. It also intends to keep improving its free cash flow per share. Further, the company aims to boost its organic growth via strategic investments in its highest growth market.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Crestwood Equity Partners LP (CEQP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +160.00%, and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.American Railcar Industries, Inc. (ARII  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +8.07%, and a Zacks Rank #2.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

3503,ORCL,"Teradata Corporation (TDC  -  Free Report) reported dismal results for the second quarter of 2017, wherein its top and bottom lines not only fell short of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate but also marked significant year over year decline.The company reported adjusted earnings (excluding all one-time items but including stock-based compensation expenses) of 13 cents, plunging 80% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 65 cents. Adjusted earnings also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents.On non-GAAP basis, Teradata’s earnings tumbled 69% year over year to 22 cents per share, mainly due to decline in revenues.Notably, Teradata has underperformed the industry it belongs to in the year-to-date period. During the said period, the stock has returned merely 8.2% while the industry gained 17%.Revenue DetailsTotal revenue of $513 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $513.35 million. Moreover, it plunged 14% on a year-over-year basis. This was mainly due to the company’s ongoing business transformation activity, under which its large customers have begun shifting to subscription pricing offerings.Products and Cloud revenues decreased 32% year over year to $166 million. Services revenues fell 3% on a year-over-year basis to $347 million. Revenues from Americas Data and Analytics decreased 17% year over year while that from International Data and Analytics grew 1% from the prior-year quarter.MarginNon-GAAP gross margin contracted 420 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 51.7% mainly due to “a higher mix of services versus product revenue”. Also, services had much lower margins which more than offsets the higher margins from product sales.The company reported non-GAAP operating income of $47 million, down from $130 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin shrunk to 9.2% from 23% reported year over year mainly due to lower revenue, shrink in gross margin and increased operating expenses to support the company’s strategic initiatives.Teradata Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Teradata Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Teradata Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet & Share RepurchaseTeradata exited the quarter with $1.085 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $1.164 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Teradata had long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $508 million at the end of the second quarter compared with $523 million at the end of first-quarter 2017.In the second quarter, Teradata generated cash flow from operations of $61 million and free cash flow of $45 million. Year-to-date, the company generated $309 million of cash flow from operational activities and $275 million of free cash flow.Teradata repurchased 3.7 million shares for $108 million during the second quarter, while 5.1 million shares for $151 million in the first half of 2017. Concurrent to its second quarter earnings release, the company announced that it intends to buyback $300 million worth of its common stock in the second half of this year. The company will use available cash from U.S. operations and its totally unused $400 million of revolving credit facility.GuidanceThe company is finding it difficult to estimate the actual impact of its ongoing business transformation initiatives on its full-year revenue. Teradata expects 2017 revenues to come in the range of $2.095 billion to $2.140 billion, representing a decline of 10% to 8%. Excluding the revenues of Marketing Applications business, which it had divested last year, the company projects revenues to decline between 5% and 7%, which is narrower than its earlier projected range of 5% to 10%.Teradata also provided earnings outlook for the full year. The company projects to report GAAP earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.31 while non-GAAP earnings are estimated to come between $1.22 and $1.27.The company did not provide any guidance for the third quarter but projects that fourth quarter to be better than the current quarter.To ConcludeTeradata revenues are getting impacted by the company’s ongoing business transformation. Also, restructuring related costs, a sluggish spending environment in the domestic market and increasing competition from the likes of International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corp (ORCL  -  Free Report) and others will continue to weigh on its financials.However, over the long run, the company is expected to benefit from transition to a subscription-based revenue model. Plus, strategic partnerships with the other big tech giants and acquisitions should bode well for long-term growth.Currently, Teradata has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Applied Optoelectronics Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 118.33% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 18.8%.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

3504,ORCL,"We have seen a number of major earnings beats this earnings season, but we shouldn’t see this as the new norm that will continue through the rest of this reporting cycle. A company’s earnings outperformance is as much a function of the overall business environment as it is of management effectiveness in executing operating and strategic plans. As such, the very strong results from a company like McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) doesn’t mean that all restaurant operators stand to shine this earnings season. What it does mean is that the operating environment is favorable for earnings growth, with effectively run operators able to capitalize on opportunities. All in all, the fundamental backdrop is favorable to earnings growth.With respect to the Q2 scorecard, we now have results from 128 S&P 500 members that combined account for 36.1% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 77.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.3% beating revenue estimates.Putting results from these 128 index members in a historical context, the growth pace is below what we had seen in Q1, but is about in-line with the 4-quarter average and presents a notable improvement over the 12-quarter average, as the comparison chart below shows.Unlike the growth pace, the proportion of companies beating estimates is tracking above historical periods, as the comparison chart below shows. The proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is particularly notable.In terms of standout sectors, the Tech sector results have been strong, with total earnings for the 37% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported up +13.2% on +11.1% higher revenues, with 90.9% beating EPS estimates and 81.8% beating revenue estimates. I even see strength in the Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) earnings report that many in in the market found disappointing. For a company this big to be able to grow the top-line in excess of +20%, entirely through organic means, is very impressive. We will see how the rest of the Tech sector results come out in the coming days, but it is reasonable to be optimistic about the sector’s earnings prospects based on what we have seen already from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and others. The Finance sector’s results have not been well received, but they aren’t bad either. Total earnings for the 54.1% of the sector’s market cap that have reported already are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues, with 82.9% beating EPS estimates and 68.6% beating revenue estimates.It is relatively early for the Energy and Consumer Staple sectors, but both of those sectors have gotten off to a shaky start this earnings season.Beyond Q2, earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up +4.8% from the same period last year in Q3. Estimates for the quarter have started coming down, with the current +4.8% growth pace down from more than +6% at the start of the quarter. This pace of negative revision is about in-line with what we had seen in the run up to the Q2 earnings season, which was a material improvement over what we had seen in the last two years.Unlike the decelerating quarterly growth pace, the overall level of quarterly earnings is in record territory, as the chart in the accompanying video shows. For a detailed look at the Q2 earnings season, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017 From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

3505,ORCL,"Shares of ServiceNow Inc. (NOW  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $119.47, eventually closing a tad lower at $119.38 on Oct 5.The share price momentum can primarily be attributed to the growing adoption of the company’s platform and tools by 2000 (G2K) companies, as defined by Forbes. The company is also gaining from its rapid penetration into the non-ITSM markets such as customer service, human resource and security.The company also posted impressive financials for the second-quarter 2017 where revenues of almost $478.5 million surged 40.2% year over year. The top-line figure also surpassed the guided range of $469–$474 million.ServiceNow stock has gained 60.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 28.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Key Drivers and CompetitionServiceNow has been a dominant name in the IT service market (ITSM). The company is steadily winning market share amid the ongoing trend of replacing legacy on-premise systems with cloud-based processes, especially among G2K companies. The growing penetration at G2K customer base has been driving ServiceNow’s top line, which has been exemplary, increasing at a CAGR of more than 70% over 2009–2016 time frame.Notably, with none of the customers exceeding 10% of revenues in the last couple of years, the customer base remains unaffected by the problem of customer concentration. Diversified clientele is another positive for the company.ServiceNow, Inc. Revenue (TTM) ServiceNow, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | ServiceNow, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the company’s expanding product portfolio (including emerging products) and strong renewal rate (almost 98%), are the other key growth drivers. Additionally, the popularity of its Customer Service Management product, launch of a new HR product and the availability of the Jakarta platform to all is anticipated to boost the company's performance further.Notably, in August 2017, ServiceNow was declared a Leader in the 2017 Magic Quadrant for IT Service Support Management Tools by Gartner for the fourth consecutive year. However, in spite of an improving top line, mounting losses and stiff competition in the non-ITSM markets from established players like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) remain concerns for the company.Zacks Rank & Key Pick Service Now currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology, Inc.

3506,ORCL,"U.S. stocks continue to extend their winning streak with the S&P 500 carving its sixth straight record close on Oct 5, the longest since June 1997. The market value-weighted index also completed its eight-day long winning streak, the longest since 2013. The broad index has posted its 43rd record close in 2017 so far and is up 350% from the low hit in March 2009. In fact, the index has more than doubled in the decade ever since its pre-crisis peak of October 2007.So, what has driven the S&P 500 higher? Investors cheered the first step toward enacting major tax reforms later this year after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a 2018 budget resolution. Renewed optimism over tax cuts propelled the buying of assets perceived as risky, including financial and tech stocks.Investors’ sentiments were also buoyed by narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and rebound in exports, which might boost the economy in the third quarter. The U.S. economy is already growing close to the range projected by the White House, while both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month. Banking on such bullish trends, investing in fundamentally sound stocks listed under the S&P 500 seems judicious.House Passes $4.1-Trillion BudgetThe House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for them to rewrite the much awaited tax code later this year. The budget aims to repeal Obamacare and also contains $1.1 trillion in non-entitlement outlays, including nearly $622 billion for defense.The far-reaching plan will trim taxes for individuals as well as corporates. The tax plan aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%, while the corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. These tax reforms will put the economy in overdrive, which will offset the revenue loss and not add to national debt that is now above $20 trillion.Republicans’ major tax bill, known as budget reconciliation, required a simple majority in the Senate. The final tally was a narrow 219 to 206, with majority adopting the House of Representatives’ version of the budget.Financials and Technology Led Advancers in the S&P 500 Banks face high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Banking on such optimism, shares of banks scaled north.Among tech behemoths, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), Oracle ORCL and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas. The tax plan seeks to encourage such multinationals to bring those profits back to the United States by cutting the tax rate. Shares of these companies scaled higher, with Netflix turning out to be the biggest gainer on the S&P 500, ending the day 5.4% higher at $194.39.Other sectors, including telecom, consumer staples and consumer discretionary, that tend to pay more to Uncle Sam also benefitted immensely.Investors Happy on Solid Economic DataThe U.S. international trade deficit fell by nearly $1 billion in August from July, while exports rose slightly to $128.9 billion in the month. This is quite encouraging as analysts had feared that hurricanes might affect trade data for August, with exports delayed due to storms.The U.S. GDP, in the meanwhile, expanded 3.1% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3%. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment drove the upside. A key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States also scaled a 13-year high in September, while non-manufacturing activity picked up to a 12-year high. According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August. The non-manufacturing gauge came in at 59.8% last month from 55.3% in the prior month.5 Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy NowWith the S&P 500 scaling record highs on tax cut hopes and a strengthening economy, investing in sound stocks from the index seems a prudent choice. We have, thus, selected five stocks that have not only gained immensely in the last two decades but also have the potential to move further north. These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

3507,ORCL,"Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) recently unveiled its blockchain services on cloud, after around two months of collaborating with Hyperledger, Linux Foundation’s open source underlying technology behind the blockchain build-up.Oracle made the announcement of the launch on the first day of its OpenWorld conference in San Francisco. The company is following the footsteps of International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in the blockchain market. Notably, IBM, currently a dominant player in the blockchain market, also uses hyperledger technology for its blockchain applications and is a key member of the Hyperledger committee. Microsoft’s solutions on the other hand are built on Ethereum technology. Oracle’s entry in the expanding blockchain market is anticipated to be a positive for the company’s top and bottom line and will boost shares going forward. Oracle stock has gained 28.7% year to date, outperforming the 26.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. Blockchain’s Increasing AdoptionThe technology that originated for the purpose of cryptocurrency (bitcoin) trading and mining is gradually gaining ground in several other industries. It is primarily used for tracking transactions related to digital assets or documents, particularly in industries like banking, financial services and insurance.The unique selling point (USP) of the technology is the assurance of secured data storage and transmission via its distributed ledger technology (DLT). The possibility of any data theft or security breach becomes less likely due to the decentralized system, where any change made in the records is visible by all parties involved in the transaction.We note that IBM has already won several deals based on blockchain. The most recent ones being the “Car ewallet” contract with ZF Friedrichshafen and UBS and another one with global food suppliers.Microsoft’s blockchain solutions is also witnessing increasing adoption as evident from the contract with Israeli bank Hapoalim as well as its Coco framework initiative built for the betterment of blockchain-based transactions.Oracle’s Prospects in BlockchainMost recently, in one of its articles, Next Big Future stated that Oracle estimates that 10% of the global GDP will be contributed by blockchain technology by 2027. Moreover, per MarketsandMarkets, the blockchain market is estimated to reach $2.31 billion by 2021 from $210.2 million in 2016 at a CAGR of 61.5%.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Oracle Corporation QuoteThough the market already has big players including the likes of IBM and Microsoft, we believe that Oracle has huge prospects in this segment given the rapid adoption of the blockchain technology across industries.Zacks Rank and Key PickOracle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It helps enterprises extend software-as-a-service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) applications as well as migrate from existing on-premise applications to the cloud. The launch of this Cloud Suite will enable users to better manage digital assets on Oracle Public Cloud and help reduce risk.The partnership not only provides a secure connection for Oracle’s business customers but also enables Accenture’s customers to access the services of a major cloud provider.

Moreover, as Oracle is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it becomes necessary for Accenture to enhancecapabilities in delivering Oracle-based business solutions.Cloud ProspectsThe overall growth expectation for the public cloud computing services market is very bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market was projected to grow 18% through 2016 to $246.8 billion in 2017. This figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is projected to be the highest growth service driven by improvement in platform-as-a-service (PaaS) along with themassive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.The exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. Consequently, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Accenture’s investments in this space to boost long-term growth.Price Performance Accenture stock has gained 15.6% year to date, outperforming the 13.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bottom LineThe company’s long-term prospects look promising, driven by sustained focus on innovative product roll outs, consistent investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions.

3509,ORCL,"After the failure to repeal Obamacare, President Donald Trump is now focusing on another campaign promise — tax reform. Last week, he proposed the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades that would make America more competitive.The plan calls for lowering corporate income tax rates, reducing the number of income tax brackets from seven to three, cutting taxes for small businesses and doubling the size of Americans' standard deductions in a bid to bolster take-home pay for the middle class.Trump’s Tax Blueprint in DetailThe proposal lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, below the 22.5% average of the industrialized world. It limits the maximum tax rate applied to the business income of small and family-owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations to25%, down from 39.6% (read: Bet on These ETFs on New Hopes for Tax Reform).For individuals, Trump’s plan would shrink the current income tax brackets from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 35%. While the top income tax rate for individuals will be cut from 39.6%, the bottom tax rate on low-earning Americans will rise from 10%. The framework also offers tax relief to middle-class families by doubling the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married couple filing jointly.Additionally, the Trump administration proposed a shift from the current 35% worldwide tax system to a territorial system, allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without incurring extra taxes.Other details of the proposed plan include substantially higher child tax credit, the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, the retention of charitable giving and mortgage interest deductions and the scrapping of most itemized deductions including the state and local tax deduction. It would also eliminate estate tax – known colloquially as the ""death tax.""Though the massive tax cuts will create an economic surge boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, it could add trillions of dollars to the country’s deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget policy group estimated that the plan contains about $5.8 trillion of total tax cuts over a decade and would have a net cost of $2.2 trillion through 2027.The tax reform is the most prestigious legislative move for Republicans to enter into 2018 midterm elections. However, it is facing a difficult fight in the Congress, with Trump’s own party divided and Democrats hostile (read: 5 ETFs to Buy if Trump Tax Reform is Enacted by Year End).Market ImpactThe legislative move has led to the return of Trump trade and investors are cashing in on the opportunity with ETFs that are deemed to gain most on tax reforms. Below, we have highlighted some of these funds.iShares Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO  -  Free Report)Small companies pay huge taxes in America and a tax cut could be a big boon to these companies. While there are several options in this space that would gain from the proposal, IWO seems to be the most exciting choice as it offers exposure to companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It charges 0.24% in expense ratio and has $8.5 billion in AUM. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook (read: Three Reasons to Bet on Small Cap ETFs Now).Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR  -  Free Report)The consumer discretionary sector will benefit the most from a reflation rally, as tax reforms will help businesses and consumers, boosting discretionary spending. VCR is by far the most popular and low cost choice in this space with AUM of about $2.2 billion and expense ratio of 0.10%. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (read: 4 ETFs to Profit from Sector Rotation).Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK  -  Free Report)The tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's proposed tax reform policy. In fact, the top five U.S. hoarders are Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) that hold 88% of their money overseas, according to Moody’s. XLK is the best way to tap as these giants account for nearly 36% in the portfolio. It is the most popular tech ETF with AUM of more than $17.7 billion and charges 14 bps in annual fees. The product has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE  -  Free Report)Since banks have higher tax rates, reduced corporate rates would lead to higher profits. In addition, the repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash could find a home in banks. Tax reform may also cause a rise in interest rates that would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Given the tailwinds, the ultra-popular bank ETF, which offers equal weight exposure, could be a big winner. It has amassed $3.6 billion in its asset base and charges 35 bps in annual fees. The ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW  -  Free Report)    Trump’s tax reform is expected to benefit buyback ETFs. This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies’ profitability and drive shareholders’ wealth. PKW tracks the NASDAQ US Buyback Achievers Index, which comprises companies that have repurchased 5% or more of their common stock in the trailing 12 months. PKW is one of the popular funds in the niche space, managing an asset base of more than $1.3 billion and charging a higher annual fee of 63 bps (read: Are Buyback ETFs in Trouble?).iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO  -  Free Report)    Tax savings will likely result in fatter and faster dividend hikes, thereby raising the appeal for dividend products. In particular, dividend growth ETFs like DGRO will benefit the most from the enactment of the tax reform. The fund provides exposure to companies having a history of consistently growing dividends. It has accumulated $2.1 billion in its asset base and charges 8 bps in fees per year. The product has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook (read: Best ETF Strategies for a Hawkish Fed).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3510,ORCL,"With the Greek rumor mill quieting down a bit and nothing major on the economic calendar, the market will likely shift its attention to the Fed's two-day meeting, which gets underway today. The central bank is expected to announce the so-called 'Operation Twist' as a prop for the market, but the move's relevance to the economy's structural problems is far from clear.
"
3511,ORCL,"Nevertheless, in the absence of anything negative from the across the pond, stocks will likely remain in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Fed announcement Wednesday afternoon. 
"
3512,ORCL,"'Operation Twist' is similar to the Fed's earlier quantitative easing programs in that it aims to produce monetary easing through bond purchases. But it is different in the sense in that it doesn't involve an expansion to the central bank's already enormous balance sheet. Instead, the move enables the Fed to change (or twist) the composition of its balance sheet by replacing maturing short-term bonds with longer-dated treasuries. 
"
3513,ORCL,"The goal is to flatten the yield curve by bringing down the yield on long-term treasury bonds. The hope is that lower long-term yields and a flatter yield curve will push investors into riskier assets like corporate bonds and stocks, which is expected to benefit the underlying economy. With the 10-year Treasury bond yield at a historically low level, it is difficult to envision further yield compression. But the move will nevertheless be a net positive for stocks. 
"
3514,ORCL,"While the move will be beneficial to the market on the margin, 'Operation Twist' is no solution to the U.S. economy's structural problems. To address those issues, we need a bold fiscal response from the nation's political leadership. But with leaders gearing up for the 2012 elections, hoping for bipartisan solutions is nothing more than daydreaming at this stage. It is in this context that 'Operation Twist' has effectively become the only game in town. 
"
3515,ORCL,"In corporate news, we have Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) reporting quarterly results after the close today. ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report) missed earnings expectations this morning, as high commodity costs weighed on its margins. The company had earlier terminated its buyout bid for Ralcorp (RAH).

3517,ORCL,"Earnings Preview 9/16/11
"
3518,ORCL,"The second quarter earnings season is over. Now we are starting to see a few companies report their third-quarter results (period ending in August September or October). Just a trickle so far, but those might provide some clues as to how well the rest of the market will fare in the upcoming earnings season.
"
3519,ORCL,"There will be just 36 firms reporting, but 14 of those are in the S&P 500, including Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Carnival Cruise (CCL  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). That is an interesting cross-section of the market which may well provide some interesting insights.
"
3520,ORCL,"It will be a light week for economic data. The main focus of the official numbers will be on Housing, starting with the home builders index, followed by housing starts and building permits and finally existing home sales. The Fed is holding a meeting, but there will be no change in the Fed Funds rate. The language of their statement might provide clues about the potential for further unconventional easing steps that they might take.
"
3521,ORCL,"With few earnings and little data outside of housing, the focus of the market will likely continue to be on the other side of the Atlantic and the ongoing Greek drama....MondayThe National Association of Homebuilders Index is likely to remain unchanged at 15, which is a simply abysmal reading. This is a magic 50 index, so any reading below 50 indicates a poor outlook for the homebuilders.TuesdayThe Data on Housing Starts and Building Permits will provide the reason for the pessimism among the homebuilders. In July, housing starts were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 604,000. They are expected to decline still further to just 592,000 (I’ll take the under on that one). That is down from over 2.2 million at the height of the bubble. It used to be a rarity for housing starts to be below 1 million, but August will mark the 33rd consecutive month where starts have been below 1 million.The best leading indicator for housing starts is building permits. They ran at 597,000 in July and are also expected to be effectively unchanged rising to 598,000 (I’ll also take the under). The bubble peak was also over 2.2 million. Traditionally homebuilding has been the sector that has led us out of recessions. That locomotive is derailed and does not appear likely to get back on track anytime soon.WednesdayAll eyes will be on the Federal Reserve Board, even though everyone knows that the Fed Funds rate will remain in the 0 to 0.25% range it has been stuck in since December 2008. The Fed has pledged to keep it there until the middle of 2013. The Fed is deeply divided on if they should do more to try to support the economy by taking unconventional steps to further ease monetary policy, and the meeting was expanded to two days so they can hash things out. The language of the statement will be carefully parsed to see it they have come to any agreement. Last time there was a highly unusual three dissents to the statement. Watch to see if that changes.Existing home sales were running at an annual pace of 4.67 million in July. Very little change is expected, with the consensus looking for a slight increase to a 4.70 million rate. Since the sale of an existing home is simply the transfer of an existing asset, it generates very little economic activity (aside from realtor’s commissions). However, since people do tend to redecorate “new for them homes there is some activity that is generated. Still, the impact pales in comparison to new home sales, even though new home sales are just a small fraction of used home sales. The important thing in the report is the level of sales relative to inventory, or the months of supply on the market. That gives a very good clue as to the future direction of existing home prices. Housing equity is (or at least used to be) a vital repository of the wealth of the middle class. Since housing tends to be a very leveraged asset, relatively small changes in price can have a big impact on wealth. Also, being “underwater on a mortgage is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a foreclosure to happen. Six months supply is considered normal, and during the bubble, four months was the norm. In July it climbed to 9.4 months from 8.2 months in June, indicating continued downward pressure on housing prices.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in they year, but have been recently in a trading range above 400,000. Last week they increased by 11,000 to 428,000. I would expect a small decline this week, but nothing big enough to really change the story of very weak job growth. The consensus is looking for 417,000. The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The four-week moving average will stay above the 400,000 level, and might top 420,000. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. The sharp rise in initial claims were an early warning of the weak jobs report for June. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.Continuing claims have in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 12,000 to 3.726 million. That is down 765,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for 3.730 million, a very small increase.  Some (most?) of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 10,000 last week to 3.608 million, but are down 1.352 million over the last year. Even extended benefits don’t last forever. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 7.144 million, which is down 25,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.066 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed (unlikely given the current Congress) then all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayNothing of particular significance.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceACCURAY INC     ARAY       201106 ($0.41) $0.08  -75 20110919 AMC $5.26 LENNAR CORP -A  LEN        201108 $0.11  $0.16  75 20110919 BTO $13.85 ADOBE SYSTEMS   ADBE       201108 $0.44  $0.44  -4.76 20110920 AMC $26.12 ANALOGIC CORP   ALOG       201107 $0.44  $0.56  -9.3 20110920 AMC $45.98 AUTOZONE INC    AZO        201108 $6.97  $5.66  9.91 20110920 BTO $325.77 CARNIVAL CORP   CCL        201108 $1.63  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.32 CARNIVAL PLC    CUK        201108 $1.62  $1.65  18.18 20110920 BTO $33.17 CONAGRA FOODS   CAG        201108 $0.31  $0.34  -2.08 20110920 BTO $23.63 FACTSET RESH    FDS        201108 $0.95  $0.82  0 20110920 BTO $87.64 FULL CIRCLE CAP FULL       201106 $0.21  $0.24  0 20110920 AMC $6.96 GENTIUM SPA-ADR GENT       201106 $0.14  $0.21  7.14 20110920 BTO $6.52 JEFFERIES GP-NW JEF        201108 $0.23  $999.00  -4.88 20110920 BTO $14.91 ORACLE CORP     ORCL       201108 $0.44  $0.39  5.8 20110920 AMC $28.95 AMER SUPERCON   AMSC       201106 ($0.08) $0.28  22.22 20110921 BTO $6.01 BED BATH&BEYOND BBBY       201108 $0.84  $0.70  16.13 20110921 AMC $59.36 COPART INC      CPRT       201107 $0.59  $0.43  1.43 20110921 AMC $41.23 FULLER(HB) CO   FUL        201108 $0.47  $0.38  8.7 20110921 AMC $21.03 GENL MILLS      GIS        201108 $0.62  $0.64  0 20110921 BTO $37.80 HERMAN MILLER   MLHR       201108 $0.33  $0.23  15.38 20110921 AMC $18.11 IHS INC-A       IHS        201108 $0.55  $0.62  1.59 20110921 BTO $79.37 RED HAT INC     RHT        201108 $0.19  $0.14  6.25 20110921 AMC $41.24 STEELCASE INC   SCS        201108 $0.17  $0.08  100 20110921 AMC $7.56 TEXAS INDS      TXI        201108 ($0.26) ($0.20) -119.23 20110921 AMC $38.77 CARMAX GP (CC)  KMX        201108 $0.51  $0.48  17.02 20110922 BTO $28.54 CINTAS CORP     CTAS       201108 $0.47  $0.40  11.36 20110922 AMC $31.59 COMTECH TELECOM CMTL       201107 $0.36  $0.73  20.51 20110922 AMC $28.17 DISCOVER FIN SV DFS        201108 $0.87  $0.47  51.39 20110922 BTO $26.19 FEDEX CORP      FDX        201108 $1.48  $1.20  1.74 20110922 BTO $77.08 FINISH LINE-CLA FINL       201108 $0.38  $0.31  0 20110922 AMC $20.50 NIKE INC-B      NKE        201108 $1.21  $1.14  6.9 20110922 AMC $88.04 RITE AID CORP   RAD        201108 ($0.18) ($0.18) 50 20110922 BTO $1.10 SCHOLASTIC CORP SCHL       201108 ($1.03) ($0.95) 17.11 20110922 BTO $27.08 SYNTHESIS ENRGY SYMX       201106 ($0.04) ($0.08) 36.36 20110922 BTO $1.60 TIBCO SOFTWARE  TIBX       201108 $0.16  $0.14  7.69 20110922 AMC $22.30 VAIL RESORTS    MTN        201107 ($1.50) ($1.16) 3.69 20110922 BTO $38.31 KB HOME         KBH        201108 ($0.17) ($0.02) -75 20110923 BTO $6.27 
"
3522,ORCL,"The top and bottom lines of the income statement - sales and net income - get all the attention these days. 
"
3523,ORCL,"But what about the ""middle"" lines - gross and operating profit? 
"
3524,ORCL,"Much like a middle child, these often get overlooked. However, they can tell a very important story. 
"
3525,ORCL,"Middle Lines
"
3526,ORCL,"Gross profit is simply a company's revenue minus the direct costs of producing its goods or services. Among other things, this can signal whether or not a company is able to raise its prices along with its input costs. 
"
3527,ORCL,"This is especially important in today's environment where soaring commodity prices are dramatically raising production costs for many companies. Companies with strong pricing power can raise their prices to offset the higher costs. Those without it cannot. 
"
3528,ORCL,"The other middle line to consider is operating profit. Operating profit takes gross profit and subtracts operating expenses such as selling, general and administrative costs. This lets investors know how efficiently a company is being run. If its operating expenses are growing significantly faster than revenue, for instance, this could be a signal that management isn't keeping a close eye on its costs. 
"
3529,ORCL,"Gross and operating profit are often expressed as a percentage of total revenue, giving you gross and operating margins. The bigger the margins, the better. 
"
3530,ORCL,"Wide Margins, Wide Moats
"
3531,ORCL,"Corporate profit margins are heavily influenced by the industry they're in, so it's important to compare them with their peers. Tech companies will tend to have much higher margins than retailers, for instance. 
"
3532,ORCL,"Some companies manage to consistently produce wide profit margins, however. More often than not, these businesses will have at least one of the four types of competitive advantages: Consumer (control over pricing), Producer (proprietary production technologies), Economies of Scale (lower long-run average costs), and External (government regulation). 
"
3533,ORCL,"These competitive advantages must be constantly monitored and maintained in order to fend off competition, and if a company continually generates wide margins and fat profits, you can bet it will attract competitors. 
"
3534,ORCL,"Ridiculous Margins, Reasonable Prices
"
3535,ORCL,"More often than not, high-margin, wide-moat businesses will trade at premium valuations. There are, however, companies with durable competitive advantages and strong growth prospects trading at very reasonable prices. For the long-term investor, these could be great buying opportunities. 
"
3536,ORCL,"I ran a screen for companies with 5-year average operating margins greater than 25% and net margins above 20%, along with the criteria that current margins must be greater than their 5-year averages (i.e., margins must be expanding). The stocks must also have a Price/Earnings/Growth (PEG) ratio below their industry average. 
"
3537,ORCL,"Here are 4 of my favorite names from the list: 
"
3538,ORCL,"Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) 
"
3539,ORCL,"Operating Margin (5-yr average): 29.6% 
"
3540,ORCL,"Net Margin (5-yr average): 23.6% 
"
3541,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 0.9 
"
3542,ORCL,"Oracle is the world's largest enterprise software company and also provides computer hardware products and services since acquiring Sun Microsystems in January 2010. Its software segment, which still represents around 68% of total revenue, has seen strong margin expansion over the last few years due in large part to growth in its wildly profitable Software License Update and Product Support division. 
"
3543,ORCL,"After paying the Government its cut through taxes, Oracle keeps almost 24 cents in net profit for every dollar of revenue it takes in. The company also has very low capital expenditure requirements, and thus generates tons of free cash flow. In fiscal 2011, for instance, Oracle produced $10.8 billion in free cash flow, up 27% year-over-year. This allowed it to repurchase a whopping $1.2 billion in shares. 
"
3544,ORCL,"Earnings estimates have been steadily climbing higher over the last several months. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. Shares seem like a bargain at just 13x forward earnings. 
"
3545,ORCL,"Visa (V  -  Free Report) 
"
3546,ORCL,"Operating Margin: 33.2% 
"
3547,ORCL,"Net Margin: 30.0% 
"
3548,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 1.0 
"
3549,ORCL,"Visa is a global payments technology company and one of the most recognized brands in financial services. The company doesn't actually issue credit cards to consumers, it simply acts a payment processor. When a cardholder swipes a credit card, Visa processes the payment by facilitating the authorization, clearing, and settlement of the transaction on its proprietary networks. 
"
3550,ORCL,"Thanks to the financial crisis and knee-jerk government regulation (never waste a good crisis, right?), Visa's stock price has whipsawed since it went public in early 2008. While the company faces regulatory headwinds, fears may be a bit overblown. Analysts have been steadily raising their earnings estimates over the last several months due in large part to better clarity over the regulation's impact. 
"
3551,ORCL,"In the meantime, Visa continues to do what it does best: making piles of money. Revenue has been soaring both domestically and abroad as more and more consumers migrate away from cash and checks. Moreover, the actual cost of processing those payments is relatively small compared with what it charges in revenue. As a result, Visa has kept an average of 30 cents of every dollar it takes in after all expenses, including taxes, over the last five years. Over the last 12 months, this has increased to 40 cents. 
"
3552,ORCL,"The company also has very little capital expenditures and thus generates exceptionally strong free cash flow. It spent $2.8 billion in the first 9 months of fiscal 2011 buying back stock. Shares trade at just 15.3x 12-month forward earnings, well below its historical average of 19.7x. 
"
3553,ORCL,"PotashCorp (POT)
"
3554,ORCL,"Operating Margin: 26.6% 
"
3555,ORCL,"Net Margin: 26.5% 
"
3556,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 1.1 
"
3557,ORCL,"PotashCorp produces potash, phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer nutrients. Surging demand in the emerging markets is driving prices and volumes for PotashCorp's products higher. For being in the commodity business, the company posts remarkably high profit margins. This is mostly due to the fact it is the world's largest potash producer and has significant pricing power over the product. 
"
3558,ORCL,"For the first six months of 2011, the company's potash segment earned an incredible 68.9% gross profit. Potash accounts for about 50% of the company's total revenue. What's also impressive is that total operating expenses represented just 4.9% of sales. As a result, every dollar in revenue that PotashCorp earns becomes 35 cents in net profit. That's about three times the industry average. 
"
3559,ORCL,"With earnings estimates surging after better than expected second quarter results, shares seem very reasonably priced at 15.9x forward earnings. PotashCorp is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock. 
"
3560,ORCL,"Google (GOOG) 
"
3561,ORCL,"Operating Margin: 27.0% 
"
3562,ORCL,"Net Margin: 25.9% 
"
3563,ORCL,"PEG Ratio: 1.1 
"
3564,ORCL,"Google is a search engine giant that derives 96% of its revenue from ads placed on its websites. Companies continue to shift away from traditional advertising sources and towards Google's popular pay-per-click AdWords program. 
"
3565,ORCL,"Google's high margins and low capital expenditures make for substantial free cash flow. Over the last 12 months the company generated nearly $8 billion in free cash flow and currently has over $39 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books. Hopefully it makes good use of that money. 
"
3566,ORCL,"Valuation seems very reasonable at 19.4x forward earnings. Three and a half years ago, Google was trading around $715 per share and had trailing earnings of $4.2 billion. Today, it's trading around $605 per share and has trailing earnings of $9.0 billion. 
"
3567,ORCL,"The Bottom Line
"
3568,ORCL,"Investors should look beyond just the top and bottom lines and consider what's in between: the gross and operating margins. For the long-term investor concerned with competitive advantages, look for wide, and expanding, margins. These four companies all fit that criteria - and are reasonably priced.

3570,ORCL,"We see new economic data before the opening bell today, but we’ll need to parse it a bit to see if we’re looking at effects of the hurricane influencing August Retail Sales results. The headline number was -0.2%, whereas expectations were for +0.2%. This is identical with what the control metric measured. Ex-autos, retail sales rose to 0.2%; however, +0.5% was expected. Ex-autos and gasoline, we see a read of -0.1%, again off the expected +0.3%.So first off, these are somewhat disappointing numbers, in that inflation metrics are regularly being sought to drive numbers upward to meet the Fed’s goal of 2% inflation in the market. These numbers do not show this has yet gained traction. Then again, we may be seeing an anomaly in the data here — or rather, two anomalies: one named Harvey and one called Irma.Stripping out auto sales for the month of August boosted the overall figure from -0.2 to +0.2, so it’s safe to say both the lack of auto sales dragged retail numbers down for the month, and that history dictates that fewer autos are sold ahead of and during Category 4 hurricanes. Strip out gasoline with the auto sales, we see the number fall back to a -0.1%, which would suggest a large portion of price hikes in the overall market are associated with higher gas prices. This would point to not only Floridians filling up their tanks on the way out of the state to wait for Hurricane Irma to pass, but also the spike in refined oil (gasoline) prices as Hurricane Harvey deluged the largest region of oil refineries in the United States.That said, we still see big misses from analyst estimates across the board. And one clearly not-hurricane-related number — July Retail Sales — was cut in half from a very strong +0.6% in the initial read to +0.3% in today’s revision. This would suggest more than an anomaly of datas taking place last month. The question will be how the next three months — September, October and November — register on inflation metrics as a rebound from hurricane damage takes place and we begin to enter holiday shopping season. The reason these numbers are important is that they will likely influence he Fed’s decision to raise interest rates again before the end of the year.Currently, odds are that Janet Yellen — or whomever the Fed Chair may wind up being in the future — and company will still not raise rates in December, but just barely at 44%.

Cloud revenues helped bolster results in the quarter and also took a larger share of company revenues overall in the quarter.However, lowered expectations for full-year earnings have sent ORCL shares trading lower both in yesterday’s late trading and today’s pre-market.

"
3572,ORCL,"Margin expansion has been a huge source of earnings growth as companies emerged from the recession lean and mean.
"
3573,ORCL,"Revenue growth in the S&P 500 rose a solid 9.7% in 2010 (excluding financials). However, the real driver of income growth came from expanding profit margins.
"
3574,ORCL,"Lean & Mean
"
3575,ORCL,"Net profit margins increased from 7.1% in 2009 to 8.2% in 2010 as companies that slashed costs during the recession squeezed the most they could out of their resources.
"
3576,ORCL,"This led to a whopping 27.4% increase in net income for the S&P - and a soaring stock market.
"
3577,ORCL,"Net profit margins, calculated as net income divided by revenues, are expected to continue expanding, leading to more double-digit earnings growth in 2011. The net profit margin is expected to increase to 8.8% for the S&P 500. Combine that with projected revenue growth of 6.6%, and you get net income growth of 14.4%.
"
3578,ORCL,"Not too shabby.
"
3579,ORCL,"The Most Profitable Sector
"
3580,ORCL,"So what sector is expected to see the widest net profit margins in 2011?
"
3581,ORCL,"Computer and Technology.
"
3582,ORCL,"The computer and technology sector is expected to see an incredible 16.3% net profit margin in 2011, up from 15.3% in 2010. That means for every $1 in revenue, companies keep an average of 16.3 cents after-tax. That's nearly twice the average of the S&P 500.
"
3583,ORCL,"Moreover, revenues are expected to grow 10.7% in the sector, leading to net income growth of 18.3% in 2011.
"
3584,ORCL,"Valuation is very reasonable too, with the sector sporting an average P/E of 15.0x 2011 earnings. That's a slight premium to the S&P multiple of 13.9x, but still well below its historical average.
"
3585,ORCL,"Here are 4 computer and technology stocks looking attractive right now:Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) provides IT security solutions around the globe. It is best known for its firewall and virtual private network (VPN) products.
"
3586,ORCL,"The company is wildly profitable, posting a remarkable 41.2% net profit margin in 2010. Earnings are expected to grow a solid 12% in 2011 based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
"
3587,ORCL,"Check Point also has a pristine balance sheet with over $1 billion in cash and no debt. Shares trade at 19.8x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 25.9x.
"
3588,ORCL,"It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
3589,ORCL,"Oracle Corp (ORCL  -  Free Report) continues to outperform expectations. The tech giant recently posted its fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise on 35% growth in revenues.
"
3590,ORCL,"Estimates have been rising off the strong quarter, sending the stock to a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). The company is expected to grow EPS a whopping 32% in 2011. Despite this, shares are trading at just 15.9x forward earnings.
"
3591,ORCL,"Oracle has a 22.4% net profit margin over the last 12 months. It has also generated an average of $8.6 billion in free cash flow per quarter since the beginning of 2010. It currently pays a dividend that yields 0.6%.
"
3592,ORCL,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) operates as an analytical instrument manufacturer for pharmaceutical, biochemical, and industrial companies. It designs and manufactures high performance liquid chromatography, ultra performance liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry instrument systems and support products.
"
3593,ORCL,"The company's net profit margin was an impressive 23.2% in 2010. Furthermore, EPS is expected to grow 14% in 2011 based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
"
3594,ORCL,"Valuation is reasonable with shares trading at 18.9x forward earnings and a PEG ratio of 1.3.
"
3595,ORCL,"WAT is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
3596,ORCL,"Netease.com Inc. (NTES  -  Free Report) is one of the leading Internet and online gaming companies in China.
"
3597,ORCL,"Estimates have been surging since NTES posted a 19% positive earnings surprise on February 23. The company also reported a fat net profit margin of 40.4% for 2010.
"
3598,ORCL,"Analysts are calling for 23.9% EPS growth in 2011 based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
3599,ORCL,"Valuation is reasonable with shares sporting a PEG ratio of 1.0. The stock is trading at 16.4x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 25.9x.
"
3600,ORCL,"NTES is also financially sound with nearly $1.5 billion in cash and short term investments and no long-term debt.
"
3601,ORCL,"Conclusion
"
3602,ORCL,"As the U.S. emerged out of recession, companies were able to turn decent sales growth into huge earnings growth through expanding profit margins. These gains are expected to continue in 2011, particularly in the wide-margin computer and technology sector. With strong earnings growth expected and reasonable valuations, tech stocks are looking like an attractive investment.

3604,ORCL,"Earnings Preview 9/10/10
"
3605,ORCL,"The second quarter earnings season is over, and now we are getting the first of the third quarter. We define any fiscal period ending in August, September and October to be the third quarter.
"
3606,ORCL,"Still, we are just talking about a trickle of reports, just a total of 47 companies will report. However, that includes six from the S&P 500, including Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Federal Express (FDX  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), Pall Corp (PLL), Kroger’s (KR  -  Free Report) and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report). That is an interesting cross section of companies and together they should give some interesting clues on the overall economy.
"
3607,ORCL,"With little action on the earnings front, all eyes will be focused on the economic data, and we will have a fairly active week on the data front. We start with Treasury Budget on Monday, and end with the Consumer Price Index on Friday. In between we get news on Producer prices, Industrial Production and Retail Sales. Any of those numbers has the potential to move the markets.MondayWe find out how much red ink was spilled in Washington during August when the Treasury budget is announced. The data is highly seasonal, but is not seasonally adjusted, so the month-to-month changes are less than meaningless -- they are downright misleading to look at. The most interesting comparison is the year over year. The expectation is that the government spent $97.5 billion more than it took in through taxes in August. That is a small improvement over the $103.6 billion in red ink last August. The other thing to look at is the year-to-date deficit relative to the year to date in 2009. The trend has been for small year-over-year declines in the deficit, but still very large numbers in any absolute or historical context.TuesdayRetail sales in August are expected to have increased by 0.2% in August, down from a 0.4% increase in July. This is a very broad based measure of consumer spending, and goes far beyond just sales at the malls. A big part of the increase in July was higher sales from gas stations -- reflecting higher prices, not more driving. That effect should be much more muted in August. Auto sales were on the soft side in August, so excluding Auto sales from the calculation is expected to result in a 0.3% increase in sales up from a 0.2% increase excluding Autos in July.WednesdayThe Empire State Manufacturing survey, which is sort of like a mini-ISM just covering New York State. Unlike the national ISM number, the dividing line between expansion and contraction is zero, not 50. The consensus is looking for a reading of 10.0 up from 7.1 last month. That would mean that the manufacturing side of the economy is not only expanding in New York, but doing so at an accelerating pace.Industrial Production is expected to have increased by 0.4% after a 1.0% increase in July. The overall Industrial Production number can sometimes be a bit misleading. It includes utility output, which is highly weather dependent. Thus it is important to look not only at the overall number, but the change in manufacturing output as well.Capacity Utilization is reported along with Industrial Production. This is a highly under-rated economic indicator, and deserves a lot more attention than it gets in the press. Effectively it is measuring the employment rate of our physical capital, the way the employment report measures the utilization of our human capital. Overall capacity utilization is expected to rise to 75.0%. That is much better than the below-70 reading we saw a year ago, but is still historically low and indicating recessionary conditions. A healthy economy has capacity utilization around 80%, so we are about half way back to normal on this measure. As with the Industrial Production number, it is important to look at the Manufacturing only utilization as well as the overall, since there can be weather related changes in utility utilization.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 27,000 in the last week, to 451,000. The third straight week of declines. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have been locked in a tight “trading range."" Look for them to fall modestly next week. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A rate of over 500,000 signals that the unemployment rate is probably headed back up and a high probability of a double dip.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 2,000 to 4.478 million. That is down 1.557 million from a year ago. Most of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims rose by 29,000 to 5.47 million. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.948 million, which is up 27,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 128,000 million above year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Producer Price Index (PPI) is expected to rise 0.2% on a headline basis, equaling its 0.2% rise in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy components prices are also expected to be up 0.2% in August, but down from a 0.3% rise in July. The report will also give clues about future inflation trends from prices further up the production pipeline. In general, inflation pressures are very tame right now.FridayInflation at the Consumer level is also very tame. The Consumer Price index is expected to show a rise of just 0.1% in August after a 0.3% rise in July. Excluding food and energy prices, the CPI should also be up 0.1% matching the rise in the core CPI in July. Right now deflation is a bigger threat than runaway inflation. At any given level, deflation is a far more serious problem than inflation. If the CPI were to come in a tick our two higher than expected it would not be all that bad. If it were to come in negative, that would be troublesome.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
3608,ORCL,"Historically the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better than expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. Given the very small number of firms reporting, there were no obvious candidates for ether positive or negative surprises this week.

3610,ORCL,"Earnings Preview 6/18/10
"
3611,ORCL,"The pregame festivities for the second quarter earnings season are getting underway. There will be just 48 firms reporting next week, but that includes 15 S&P 500 firms. We define the second quarter as fiscal periods ending in May, June and July, so these are mostly firms with fiscal periods ending in May. The 15 S&P 500 firms reporting represent a wide cross section of the market. These include Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Discover Financial (DFS  -  Free Report), ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report), Walgreen (WAG) and Nike (NKE).
"
3612,ORCL,"On the economic data front, there will not be a lot of reports, but the ones we get are some important ones, most notably the reports on Used, and especially New Homes Sales. We will also get new orders for durable goods, the final numbers on first quarter GDP and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index.MondayNo reports of significance.TuesdayExisting Home Sales are expected to have risen to an annual rate of 6.10 million in May from 5.77 million in April. Existing home sales, which are reported at closing, are still benefiting from the home buyer tax credit. People had until April 30 to be under contract, but they have until the end of June to close. Thus we will have strong sales in May and probably even stronger sales in June, but come July there will be a massive hangover and sharply lower sales.WednesdayNew Homes Sales are expected to drop to an annual rate of 480,000 in May from 504,000 in April. New home sales are recorded when the contract is signed, thus they are already suffering from the hangover. I suspect that the actual level will be below the 480,000 forecast. While much smaller than existing home sales, new home sales are FAR more important to the economy. Each new home built creates an enormous amount of economic activity. Existing home sales affect the economy mostly indirectly -- for example, as people redecorate the homes that are new to them.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets to decide the fate of the Federal Funds rate. It is universally expected to remain at the current 0.00 to 0.25% range. The real interest will be in any change to the policy statement, particularly the language on keeping rates extremely low for an extended period of time. With unemployment still at 9.7%, manufacturing capacity utilization still far below normal, and inflation nearly non-existent, it would be foolish in the extreme to raise rates any time soon.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They rose 12,000 in the last week, to 472,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall next week. Longer term, we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go.Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late, but that was reversed last week as claims rose to 4.571 million, an increase of 88,000. Part of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 169,000 to 5.221 million. However that is probably due to even the extended claims running out as a bill to further extend benefits has been stalled in the Senate. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.792 million, which is down 81,000 from last week, but up 559,000 from a year ago. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.New orders for Durable goods are expected to have dropped by 1.4% in May partially reversing a 2.8% increase in April. However, most of the April increase was due to a huge surge in the extremely volatile transportation equipment segment, which includes jetliners. Excluding transportation equipment orders are expected to have risen by 0.9% after a 1.1% decline in April. The ex-transportation number is probably the more important one to keep your eye on.FridayWe get our final read on the first quarter GDP. The first read of 3.2% was revised down to 3.0% growth in the second look, but the consensus is expecting the final number to stay at 3.0%. Changes to the composition of that growth though could be significant, as almost half of the growth came from inventory building, which is a very low quality (i.e. usually reversed in subsequent quarters) source of growth.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index is expected to fall slightly in June to a reading of 75.3 from 75.5. In theory, the consumer sentiment and confidence indexes should be important since the consumer comprises 71% of the economy. However there is often a disconnect between what people say on these surveys and their actual behavior. Generally, lower gasoline prices and higher stock prices drive the number higher, and higher gasoline and a lower stick market drive it down. Since the last survey, gas prices are down, but so is the stock market.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceSonic Corp SONC 201005 0.2 0.24 -150.00% 20100621 AMC 9.33Steelcase Inc SCS 201005 -0.06 0.02 -999.00% 20100621 AMC 7.44Adobe Systems ADBE 201005 0.34 0.28 3.33% 20100622 AMC 33.12Aerovironment AVAV 201004 0.58 0.27 -6.25% 20100622 AMC 25Apogee Entrprs APOG 201005 -0.05 0.27 -90.91% 20100622 AMC 13.07Carnival Corp CCL 201005 0.3 0.33 69.23% 20100622 BTO 36Carnival Plc CUK 201005 0.28 N/A 120.00% 20100622 BTO 38.6China Cord Bld CO 201003 0.04 N/A N/A 20100622 BTO 5.31Commercial Metl CMC 201005 -0.12 -0.1 -26.60% 20100622 BTO 15.87Fuller(Hb) Co FUL 201005 0.38 0.36 35.71% 20100622 AMC 21.91Gerber Scientif GRB 201004 0.04 -0.09 25.00% 20100622 BTO 5.73Jabil Circuit JBL 201005 0.26 -0.02 -22.73% 20100622 AMC 13.87Progress Softwa PRGS 201005 0.47 0.29 36.84% 20100622 AMC 33.22Red Hat Inc RHT 201005 0.13 0.12 16.67% 20100622 AMC 32.13Walgreen Co WAG 201005 0.57 0.53 -4.23% 20100622 BTO 29Amer Apparel APP 201003 -0.22 -0.13 0.00% 20100623 BTO 1.86Amer Software A AMSWA 201004 0.07 0.06 0.00% 20100623 AMC 5.63Bed Bath&Beyond BBBY 201005 0.48 0.34 19.44% 20100623 AMC 41.7Canadian Solar CSIQ 201003 0.08 -0.13 -31.37% 20100623 BTO 11.8Carmax Gp (Cc) KMX 201005 0.33 0.11 4.00% 20100623 BTO 20.82Cke Restaurants CKR 201004 0.17 0.29 133.33% 20100623 AMC 12.49Herman Miller MLHR 201005 0.18 0.2 -11.76% 20100623 AMC 19.98Nike Inc-B NKE 201005 1.05 0.99 13.48% 20100623 AMC 74.57Niska Gas Strg NKA 201003 N/A N/A N/A 20100623 BTO 18.07Paychex Inc PAYX 201005 0.31 0.32 3.03% 20100623 AMC 28.67Rite Aid Corp RAD 201005 -0.14 -0.11 -26.32% 20100623 BTO 1.1Somanetics Corp SMTS 201005 0.12 0.14 100.00% 20100623 BTO 24.83Spectrum Contrl SPEC 201005 0.22 0.18 -5.00% 20100623 AMC 14.71Techprecision TPCS 201003 N/A 0.04 N/A 20100623 AMC 0.81Accenture Plc CAN 201005 0.69 0.68 -1.64% 20100624 AMC 38.49Block H & R HRB 201004 2.04 2.09 14.29% 20100624 AMC 15.93Conagra Foods CAG 201005 0.4 0.41 0.00% 20100624   25.23Darden Restrnt DRI 201005 0.88 0.9 3.26% 20100624 BTO 44.54Discover Fin Sv DFS 201005 0.11 -0.18 -650.00% 20100624 BTO 14.04Flow Intl Corp FLOW 201004 -0.02 -0.03 0.00% 20100624 AMC 2.86Fsi Intl FSII 201005 0.16 -0.09 -33.33% 20100624 AMC 4.5Lennar Corp -A LEN 201005 0 -0.11 87.50% 20100624 BTO 15.3Mccormick & Co MKC 201005 0.44 0.42 8.51% 20100624 BTO 40.77Oracle Corp ORCL 201005 0.52 0.44 0.00% 20100624 AMC 23.07Palm Inc PALM 201005 -0.7 -0.4 -48.78% 20100624 AMC 5.69Research In Mot RIMM 201005 1.34 0.98 -0.78% 20100624 AMC 61.91Robbins & Myers RBN 201005 0.22 0.26 -7.14% 20100624 BTO 22.61Standard Micros SMSC 201005 0.14 -0.15 600.00% 20100624 AMC 24.09Synnex Corp SNX 201005 0.68 0.57 6.45% 20100624 AMC 26.79Tibco Software TIBX 201005 0.1 0.09 14.29% 20100624 AMC 11.9Azz Inc AZZ 201005 0.56 0.8 4.92% 20100625 BTO 38.57Finish Line-Cla FINL 201005 0.15 -0.01 27.08% 20100625 BTO 16.45Kb Home KBH 201005 -0.32 -0.6 -57.78% 20100625 BTO 12.54Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

3617,ORCL,"Earnings season is off to its weakest start since the end of the last recession. While there has been some improvement over the past week, it still looks like a pretty ugly earnings season. After the stock market coming to believe that double-digit median year-over-year growth was something just short of a constitutional right, we seem likely to fall well short. Thus far, median year-over-year growth is running at just 8.6%.
"
3618,ORCL,"In recent years, the normal ratio of positive surprises to disappointments has run about 3.0:1. This time around it is just 2.4:1 - a huge improvement over last week. The median surprise is holding up better at 2.6%, where in most recent quarters it ended up at 3.0% or better.
"
3619,ORCL,"If you are looking for a silver lining, it is that the worst damage is in the Financial sector and, almost a quarter of the Financials have already reported, far more than any other sector. So far, the Financials have been responsible for almost two-thirds of all the earnings disappointments.
"
3620,ORCL,"The Consumer Discretionary sector has also been weak, showing median growth of just 2.8%, and a surprise ratio of 1.4:1 and a 1.4% median surprise. Add the disappointments in the Discretionary stocks to those in the Financials and together the two sectors are responsible for more than 80% of the disappointments so far. Put another way, excluding only the Financials, the surprise ratio is running at 5.5:1.
"
3621,ORCL,"There are two sectors which are currently showing growth over 20%, Tech and Energy. Five more are comfortably in double digits, although all five of those have less than 15% of the results in. Tech is having a remarkably strong quarter so far on the surprise front, with a surprise ratio of 13:1 and a median surprise of 8.7%. This is made even more remarkable given that almost half of the sectors results have already been reported.
"
3622,ORCL,"Industrials, with 16 positive surprises and no disappointments are also having a very strong quarter, as are the Health Care sector with a surprise ratio of 5.5:1. Looking at the expectations for those left to report, these three sectors should end up on the medal stand when the race is over.

"
3624,ORCL,"On a total net income basis, so far the fourth quarter can be summed up in a single word: UGLY. While there has been a substantial improvement over the last week, the fourth-quarter still is by far the weakest quarter we have seen in a long, long time. Total net income reported so far is 41.9% below year ago levels, although that is much better than the 99.1% decline we were seeing last week.
"
3625,ORCL,"Since the most troubled sector, Finance, has seen a much higher percentage of its firms report than the S&P 500 overall, the number should continue to climb out of the hole it is in. Still, if every remaining firm were to come in exactly as expected, the total earnings would still be 17.9% lower than a year ago.
"
3626,ORCL,"On a median basis, the reporting firms are showing positive growth in earnings, just less positive than in previous quarters.  However it very much looks like a tale of two markets, with Tech doing well and Financials doing awful. Collectively, the 43 Financial firms that have reported so far are in the red, not just earning less than a year ago, but actually losing money. Twelve of these firms are actually in the red (none were a year ago) and four more have seen more than 90% of year ago earnings evaporate. New reports in the red this week include National City (NCC), Washington Mutual (WM) and Huntington Bank (HBAN  -  Free Report)). Based on the expectations of the yet to report firms things should improve somewhat, but still be down a staggering 93.7% when all is said and done.
"
3627,ORCL,"Telecom will lead the pack but that is artificially boosted by the AT&T/Bell South (T  -  Free Report) merger a year ago. Tech so far is up 32.8%, while that might decline a little bit as expectations for the remaining firms stand at 16.1%, when the reported and unreported are combined, 26.1% growth is expected. That sure beats a sharp stick in the eye. Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) were the big contributors to the Tech total this week. It certainly appears that Tech will be one of the bright spots for the quarter.
"
3628,ORCL,"Energy, riding oil prices that remain averaged over $90 a barrel during the quarter has only had four firms report, So far, so good with total net income growth of 25.0%, but that should fade a bit to 17.5% growth when all the reports are in. Note that this is a very different picture than on a median basis where Energy is expected to be near the back of the pack. Health Care is currently in a distant fourth place, but as more firms report its total net income growth should climb from the current showing of 11.6% up to 16.8%. Still off the medal stand, but a much closer finish. With a few more positive surprises for Health Care (or disappointments in Energy), the sector just might squeak out the bronze.

"
3630,ORCL,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
3631,ORCL,"This, so far is looking like the story of the dog that didnt bark. Outside of Finance and to a lesser extent Consumer Discretionary, earnings surprises have been very positive. The normal reaction by analysts to a positive earnings surprise is to raise estimates for future periods. This does not seem to be happening this time (at least not yet, it may be that the analysts have just not gotten to it yet given how many have just reported).
"
3632,ORCL,"The revisions ratio for 2008 is 0.45, indicating well over two estimate cuts for every increase, and is up ever so slightly from 0.44 last week, and 0.49 two weeks ago.
"
3633,ORCL,"The total number of revisions is starting to rise. Over the last four weeks there have been 1,776 changes in estimates: 552 up and 1,224 down, up 16.3% from 1,527: 448 up and 1079 down last week. As earnings season gets into full swing over the next few weeks, the totals will climb significantly from current levels, most likely topping 3,000.
"
3634,ORCL,"By far the sector that is faring the worst is the Financials where cuts out number increases by almost 6:1. Banks continue to get slammed, with large numbers of estimate cuts at firms like BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report), Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report), Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report).
"
3635,ORCL,"Consumer Discretionary follows with a revisions ratio of 0.25, or four cuts per increase. However it is striking that only one sector, Health Care, is clearly in positive territory, and a less than 5:4 ratio is hardly overwhelming. Even there if one stock, Forest Labs (FRX) were removed from the sample, the revisions ratio would be below 1.0. Energy was the next best with a very neutral 1.02 reading. Recall that Health Care is seeing positive earnings surprises out number disappointments by 5.5:1, and a 1.24 revisions ratio is the best it can muster! Even more disturbing are the revisions ratios for Tech, at four cuts for each increase, despite 13x as many positive surprises as disappointments. As for Industrials, so far the sector has seen 16 positive surprises without a single disappointment, yet is receiving more than two estimate cuts for each increase! Unless we start to see a dramatic turnaround in the next few weeks, this has to be seen as a resounding vote of no confidence by the analysts.

"
3637,ORCL,"The early look at 2009 revisions shows that analysts are already revising their estimates downward on balance for the year, and at almost the same rate they are doing so for 2008. The overall revisions ratio is 0.50, unchanged from last week and down sharply from 0.63 two weeks ago. As with 2008, the defensive Health Care sector is doing relatively well, while the pictures for the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors look bleak.
"
3638,ORCL,"In particular, the retailers are taking it on the chin. Firms with at least 12 cuts and no increases include Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report), Family Dollar (FDO), Kohls (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report).   However, the total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is still relatively light at 816: 272 up and 543 down. This is up 14.0% from 716 (239 up and 477 down) last week. Keep in mind that the numbers for some of the individual sectors are still very light. Still, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Telecom and Utilities were all seeing cuts running at 3x increases or more. All in all, not a very encouraging outlook, even for as far out as 2009.

"
3640,ORCL,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
3641,ORCL,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
3642,ORCL,"Despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials will account for 22.2% of the total net income for the S&P 500, and 22.7% in 2008. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is the cheapest on a P/E basis, it just reclaimed it throne as the biggest total market cap sector (it is in a virtual tie with Tech). The Financial sector makes up 17.9% of the total market capitalization of the index, followed by Tech at 16.7%. The surprise rate cut clearly caused the Financials to rally far more than the market as a whole. However, given the ongoing massive cuts in estimates, please take the P/E on the Financials with a bag of rock salt. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of only 10.8x and based on 2009, only 9.6x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
3643,ORCL,"Energy is even cheaper based on 2008 earnings, trading at 10.5x, although Financials reclaim the cheap throne based on 2009 earnings (9.6 vs. 10.5). Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge, you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved than is true with the Financials. However, Energy is a fairly distant fourth when it comes to total market capitalization (and thus weight in the index) at 12.0%. Health Care is in third for market capitalization at 12.1% and 11.5% of total earnings for both 2008 and 2009.
"
3644,ORCL,"It is instructive to look at where the expected earnings shares were at the start of 2007, as well as the market cap shares at that time. Much has changed during 2007, and it is likely that much will also change in 2008 as well. At the start of 2007, the Financials represented 21.9% of the S&P 500 total market capitalization and were expected to provide 26.9% of the total earnings. In other words the sector has lost 4.0% of ""market cap share"" in just one year, and 4.7% of 2007 earnings share. For perspective, the whole Utilities sector currently comprises just 3.53% of market capitalization and 3.30% of 2007 earnings.
"
3645,ORCL,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 13.7x and 12.4x, respectively. Based on 2008 earnings that translates to a 7.30% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.56% ten year T-note. Even against the A-rated corporate bond yield of 5.28% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.
