15,BDX,"A number of high-profile medical technology firms, including the likes of Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT), are unlikely to stand in the way of Dutch firm Philips' bid for heart device-maker Spectranetics (SPNC), an analyst said Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Spectranetics stock rocketed to a record closing high, up 26.2%,  to 38.35, after Philips announced its plan to acquire Spectranetics for $38.50 in cash per share. The deal values Spectranetics at 1.9 billion euros, about $2.16 billion.Needham analyst Mike Matson says the bidding will likely stop there as Boston Scientific, Abbott and Medtronic aren't expected to bid for the company. Spectranetics makes a drug-coated balloon called Stellarex as a treatment for a disease in which the arteries to the legs, stomach, arms and head narrow.Rivals C.R. Bard (BCR), Boston Scientific and Medtronic already make drug-coated balloons, Matson wrote in a note to clients. Further, Becton Dickinson (BDX) is acquiring C.R. Bard for $24 billion.That leaves three major firms in the sector that lack drug-coated balloons: Abbott, Cardinal Health (CAH) and Terumo.""We suspect Abbott is too preoccupied with its St. Jude Medical and Alere (ALR) acquisitions to pursue another large deal,"" he said. ""Similarly, Cardinal is in the process of acquiring Medtronic's medical supplies business for $6 billion.""IBD'S TAKE: The heart-valve sector heated up last year as Boston Scientific made an acquisition that could bring it closer to competing with Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences  in the U.S. Head to Sector Leaders a look at for how the battle is shaping up.Matson is unsure of Terumo's acquisition strategy.Similarly, he doesn't expect Philips' acquisition to get caught up with regulatory issues. Philips and Spectranetics only overlap in atherectomy, a process in which hardened or narrowed arteries are removed from the body. Philips got into the area with an earlier acquisition.""But we believe its market share is very low and think regulatory issues are unlikely,"" he said.Philips said Wednesday that it expects the deal to close in the third quarter. The Dutch firm expects to see revenue growth and profit accretion by 2018.Matson kept his buy rating on Spectranetics stock, though he boosted his price target to 38.50 from 34 to reflect the acquisition cost.RELATED:Medtronic's Edwards-Rivaling Unit Outgrows Broader Market In Q4Boston's Heart Valve Wins in Face-Off Trial With Rival MedtronicEdwards Rockets To 6-Month High On Strong U.S. Heart-Valve Sales

18,BDX,"The S&P 500 index outperformed dividend stock mutual funds on average over the past 10 years, but the index and the dividend group were actually neck-and-neck for much of the decade.It wasn't until the second quarter of 2013 that the S&P 500 charged into the lead decisively. Earlier, dividend funds had outperformed in 2008 and then for much of 2010 through Q1 2013.That included the financial-crisis fueled market meltdown period, when investors sought the relative safe haven of funds holding stocks that paid dividends.Overall, over the past 10 years the S&P 500 averaged an 11.39% yearly gain.

It posted a 7.96% average annual gain.Managed by Clare Hart and Jonathan Simon, the fund had 95% of its shareholders' money in U.S. stocks as of Dec. 31. The bulk of the balance was in cash.Financial services was the fund's biggest sector, with a 25% weighting. Health care was next with a 12% weighting. Industrials was the third biggest sector, at 11%.Share-price gains by medical supplies company Becton Dickinson (BDX) have helped make Equity Income the top performing dividend fund in the past decade.Shares are up 2% so far this year.Earnings per share grew 1%, 17%, 9600% and 28% the past four quarters.A little more than a year ago, the company acquired CareFusion through debt financing. The company has paid down a $1 billion term loan for the takeover. The firm continues to dish out dividends, but it has suspended share repurchases until it meets its debt reduction goals. Its dividend yield is 1.7%.The company has a 96 Composite Rating from IBD.

23,BDX,"Many stock mutual fund managers are basking in the warm glow of 2017's hot performance numbers for the broad market. The S&P 500 index rose 1.11% in December, lifting the fourth quarter's gain to 6.64% and capping a 21.83% year. The Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% for the year, on the way to topping 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday.X The S&P 500 is already up another 2.63% so far this year. The Dow is up 2.20%.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds edged up 0.73% on average in December to extend their gains in Q4 to 5.13% and in 2017 to 18.26%, according to Lipper Inc. World equity funds, powered in part by a weaker dollar, turned in gains of 2% in December, 4.92% in Q4 and 28.52% last year.General domestic taxable bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.57% on top of a 0.39% December move. They finished the year up 4.86%.But fund managers and investment strategists have also turned their eyes to 2018, where many expect more-modest gains overall.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersTop Mutual Funds In Q4Mutual Fund Category PerformanceWhy Buffalo Discovery Fund Keeps OutperformingWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Fund managers and strategists expect to rely more on foreign stocks and on value equities for their gains. Still, fund managers certainly have not abandoned U.S. equities totally, having 2018 bets on stocks like First Solar (FSLR), part of the S&P 500; Amazon (AMZN), a key piece of the Nasdaq Composite; and Boeing (BA), the best performing Dow Jones industrial average stock in 2017.One reason fund managers and strategists expect to search further afield overall for big returns in 2018: history. Since 1963, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 15% annually in 19 years. And each time it did that, in the following year the broad market's gains averaged just 7.5%.Two more reasons for the expected rotation into more foreign stocks and value equities: Cheaper valuations for many foreign equities give them more room to run in '18, and forecasts for faster economic growth abroad.""We're in a synchronous growth pattern,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management and manager or co-manager of seven of its stock mutual funds with a combined $1.7 billion in assets. ""It's rare that we have growth in the U.S. as well as in key markets abroad. In this sort of economic environment, value (stocks) overall should beat growth (stocks).""Stocks should also continue to get a tailwind from the Federal Reserve's slow tempo of interest rate hikes. ""The slow pace is reassuring to investors,"" said Allen Bond, a manager of $6.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund (JENSX), which outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as the past three and 10 years, and just fell short over the past five years.One key reason why Doll expects value to outperform is that corporate earnings have been on a roll and should remain that way. That's indicative of a rising economic tide that lifts stocks of all stripes, including modestly priced value-oriented ones, Doll said. Further, as the strengthening economy lifts earnings of both types of stocks, investors are likely to flock to value stocks, which are more attractively priced than growth stocks.""Inflation and interest rates have been behaving themselves and letting earnings growth go to the bottom line,"" he added.Doll added that U.S. tax reform should boost corporate earnings. Also, both corporate CEO and consumer confidence is up. And demand is strong for many goods and services, especially in the technology, health care and certain consumer areas.IBD'S TAKE: To see how tax reform impacts individuals like you, check out this IBD report.""Much of the consumer area has been doing OK, with capital spending improving before the tax bill, (enactment of which) will accentuate capital spending,"" Doll said. ""That should be good for industrials and many tech stocks.""Within the tech space, Doll likes software companies and credit card companies, which use software to facilitate digital payments for transactions. Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) were among the top four holdings of Doll's largest portfolio, $563.8 million Nuveen Large Cap Core (NLCIX), as of Nov. 30.Among health care stocks, ""I would highlight diversified biotech companies and managed care providers,"" he said. ""I'm less interested in pharmaceuticals and some equipment companies. . . . We prefer diversified biotech to pharma as they have faster growth and similar valuation characteristics.""Nuveen Large Cap Core also held cloud computing services provider Red Hat (RHT). Red Hat enables a client's noncloud enterprise software to jibe with cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was a third holding. UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.Additional holdings included First Solar, Amazon and Boeing. Solar energy company First Solar was new to the fund in November. It posted Q3 results on Oct. 27 that crushed analysts' expectations. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 0% and 64% the past two stanzas. Hot as a solar flare in 2017, the stock gained 110.41%.Trading around 125, First Solar is extended. It has a very strong IBD Composite Rating of 98. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Its IBD SMR Rating is A. That means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Amazon soared nearly 56% last year. The e-commerce leader slid on Dec. 29 amid reports that President Trump had called for Amazon — also a leader in cloud services — to pay the U.S. Postal Service higher fees for package deliveries. Separately, the FAANG stock says it shipped more than 5 billion items in '17 through its Prime program, for which customers pay $99 a year.Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1,213.51.And aerospace and defense titan Boeing gapped up more than 2% on Dec. 12 after saying it would raise its dividend 20%, to $1.71 a share, up from $1.42, giving shares a 2.3% dividend yield. Boeing also increased its stock buyback program.In 2018, Dow-component Boeing is up 4.19%.In the tech sector, Jensen's Bond likes stocks that benefit from the ongoing transition to cloud computing. He likes companies that help themselves by making the switch or that make money by helping others shift to the cloud.Microsoft (MSFT) is a dual beneficiary, he says. Oracle (ORCL) enables customers to use on-premises enterprise software or to shift to cloud computing. ""They are a go-to database software provider for companies with extremely sensitive information that can't have things go wrong,"" Bond said.He also likes Alphabet (GOOGL). ""GOOGL is more of a player in the cloud infrastructure space,"" he said. ""If a customer needs access to a cloud structure, they sell that. But most of their business is from their core advertising model, resulting from their ubiquitous position in online search and online ad buying.""Bond also likes specific themes in health care. One such theme is growing affluence in emerging markets. That enables patients to be able to afford better health care.""When a health care system starts to grow and develop in an emerging market, needles and syringes are some of the first things they need to make that work,"" he said. As a result, he likes Becton, Dickinson & Co. (BDX), a leading maker of needles and syringes.The company acquired CareFusion, a maker of infusion pumps (which deliver medical liquids over time), in 2015.And last month Becton Dickinson said it and C.R. Bard had agreed to divest two product lines to win regulatory approval for their merger. Bard makes catheters and biopsy devices.Bond also likes Stryker (SYK), whose orthopedic implants, surgical tools and medical devices enable it to capitalize on aging populations in the U.S., Europe and Japan.The $174 million Kinetics Internet Fund (WWWFX) was one of the top performing U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in 2017, posting a 57.43% gain, according to Morningstar Direct.The fund had 36 holdings as of Sept. 30, including a 12% stake in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). The cryptocurrency, which is volatile, rose about 1,166% last year. ""We're not afraid to be wrong,"" said co-manager Peter Doyle. ""A lot of people won't participate in the upside of 'consensus money' and cryptocurrencies because they need outside reinforcement. We don't say cryptocurrencies can't fail. But we control our risk by controlling the size of our position.""Doyle said the fund's stake is ""much higher"" than what it has formally disclosed, due to appreciation.For investment opportunities in general, the fund is looking beyond many popular large caps that enjoyed large run-ups in 2017 and other recent years. Their high valuations leave them insufficient room to post additional gains, said co-manager James Davolos.For one thing, the fund holds stock in nine companies in which noted investor and Liberty Global (LBTYK) chairman John Malone holds large blocks of shares, including Liberty Media (LSXMK), Liberty Broadband (LBRDK) and Liberty Global. ""If you've trusted John Malone (by owning shares in his companies) over the years, almost without exception you've done well,"" Doyle said.Kinetics Internet also likes Live Nation Entertainment (LYV). The company helps popular music performers earn a living through live performances and through concession sales, corporate sponsorships and advertising, Doyle said.The fund managers also like Copart (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions. ""This company keeps gaining market share by providing value to both buyers and sellers of vehicles by providing price transparency and lower transaction costs,"" Davolos said.S&P 500 index funds led all U.S. diversified categories in Q4 with an average gain of 6.76% after tacking on 1.28% in December.World equity funds trailed U.S. diversified stock funds in Q4, averaging a 4.92% advance after a 2% December return. India region funds paced all foreign stock fund categories by soaring 12.64% in Q4, helped by a 4.77% December romp.Global natural resources funds beat other major sectors by posting a 6.45% Q4 gain, aided by a 4.96% December geyser. That gave them an 8.49% return for the year. But commodities base metals funds did even better with gains of 7.68% in December, 10.97% in Q4 and 28.69% for the year.Consumer services funds added 2.52% in December, which lifted its gains to 8.42% in Q4 and 18.23% in 2017.Loan participation funds were tops in Q4 among general domestic taxable bond categories, rising 1%. Their December gain was 0.35%.Among world income funds, emerging markets hard currency funds enjoyed the best Q4, gaining 0.73%, a shade better than their December return.Municipal bond funds averaged a Q4 gain of 0.44% after returning 0.81% in December.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsHow Did Mutual Funds Perform In 2017?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

27,BDX,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences. (See our full list of best sector mutual funds.)To highlight the best mutual funds in the top-performing sectors, the ""best of the best"" list of IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners includes the top fund in each of six sectors.Click Here To View A Table Of Top Performing Mutual Funds By CategoryFidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) came out on top with a 10-year average annual return of 16.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.31%. The fund held $9.7 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29. Its expense ratio is 0.74%. Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said. ""We have that kind of historical understanding and depth of understanding of the industry and the individual players. Equally important is the ability of these companies to access capital at a low cost. I want my companies to be self-reliant.""The five top biotech funds all owned big-cap biotech and Soliris maker Alexion in their recently reported quarters. Four of the five funds also held biotechs Celgene and Gilead, which focus on cancer and hepatitis C, respectively. Generic drug makers tracked by IBD soared more than 900% from March 2009 to July 2015, while ethical drug stocks rallied nearly 750% from March 2009 to August 2015.T.

""Although the realization of these companies’ values may encounter intermittent setbacks, we believe the market will recognize and reward them over the longer term.""Franklin Biotechnology Discovery (FBDIX), with $1.1 billion in total net assets as of Feb. 29, has a 10-year return of 15%. Biotech stocks made up 84% of the portfolio, followed by 13% in pharmaceuticals and nearly 3% in life sciences tools and services.""We focus on biotechnology and generally have limited exposure to other areas in health care,"" Evan McCulloch, senior vice president and lead portfolio manager of the fund, said. ""We avoid more traditional large-cap pharmaceuticals companies, which have less favorable growth prospects and do not show the same levels of innovation we see in biotechnology.""Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals were among top positions in the 119-stock fund. The fund, which closed to new investors in July 2014, has an expense ratio of 1%.""Overall, we believe there are strong fundamentals underlying the biotechnology sector's recent growth which have also helped our fund,"" McCulloch said. ""Innovation remains very strong, with promising new treatments in areas like immuno-oncology, gene therapy, Alzheimer's disease, GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, central nervous system diseases and others.""Rydex Biotechnology (RYOAX) rounds out the top-five sector funds with a 10-year return of 14.7%.

"
38,BDX,"Momentum can shift quickly on Wall Street. A single trend or event sends some stocks or industries tumbling, while others get a shot in the arm and race higher.
"
39,BDX,"Stock groups that fall into the latter category — share prices that have spiked considerably in recent weeks — feature a diverse mix of companies that range from Time Warner (TWX) and Walt Disney (DIS) to FedEx (FDX), Becton Dickinson (BDX) and Whirlpool (WHR).
"
40,BDX,"Following are four stock groups that have made big moves over the past few weeks.
"
41,BDX," Freight shippers: An improving economy, combined with falling oil prices, have created a positive operating environment for companies that deliver freight and packages for a living. IBD's Transport-Air Freight group ranks No. 11 out of 197 industries tracked — up from No. 49 four weeks ago and No. 117 as recently as 13 weeks ago.
"
42,BDX,"FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) are far and away the biggest players in the group and boast IBD Composite Ratings of 94 and 91, respectively, out of a possible 99.
"
43,BDX,"A couple of other stocks also have pretty high ratings: Air T (AIRT), with a Composite Rating of 89; and Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW), with a Composite Rating of 87. Composite Ratings factor in things like earnings growth and stock price gains.
"
44,BDX," Media conglomerates: As recently as 13 weeks ago, IBD's Media-Diversified group languished way down the industry rankings in 157th place. Since then, the group has steadily moved higher and currently ranks No. 12.
"
45,BDX,"In addition to Disney and Time Warner, the group includes media/entertainment heavyweights 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Viacom (VIA) and CBS (CBS).
"
46,BDX,"Some stocks in the group have benefited from moves to expand their Internet offerings and build bigger audience bases.
"
47,BDX,"For example, Time Warner's HBO premium channel recently said it will offer streaming-only HBO Go to consumers without cable subscriptions next year to help it compete against Netflix (NFLX). Similarly, CBS recently said it will offer its Showtime premium channel as an online subscription service and CBS News as an advertising-supported online channel
"
48,BDX," Medical supplies: Like the Media-Diversified group, IBD's Medical-Supplies group has made a big move the past few months. Thirteen weeks ago the group ranked No. 164. It has since vaulted to No. 19. The group's shares touched a record high on Monday and have risen 19% since the beginning of October.
"
49,BDX,"Becton Dickinson, the largest stock in the group by market cap, saw its shares spike in October after it announced plans to buy CareFusion (CFN) for around $12 billion. Shares have since moved even higher for Becton, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 91.
"
50,BDX,"Other highly rated stocks in the group include Patterson (PDCO), which has a Composite Rating of 94; and West Pharmaceutical Services (WST), with a Composite Rating of 93.
"
51,BDX," Household appliances: An improving U.S. housing market and economy have helped IBD's Household-Appliances/Wares group move up to No. 21 in the industry rankings from 186th place 26 weeks ago.
"
52,BDX,"Whirlpool is the biggest stock in the group and boasts a Composite Rating of 91.

53,BDX,"The list of stocks hitting new highs Monday was short as the market remained in a correction. Medical equipment maker Becton Dickinson (BDX) soared 9.10, or nearly 8%, to 124.94 after announcing late Sunday that it was buying CareFusion (CFN) for $12.2 billion.

57,BDX,"The stock market today has its work cut out for it, although Christmas week trade generally tends to be light. The young uptrend ran into heavy distribution Friday, raising questions as to how long it will last.

58,BDX,"Economic news isn't likely to have much impact. The Chicago Federal Reserve's National Activity Index, the most prominent piece of economic news prior to the open, showed a 0.3% slip in November. That accelerated October's 0.17% contraction and was not what economist consensus had expected — a 0.15% increase.
"
59,BDX,"International markets also appeared to have negligible effect. Stocks in Europe traded modestly higher at midday. China's markets rose, including a 1.8% jump from the Shanghai Composite, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 in Japan slipped 0.4%.
"
60,BDX,"The dollar rose. Bonds edged up. Oil prices slipped, with West Texas Intermediate down 1%, bobbing between $34 and $35 a barrel, and Brent crude down 2% to just above $36. Most metals traded higher, but with no big gains.
"
61,BDX,"There could be a ""Star Wars"" effect on early trade, with Walt Disney (DIS) being one of three stocks leading the Dow with a better-than 1% gain in premarket trade. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Apple (AAPL) also gained more than 1%.

"
63,BDX,"Disney shares briefly cleared a 117.678 buy point in a cup-with-handle base in November, then dropped and undercut the buy point by more than 8%, triggering a sell rule.
"
64,BDX,"Huge-screen, 3D-savvy Imax (IMAX) jumped 3%. The new ""Star Wars"" film reportedly premiered on 667 Imax screens over the weekend, pulling in $48 million — setting an Imax record and topping the $44.1 million opening weekend take of ""Jurassic World,"" according to box office figures from Deadline Hollywood. Imax, an IBD 50 stock, ended Friday about 2% below a 39.97 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.

67,BDX,"Medical equipment makers Becton Dickinson (BDX) and CareFusion hit new highs on the stock market today after their $12.2 billion buyout deal was announced Sunday evening.
"
68,BDX,"On a conference call with analysts Monday morning, company leaders said the two firms complement each other both technologically and geographically. CareFusion (CFN) sells mostly in the U.S. while BD sells mostly outside of it, and the combined portfolio of products and services should offer a full suite for the $20 billion medication management industry, they said.
"
69,BDX,"They also fielded questions about why BD is making such a large buyout, which does not fit its recent history of tuck-in deals. In response, they cited the consolidation of the customer base, the need to cut costs and the necessity of a global presence when most growth in the industry is coming from emerging markets.
"
70,BDX,"Such factors have been driving consolidation in the medtech market, with both Medtronic's (MDT) $43 billion buyout of Covidien (COV) and Zimmer's (ZMH) $13.35 billion acquisition of Biomet already in the works.
"
71,BDX,"""As the third big MedTech deal to be announced this year, this transaction will likely be viewed as yet another indication that scale is taking on an increasing level of importance to management teams as they plan for future positioning of their companies,"" wrote Leerink analyst Richard Newitter in a research note. ""It could add pressure to companies with strong balance sheets (and often talked about as likely acquirers) like Stryker (SYK) or Abbott (ABT) to put capital to work sooner rather than later and potentially toward a larger-sized transaction.""
"
72,BDX,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro echoed the point in his note and added that ""acquisition of smaller cap medtech companies may continue to be pushed out as large-cap medtech companies digest their recent sizeable acquisitions.""

83,BDX,"Two large-cap funds are among those setting up for potential breakouts as the stock market remains near all-time highs.XFirst up is iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA (USMV), which is just shy of a 50.13 flat-base buy point. It briefly cleared a prior flat-base entry in late April, pulled back below the buy point, and bounced off its 50-day moving average en route to a 4% gain.The $13.5 billion fund tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index, which comprises domestic stocks that tend to be less volatile than the broader U.S. equity market. It carries a 0.15% expense ratio.USMV's biggest sector weighting was health care as of July 31, at just over 19% of assets. Information technology followed at nearly 19%, consumer staples 13% and financials 11%. Health care names accounted for half the top 10: Becton Dickinson (BDX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Stryker (SYK), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).The fund's top 10 names made up less than 15% of total assets. USMV also helps limit volatility by keeping each holding to about 1.5% or less and has a relatively low annual turnover of 28%.Its year-to-date gain of 11.5% through July 31 is in line with the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF outpaced the benchmark index over the past three years at 13.1% vs. 10.9%, and slightly underperformed the past five years at 13.5% vs. 14.8%. It has a dividend yield of 2.05%.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF), which tracks the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index, is near a 41.85 buy point of a flat base.The fund, which launched in December 2012, targets stocks with a sustainable yield. That leads to profitable companies that should have the ability to keep paying dividends. Top holdings as of July 28 included Procter & Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Pfizer (PFE), Apple (AAPL) and Merck (MRK).Its top 10 stocks accounted for about 27% of assets; annual turnover is 85%.

88,BDX,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. Last month, world equity funds rose 1.33%. China regional funds, which gained 11.36%, led the world equity market. In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said. ""While those names have done well — especially Amazon — there's still a runway for them.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Brian Deagon analyzes the tailwinds driving Amazon. In the ""Buys & Sells"" column, Julie Mak points out that some leading mutual funds have been selling Alphabet and Amazon.Another plus for the tech sector is that acquisitions seem to be picking up, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformancePiantedosi says investors should brace for volatility until the elections. A Democratic White House, with the Senate and House in Republican hands would mean continued gridlock, he says. Still, his impression is that support for tax reform is growing in both parties. ""That would be a huge positive,"" he said.In health care, he's wary of many drugmakers due to political calls for price regulation. Still, he likes Celgene (CELG), Vertex (VRTX) and Biogen (BIIB).""Biotechs feel a little safer (than non-biotech drugmakers),"" he said. ""They are doing wonderful things to cure big diseases. They combine positive reward-to-risk. And they're beaten up and trading at valuations at attractive valuations.""Within retail, he likes a few names.""It's an area to watch as we head into the holidays, especially some more apparel-oriented stocks,"" Piantedosi said. ""This is a short-term theme.""Macy's (M) has gone through markdowns after having to discount last year's overstock, he says. The mild winter dampened consumer demand for warm clothes. And competition is stiff from Amazon.""The company has done a great job managing inventories going into the holidays this year,"" Piantedosi said. ""Expectations are low. And they've been monetizing real estate"" by selling or closing unneeded locations.And he continues to like home-improvement giants Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD).""Housing is still strong,"" he said. ""Interest rates are still low. Consumers are OK. And (stock) prices have come in a little over fears of a housing slowdown.""Jeff Rottinghaus, T. Rowe Price manager of $1.6 billion Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $314.1 million U.S. Large-Cap Core (TRULX), says stock prices in general seem fairly priced. But he likes some names in health care, where prices have been pushed down.He calls Becton Dickinson (BDX), Medtronics (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ""quiet"" because none is under political pressure over drug pricing. Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge. Science-technology funds zoomed ahead 13.21% for the quarter on top of a 2.89% September gain.Health-biotechnology funds were also strong, manufacturing gains of 6.84% and 5.83% in the quarter.Small-cap growth funds gained 8.19% on average, leading all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.

89,BDX,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) is one of the year's top ETF Leaders as it rides some of the best parts of a mixed health care sector.This year, the medical sector has diverged, with some of its industries faring much better than others. Biotechs and other drugmakers are down roughly 20%. But IBD's medical products and equipment industry groups are up about 14%. Only the diversified medical companies are doing quite as well in 2016 in health care.Much of the outperformance in medical devices owes to superior results at some of the top manufacturers, where innovation has played a key role in igniting industry leaders.Of 47 stocks in the ETF, Medtronic (MDT) is the largest holding, with more than 12% of the portfolio. Shares have climbed as much as 12% from the 79.60 buy point of a breakout in April.The stock has performed decently despite the fact that earnings have been basically flat for five quarters. The outlook is improving, though: Analysts expect profit to rise 7% in the fiscal year ending in April and 11% the next year. At its investor day in June, Medtronic forecast mid-single-digit revenue growth as it develops its product pipeline and draws on its diversified markets.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is another stock that has shouldered the ETF's advance. Shares are near all-time highs. The main move this year was on April 4, after the company announced that its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement was shown to reduce deaths from heart attacks in patients at moderate risk from open-heart surgery. Shares soared 17% on the news.Medtronic's CoreValve competes with Edwards in heart valve replacements for patients not able to have open-heart surgery. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity remained bullish on the stock following the earnings report, saying it dominates the market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements and shows potential for market expansion.Shares of Stryker (SYK) -- which has the broadest range of orthopedics products among its peers -- have climbed as much as 34% this year, but fell sharply after its July 22 earnings report. There was no clear explanation for the slide, other than some softness in emerging markets.Other key contributors to iShares U.S. Medical Devices are Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which makes equipment for medical research, and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), which just posted its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade. Becton Dickinson (BDX) had been trending higher, but fell sharply Thursday after it cut its full-year sales forecast, citing currency headwinds.The ETF is extended from a breakout in April and from a pullback to the 50-day moving average in June. But it remains near the 142.47 buy point of a three-weeks-tight pattern that formed during July. The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

134,BDX,"Abiomed’s (ABMD  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings are scheduled to release on Jul 26, before the market opens.We believe that the company is set to gain from its flagship Impella product line.

Earnings also skyrocketed 142.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $171.9 million, reflecting year-over-year rise of 29.8%.

Notably, the first patient was successfully treated at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany. This latest acceptance further enhances Abiomed’s product portfolio.

135,BDX,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday ending its four-day winning streak. All three major stock indexes closed in the red. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a second round of tariffs worth $200 billion on Chinese goods halted the four-day market rally. Investors remain confused between strong expectations of second quarter earnings supported by a fundamentally robust U.S. economy and prolonged trader tensions between the United States and China.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,700.45, declining 0.9% or 219.21 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.7% to close at 2,774.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,716.61, shedding 0.6%.

In March, Trump administration announced first phase of 25% U.S. tariffs worth $50 billion. First part of these tariffs worth $34 billion was implemented from Jul 6 and the remaining $16 billion of tariffs will be implemented within next two weeks.On Jul 10, the U.S. government released a list of 10% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion. The new tariffs will undergo a two month review and hiring after which final decision will be taken. Last week, President Trump had threatened China that his administration may consider the possibility of imposing new tariffs worth $300 billion on China if it retaliate U.S. tariffs. However, China has retaliated with $34 billion of tariffs imposed on U.S. exports.Energy Stocks Plunge Energy stocks plunged on Wednesday on trade war concerns and some positive news on the supply side. These two developments overshadowed the government report which revealed that for the week ending Jul 6, the U.S. crude oil inventory dropped significantly by 12.6 million barrels from the previous week.Investors fear a full-flagged global trade war will slow economic growth reducing oil demand worldwide. Moreover, supply concerns eased as OPEC reported that Saudi Arabia enhanced oil production in June to its highest level since the end of 2016. Further, four Libyan oil ports have returned to normalcy after Tripoli-based National Oil Corp (NOC) lifted the ban imposed on February.Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated on Tuesday that Trump administration will consider requests from some countries to be exempted from sanctions that United States will impose on Iran since November.On Jul 11, the WTI crude dropped $3.73 or 5%, to settle at $70.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

136,BDX,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 26, before the market opens.We expect the company to see steady growth on the back of its international ventures. While this can majorly drive second-quarter results, a raised guidance and strategic collaborations are other tailwinds.In the last reported quarter, Baxter posted adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.9% and improved from the year-ago quarter’s 58 cents.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.85 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 9.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 71 cents, indicating an increase of 12.7%.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteStrong International Presence Likely to Drive ResultsBaxter has a strong presence in foreign markets which helps the company gain traction.In the last reported quarter, the company’s international sales accounted for an impressive 46.3% of total revenues.Baxter’s advanced surgery team recently launched TISSEEL Prima in Europe. Furthermore, in Japan, the company’s renal care team launched the KAGUYA peritoneal dialysis technology.In the last reported quarter, Baxter saw higher volumes of shipments of IV solutions from Mexico to the United States. The company looks forward to reallocating additional IV solutions from select South America manufacturing facilities. Per management, this will help revamp production processes at manufacturing facilities in both the United States and Puerto Rico.Other Factors at PlayRaised GuidanceBaxter has raised its guidance for 2018.The company expects sales growth of 5% at constant currency (cc). It projects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.85-$2.93 for the full year.

Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Though the buyout did not prove accretive in the last reported quarter, management expects the deal to be modestly rewarding in 2018.From the acquisition of Claris Injectables Limited, Baxter expects revenues worth $145 million in 2018.Lately, Baxter announced a partnership with International Society of Nephrology (ISN) to spread awareness on chronic kidney disease awareness and its therapy in emerging markets. This reflects Baxter’s focus on specializing in renal care.Cyclophosphamide CompetitionCyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment, which has been underperforming over the last five years. For 2018, Baxter expects U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of around $120 million, up from the previous guidance of $95 million. However, the guided figure is much lower than $185 million in 2017.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Baxter this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

141,BDX,"President Donald Trump’s calling off of the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last Thursday was quite a shocker.The abandonement of summit plans dealt a blow to the underpenetrated and emerging markets of Asia, which are a solid source of revenues for more than 80% of U.S.-based multinational companies. The effects of the political mayhem caused the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, South Korea’s KOSPI and Japan’s Nikkei to plummet.Major Wall Street indices, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, lost ground as well.Considering this trend of downward movements, the White House decided to conduct the meeting. The United States announced its plans to send a “pre-advance team” to Singapore to prepare for Trump-Kim summit on Jun 12.MedTech appears to be one of the very few sectors that might shelter investors from the political tension. Shrugging off the current volatility, the Medical-Products industry has returned 0.2% since the call-off against the S&P 500’s fall of 0.4%. In fact, analysts believe that the MedTech sector will be able to strengthen its foothold at a faster rate if the meeting goes on as planned.This is because there are a number of U.S.-based MedTech companies operating in Asia. Post the success of the summit, these companies will be able to spread their network in North Korea and augment overall production. Per research by Statista, the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach a worth of around $78 billion in 2018.Buoyed by the encouraging projections, it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical-Product companies are placed amid the political turmoil.4 MedTech Stocks to GainMeanwhile, the Medical-Product companies have already been gaining from organic growth, R&D innovation, higher consolidation, tax abolition as well as focus on emerging markets including Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, India, Philippines and more.In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing these markets over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish about growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government’s focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are gaining from the prospects in the APAC market:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), popularly known as BD, particularly focuses on broader emerging markets like India, China, Brazil and Turkey, whose economic and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly. In particular, safety-engineered products continue to drive growth in the emerging markets. We believe that exposure in these markets will boost the top line, which in turn will accelerate EPS growth.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have returned 16.2% in a year, significantly higher than the S&P 500 index’s gain of 11.4%.Baxter International’s (BAX  -  Free Report) solid presence in Asia, precisely India, is worth a mention. The company has research hubs in Japan and China. Recently, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. The stock has returned 21%. Intuitive Surgical Inc’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. In the past two years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia projected consistent strength. The company registered solid growth in China, Japan and Korea.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s shares have returned 49.1% in a year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boston Scientific Corporation’s (BSX  -  Free Report) growth strategy comprises the pursuit of development opportunities outside the United Station through strengthening of global presence, inclusive of emerging markets. Against the backdrop of flattening or declining sales growth in developed markets like the United States and Europe, Boston Scientific is fortifying its foothold in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC).In first-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered 17% growth. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year). The company is currently projecting an improvement in performance in China banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 11.7% in a year. Things to Remember“Things are not so easy as they appear to be!”Americans should never forget that former president George W. Bush referred North Korea as an ‘Axis of evil,’ as it sponsored terrorism and had solid access to nuclear weapons.Further, North Korea's multiple trials of nuclear warheads have dampened the inter-country relationship. Analysts believe that an unforeseen summit may not solve these age-old problems. Further, no one can guarantee that Kim Jong Un’s ‘tremendous anger and open hostility’ will not offend Trump anymore as it did last week.However, Trump’s team is expecting to reach an agreement to settle the North Korean nuclear and other issues in the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Strong growth in BD Medical was primarily driven by Medication Delivery Solutions, Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units. Meanwhile, the acquisition of C.R.

Ecolab operates in highly competitive markets, which might mar prospects over the long haul.We believe that volatility in foreign currency exchange rates will remain a significant headwind for the company. Ecolab faces pricing pressure in the Energy segment which is likely to hurt profits.On the brighter side, a strong guidance instills optimism on the stock. Further, Europe, North America and Latin America led the Global Industrial regional growth in the quarter. Strength in the Global Institutional segment led by growth in the Specialty and Healthcare business lines is also a positive.

Strong year-over year growth in organic revenues is encouraging.The stellar performance was driven by strong sales at the CAG business. In the fourth quarter, CAG organic revenues rose low double digits on strong CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth and VetLab consumables organic revenue growth. We are upbeat about the company’s expanding premium instrument base in the United States and international markets, including growth in competitive instrument placements, increasing utilization and continued customer retention.In this regard, we are optimistic about gains from the commercial launch of Catalyst SDMA Test in North America in January. With this, the company’s point-of-care customers will be able to add SDMA as an essential element to the routine chemistry panel.

Earnings rose 4.5% year over year. Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, divestiture-related items and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of a penny, adjusted EPS was $1.18.Without these adjustments, the company’s reported a net loss of $1.03 per share, compared to 59 cents in the previous year. This included a $2.2-billion net tax expense related to the U.S. tax reform.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.37 billion, up 7% on a constant exchange rate or CER basis (up 1.2% on a reported basis). The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.20 billion. Foreign currency fluctuation favorably impacted Medtronic’s third-quarter revenues by $177 million.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (53.1% of total revenues) fell 4.9% year over year (up 6% at CER) to $3.91 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.36 billion (32% of total revenues), reflecting a 5% increase at CER (up 7.8% as reported). Emerging market revenues (14.9% of total revenues) amounted to $1.10 billion, up 12% at CER (up 11.8% as reported).Medtronic plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Medtronic plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic plc Quote Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 7% at CER (up 10% as reported) to $2.80 billion, driven by strong, balanced growth across all three divisions.CRHF sales totaled $1.46 billion, up 4% year over year at CER (up 6% as reported). This came on the back of growth in Arrhythmia Management led by high-teens growth in atrial fibrillation Solutions at CER, amplified penetration of the Micra transcatheter pacing system, and strong uptake of the TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope. This apart, strong demand for the company's suite of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-P) along with growth in Mechanical Circulatory Support drove Heart Failure division revenues.CSH revenues were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) to $886 million on the back of low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 5% growth at CER (up 7% as reported) to $457 million, driven by continued adoption of the Valiant Captiviathoracic stent graft systems. Peripheral was driven by double-digit growth in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and drug-coated balloons. Moreover, solid contributions from VenaSeal closure system drove high-single digit growth in endoVenous.In MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.04 billion, marking a 6% year-over-year increase at CER (down 16% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at CER.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $1.94 billion were up 5% year over year at CER (up 7% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and high-single digit growth in Pain Therapies, at CER. However, revenues from the Spine business remained flat at CER on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 13% at CER (17% as reported) to $584 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 140 basis points (bps) to 70.3% on a 3.3% rise in gross profit to $5.18 billion. Adjusted operating margin expanded 10 bps year over year to 28.9% owing to a 5.3% rise in research and development expenses (to $558 million) along with a 4.6% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.49 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $140 million as compared with $46 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceMedtronic reiterated its fiscal 2018 constant-currency revenue and EPS guidance. The company maintains full-year revenue growth projection at the range of 4-5% at CER. However, the company revised its foreign currency fluctuation estimation, which is now projected to have a positive $480-$500 million impact on fiscal results compared with $275-$375 million estimated earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues remains at $29.50 billion.Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share growth is still expected in the range of 9-10% at CER. Currency translation is likely to have an adverse impact of 4 cents compared with the earlier expectation of a negative effect of 2 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is pegged at $4.76.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Medtronic expects currency translation to have a favorable impact of $300-$320 million on revenues. Currency translation is expected affect fourth-quarter earnings per share by 2 cents.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal third quarter on a solid note. The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments. However, escalating costs continue to be a concern.Moreover, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Moreover, the company’s recent receipt of FDA approval for the Riptide Aspiration System under the Neurovascular unit within the RTG business buoys optimism. This adds a valuable tool to the company’s Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) product portfolio.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

Revenues came in at $3.08 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $3.05 billion, showing a 5.4% rise from the year-ago quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.61, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.5%. The same for revenues is pinned at $4.12 million, indicating 38.7% growth.BD delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2% for the trailing four quarters.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS Surprise Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteLet’s delve deeper.BD Medical: A Key Growth DriverIn the last reported quarter, BD Medical accounted for a whopping 66.2% of the company’s total revenues. Revenues in the segment rose 1.9% to $2.04 billion at cc on a year-over-year basis. Per management, this includes a headwind of approximately 170 basis points (bps) from the US dispensing change. Furthermore, the added legacy of C.R. Bard has led to accelerated growth in the segment.It is also encouraging to note that for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment is at $2.13 billion, up 4.6% sequentially.Medication and Procedural Solutions or MPS revenues grew 5% in the first quarter. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $936 million, up 1.2% sequentially. Growth is likely to be driven by continued strength in the pre-filled flush devices, infection prevention and surgical products.Diabetes Care revenues grew 2.2% on growth in pen needles. Yet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pinned at $262 million, down 5.4% sequentially.At Pharmaceutical Systems, revenues grew 3.7% in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is $343 million, showing a 40% rise sequentially.Revenues at Medication Management Solutions or MMS declined 3.4%, although, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $581 million, up 23.4% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayView SolidBD expects fiscal 2018 revenue growth in the range of 30-31% on a reported basis.

Life Sciences segment is expected to rise 4.5% to 5.5%, while growth in the new BD Interventional segment is anticipated between 5.5% and 6.5%.Acquisitions & DivestituresBD’s acquisition-driven strategy has been instrumental in driving growth. Recently, BD acquired C.R. Bard and per management, BD is on its way to become one of the biggest medical technology devices companies in the world with approximately $16 billion in annualized revenues. The closure of the takeover will lead to a third and new business segment — BD Interventional. BD’s collaborative moves with Fresenius Medical Care to provide sodium chloride saline to customers are also worth a mention.Last year, BD announced that Merit Medical Systems has signed an agreement to acquire certain assets of the company.BD Life SciencesRevenues from BD Life Sciences totaled $1.05 billion in the fiscal first quarter, up 7.3% at cc from a year ago. The segment's performance was backed by strong numbers across the Biosciences, Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems units. The segment also saw solid growth outside the United States.Recently, BD announced pre-market approval from the FDA for the BD Onclarity HPV assay. Per management, this is likely to boost the BD Diagnostics Systems.The segment’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter, is pinned at $1.06 billion, up 1% sequentially.Our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for BD this quarter.

153,BDX,"The trade war cacophony has spread far and wide, not sparing the investment world. The conflict between two of the world’s biggest economies has led Dow to fall more than 1,100 point in just two days last week. Although it is gradually recovering, the market is still fraught with possibilities of other outbreaks.The 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors which might face the brunt of the trade dispute.Current ScenarioUnlike what most economists had initially expected, China is fast adopting stances to square off America’s advantage points in this import tariff game.In response to Trump’s proposed imposition of $60 billion in annual tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing has announced the initial $3 billion of reciprocal tariff on 128 (roughly) imports from the United States and is supposedly preparing a bolder counter-attack.In the wake of the tariff threats, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller has warned of an impending economic crisis.Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report states that the United States will maintain a lead in the trade conflicts with China. This is because the United States, to some extent, is a monopsony market with a large number of buyers. Thus, if the nation stops purchasing Chinese products, China will not be able to channelize that surplus to Canada or Indonesia at the same price. However, China will not be able to adopt a tit-for-tat strategy as it does not import on the same scale from the United States.Accordingly, following last week’s crash, the market is slowly looking up. The news that the nations are likely to resolve the issue mutually is fuelling the recovery. However, whether the talks will extinguish the possibilities of a trade war completely is yet to be seen. Meanwhile, investors are caught in the “America First” and “Made in China 2025” web.Is Medical Device Caught in the Storm?As stated earlier, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has identified healthcare as one of the 10 sectors which are subjected to the $60 billion U.S. tariff. More specifically, Trump has considered biomedicine and high-performance medical devices, which include China’s advanced chemicals and medical equipment, respectively.Needless to say, this has triggered a decline in the sector. Following the news and with chances of China’s retaliation, losses were widespread in the Medical device sector with bigwigs taking severe blows. We note that, the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations.Going by a Market Realist report, companies like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), Abbott and others saw considerable weakness on Mar 23 as talks of a U.S.-China trade war started doing the rounds.Although these stocks are gradually reviving on rising chances of the two nations negotiating certain terms, investors consider them still extremely vulnerable and widely exposed to the trade conflict given their huge business network in Mainland China.We have shortlisted three stocks that are facing the brunt of the tumultuous market conditions.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) lost 6.5% on Mar 23. We note that, the company has been investing heavily to cash in on the Chinese Reconstructive and Trauma markets. Strategic investments in these regions over the past several quarters to improve operational and sales performance are yielding results. In the fourth quarter, the company witnessed improvement in its Asia Pacific business on solid distributor orders. China particularly demonstrated strong growth. Thus, any form of retaliation by China will impact the company.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price  Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteMedtronic: In the last reported quarter, Medtronic’s businesses in China showed strength, growing double digits. According to the company, within the next decade, China is expected to be its biggest health care market. Needless to say, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expending large amounts of cash to strengthen its business in this market. The company is focused on developing public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Medtronic PLC Price  Medtronic PLC Price | Medtronic PLC QuoteOver the last few years, Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has been leading the emerging market investment trend, with about 50% of total sales coming from this region. This Zacks Rank #3 stock’s core Established Pharmaceuticals Division (""EPD"") business operates solely in emerging geographies, with leading positions in Chinese pharmaceutical markets for branded generics. In the last reported quarter as well, China demonstrated double-digit growth in EPD. Trade war or not, these stocks are in an extremely vulnerable position with a broad network and diversified business base in China.Abbott Laboratories Price  Abbott Laboratories Price | Abbott Laboratories QuoteBreaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks’ has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks>>

154,BDX,"Going by the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, more than 100 million U.S. adults are living with diabetes or prediabetic condition. Notably, this is gradually taking the shape of a deadly epidemic.Diabetes rates in the United States have moved up from 5.5% in 1994 to 9.3% in 2012. Furthermore, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2016, resulting in approximately $245 billion of medical costs and reduced productivity every year (per an article by The State of Obesity).Globally, the scenario is quite intriguing. Per a Global Report on Diabetes by World Health Organization, prevalence of diabetes in adults rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Moreover, worldwide expenses related to diabetes were around $850 billion in 2017 (per the International Diabetes Foundation).Notably, projections related to the disease hint at the continuation of the present trend. In this regard, the number of patients aged 18-99 years and diagnosed with diabetes is expected to rise to 693 million by 2045 from 451 million in 2017 (per the International Diabetes Foundation).It goes without saying that the rising incidence of diabetes has opened up opportunities for diabetes device makers. The market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.4% to reach a worth of $7.35 billion between 2016 and 2021 (per a report by Mordor Intelligence). Globally, the market is expected to value $66,053.1 million, at a CAGR of 6.7% between 2016 and 2025 (per a Transparency Market Research report).Thus, for investors who are keen on placing a bet on the healthcare space for long-term gains, the diabetes devices market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Factors Driving Diabetes Devices MarketRising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The diabetes devices market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for diabetes care devices. A report by Cision puts more light on this. Per the report, the demand for insulin delivery and blood glucose monitoring devices have been rising in the highly-populated countries — China and India. According to the International Diabetes Federation, China recorded the highest number at around 96.2 million diabetic patients in 2014 followed by 66.8 million in India.AI Shapes Diabetes Devices MarketCognitive Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been transforming the way diabetes is managed throughout the world. Hi-tech medical devices and analytical predictive-diagnostics tools are helping create customized programs that support blood glucose management and improved medication adherence.Going by a report by Statista, worldwide revenues from eHealth solutions for diabetes are expected at $1.01 billion in 2018. Furthermore, the market is expected to see a CAGR of 29.8% between 2018 and 2020. According to the report, growing demand and increased availability of connected medical devices for in-home usages, apps for smartphones to aid self-management and telemedical services along with service-oriented apps have been stimulating growth in this niche market.In view of the above-mentioned factors, a number of bigwigs have been expending lump sum amounts on R&D to continuously innovate and develop devices with improved efficacy and no side effects.For instance, back in 2016, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter’s machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed.  In 2017, the companies jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Medtronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.In line with the developments in the diabetes business, in February 2018, Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) announced the availability of FreeStyle LibreLink app in Europe for use in smartphones (both iPhone and Android). We encouragingly note that, Abbott is planning for a mobile app solution for FreeStyle Libre users outside Europe, based on in-country regulatory approval.Moreover, Boston, Taipei, Hong Kong and Bangalore-based company DIABNEXT has developed a Diabetes AI that provides personalized metric analysis and decision-making tools for physicians and patients to improvise pre-diabetes and diabetes management.3 Stocks to Bet OnWe have selected three companies, which we believe can tap into the promising prospects of the diabetes devices market.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report): The company has a strong presence in the diabetes care market with a global market share of 27%.

155,BDX,"Integrating medical care and pharmacy benefits under one roof, Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report), a global health insurance company. The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. Post the acquisition, the combined company will invest $200 million in its charitable foundation to support the communities in which it operates.Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts. Express Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefits manager.Express Scripts sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Express Scripts’ stock has outperformed the industry in the past year. Specifically, the company’s shares have gained 19.7% compared with the industry's rally of 13.8%.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.The transaction will result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after closure. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021. The latest acquisition has been undertaken solely to enhance customer base and improve ‘Patient-Provider Alignment’.Express Scripts Holding Company Price  Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteU.S. Healthcare Leads the M&A GameMergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been the key driver of the U.S. healthcare space, lately. Glancing through the major acquisitions of the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard, and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Actelion deserve a mention.In fact, health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. Notably, the latest buyout of Express Scripts comes just three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to take over the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna.Coming to the post-acquisition impacts, we believe that the latest development will pose a big threat to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), the largest U.S. health insurer, with its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS Health after it completes the merger with Aetna.The move is also expected to nullify threats from Amazon.com Inc., which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. Recently, the e-commerce giant announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to curb medical costs for their employees.What are the Moody’s Ratings for Express Scripts?Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody’s Corporation, placed the Baa2 senior unsecured long-term ratings to Express Scripts. Notably, obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate-credit risk. However, the latest rating has been kept under review with a tag of ‘direction uncertain’ by Moody’s.Moody’s has not rated Express Scripts with high-credit risk because of its solid position as a leading pharmacy benefit manager, moderate leverage and strong cash flow.However, Moody’s is worried about Express Scripts’ high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Further, the company’s ongoing dispute with Anthem, Inc — its largest customer — is a concern.Per Moody’s, Express Scripts experienced declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

156,BDX,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has taken center stage, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers. The season has turned out to be favorable so far, especially on the revenue front. A sturdy revenue momentum was witnessed in the season, above-average proportion of positive surprises along with favorable revisions trend for the present and the upcoming quarters.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported their results, are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. Of the total companies, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to fare impressively. For the fourth quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 6.6% on 5.7% revenue growth. Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of Medical Product companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q4Tax BenefitsAs part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%, providing a huge relief for all sectors. Needless to say, the medical device companies cheered the legislation as well.Further, the news of Congress delaying the 2.3% medical-device tax for another two years was a huge boost for industry players and investors. Manufacturers appreciate the delay as it is likely to favor the companies’ R&D activities.Favorable Consumer BehaviorDespite political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at four major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Feb 6:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.05 billion, up 4.2% year over year.

157,BDX,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of CE Mark for its self-expanding CENTERA valve. The valve is used for severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at high risk of open-heart surgery. However, the CENTERA valve is not approved for commercial sale in the United States.Per the company, the Edwards CENTERA valve is repositionable and retrievable and can be delivered through a low-profile, 14-French, motorized delivery system.The CE Mark was based on the CENTERA-EU Trial results, which were presented at EuroPCR 2017. This study enrolled 203 high-risk patients at 23 centers in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The outcome of the trial demonstrated high survival rates (99%) and low rates of disabling stroke (2.5%) and new permanent pacemaker (4.9%) at 30 days.  The regulatory approval is likely to boost the company's Transcatheter Heart Valves (THV) segment precisely.THV in FocusTHV segment includes technologies designed to treat heart valve diseases using catheter-based approaches as opposed to open surgical techniques. In the fourth quarter, the company reported THV sales growth of 20.2% over the prior-year quarter, with double-digit procedure growth in Europe.

158,BDX,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has presented positive data from an at-home pediatric study on patients aged between seven and 13 years. Notably, the data is based on MiniMed 670G system and was demonstrated at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes’ 11th International Conference in Vienna, Austria.Study Results in DetailThe multi-center study had enrolled 105 participants within the 7-13 years’ age group. The trial consisted of a two-week run-in phase along with a study phase of three months. 97% of the participants chose to continue using the system as part of a Continued Access Program. Moreover, the study results demonstrated data from the pivotal trial of MiniMed 670G system on patients aged 14 years and above.Using the study results, the company has applied for an expanded FDA approval to include the patients ranging from seven to 13 years as eligible for using the MiniMed 670G system. At the same time, the company is working to expand the usage of the product on children aged between two and six years. Hopes are harbored on the effectiveness of this system, which should get greater customer adoptability over time.MiniMed 670G at a GlancePost the receipt of the FDA approval in 2016, Medtronic had commercially launched the MiniMed 670G system in June 2017. It is a Hybrid Closed Loop insulin delivery system for Type I diabetic patients aged 14 years or older. The MiniMed 670G system features Medtronic’s latest Guardian Sensor 3, a glucose sensor with increased accuracy and enhanced performance. This is the only FDA approved sensor to control a hybrid closed loop system including diagnostic technology that continuously checks sensor health. The system also carries Medtronic’s most advanced algorithm known as, SmartGuard HCL technology.Developments in Diabetes BusinessMedtronic witnessed sluggish growth in Diabetes business last quarter. However, the company gained on a strong uptake of new sensor-augmented insulin pump systems in the United States as well as in the international markets. This growth was temporarily offset by a limited supply of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors. Moreover, a strong customer enrollment under the Priority Access Program briefly affected revenues.Per management, the diabetes business should witness revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as the company has finished shipping pumps for the Priority Access Program. Also, the company is moving steadily with its sensor capacity expansion plans, scheduled to be completed in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Additionally, Medtronic geared up for the international launch of the MiniMed 670G and the U.S. launch of CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ in late 2018 and its new professional CGM iPro 3 in 2019. In this regard, the company also announced favorable results supporting the use of CGM on people with type 2 diabetes in October 2017.This apart, we are upbeat about Animas Corporation’s (one of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Care Companies) exit from the insulin pump business with Medtronic as partner to support a smooth transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Notably, patients using an Animas insulin pump will be offered the choice to switch to a Medtronic pump.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and a rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth in the diabetes market. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the latest positive study results have come at an opportune moment.Share Price MovementMedtronic has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 4.7% in comparison to the broader industry’s 1.8% increase.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

164,BDX,"On Feb 16, we issued an updated research report on Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Salt Lake City, UT-based molecular diagnostics provider has been outperforming the broader industry over the past six months. The company has rallied 13.3%, against the industry’s 1% decline. Myriad Genetics exited the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a promising note. The company particularly observed strong growth in GeneSight testing revenues.  The company’s molecular-diagnostics portfolio has been gaining prominence in the MedTech space of late. We are particularly upbeat about the newly-launched range of products. Myriad Genetics has been recording strong volumes of EndoPredict and GeneSight tests. In the Prolaris testing space, volumes continued to grow double-digits in the fiscal second quarter.In particular, Myriad Genetics was focused on driving revenues by commercializing its innovative products, including Vectra DA, Prolaris, myPath Melanoma, Myriad Genetics’s Companion Diagnostics, EndoPredict and myPlan Lung Cancer Test. Earlier, management expected each of the products to generate revenues of more than $50 million by fiscal 2020.Moreover, Myriad Genetics has been consistently gaining reimbursement approvals. During the reported quarter, the company announced the finalization of LCD from Noridian for EndoPredict, thereby expanding the total coverage to around 90% of the U.S. market. Also, the Prolaris test is under evaluation for revised NCCN guidelines and has been covered by Medicare for patients at intermediate risk.  Also, in order to gain reimbursement coverage in Vectra DA and GeneSight testing platforms, the company has been undertaking certain measures.Furthermore, the raised FY18 guidance instills confidence. We are upbeat about growth in new product volumes, an expanded reimbursement for new products and an increase in international RNA kit revenues. Meanwhile, Myriad Genetics faces competition in the key BRACAnalysis market. The company expects competition to intensify owing to advancement of technology. We believe competitive headwinds might reduce prices of expensive tests provided by the company. This might impede margin improvement as well.Moreover, as the company receives a considerable portion of its revenues and pays a portion of its expenses in foreign currencies, it is at risk of exchange rate fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

However, we are upbeat about the company’s Animal Health segment that has been performing well lately. The company provides a wide range of consumable supplies, equipment, software and value-added services. The company’s broad spectrum of products cushions it against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe a diversified product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key growth catalysts.On the flip side, a downbeat guidance indicates looming concerns ahead.  Decreasing revenues in the dental segment is another headwind. The recent decline in the segment is driven by decreased sales of CEREC and digital technology products. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018.Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

170,BDX,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has recently entered into an agreement with In Vitro Diagnostics technologies player, Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report). Per the terms of the deal, the former will have exclusive worldwide commercialization rights over Surmodics' SurVeil drug-coated balloon. The deal remains aligned with Abbott’s focus to expand its broad line of vascular care products.Notably, the SurVeil drug-coated balloon by Surmodics is used to treat the superficial femoral artery and is under evaluation in a U.S. pivotal clinical trial. Significantly, this new-generation device is likely to complement and extend the company’s vascular devices portfolio including stents and vessel closure devices for addressing peripheral artery disease (PAD).Per the American Heart Association, PAD is the narrowing of arteries causing reduced blood flow to the legs, stomach, arms and head. According to Abbott, this condition is often underdiagnosed leading to other serious vascular conditions. In this regard, drug-coated balloons have emerged an important treatment option for the treatment of PAD.Globally, over 200 million people are affected with PAD while 12-20% of Americans alone aged above 60 years are suffering from the disease. Undoubtedly, the market for the therapies related to this indication looks lucrative.Per Abbott, the SurVeil drug-coated balloon holds greater promises in capturing the market compared with traditional devices. This is because it includes a proprietary drug-excipient formulation for a durable balloon coating and is manufactured using an innovative process to improve coating uniformity.Pre-clinical data for SurVeil has shown a three- to five-times higher target tissue drug concentration, a more evenly distributed and durable drug effect, and lower incidence of downstream drug particles in comparison to the control drug-coated balloon.Accordingly, the Surmodics deal seems highly strategic from Abbott’s point of view in monopolizing the huge and growing market for PAD-regulating drug-coated balloons.Apart from SurVeil-related pact, Abbott has choices to negotiate agreements for Surmodics' below-the-knee and arteriovenous fistula drug-coated balloon products, currently in pre-clinical development.Per data by ReportsnReports, the global market for peripheral vascular interventions including lower extremity stents, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloons, PTA drug-eluting balloons, carotid stents and renal stents is estimated to rise from $2.1 billion in 2015 to $3.4 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 6.8%.Two major players in the drug coated balloons market are Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quality Systems, Inc. QuoteQuarter HighlightsEagleDream Acquisition: A Major PositiveRecently, Quality Systems acquired EagleDream, a software analytics solutions company. It was incorporated in the company’s operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. During the quarter, the company closed 10 deals across a broad product spectrum of accounts, both by specialty and geography. It has also led to a swift uptake in interest from the company’s user base around EagleDream. Thus, Quality Systems witnesses deal flow and significant interest from the integration of EagleDream.Bookings StrengthenA sequential 17% increase in bookings majorly drove sales in the reported quarter, which amounted to 30.5 million.Interoperability FrameworkThe company’s framework is suitable for its software to exchange and make use of the information. Per management, the company had more than 100 clients integrated into the national care quality framework for interoperability, as of Dec 31. Further, more clients are being added each month post the upgrade. It ensures that patient data is transportable not just within the company database, but also across the industry.Margin DetailsGross profit for the third quarter totaled $70.1 billion and gross margin is at 53.2%. Gross margin declined 429 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The decline is mainly due to a general shift to lower margin subscription revenues.RCM margins are too compressed as the company invested for future efficiencies and witnessed some headwinds this quarter from personnel expenses.Operating expenses surged due to investment in sale and marketing as well as acquisitions, partially.Financial ConditionThe company exited the third quarter with 23.4 million in cash and equivalents and 39 million in outstanding against revolving credit agreement at the end of the quarter. Quality Systems continues to be well positioned in terms of financial flexibility with 189 million available in total liquidity.FY18 ViewFor fiscal 2018, the company reiterated revenue outlook at the range of $522-$530 million. The company reiterated its adjusted earnings per share at the range of 64-68 cents.Our TakeQuality Systems exited the third quarter of fiscal 2018 with a lukewarm performance in earnings, while revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Solid revenue growth and segmental support buoys optimism. Revenues benefited from EagleDream software platform, which has been enjoying favorable market response since its integration in the reported quarter.On the flip side, declining revenues in the Software and Hardware Related segment are a concern. Operating expenses are also high due to acquisition-driven costs. Continued acquisition poses integration risks for the acquiring company.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Quality Systems has underperformed with respect to the industry.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksQuality Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks in the broader medical space are Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), BIOVERATIV  and Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report).

172,BDX,"Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2017 results, scheduled for release on Feb 6, are expected to show sluggishness in BD Medical — one of the major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings in the first quarter, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments will help the company generate solid results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BD Medical revenues is pegged at $2.03 billion for the first quarter. This indicates a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, Becton, Dickinson, also known as BD, delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 3.8%. Like the previous quarter, management expects strong numbers in the Biosciences, Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems units.Major Factors at PlayDull Prospects in BD Life Sciences: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the BD Life Sciences segment is pegged at $1.01 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. In fact, the Biosciences and Diagnostics segments are expected to decline 8.3% and 1.7% respectively on a year-over-year basis. Lower reimbursements for medical products and services have been imposing a downward pressure on the prices of products. Further, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies are also expected to affect BD’s top line.Foreign Exchange Woes: BD generates more than half of its revenues from international operations (more than 50% in fiscal 2017), which is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, domestic manufacturers such as BD are being hurt by strong U.S. dollar, which has benefited from more upbeat economic prospects compared with the rest of the world. Currency volatility will continue to be a headwind in first-quarter of fiscal 2018.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for BD. The company’s momentum in China and the emerging markets have been already reflected in the previously-reported quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, BD’s strategic transformation of the U.S. dispensing business model has been successfully implemented. Further, the company’s strategy for end-to-end medication management is gaining prominence.Northward Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the first quarter is $3.04 billion, which grew 4.2% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the first quarter is pegged at $10.87, which improved 14.7% year over year.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteHowever, BD does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BD is -0.50%, as the Most Accurate estimate is $2.37 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat this season.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank Stocks Here.Luminex (LMNX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.75% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Notably, rise in pricing pressure and product mix had offset case volume growth of around 5%.Revenues from U.S. Surgical Support business declined around 10% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to weakness in the biologics portfolio along with persistent sluggishness in the U.S. service business case volume growth.However, the international business recorded 34% growth at CER or 35% on a reported basis for the fifth consecutive time on solid contributions from key geographies.In the reported quarter, there was a 12.7% increase in cost of goods sold after excluding amortization of intangible assets expenses.

The company is set to complete the $24-billion cash-and-stock deal.Favorable tidings on the regulatory front have accelerated the deal’s progress. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission gave its approval for the acquisition. However, the acquisition is a subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.Formation of BD Interventional: A New SegmentAfter the completion of the deal, Becton, Dickinson will establish a third business segment — BD Interventional. Notably, Bard will be integrated in this vertical. Becton, Dickinson is already a leading player in interventional specialties solutions. The company promotes positive clinical outcomes using minimally invasive and percutaneous techniques for obtaining samples of liver, breast, lung and kidney biopsy. Further, the company provides facilities for peritoneal drainage at home.In April 2017, Becton, Dickinson signed the agreement.

The strategic acquisition is expected to generate benefits from complementary businesses and geographical expansion.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price Becton, Dickinson and Company Price | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Moody's Not HappyMoody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of  Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), downgraded Becton, Dickinson's senior unsecured notes to Ba1 (LGD 4) from Baa2 and its commercial paper rating to ‘Not Prime’ from Prime-2. The lackluster rating reflects Becton, Dickinson's aggressive acquisition strategy. In this regard, the company’s latest deal to acquire Bard has been signed just two years after the $12.5-billion CareFusion buyout.Per Moody’s, the acquisition is likely to almost double Becton, Dickinson's debt load (including assumed debt issued by Bard). Further, the company’s pro-forma leverage (debt/EBITDA) will increase almost five times after the closure of the deal, indicating looming concerns for the stock.Although, Becton, Dickinson expects to reduce debt/EBITDA ratio below three times within three years of closing, Moody’s believes this is unlikely to happen.On a positive note, Moody's believes that the company's cost-saving targets are achievable. In this regard, Becton, Dickinson expects $300 million of cost savings by fiscal 2020. Moody's also expects Becton, Dickinson to make use of free cash flow for debt reduction.What’s in the Cards Post Deal Closure?Becton, Dickinson announced that it will divest soft tissue core needle biopsy products and Bard's Aspira product line of tunneled home drainage catheters and accessories for $100 million to Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

184,BDX,"GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report) has been dominating the headlines on announcements of plans to strike a couple of deals with China’s leading pharmaceutical company — Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co., Ltd (“Hayao”). Notably, the company intends to enter a strategic partnership and China joint venture agreement with Hayao.Under the terms of the equity investment agreement, Hayao will invest in around $300-million in cash or in kind in GNC Holdings.Following the closing of the transaction, Hayao will own around 40% of GNC Holdings on a converted basis.

Interestingly, GNC Holdings aims to extend the maturity date of the term loan facility by two years, to March 2021 and issue a $275-million ABL Term Loan as part of the planned maturity extension.International Business — A Key Growth DriverNotably, GNC Holdings’ international business has been a key growth driver for the company in recent years. Of late, the company has been seeing solid growth in China.  Furthermore, over the recent past, the company has witnessed improvement in trends in Mexico, South Korea and Hong Kong. We believe successful completion and execution of these agreements will significantly drive top-line contributions from China.Market PotentialPer a report by Grand View Research, the global market for dietary supplements is expected to see a CAGR of 9.5% between 2016 and 2024. The report further states that usage of the supplements in treating cardiovascular diseases and malnutrition will continue to boost demand.

Performance in the segment is affected by sluggishness in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units in the United States.Within the Diabetes Care unit, BD temporarily has paused shipments of insulin infusion sets, thanks to higher-than-anticipated rate of complaints associated with insertion during the pilot launch of the product. However, management conducted a clinical trial to gather insights and ensure that patients ultimately realize the full benefits of BD FlowSmart technology. BD continues to collaborate with Medtronic Plc (MDT  -  Free Report) toward full commercialization of the productAdding to woes, the ongoing political conundrum pertaining to the repealing of Obamacare by the Republicans has given rise to uncertainties for dental stocks like BD and CONMED Corporation.

Notably, earnings improved from 49 cents in the year-ago quarter. The company reported net revenues of $1.260 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.226 billion. Meanwhile, revenues rose from $1.138 billion in the year-ago period.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Cerner is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cerner is +1.75% as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 58 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 57 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Cerner currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cerner’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise this season.Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cerner Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderView Upbeat: We believe Cerner’s strong sales performance, solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it for stellar growth. For second-quarter 2017, the company forecasts revenues between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents per share. For full-year 2017, management expects revenues between $5.100 billion and $5.300 billion. Cerner currently forecasts 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $2.44 and $2.56 per share.Development of Electronic Health Records System: Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February.This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.Stable Estimate Revision Trend: For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is stable at 57 cents over the same time frame.Robust Portfolio: We believe that Cerner’s strong product portfolio will help boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Furthermore, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory space.Solid Global Foothold: Cerner is one of the largest pure-play HCIT companies and its wide footprint, large reference-able client base and composite array of solutions make it an ideal candidate for investors seeking an exposure to the HCIT industry. Cerner offers an exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company has won contracts in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East. The company has also been working with client organizations globally, to a focus on its population health management profile.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

198,BDX,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3.Last quarter, this renowned healthcare products and service distributor delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.0%. Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.81%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHenry Schein’s first-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments – Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in both North America and overseas markets. We expect a similar trend in the second quarter as well.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteNotably, during the to-be-reported second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighbourhood. This has enabled the company to be a complete solutions provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. In this regard, we note that management expects at least mid-single digit growth in North America’s dental equipment market in the second quarter. The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is thus busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s year-over-year deterioration in gross and operating margin over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.Meanwhile, per management, solid sales in the second quarter are likely to be partially offset by the timing of Good Friday this year. Notably, this international holiday has fallen in the second quarter this year as compared to last year’s timing which was in the first quarter.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to our woes. Also, advent of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the U.S. adds to the competitiveness in the market.Overall, the company’s reaffirmed its 2017 EPS guidance, reflecting growth of 16–18% from the year-ago period.For the second quarter of 2017, there has been no change in estimate revision over the last 30 days. The same has been observed in the magnitude of estimate revision, with earnings estimates remaining at $1.73 over the same time frame.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Henry Schein this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.73. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

199,BDX,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a leading provider of tools and integrated systems for analysis of genetic variation and function, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, Illumina’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, at an average of 8.56%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the last reported first quarter of 2017, Illumina witnessed robust revenue growth on account of consistent improvement in sequencing consumables and strong demand of microarrays. While management is still emphasizing on its portfolio of sequencing platforms to fortify its market position, we expect the company to maintain top-line growth in the second quarter of 2017.Per management, top-line growth in the first quarter can also be attributed to strong uptake of the NovaSeq platform with more than 135 orders placed in this period.Moreover, with an active HiSeq customer base of roughly 800 customers, the company expects the replacement of older generation instruments by NovaSeq trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. QuoteFurther, the company recently launched VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe, a CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing based approach to noninvasive prenatal testing. Notably, outside the U.S., the rate of NIPT adoption is increasing. The Netherlands and Denmark began covering the test in the first quarter and the same is expected shortly in France. The company continues to see positive reimbursement trends in Europe as well. Also, Illumina has been forging ahead with its NIPT expansion plans in China.We believe these developments will boost the company’s top line in the upcoming quarter.On the flip side, weak margins owing to the introduction of NovaSeq, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents for the company. Also, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Overall, for the second quarter of 2017, Illumina projects revenue growth of approximately 7%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $642.5 million. The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of 65–70 cents. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is stable at 68 cents, within the guided range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Illumina is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Illumina has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

200,BDX,"Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report), a leading player in the medical technology space, is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27 after the bell.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $1.48 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Notably, on an average, Stryker beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 2.08% over the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Stryker is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Stryker’s Earnings ESP is +0.66% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.52 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Stryker currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Stryker’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a beat.Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayFor the second quarter of 2017, Stryker expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.48–$1.52. Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5% to 9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.For the full year, the company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $6.35 to $6.45. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for full-year 2017. The tie-up with Indo UK Institute of Health’s Medicity Program is an important factor as well. Notably, this is a 20-year partnership that aims to offer primary joint replacements (orthopedic areas of hip, knee and trauma products) and healthcare services in India at low costs.The company’s estimate revision trend is encouraging. For the current quarter, Stryker saw two upward estimate movements with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month. Current quarter estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.51.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are three companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

201,BDX,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, after markets close on Aug 1.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.4%. The four-quarter average earnings beat is 1.0%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayManagement expects SG&A expenses margin in the band of 26%–27% in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, while it was 26.8% in third-quarter 2017. Also, R&D expenses margin is projected at 7% for fourth-quarter 2017 as compared to 6.8% of the preceding quarter.  Hence, we expect the bottom-line drag to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from international markets. Notably, in the last reported quarter, currency impacted ResMed’s combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues by 3%. This is likely to dent results in the fourth quarter as well.Moreover, overall macroeconomic uncertainty is a major obstacle when it comes to the company’s international operations.Also, the market for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) products is highly competitive with respect to product price, features and reliability. Other challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement pressure continue to hurt the stock.On the brighter side, an expanding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) market is a huge opportunity for ResMed. In line with this, the company released positive data pertaining to a clinical trial related to its Home Oxygen Therapy - Home Mechanical Ventilation (HOT-HMV). The results demonstrated that COPD patients who received non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at home with oxygen therapy had a 51% decreased risk of re-hospitalization or death, and stayed out of the hospital more than three times longer, compared to those who received oxygen alone. The company’s current endeavors to gain traction in the COPD market are expected to boost revenues.Further, as a major breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea, ResMed introduced AirTouch F20 full face mask with UltraSoft memory foam, which keeps patients on CPAP therapy comfortable throughout the night. AirTouch F20 is available in the U.S. and Canada now which is expected to drive the company’s top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.ResMed’s efforts to expand its business internationally are encouraging.The company’s revenue performance across all segments in the reported third quarter of 2017 was impressive. We expect the company to maintain a similar trend in this quarter.ResMed’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, the company saw one estimate move north with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month. This has taken the current year estimate from $2.79 to $2.80 over the same period.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for ResMed this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

203,BDX,"McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), one of the largest healthcare service providers, is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 27.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $3.39 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04. Also, in the last four quarters, McKesson earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate at an average of 3.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  McKesson has an Earnings ESP of +2.15% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.85 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.79. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: McKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of McKesson’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.15% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market. Management expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in fiscal 2017 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. Also, McKesson expects earnings per share in the range of $11.75 to $12.45 for fiscal 2018. Distribution Solutions business revenue growth is expected to increase mid-single digits year over year. Keeping in mind the last quarter performance and promising guidance, we expect a similar trend in the yet-to-be reported quarter.McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteFurthermore, McKesson is likely to benefit from the acquisition of CoverMyMeds LLC in the quarter to be reported. In this regard, we note that the acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.In the international segment, management expects percentage revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in 2018.  Per management, international business is likely to be impacted by additional U.K. reimbursement cuts although the incremental cuts that will impact fiscal 2018 are significantly smaller than those in fiscal 2017.However, continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs, significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches might have an adverse impact on McKesson.

204,BDX,"On Feb 26, we issued an updated research report on STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report). The company has been actively trying to expand into adjacent markets and strengthen core business through acquisitions and dilutions. However, the company operates in a tough competitive landscape, which is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This developer, manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction, and surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services has outperformed the industry over the past year. The stock has gained 31.5% compared with the industry’s 16.5% rally.STERIS exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 on a mixed note, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. We are encouraged by the favorable underlying market trends along with the new product and service offerings. The company’s organic growth was strong across specialty services, life sciences and applied sterilization segments.We are particularly upbeat about STERIS’ six acquisitions in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Through these buyouts, the company aims to strengthen the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services and the Applied Sterilization Technologies businesses. Furthermore, financed with both cash on hand and credit facility borrowings, the company had to incur acquisition cost of around $51.6 million, net of cash acquired and including potential contingent consideration of $5.3 million.We believe STERIS can pursue back-to-back acquisitions in the long run in order to expand business and customer base, courtesy of its strong financial position.We are also encouraged by the company’s recent organizational changes to serve customers in a better way. We also expect this move to enhance the company’s cost structure. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Meanwhile, STERIS competes for pharmaceutical, research and industrial customers against several large companies that have extensive product portfolios and global reach, as well as a number of small companies with limited product offerings and operations in one or a few countries.The company expects to face intense competition as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. This might hamper STERIS’ growth considerably.Moreover, a number of STERIS’ customers are undergoing consolidation, partly due to healthcare cost reduction measures initiated by competitive pressure as well as legislators, regulators and third-party payors. We believe if the company fails to check the rate of its customer consolidation now, it will adversely affect its business as well as financial condition.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

In June, the companies had partnered to develop tests based on a review and selection process involving QIAGEN’s assay technologies tests for DiaSorin’s LIAISON family of analyzers.As per the latest announcement, QFT-Plus stands to be the first assay from QIAGEN’s QuantiFERON portfolio that will be available for use on the LIAISON family systems. Moreover, per the agreement, the companies will be working on developing a completely automated version of the QuantiFERON test read-out components for use with the QuantiFERON-TB Plus test along with future QuantiFERON-based tests that will be adopted for use on LIAISON.In this regard, the companies plan to launch the CE-marked QuantiFERON read out components for use on LIAISON XL in the third quarter of 2018.

209,BDX,"On Feb 6, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Netherlands-based molecular diagnostics provider offers innovative technologies and products for pre-analytical sample preparation and molecular diagnostics solutions. The stock has been trading above the broader industry over the past six months. As per the latest share price, it has lost 2.1% compared with 3.9% decline of the broader industry.The company ended the fourth quarter on a solid note with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the quarter, QIAGEN’s Molecular diagnostics sales increased significantly on dynamic growth in the QuantiFERON latent TB test. Also, double-digit CER growth in revenues from the company’s companion diagnostics partnerships and sustained double-digit CER growth in consumables related to the QIAsymphony automation system contributed to the top line.Moreover, during the reported quarter, the company surpassed its goal of 2,000 QIAsymphony placements in 2017, reflecting strong demand for the system. Management now aims to surpass 2,300 cumulative QIAsymphony placements by the end of 2018. Also, the company’s focus to drive growth through Sample-to-Insight offerings buoys optimism.  We are also upbeat about QIAGEN’s solid progress with the test menu expansion strategy. In this regard, in January, the company’s ipsogen JAK2 RGQ PCR Kit (ipsogen JAK2 assay) received FDA approval for additional use in the diagnosis of all myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS portfolio.Meanwhile, QIAGEN is exposed to stiff competition. The company is facing intensifying competition from firms that provide competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers. The markets for some of the company’s products are very competitive and price sensitive, which adds to the concerns. Also, strong reliance on collaborations and declining HPV sales in the United States are other negatives.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Royalty and license fee revenues totaled $7.1 million, down $0.9 million year over year.Per management, the decline in royalty and license fee revenues was caused by lower royalties resulting from expirations of patents in the third-generation hydrophilic coatings.This unit generated a $0.4-million operating loss in the reported quarter, comparing unfavorably with operating income of $3.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the segment was affected by planned increased investments related to Surmodics’ whole product solution strategy, reductions in royalty revenues as well as a $0.7-million increase in contingent consideration expense.IVDIn the quarter under review, sales increased 5.9% to $4.2 million. The upside came on the back of strong growth and stabilization across BioFX, microarray and antigen product sales.IVD operating income was $1.7 million in the current quarter compared with $1.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Surmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Surmodics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Surmodics, Inc. Quote Margin DetailsProduct gross margins contracted 160 basis points (bps) in the first quarter to 64.3% of product sales compared with 65.9% in the year-ago period.

The segment has been gaining grounds on the back of strong growth and stabilization across BioFX, microarray and antigen product sales. Surmodics issued a solid guidance for fiscal 2018. The company's solid initiatives to strengthen research and development programs hold promise.The company witnessed significantly high operating losses, specifically in Ireland. Product sales declined substantially owing to shipment issues, particularly in the Medical Device segment. Further, foreign-exchange woes related to the Creagh Medical buyout have been a major dampener. Surmodics’ drug-coated balloons face stiff competition in niche space. The company’s margins are expected to be under pressure, thanks to expenses in the Irish facility infrastructure and lower Medical-Device product gross margins.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $183.88 billion.Quarter in DetailsPharmacy Services revenues increased 9.3% to $34.2 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes, higher pharmacy network volumes as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and continued price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8.2% to 389.7 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 69 million, up 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC were up by a marginal 0.3% year over year to $20.9 billion. According to the company, a 2.5% increase in same store prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 0.7% year over year but were positively impacted 80 basis points by seasonal cough and cold. Front-store sales were adversely affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales increased 0.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were adversely affected by approximately 340 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-bps negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the reported quarter.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) increased approximately 80 bps to 86.9% at the Pharmacy Services segment and around 160 bps to 86.8% at the Retail/LTC segment.Gross profit improved 3.9% to $7.9 billion. However, gross margin contracted 21 bps to 16.3%.

The revision reflects the effects of the tax reform achieved through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).Management noted that, with $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the TCJA, the company will be able to make strategic investments in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term.Accordingly, the company has increased its 2018 adjusted operating profit growth guidance to a range of 1% to 4% from the earlier-stated range of (1.5%) to 1.5%.Earlier, while providing its 2018 initial outlook, CVS Health noted that, it expects to deliver net revenue growth of 0.75% to 2.5% in the year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full-year revenues is pegged at $188.04 billion.For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%.Our TakeCVS Health ended the year 2017 on a solid note with a better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance. The year-over-year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the specialty services. However, year-over-year Retail/LTC comparisons were dull.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCVS Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

This came on the back of strong demand for existing OEM product lines and contract components.On a comparable organic constant-currency basis, revenues improved 11.1% over the prior year.

Integer Holdings’ Cardiac Rhythm Management unit has been sluggish.

Owing to continued reimbursement declines, the company expects rental revenue per patient to fall in the upcoming quarters.Of the major positives, the company provided a positive guidance for full-year 2018. The company’s steadfast focus on customer relationship, focus on cost reduction and burgeoning financial performance are key catalysts. Integer Holdings derives a significant portion of its revenues from Medicare’s service reimbursement programs.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

215,BDX,"Omnicell, Inc. (OMCL  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 14.2%.This Mountain View, CA-based developer and marketer of end-to-end automation solutions for the medication-use process has a market cap of $1.90 billion. The company’s five-year projected growth rate is favorable at 15.8%, compared with 15.9% of the broader industry.However, the estimate revision trend for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company for the current year has been mixed. In the last 60 days, three analysts revised their estimates upward, with two movements in the opposite direction. However, the estimate revision for earnings increased around 1.5% to $1.99 per share over the same time frame.Factors at PlayWe note that, the stock is progressing well with its 3-legged strategy that covers market expansion through delivery of differentiated, innovative solutions; expansion into new markets, primarily outside the United States; and expansion through strategic partnerships and acquisition of new technologies.During the last-reported quarter, the company gained some new prominent customers as well as significant strategic deals with existing customers and thereby, progressed in the first leg of its strategy.Apart from XT Series momentum, the company is witnessing market momentum valuing and validating the entire Omnicell platform as a strategic solution. Omnicell XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System, which is likely to be available from mid-2018, is already gaining significant momentum in the market with a number of contractual bookings in fourth-quarter 2017.The second leg of expanding into new markets is driving growth in the Non-Acute Care segment. While the company continues to focus on the Middle East and South Africa, it also sees greater adoption of technologies in other parts of the world, the latest one being Australia. Internationally, the company had signed a contract with HCL HCA healthcare for both pharmacy and supply solutions for six hospitals in the U.K. The third leg of acquisition and partnerships is also progressing successfully. The company's most recent buyout is InPharmics, a Mississippi-based technology and services company which should help Omnicell in expanding the capabilities of its Performance Center.Omnicell’s strong position in Sweden, Germany, U.K., Singapore, Middle East, South Africa and China also buoys optimism. The company has been witnessing strong pipeline development in these countries. In addition, Omnicell witnessed strong business trends across Europe where it has observed a healthy acceptance of its medication adherence products.Meanwhile, we would like to remain on the sidelines as over the past month, Omnicell has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has declined 16.1% versus the industry’s 6.5% fall.  Moreover, Omnicell continues to expect higher costs in the upcoming quarters stemming from the integration of Aesynt and Ateb and expenses related to the recently launched XT series, thereby adding to the concern.   Moreover, Omnicell is exposed to a resilient hospital capital expenditure environment that might adversely affect the adoption of its solutions. Furthermore, the reimbursement mix has also affected the endowments income, further affecting hospital spending capabilities. While the company has won some new deals in larger hospitals, the market is still susceptible to the economy and credit conditions.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.8% is a positive for BD. Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential, as surging profit levels indicate solid prospects over the long haul.Here we take a look at five other factors that are likely to provide BD with a competitive edge in MedTech in the quarters to come.5 Factors Worth ConsideringShare Price Appreciation: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that shares have returned 22.2%, which compares favorably with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 6.7%. The current return is also greater than the industry’s gain of 11.6%.The price surge can be attributed to strong investor optimism around the stock, considering that BD’s scale, size, commercial platform, industry-leading brands and solid acquisition strategies are likely to drive growth.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Recently, the company established a third business segment — BD Interventional. Notably, the recently-acquired C.R. Bard is integrated in this vertical. In this regard, management confirmed that BD is on track to become one of the biggest medical-technology devices company in the world following the buyout.The acquisition is expected to generate benefits from complementary businesses and geographical expansion. This will also boost the company’s share price in the upcoming days.Launches: Recently, BD announced the commercial availability of the CE-IVD marked PAXgene Blood circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) tube within the European Economic Area and Switzerland (Western Europe).The plastic tube, used for blood collection, was developed by PreAnalytiX GmbH, a joint venture between BD and Netherlands-based provider of Sample to Insight solutions, QIAGEN N.V.

R. Bard acquisition, BD expects fiscal 2018 revenues to increase in the range of 30-31% on a reported basis.

The current range indicates growth of approximately 15-16% on a reported basis, or approximately 12% at cc.Geographical Expansion: BD continues to focus on geographical expansion into overseas markets, in particular, emerging markets.In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, international revenues grew 6.3% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by Kiestra installations and strength in core microbiology within Diagnostic Systems as well as strong sales of clinical instruments within the Biosciences unit.Strength in pre-filled flush devices in MPS and strong growth in Pharmaceutical Systems also contributed to international growth.Developed markets revenues grew 2.5% in the first quarter, including an anticipated headwind from the U.S. dispensing change of 130 basis points (bps). Growth was driven by strong performance in Europe in Pharmaceutical Systems and Diagnostic Systems.The combination of BD and Bard augments the company’s growth profile in developed markets. For fiscal 2018, BD estimates developed market growth of around 4% on a reported basis.On an adjusted basis, the markets are expected to grow 4.5% year over year, excluding the estimated 50-bps impact from the U.S. dispensing change and the hurricane in Puerto Rico.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2.

(QGEN  -  Free Report).Since 2016, a research use only (RUO) version of the PAXgene Blood ccfDNA tube has been marketed by PreAnalytiX. The expanded access of the product in Europe will further consolidate BD’s foothold in the molecular diagnostic testing space.+Per management, this launch will also heighten the growth prospects of the companies in Western Europe, who offer ccfDNA based tests.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuotePAXgene at a GlanceThe PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tube provides a solution for clinical laboratories when the sample cannot be processed on the same day. It is used for the collection of whole blood samples and stabilization of ccfDNA. With PAXgene, samples can be stored in room temperature for up to 7 days. The stabilization is convenient for clinical laboratories as collection and processing occur days apart, unlike the standard EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tubes.The tube includes a proprietary sample stabilization additive and the BD Vacutainer Hemogard technology to assure healthcare workers’ safety. It ascertains accurate and consistent results in molecular diagnostic testing applications, using the ccfDNA. It can be used for treating cancer and also reduces the potential for errors in non-invasive prenatal tests.About PreAnalytiXPreAnalytiX was jointly formed by Becton, Dickinson and QIAGEN with a view to develop, manufacture and sell integrated and standardized systems for sample collection, stabilization and purification of RNA and DNA from human blood or bone marrow.

QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Segmental AnalysisPharmaceutical SegmentPharmaceutical revenues increased 4.7% to $31.15 billion on a year-over-year basis. The segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and also gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers.However, the segment witnessed a 4% decline in profits to $514 million, thanks to generic pharmaceutical pricing, recent investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics program performance.However, solid performance by the Specialty Solutions business partially offset the negative impact in the segment.Medical SegmentRevenues in the segment improved 18.6% to $4.04 billion, primarily on higher contributions from new and existing customers.Medical segment profits increased 38% to $220 million, courtesy of higher contributions from new and existing customers and acquisition of the Patient Recovery business.Share-Repurchase ProgramThe company’s board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of the company’s common shares, which will expire on Dec 31, 2020.With the latest authorization, Cardinal Health is authorized to repurchase up to $1.3 billion of its common shares.MarginsAs a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 5.3% of net revenues.

Further, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth. A strong fiscal 2018 outlook buoys optimism.On the flip side, despite growth in business, profits at the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing. Huge investments in Pharmaceutical IT platform and lackluster generics performance are likely to mar Cardinal Health’s operational efficiencies in the upcoming quarter. Intense competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks.

220,BDX,"On Feb 7, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Over the last three months, this San Diego, CA-based company, providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has gained 4.7%, higher than the broader industry’s 1.4%.Illumina exited fourth-quarter 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the fronts. Additionally, revenues and earnings improved on a year-over-year basis. This apart, an improving margin scenario instilled investor confidence in the stock. We are also optimistic about Illumina’s expansion strategy through the enhancement of its portfolio of sequencing products and the development of strategic partnerships with therapeutic and diagnostic service providers. In this regard, in January 2018, Illumina signed a commercial agreement for distributing Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Ion AmpliSeq technology to researchers who conduct studies on Illumina’s next-generation sequencing platform. Currently, Illumina is focusing on product innovation through research and development as well, which is evident from the recent launch of iSeq 100 Sequencing System. Post a promising fourth quarter, we expect Illumina to maintain growth momentum on continued uptake of sequencing consumables, instruments and microarray portfolios.Meanwhile, Illumina faces stiff competition in the sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets with several large players already enjoying significant market share, intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise. Also, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding issue raises concern.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The figure however outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $189 million and was above the company’s guidance of $187-$189 million. The year-over-year decline was however caused by a fall in Hereditary cancer testing revenues owing to price reductions in long-term contracts.Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. Quote However, the decline was partially offset by growing new product volumes, expanded reimbursement for new products and increase in international RNA kit revenues. Moreover, this was the fourth consecutive quarter where the company witnessed year-over-year Hereditary cancer volume growth led by encouraging response to the newly launched riskScore test under its myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing portfolio.Quarter in DetailsSegment-wise, Molecular diagnostic tests (92.4% of total revenue) recorded total revenues of $179.2 million, down 2.6% year over year on account of a 11.8% decline in Hereditary cancer testing revenuesto $126.9 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 26 cents and revenues is $191.6 million.Our ViewMyriad Genetics registered a better-than-expected performance in its second-quarter fiscal 2018. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is disappointing. On a positive note, the company observed strong growth in both GeneSight and EndoPredict testing revenues. The recent FDA approvals and encouraging test results buoy optimism.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMyriad Genetics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

226,BDX,"Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), popularly known as BD, reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $2.48 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.40. Adjusted earnings increased 3.9% at constant currency (cc) on a year-over-year basis.The company reported revenues of $3.08 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 billion.

However, BD Medical witnessed strong performance in the Medication and Procedural Solutions as well as the Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units.  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Medication and Procedural Solutions registered revenues of $925 million in the BD Medical segment, up 5% year over year at cc.Diabetes Care reported revenues of $277 million, up 2.2% at cc on a year-over-year basis.Pharmaceutical Systems reported revenues of $245 million, up 3.7% at cc on a year-over-year basis.However, Medication Management Solutions reported revenues of $587 million, down 3.4% at cc on a year-over-year basis.BD Life SciencesThe BD Life Sciences segment generated revenues of $1.05 billion, up 7.3% at cc from the year-ago quarter. The segment's performance indicates strong numbers across the Biosciences, Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems units.Preanalytical Systems recorded revenues of $375 million in the first quarter, up 4% at cc on a year-over-year basis.Diagnostic Systems reported revenues of $381 million, up 12.5% year over year at cc.Meanwhile, the Biosciences unit registered revenues of $289 million, up 5.3% at cc.Geographic ResultsUnited StatesU.S. revenues were roughly $1.66 billion, up 1.6% on a year-over-year basis.Within the BD Medical segment, growth in the Medication and Procedural Solutions and Diabetes Care units was offset by declines in the Medication Management Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units.BD Life Sciences segment results within the United States were primarily driven by Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems units in the reported quarter. International RevenuesInternational revenues rose 6.3% to $1.42 billion at cc.Both BD Medical and BD Life Sciences segment registered strong growth outside the United States.  Within the BD Medical segment, growth was driven by strength in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit, aided by impressive results in the Medication and Procedural Solutions and Diabetes Care units.GuidanceIncluding the accretion from C. R. Bard acquisition, BD expects fiscal 2018 revenues to increase in the range of 30-31% on a reported basis. However, revenues are expected to grow in the range of 4.5-5.5%.Notably, revenues are likely to be affected by the change in the U.S. dispensing business model.The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.85-$11.00, up from the previous range of $10.55-$10.65. The current range indicates growth of approximately 15% to 16% on a reported basis, or approximately 12% at cc.Bottom LineBD ended the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. A strong guidance for fiscal 2018 instills investor’s optimism. BD recently completed the acquisition of C. R. Bard. The company will now establish a new segment — BD Interventional — where Bard will be integrated. Further, in collaboration with Check-Points Health B.V., the company obtained CE Mark for molecular screening test for antibiotic-resistant carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) on the BD MAX System.On the flip side, BD continues to face headwinds because of the previously disclosed change in its U.S. dispensing business model. Further, lackluster performance by the Medication Management Solutions unit is a concern. BD temporarily paused shipments of insulin infusion sets. The recent recall of Barricor blood collection tubes in the quarter adds to the woes.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks that reported impressive earnings this season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

227,BDX,"The FDA approvals of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Hemlibra or Cobas Cdiff Nucleic acid test and Thermo Fisher Scientific’s (TMO  -  Free Report) slew of advancements in next-generation sequencing (the latest one being the FDA approved Oncomine Dx Target Test) clearly point toward the rapid emergence of in vitro diagnostics (IVD) in the MedTech space.The recent EvaluateMedTech World Preview indicates that while worldwide MedTech sales are expected to witness CAGR of 5.1% to $522 billion by 2022, steering ahead of cardiology, IVD will rake in annual sales of $69.6 billion at a CAGR of 5.9%.The above data is just a small indicator of the vast scope for growth of the IVD market. For investors keen on MedTech, the most important fact is that IVD’s benefits are not limited to any particular country or geographic territory. With the emergence of complex and transmittable diseases worldwide, this part of the MedTech space is currently in the spotlight.IVD in a NutshellIf we go by FDA’s definition, in vitro diagnostics are, “tests that can detect diseases, conditions, or infections. Some tests are used in laboratory or other health professional settings and other tests are for consumers to use at home.”Growth FactorsRapid occurrence of infectious diseases worldwide, increasing burden of killer bugs like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, stroke and other heart diseases, and diabetes in developing and developed nations as well as growing cognizance of early cancer screening, detection, and prevention have made IVD indispensable in the healthcare space.Growing investment from both government and private players in the form of reimbursement coverage and speedy patent approvals are also driving demand. These apart, per a report by Research and Markets, increasing geriatric population, rising per capita GDP and per capita healthcare expenditure are acting as major growth catalysts. Per the report, owing to suitable demographical changes and rising disposable income coupled with improving basic infrastructure, developing regions are gradually becoming happy hunting grounds for this business.Geographic Distribution So far, North America has the lead in the in vitro diagnostic market. Per Coherent Markets Insights’ data, it is the highest contributing region with projected market share of 46.7% by 2024 (at CAGR of 5.4% between 2016 and 2024). Favorable demography and regulatory policies along with increasing healthcare spending have aided growth of the IVD business in this geography. However, increasing instances of lifestyle oriented diseases, improving government funding and growing awareness of new technologies have fueled demand for IVD in emerging economies.According to a recent report by Research and Market, China is the fastest growing among the top 10 IVD country markets. It is likely to expand more than threefold by 2022 from 2016.On the other hand, the revenue of the Indian IVD market has grown at a CAGR of 20% having increased from $0.64 billion in 2012 to $1.6 billion in 2017 (data by Goldstein Research).Segmental Contribution Per a MedGadget report, apart from geographic distribution, the global in vitro diagnostic market has been segmented on the basis of application, type, end user and usability. Application wise, diabetes, infectious diseases, oncology, nephrology, autoimmune diseases and cardiology are generating huge revenues across the globe.From the point of view of end user, hospitals, laboratory, point of care testing are the leading users.  In terms of usability, disposable IVD devices and re-usable IVD devices are widely used across the globe.Key Players Roche remains the top player in the IVD market with expected sales of $12.8 billion in 2022. Key IVD developments at Roche include the Cobas range of tests, the latest one being Cobas Zika (the first commercially available test for the detection of the Zika virus RNA in samples of human plasma).On the other hand, Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) recent acquisition of Alere should establish the company as the global leader in point-of-care testing, the fastest-growing segment of in vitro diagnostics market. In this regard, the company noted that, point-of-care testing is a $7 billion segment of the in vitro diagnostics market and is growing rapidly.Among the other bigwigs, Becton Dickinson & Company (BDX  -  Free Report) deserves a mention. The company is striving to get approval for the commercialization of its innovative products in the fast-growing infectious diseases testing market. Its BD Diagnostics provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostics specimens, as well as instruments and reagent systems to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, healthcare-associated infections and cancer.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

228,BDX,"Asia-Pacific, or APAC, is home to more than half of the world's population, so demand for healthcare is also exceptionally high in the region. Furthermore, the need for cutting-edge MedTech products and services is significantly high across the world, with APAC being no exception.In fact, a research report by McKinsey shows that APAC is expected to outpace the European Union as the world’s second-largest MedTech market pretty soon (after the United States). Almost 1.1 billion people in the region are expected to enter the 50-plus age group by 2025, indicating emerging demand for healthcare needs. Also, APAC accounts for two-thirds of the global disease burden.Further, a research report by Statista shows that the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach nearly $78 billion in 2018.Trump’s Focus on AsiaWith the above data pointing toward the huge and unmet healthcare needs within the APAC market, investors may find President Trump’s recent 12-day long Asia trip (with stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines) to be a positive sign.Furthermore, his recent tweet – “Our great country is respected again in Asia. You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!”–is indicative of a favorable Republican stance on APAC, especially with respect to business and trade.Here we take a sneak peek at two major postulates of Trump’s recent Asia visit:Bilateral Trade AgreementTrump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. However, Trump specifically mentioned that these agreements are bound to follow the ""principles of fair and reciprocal trade."" He also voiced for “free and open Indo-Pacific trade,” emphasizing on increased focus in the nations of Japan, Australia, and India.Prospects in China“Pacific is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States,” said China’s President Xi Jinping during Trump’s visit.China undoubtedly poses serious competitive threat to the United States, not just in the healthcare space, but also in electronic, semiconductors, retail, and other areas. Jinping’s statements clearly hint at the possibility of the countries coexisting peacefully despite the political tensions. This might also be indicative of strategic mergers between companies in the two nations in order to enhance trade practices.MedTech Companies Eye APACConsidering Trump’s growing focus on APAC, the region seems to be poised to yield accretive returns in the long term. In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing the emerging market over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish on the growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure, and the expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Meanwhile, despite the health-policy debacle in the United States and deteriorating economic conditions in Europe, we can conclude that growth in the emerging markets of China, India, Japan, and others will bolster the global foothold for MedTech companies. Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are tapping into and also gaining from the bountiful opportunities in the APAC market:Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report)Baxter’s solid presence in Asia, precisely in India, is worth a mention; the company has research hubs in Japan and China. In the just-reported third quarter, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million. In December 2016, Baxter had initiated the agreement. Per management, the acquisition will bolster Baxter’s foothold in the generic pharmaceuticals space. In the second quarter of 2017, Baxter signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline. Further, Baxter’s strong presence in peritoneal dialysis, nutrition, IV fluids, and anesthesia gases fortifies its footprint in China.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has had an impressive run on the bourses in the last two years. The stock has returned 70.6%, significantly higher than the broader industry’s gain of 16.2%.  BostonScientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report)An important part of Boston Scientific’s growth strategy is to continue pursuing development opportunities outside the United States.In the just-reported third-quarter 2017, business from the emerging markets registered an 18% organic growth rate. It remained above the company’s target of reaching 15% of sales by 2017 (from 8% in 2013). Business in China was also remarkable (up 23% year-over-year). The company is currently looking forward to an improved performance in China, banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.Boston Scientific is also optimistic about its core cardiology segment, which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. The cardiology capacity in China is expected to double by 2017-end. In India, business is projected to grow more than 15% annually.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has yielded a stellar return of 59.3% in the last two years, way ahead of the broader industry’s 16.2% over the same time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report)Intuitive Surgical’s growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. Over the last couple of years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength, with solid growth in China, Japan, and Korea. In the just-reported third quarter, Intuitive Surgical’s system placements included 14 in Japan, five in India, four in New Mexico, and one in China.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 135.4% over the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s 25% during the same period.  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson and Company, or BD, is focused on geographical expansion in overseas markets, and in particular, emerging nations. We note that the company is especially focused on broader emerging markets like India and China, which are seeing rapid growth in economic and healthcare sectors. We believe that significant emerging market exposure will boost the company’s top line, which in turn should lead to accelerated EPS growth.BD revenues grew 6.9% in the just-reported fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Emerging market revenues grew a strong 12.7% year-over-year in the quarter at constant currency, driven by strong performance in greater Asia and China, where revenues saw double digit growth.This leading player in the MedTech space is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has returned 45.1% in the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s growth of 10%.  The ParadoxHowever, Trump’s ‘Americafirst!’ pitch at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, or APEC, which was held in Vietnam (November 6-11), has been a serious threat to U.S. multilateral trade. It has been clearly portrayed that Trump’s primary focus was, is, and will be the betterment of the United States.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

229,BDX,"We expect IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 6.56%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters at an average of 13.60%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that IDEXX is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  IDEXX has an Earnings ESP of +1.19% as the Most Accurate estimate is 85 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at 84 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: IDEXX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of IDEXX’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.19% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?IDEXX achieved strong organic growth in the U.S. and international regions in the last reported first quarter of 2017, driven by strong global gains in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues, including double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base. The company expects this bullish trend to continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Overall, IDEXX raised its 2017 revenue outlook by $15 million to the range of $1,925--$1,950 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 9.5% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.92 billion, within the guided range.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteOn the bottom-line front, the company raised its EPS guidance to $2.95--$3.11 per share from the earlier range of $2.85–$3.01, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 21%--27% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $3.05, which is within the guided range.We are upbeat about the company’s innovation-based global strategy that is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. In June, IDEXX announced the addition of rVetLink to its portfolio of technology applications. Notably, rVetLink is an advanced all-inclusive referral management solution designed for specialty care hospitals that simplifies the referral procedure between primary care and specialty care veterinarians.This apart, IDEXX continues to display solid growth with respect to international expansion. The company has been significantly benefitting from the companion animal market of emerging nations demonstrating the bountiful opportunities. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe, the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the second-quarter performance.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind for the company. Another concern is the company’s high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion in the U.S. and internationally, and portfolio expansion.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. This struggle to gain market share might also prove to be a drag on second-quarter 2017 results.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.(TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

230,BDX,"Pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, after market close. This St. Louis, MO-based company is the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in North America.Meanwhile, the company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 0.8% in the last reported quarter. The stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters at an average of 0.3%.Express Scripts’ stock has underperformed the Zacks classified Medical Services industry in the last six months. Specifically, the stock lost 12.1% during this period compared to the industry's gain of 3.7%. Moreover, the current rate is way lower than the S&P 500's 8.8% over the same time frame. This indicates looming concerns ahead.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteLet’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlaySecond-Quarter Outlook: For the second quarter of 2017, Express Scripts expects total adjusted claims in the range of $343 million to $353 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter are estimated in the band of $1.70 to $1.74, representing growth of 8% to 11% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth in the band of 2% to 4% from 2017 through 2020 for the core PBM business.Favorable Macroeconomic Scenario: We expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population in the U.S. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation. Thus, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and increased regulatory burden has been driving demand for generics, a key catalyst for the company.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: On the flipside, Express Scripts faces intense competition in the PBM industry. The company faces competition from independent PBMs like MedImpact and Navitus Health Solutions. Moreover, the niche space is dominated by players like CVS, Aetna and Cigna, among others. We expect intensifying competition to mar second-quarter revenues.Estimate Revision Trend: Express Scripts’ estimate revision trend lacks luster at the moment.

For the current year, Baxter saw two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the second quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact the top line by low single digits. Also, the foray of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the U.S. intensifies competition for the company.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter.

232,BDX,"Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 89 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, adjusted earnings declined 18.3% on a year-over-year basis.Factors at PlayWe are particularly upbeat about Varian’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in second-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 92 cents–96 cents and revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.Further, strengthening its foothold in the oncology business, the company launched its FDA approved product Halcyon in May. Also, in June, the company signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam.We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteThis apart, Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening new offices in Africa and the Middle East, which shows that it is aware of the opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter.

233,BDX,"We expect Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 26.87%. It is worth noting that Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.89%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% as the Most Accurate estimate is at 74 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 73 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Align Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Align Technology’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.37% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, thereby ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in Feb 2017. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter.In May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment. Moreover, in a bid to gain traction in the Invisalign platform, Align collaborated with Digital Smile Design in March. Post-collaboration, Align’s Invisalign clear aligner treatment can be used by dentists during tooth alignment procedures along with Smile Design protocols.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteNotably, to expand its Invisalign brand offerings, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution – Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement – for teens in March. According to the company, this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. Recently, the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, design and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company had announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to likely continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Notably, for second-quarter 2017, the company projects earnings per share of 71−74 cents on revenues of $340–$345 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 221,000 to 224,000, up 25–27% from a year ago.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansionOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Also, the company’s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.34%.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, Lutonix DCB is used to treat patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the U.S. We expect to see this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter.Furthermore, the company's investments in emerging markets have strengthened its position internationally. We are also upbeat on the solid contribution from the company’s vascular product line. The urology and oncology segments are likely to drive second-quarter sales.On the flip side, a challenging Med-tech environment, especially in the hernia fixation and peripheral stent businesses raises concerns. The company continues to witness significant pricing pressure as well. Also, unfavorable foreign currency will continue to hurt top- and bottom-line growth.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat either this quarter.

However, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter earnings average lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) reflected a massive 46.4% year-over-year deterioration. Revenues in the quarter dropped 3.6% year over year. The dismal performance was primarily due to lower sales at the U.S. & Canada international and manufacturing/wholesale segments. Also, in the first quarter of 2017, gross margin and adjusted operating margin deteriorated. Hence, we expect a similar trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. QuoteMoreover, GNC Holdings has a number of tough competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, major international supermarket firms and large U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we expect the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which, in turn, may hurt margins.Also, currency headwinds continue to be a growing concern for GNC Holdings. Management also expects the failure to comply with FTC regulations and changing consumer preferences to hamper business.However, on the bright side, the performance of One New GNC was quite encouraging during the first quarter of 2017. Banking on it, we expect the company to continue to gain in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.

Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEdwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve(TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.In the TAVR space, Edwards Lifesciences reported highly encouraging European post-approval clinical trial results for its SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in May 2017. The company also demonstrated successful results pertaining to its CENTERA valve for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures in the much awaited EuroPCR 2017 held in May.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteWe are also upbeat about the company’s initiative of strategic investment in research and development and receipt of regulatory approvals for those products.

All these are expected to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continues to challenge the company.

It is worth noting that Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters at an average of 5.15%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPosing a threat to Quest Diagnostics’ revenue per requisition performance, the last reported first-quarter 2017 saw a 20-basis points (bps) decrease in the same. Moreover, we remain apprehensive, as the company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagement, WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.This apart, unit price headwinds had  less than 100 bps in the first quarter. While unit price headwinds stayed in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for 2017 too.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteAlso, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). However, while reimbursement pressure has likely acted as an overhang on performance in the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects to beat the pressure through test and business mix.On a positive note, as observed in the reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to stimulate performance by adhering to its two-point growth strategy – Accelerate growth and Drive operational Excellence.We are also optimistic about the successful execution of the company’s strategy to grow its esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Also, in the recent past, Quest Diagnostics witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the second quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We believe all these recent developments will significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the second quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues within the range of $7.64 billion to $7.72 billion (annualized growth of 2–3%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, close to the low end of the company’s guided range.

240,BDX,"Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3.Becton, Dickinson has an impressive track of comfortably beating estimates in each of the four trailing quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.14%, bringing the four-quarter average to 5.58%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayBecton, Dickinson's innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst in our view. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the U.S. and International markets are helping the company to rapidly expand its product portfolio. Management at Becton, Dickinson expects that strong demand for its Pyxis ES platform and infusion pumps to be growth drivers in the fiscal second quarter. Overall for fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase approximately 4.5% to 5.0%.Additionally, partnerships and collaborations are providing the company a competitive edge. However, an unfavorable foreign exchange rate is anticipated to remain headwind for the rest of year. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.The company’s estimate revision trend lacks luster. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined from $2.47 per share to $2.44, adding to our concerns. Overall for fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings (on a currency-neutral basis) are expected in the range of $9.70 to $9.80, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.0% to 14.0%. However, after including the estimated unfavorable impact from foreign currency, the company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share between $9.35 and $9.45, representing an increase of approximately 9% to 10%. Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteEarnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Becton, Dickinson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.51%, bringing the four-quarter average to 7.12%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayAmerisourceBergen’s pharmaceutical distribution segment continues to face headwinds in the form of contract renewals and lower generic inflation. The AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”) business is also being hurt by several factors, including accelerating deflation of generic drugs and lower contribution from generic launches.Although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs and lack of generic inflation will adversely impact bottom line.However, the company renewed its relationship with the largest health systems customer and has been making persistent efforts to address the headwinds in the ABDC segment. This can boost the top line to some extent in the fiscal third quarter.The company’s estimate revision trend is mixed. For the current quarter, AmerisourceBergen saw one upward and downward estimate movement over the last one month. Current quarter estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.37.Also, the company is apprehensive about its earnings and revenue growth expectations for fiscal 2017 due to the uncertainty surrounding drug pricing trends. The company currently expects revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. The company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.77 to $5.92.

245,BDX,"Q3 earnings season has taken center stage, with 272 S&P 500 members, which account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization, having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% surpassing revenue estimates.With 134 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating an improvement sequentially. Needless to say, the ongoing week is a crucial one for this season as by the end of it we will have results from more than 80% of the S&P 500 bigwigs.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show this quarter. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 5.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate from the second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of MedTech companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q3Hurricanes Wreak Havoc Various reports suggest that hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Ecolab (ECL  -  Free Report) expects the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents per share. In fact, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects an almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.Apart from the natural factors, a rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumer income, coupled with increasing aggregate spending, are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers.Political ConundrumWhile the overall investment world has been gaining prominence, investors in the MedTech industry are unfortunately seeing a reverse trend. Stocks tumbled and things got riskier when the Graham-Cassidy bill to retract Obamacare failed to gain support again. And, President Trump’s latest executive order has already become a serious threat to the healthcare community at large.In this regard, let’s not forget the tax-reform pledges that Trump has taken to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Although investor confidence trends upwards with the hope of ‘enactment of new tax reforms,' we believe the market has not got a whiff of it due to the lack of favorable developments on the regulatory front.Favorable Consumer Behavior Despite the political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at the major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Nov 2:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell.For fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase 4.5% to 5.0%.

While earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues remained in line with the same. We are disappointed by the company’s declining sales performance within several of its core segments. The trimemd 2017 guidance also added to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead. Nevertheless, improved gross and operating margin performance was encouraging.We look forward to the expected synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company’s musculoskeletal offering.

The figure topped the company’s guidance of $2.19–$2.22 billion and also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 billion.Organic revenue growth in the second quarter (excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisitions of EndoChoice Holdings and Symetis SA) was 6% year over year.Geographically, in the second quarter, the company achieved operational growth of 9% in the U.S. (up 7% organically), 4% in Europe (up 2%); up 7% in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region (up 7%) and up 12% in the emerging markets (up 14%).Segment AnalysisBoston Scientific currently has three global reportable segments: Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management and MedSurg.The company generates maximum revenues from Cardiovascular. Sales from its subsegments — Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions — were $603 million (up 5% year over year at CER) and $273 million (up 7%), respectively, during the second quarter.The second largest contributor to Boston Scientific’s top line was Rhythm Management, which includes Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) and Electrophysiology.

At the end of the second quarter, the company had a total long-term debt of $5.84 billion, a marginal increase from $5.14 billion at the end of the first quarter.GuidanceBoston Scientific has provided an update to its full-year 2017 guidance.The company raised its 2017 revenue guidance to the range of $8.89-$8.99 billion (annualized growth of 6-7% on reported basis and growth of 6-8% on operational basis including contribution of approximately 120 bps from EndoChoice and Symetis) from the earlier band of $8.80–$8.90 billion (annualized growth of 5-6% on reported basis and growth of 6-7% on operational basis). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $8.87 billion, below the guided range.Adjusted EPS guidance range for 2017, has been slightly increased to $1.22−$1.27 from the earlier range of 1.22−$1.26. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 is within this guided range.The company also provided its third-quarter 2017 financial guidance. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 29–31 cents per share on revenues of $2.18–$2.21 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS stands at 31 cents while for revenues, it is $2.19 billion.Our TakeEven amid challenging economic conditions, a competitive environment and severe currency headwinds, Boston Scientific posted a better-than-expected second quarter, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues, ahead of the mark. While foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company’s recent recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. Also the unimpressive defibrillator performance within the company’s core CRM segment continues to remain a drag for the overall growth.Nevertheless, Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets, which accounted for higher sales across all its geographies in the second quarter. We are also encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products, both in the domestic and overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning is the company’s recent acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, in a bid to fortify its structural heart business in Europe. This apart, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems. It also received CE Mark for the Vercise Gevia Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System and the first MR-conditional directional DBS system for treatment of movement disorder symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease, dystonia and essential tremor.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some other better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.82%, taking the four-quarter average to 3.96%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Becton, Dickinson is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen which is the case here.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.11%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Becton, Dickinson has a Zacks Rank #2, which is favorable. The combination of a Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP indicates a likely positive surprise. Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision. Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteFactors at PlayBecton, Dickinson's innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst in our view. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and International markets are helping the company to rapidly expand its product portfolio. Management at Becton, Dickinson expects that strong demand for its Pyxis ES platform and infusion pumps to be growth drivers in the fiscal fourth quarter. Overall for fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase approximately 4.5-5.0%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BD Medical segment is at $2.105 billion for the fourth quarter, signifying sequential growth of 2.8%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Medical Surgical Systems is pegged at at $908 million, up 4.4% sequentially.Additionally, partnerships and collaborations are providing the company a competitive edge. However, an unfavorable foreign exchange rate is anticipated to remain headwind for the rest of year. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.The company’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current quarter, five analysts moved north compared to no downward revision in the last two months. Over the last three months, the current-quarter estimates improved from $2.37 per share to $2.38. Overall for fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings (on a currency-neutral basis) are expected in the range of $9.42 to $9.47, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10%.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.INC Research Holdings, Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

250,BDX,"The Q3 earnings season had kick-started last week with results from 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) having been reported so far. We observed the S&P 500 index to have made a pretty good opening with respect to both earnings and revenue growth. Per the latest Earnings Preview, till Oct 20, 2017, total earnings for these members went up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.With 180 S&P 500 members lining up for releasing their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish about the equity market scenario, gradually demonstrating an improvement from the sequentially last quarter.A Look at MedTech Space Within Medical SectorWhile overall growth has been steadily accelerating from the preceding few quarters’ performances, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that has seen a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.This lack of visibility befuddles the favorable trend this sector was maintaining over the past few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate is standing at 2.2% on 4.8% revenue growth projection. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate of second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Needless to say, that the current crisis in the U.S. MedTech industry, integral part of the broader Medical sector, shows no signs of abating. MedTech space was earlier hopeful about the change of power within the White House. However, it is currently fussing over the total failure of the Republicans’ ObamaCare repeal and replacement. Considering the prevailing uncertainty over the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.Political turmoil and the health policy related battle apart, majority of the stocks’ bottom line within this space is likely to be hurt in the third quarter on escalating costs induced by the consecutive hurricanes and Mexico earthquakes.Given this gloomy backdrop, investors interested in the MedTech space will keenly await the earnings reports of key MedTech companies namely, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and C. R. Bard, Inc.  on Oct 24.Per our quantitative model, when stocks with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) are combined with a positive Earnings ESP, then chances of beating estimates are always high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A Sneak Peek at Both StocksSimilar to the sequentially-last quarter, Edwards Lifesciences seems to be gaining from its strong Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) segment. Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographical regions with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well as a continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last quarter. Also, with the receipt of an expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June, the top line at the THVT segment is expected to get a further boost this yet-to-be-reported quarter. (Read: Will Edwards Lifesciences Gain on THVT in Q3 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $496 million reflects an increase of 20.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $322 million shows an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter revenues are projected at $833.89 million. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the United States of $467 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.8% in the trailing four quarters. While Edwards Lifesciences has an Earnings ESP of -2.32%, it carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 87 cents per share being revised a penny downward over the last seven days. However, it has shown a rally of 26.4% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $834 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, an 11.5% improvement from the year-ago reported number of $748 million.In this regard, we also anticipate the company’s arch rival in transcatheter heart valves space, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), to fare well in the business this third quarter. Boston Scientific is slated to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 26, before the market opens.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Edwards Lifesciences Corporation price-eps-surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote Looking into C.R. Bard’s recent performance trend, we believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by an accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the United States. We expect this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter. (Read: Can CR Bard Spring a Surprise This Earnings Season?)Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.03% in the trailing four quarters. While C.R. Bard has an Earnings ESP of -0.09%, it carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $2.95 per share being revised a penny downward over the last 30 days. However, it has shown an improvement of 15.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $992 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter as compared to the year-ago reported figure of $932 million, reflecting a 6.4% gain.In this regard, we note that C.R. Bard is slated to be acquired by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) for $24 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. This acquisition is expected to strengthen the company’s footprint in the home healthcare market in the United States.C.R. Bard, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise C.R. Bard, Inc. price-eps-surprise | C.R. Bard, Inc. Quote Comparative AnalysisAnalyzing all the revenue drivers and other fundamental factors for both Edwards Lifesciences and C.R. Bard along with their respective Zacks Consensus Estimates, we may conclude that Edwards Lifesciences is expected to perform better than C.R. Bard in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

251,BDX,"The MedTech space received a sudden jolt on late night Thursday when White House pulled the plug on Obamacare subsidies that reduce health care costs for Americans with low incomes. This comes as no surprise for the lukewarm response to its replacement, The American Health Care Act (AHCA), has forced Republicans to continue to seek new avenues. In a bid to save its face, the Trump administration attempted a “skinny"" repeal bill along with a Graham-Cassidy bill, which failed to make any headway in the senate.We believe that the impasse is slated to continue as President Trump has always been an outspoken critic of the ACA. Our apprehension comes from the uncertainty regarding the outcome of a slew of events. This includes the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed, a stronger dollar, and the stance of healthcare insurance companies over ACA. These are expected to spark bouts of volatility.As of now, plenty of speculation has been made regarding the extent of interest rate hike by the Fed before the end of the year. Though, the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates, majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates. The ones debating against increasing rates stated that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2% — an indication of a healthy economy — might cause major setbacks to the U.S. economy. However, investors may also feel that, even if Fed decides to increase rate, it will hardly have any impact over the long term.Nevertheless, it would be foolish to claim that volatility has vanished from the market, just because the global market has started to recover since yesterday. No doubt, such market uncertainty has made investors increasingly cautious about spending on stocks.Interestingly in this phase of massive global sell-offs, the MedTech sector has not only held its own, but also maintained a stable uptrend. This is based on some of its powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions, emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and innovation of new products.In fact a closer look at this sector’s history will reveal the companies’ undaunting spirit to expand their business whatever the market scenario is. Despite political conundrum over Obamacare, we have witnessed some big cross-border mergers in recent times like the impending take over of C.R. Bard Inc  by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).What’s the Rewarding Strategy?  We believe investors can earn handsome profits by extrapolating the current bullish trends of the market into the future. Henceforth, seeking refuge in momentum investment strategy is a strategic investment gamble at this moment.However, picking the right momentum stocks may baffle seasoned investors, let alone the new ones, who are planning to enter the uncharted world of jam-packed trades.Here, at Zacks, we use our Style Score System to single out stocks which can aid in beating the market.The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success.Our PicksAmid the present volatility across the global economy, we have found a handful of top Zacks Rank momentum stocks for you from the Medical Devices space that are going to gain from this share market turbulence.

The device is slated for distribution this month.Coming back to the news, BD and Euroclone plan to launch these molecular assays outside of the United States from 2018.The molecular assays leverage on the company’s flagship platform BD MAX System to detect infectious genital mycoplasmas, including Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species, which are generally unidentifiable by the conventional methods. However, the assays are currently not available for sale in the United States.Per management, the addition of these assays to the existing BD MAX portfolio along with the company’s other assays like BD SurePath and the BD Onclarity HPV assay is likely fortify the company’s foothold in clinical laboratories for testing STI.Impressive Stock PerformanceShare prices of BD inched up 0.5% to close at $194 following the news release. Over the last year, the company has outperformed the broader industry. While the stock was up 6.9%, the broader industry gained just 5.9%. Nonetheless, the current return is relatively lower than the S&P 500’s addition of 14.5% over the same time frame.Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s focus on expanding into overseas markets, in particular, the emerging markets followed by new product launches and its acquisition-driven strategy are its significant growth catalysts.Our TakeBD has a diversified product portfolio, which reduces the risk of exposure to any one specific product. Additionally, a diverse revenue base and increased adoption of the company’s new and existing products are expected to drive its top-line growth.Meanwhile, the latest development is likely to maintain the company’s international footprint. Evidently, BD witnessed a 4.7% increase in revenues to $1.433 billion outside the United States on comparable currency-neutral basis in the last quarter.According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global sexually transmitted diseases testing market is anticipated to reach $167.4 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 8.5%. Markedly, after considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development to be a strategic fit.Stocks to Consider A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

The company’s favorable demographic trend and strategic acquisitions encourage us as well. Moreover, the company has been witnessing growth in the personal care segment on synergies from acquisitions.Meanwhile, though we expect synergies from the Tenet Healthcare acquisition to boost operations, escalating operating expenses and a declining gross margin continue to raise concerns.

Underlying sales increased 15.3% (including the impact of Germany stocking sales as customers in Germany elected to purchase additional inventory of the SAPIEN 3 valve in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from recent intellectual property litigation).Revenues were primarily driven by considerable growth in transcatheter heart valve sales as well as strong performance by the other two product lines across all regions.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteSegments DetailsFor the second quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $487.5 million, reflecting 16.5% growth over the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., THVT sales in the quarter were $316.3 million, up 28.4% year over year. Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance results being delivered by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions.Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were $207.1 million, up 4.2% from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the supply recovery in mitral valve sales, partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valve.Critical Care sales were $147.2 million in the reported quarter, representing an increase of 3.7% from second-quarter 2016.  Solid growth across all product categories was driven by double-digit growth in the company's Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, mainly in the U.S and Asia Pacific.MarginsIn the first quarter, gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 74.9% owing to a more profitable product mix, led by growing sales of transcatheter valves.

Long-term debt in the quarter totaled $1.02 billion, compared with $847.9 million reported previously.Cash flow from operating activities was $197.7 million in the second quarter, compared with $128.3 million in the previous quarter. Excluding capital spending of $58.0 million, free cash flow was $139.7 million. During the quarter, management repurchased 0.8 million shares for $73.8 million to offset dilution associated with its Valtech Cardio acquisition and stock-based incentive compensation.Updated 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second-quarter performance,Edwards Lifesciences has raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously projected range of $3.2–$3.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is $3.35 billion, near the high end of the guided range. Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to $3.65–$3.85 from $3.43–$3.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $3.52, within the company’s guided range.For the third quarter of 2017, the company projects sales (excluding the effect of Germany stocking sales) between $810 million and $850 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $816.1 million, within the projected range. The company estimates adjusted EPS between 80 cents and 90 cents. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 83 cents, which is also within the company‘s forecasted range.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong transcatheter valve sales were a major positive. The company also performed well on its gross margin front, which raises optimism. Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences’ raised revenue and earnings guidance hints at better days ahead. However, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to pose challenges to the company.Nevertheless, management expects to gain traction in the ever expanding TAVR market, based on increasing preference in favor of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as well as compelling clinical evidences, leading to strong adoption of THV therapy.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

Also, the raised guidance for adjusted earnings, revenues and net cash from operating activities buoy optimism about the company’s performance.We are also highly optimistic about the company’s focus on its new two-point strategy.
