1,UA,"Sportswear behemoth Nike (NKE) stock has exploded to new highs after the Dow Jones athletic apparel and shoe giant crushed earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday and announced a $15 billion stock buyback.The mix of fresh products, increasing demand at home and abroad, and accelerating digital innovation could drive Nike's stock price even higher, according to Wedbush Securities footwear analyst Christopher Svezia. Indeed, he was so impressed with the Dow Jones firm's results he claimed that 2018 is shaping up to be ""the Year of Nike.""""Improved design and technologies and sufficient quantities (are) being brought to market with better speed (boosted by Express Lanes), whether with React (expanding more into Sportswear now as well), the Air Max platform (with 270s, Vapor Max, and more), or NBA,"" Svezia said in a research note. ""Jordan will also return to global growth this year and women's is a material opportunity as well.""Nike's Express Lanes initiative is part of its overall Consumer Direct Offense strategy, which aims to make its offerings more appealing and accessible to the consumer.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNike CEO Mark Parker says Express Lanes cuts down the time between a product's design and its appearance on the shelves from months to a few weeks.The wider Consumer Direct Offense strategy aims to make Nike the leader in innovation, speed to market, and direct connections with customers through digital systems, membership and personalization.Nike stock vaulted 11% to 79.68 on the stock market today. Old rival Adidas (ADDYY) rose 2% and new pretender Under Armour (UAA) sank 3.9%. Among other footwear stocks Skechers (SKX) climbed 0.7% and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) sank 2.7%.Nike's continued innovation is leading to even more growth, further bolstering its profits.""Digital is also accelerating (+34%), aided by the SNKRS app and more, while helping drive margins,"" Svezia said.Nike is certainly continuing to pursue this space aggressively. In April Nike acquired body-scanning software firm Invertex, as it continues to beef up its digital technology, including its artificial intelligence capabilities. And in March it bought consumer data analytics company Zodiac for an undisclosed sum.Parker cited Nike's earnings as a harbinger of good things to come, and prove that his strategy is working.""Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies and a return to growth in North America,"" Parker said in a press release. ""Fueled by a complete digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the foundation for Nike's next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and profitability.""Meanwhile Svezia believes Nike is underplaying its hand with its outlook. He sees great opportunities in foreign markets, as well as at home. While North American sales grew 3% in the most recent quarter, that followed three straight quarters of declines.""There is opportunity in China and Europe in addition to accelerating growth in North America (on greater product availability and favorable comparisons) while gross margin should be supportive,"" he said.Nike is the footwear market leader in China and Cowen managing director John Kernan has said the current boom in popularity in the NBA will disproportionately benefit Nike over other brands.The sunny picture is in stark contrast to 2017, a tough year for the footwear industry in North America. This was despite collective sales of more than $74 billion, according to Euromonitor.Top brands including Nike and Under Armour struggled, while retailers had their own woes due to heavy price promotion.

6,UA,"Nike (NKE) growth prospects have snagged the attention of Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which has built a stake in the sportswear giant.X The hedge-fund billionaire told investors at an event Thursday evening that the position, initiated last year, already has earned a 30% return, according to Reuters and other reports.

9,UA,"Under Armour's (UAA) popularity is fading among teenage boys, said Piper Jaffray on Monday, and new research shows that it might not just be teens that are cooling on the Baltimore-based athletic apparel brand.Google search trends have been ""relatively flat"" so far in the first few months of the year, said FBR in a Tuesday note — except, of course, February's PR kerfuffle after Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank made ill-received comments about President Trump.More notably, Under Armour's Stephen Curry-related search traffic growth has flattened since mid-2016, said the firm, marking a complete reversal from the past two years of ""consistent search growth,"" i.e. increased Googling of the Golden State Warriors MVP during the NBA season.""We believe this shows a continued decline in (Under Armour's) resonance with consumers that could pressure UA at least near term,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, who reiterated an underperform rating. ""These search results are consistent with our view that UA is lagging in innovation and in the deep sponsorship roster that drives web traffic.""That appears to echo Piper Jaffray's findings that Under Amour isn't cool — even though athleisure is still hot.""While athletic brands account for 41% of top-teen apparel choices today versus 26% last year, Under Armour is not seeing the incremental benefit (still 2% share or less in upper income group),"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy on Monday. ""What we are seeing, however, is Nike (NKE) continuing to maintain its apparel dominance and Adidas significantly accelerating its share in the category.""Under Armour shares fell 1.6% to 19.42 on the stock market today. Nike shares rose 1 cent to 54.91. U.S.-listed shares of Adidas (ADDYY) dipped 0.65% to 93.46.FBR's Anderson also pointed again to the ""intensifying"" price war between Under Armour and Nike, and the firm's findings that Under Armour shoes aren't as popular with consumers as they used to be.IBD'S TAKE: Nike is no longer the top ""new"" brand for teen boys, said Piper Jaffray. This is. The Google trends are additionally concerning for Under Armour's sales prospects for its line of Curry-branded footwear.""A significant portion of UA's growth over the past year has come from the Curry shoe (we estimate 10% contribution growth to footwear), and while Curry is still popular, we believe the shoe has plateaued for now,"" said Anderson.Curry was recently trending in sports circles on Twitter, however — his new Curry Lux ""Oxblood Leather"" shoe was subject to mockery on the internet. Steph is selling a PT Cruiser for your feet pic.twitter.com/QCfaTeB47W— Zach Harper (@talkhoops) April 9, 2017But there's a chance Steph Curry and Under Armour could get the last laugh despite not being cool or popular.

10,UA,"X Under Armour (UAA) has a stronger brand than three years ago and people still love wearing activewear — those are the main take-aways from Jefferies' upgrade of the Nike (NKE) rival that are sending shares up early Friday.""The bottom has formed,"" declared the report's headline, as Jefferies analyst Randal Konik upgraded the stock to buy from hold and upped his price target to 27 from 19. He also added Under Armour to the firm's franchise picks list.Why? For one thing, athleisure is a trend that's got stamina: The research firm's survey of 2,000 consumers found that about 25% more of those polled are wearing activewear four to five times a week, almost a third are buying more athletic apparel for themselves, and a quarter more are purchasing more such apparel for their kids.Nike's mixed results Tuesday had some on the Street pointing to competition from Under Armour and, in particular, a resurgent Adidas (ADDYY). Jefferies' poll agrees that Adidas ate into Under Armour's market share, ""but gains are moderating"" as the Kevin Plank-helmed company makes inroads with children and finds more popularity.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour got a buy rating from Jefferies, but the stock is in a long downtrend, hitting a 3 1/2-year low as recently as Wednesday. Sales growth has slowed and Wall Street expects the company to post outright losses in the first half of this year. Focus your attention on top-rated companies with strong, even accelerating growth whose stocks are setting up in bullish bases.""We were guarded on UA during '16 given Adidas, and UA EPS and stock are down 75% and 50%+, respectively, in 6 mo. predominantly due to share transfer,"" wrote Konik.But Street estimates aren't taking into account stabilization in the North America market, flattening gross margins, expansion into international markets and category extensions, he said.Konik said his research indicates that ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now.""Under Armour shares rose 3.6% to 19.66 on the stock market today. On Wednesday, Under Amour fell to 18.40 intraday, its lowest level since September 2013.Nike shares rose 1.8%, regaining their 50-day line after tumbling 7% Wednesday following its weak Q3 sales and margins. Adidas edged lower.Skechers (SKX), which was upgraded to outperform by Cowen & Co., climbed 5.2%.

Star endorser Steph Curry recently went on an Under Armour-branded tour of China, and the company flexed its marketing muscle at the recent Rio Olympics.Plus, there's Kohl's (KSS) introduction of Under Armour products, which should help offset the loss of Sports Authority, they said. Wells Fargo upped its price target range to 44-46 from 38-42.Under Armour shares rose 1.3% to 38.27 in the stock market today. The stock remains below its 50-day and 200-day moving average.

24,UA,"The beginning of fall beckons wool coats — and apparently even wool shoes.Nike's (NKE) new woolly shoes helped accelerate basketball shoe sales industrywide to 13.7% year-over-year growth for the week ended Oct. 1, as total athletic footwear sales ramped up to 11.4% growth, according to Deutsche Bank, citing SportScanInfo figures.The $200 Air Jordan 12 Retro Wool, which was released on Saturday, Oct. 1, is crafted from dark gray wool and features leather overlays and metallic silver accents. The shoe diverges from Nike's usual fare, wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, in featuring a wool upper.Taking a look at each brand: Nike's footwear revenue grew 5.2% that week, while Under Armour (UA) shoe sales continue to grow in the hefty double digits with a 83.5% pop.Sales of shoes from Adidas, in the midst of its resurgence, rose 52.8%, with Adidas brand sales up 63.5% and Reebok predictably down again, this time 23.8% from the prior-year week.Skechers (SKX) footwear sales grew 3.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Nike came out well ahead of quarterly expectations when it reported last week, but shares continued their descent on futures order weakness and competition from Under Armour and Adidas: ""Nike's Q1 'Peppered With Red Flags' As Under Armour, Adidas Take Share."" Broadly, casual athletic and basketball shoes were the top performers last week, said Weiner.Nike shares dipped 0.5% to close at 51.79 in the stock market today, trading well below their 50-day line after breaking support at the key level on Sept. 8.Under Armour eased 0.1% to 37.78.

The Dow Jones industrial average again got an assist from Nike (NKE).The Dow rose 0.3%, the S&P 500 climbed 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite added 0.1%. Volume was tracking higher across the board in the stock market today vs. the same time Thursday.Gaming software, apparel makers and oil drillers were among the biggest gainers, while automakers, data storage and tobacco stocks lagged.Nike led the Dow again with a 2% jump in fast turnover, on track for a fifth straight up session and at a five-month high. The athletic shoe and apparel giant in December reported quarterly results that beat forecasts, while rival Under Armour (UA) gapped down and plunged 23% on Jan. 31 after its earnings and sales missed.On the IBD 50, Nvidia (NVDA) in early trade rose 3% in brisk trade and regained a 120.03 cup-base buy point, but reversed lower to a 2% loss. Mizuho, which has a buy rating on Nvidia, boosted its price target to 130 from 115. The graphics chipmaker reported a solid Q4 earnings and sales beat, but guided for Q1 sales of $1.9 billion, in line with views for $1.88 billion. It also expects non-GAAP gross margin of 59.7%, a slight slip from Q4's 60.2%.Among other IBD 50 stocks, insurers Essent Group (ESNT) and Primerica (PRI) led the upside with gains of about 3% each. Both stocks are extended from buy points.Jack In The Box (JACK) popped 3% as it surged back above its 50-day line and drew closer to a 113.40 entry of a flat base. SunTrust raised its rating on the fast-food chain to buy from neutral and its price target to 122 from 102.On the downside, Yelp (YELP) plunged 9%, gapping down below its 50-day line in heavy volume. It had been forming a cup base with a 43.46 entry. The online review site's Q4 results late Thursday came in above views. But its Q1 and full-year revenue outlook disappointed.RELATED:Nvidia Earnings, Sales Crush Views As Demand Booms In All Markets, But Guidance Is So-SoYelp Q4 Mostly In Line, Revenue Outlook Light, Stock Falls

26,UA,"Since Nike last reported quarterly earnings, a few things have changed.America elected a new president, Adidas is back at the No. 2 spot in the U.S. athletic market and Nike's upcoming second-quarter earnings release will no longer prominently feature its highly watched ""futures"" orders, a metric that has been known to move share prices.Of those factors, the contentious election might be the least impactful on Nike so far. Shares have only slipped 0.6% since Nov. 8, though the stock has tumbled 19% this calendar year. Nike dipped 0.1% to close at 50.85 on the stock market today, dropping further below its 50-day line.""I don't think the election has impacted consumer demand, but many apparel retail stocks have traded down on concerns over possible changes to trade regulations,"" said Morningstar apparel retail analyst Bridget Weishaar (who does not cover Nike), when asked about the impact of the election on the broader retail environment.When Nike reports after the close Tuesday, per-share profit is expected to decline 4% to 43 cents on 5% revenue growth to $8.09 billion.Significantly, this will mark the first earnings release that does not share the company's futures orders, a Nike-made term that reflects products scheduled for delivery to retailers.As the company points shoppers to its app, website and stand-alone Nike stores, the metric is losing some relevance — at least, to Nike, which said in its last earnings call that its ""evolving business mix"" means that futures and revenue are less correlated now.Shifting the disclosure to the earnings call with management may alleviate some of the pressure around the quarterly figure, particularly following the last three quarters of missed forecasts.IBD'S TAKE: Wondering what happened last quarter? Nike beat on both the top and bottom lines but its stock took a hit when futures growth fell short of expectations. You can stop looking at that metric now, said Nike.Meanwhile, Adidas and Under Armour (UAA) remain pressing challengers.Nike ""faces potentially peak market share and operating margin in N. America as Adidas remains in a robust product cycle while Under Armour expands distribution and categories,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Kernan in a Dec. 6 report, downgrading Nike to market perform from underperform.Its three-striped rival, Adidas, is back in the spotlight following a sluggish period in the U.S. that saw the athletic apparel maker ceding its second-place spot to Under Armour in 2014. The Germany-based maker of Superstar and Stan Smith shoes has since clawed its way back up, however.From NPD Retail Tracking service, Adidas has once again attained #2 spot in US sport footwear & apparel, passing UA. and behind Nike/Jordan— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) October 25, 2016Investors and analysts will also be looking for further signs of slowing in Nike's basketball business.But such concerns are ""overdone"" and ""shortsighted,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser on Monday, highlighting the company's brand and innovation pipeline. He has a positive rating on the stock.""The point is, NKE doesn't remain complacent for very long and the stock chart reflects this,"" said Poser. ""Historically, shares rallied 20%+ following other periods of investor angst (Mar-Sep 2002, Jan-Aug 2006, May-July 2012). We believe the recent pullback is a buying opportunity.""Also next week, mall-based athletic shoe retailer Finish Line (FINL) will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Analysts expect a loss of 18 cents a share, narrowing from a 49-cent loss a year earlier. Finish Line sells shoes from Nike, Under Armour and Adidas.After breaking out past a buy point on Dec. 8, Finish Line stock has fallen for six straight sessions.RELATED:Skechers Comeback Seen; Nike Loss To Under Armour, Adidas Could RampNike Seeks 'Energy Harvesting,' Augmented-Reality PatentsUnder Armour Clinches First Pro-Sports Deal; Nike Gets Nod From HSBC

27,UA,"Confirming earlier reports, Under Armour (UA) said Monday that it has clinched a 10-year deal to be the official on-field uniform provider of Major League Baseball, starting in 2020.Financial terms weren't disclosed, but the contract is a major first for the apparel and footwear brand — its first professional sports league deal.Last year, Under Armour was reportedly one of the names vying to outfit the National Basketball Association after Adidas decided not to renew its partnership, but Nike (NKE) ultimately won out. (Under Armour struck a deal to become the official outfitter of the NBA Draft Combine, however, starting in 2018.)Under the deal, licensed sports merchandise company Fanatics will manage the manufacturing and distribution of both Under Armour and Fanatics fan gear at retail, according to Under Armour.Under Armour will also provide the pro baseball league's players with its Connected Fitness offerings, which currently include a fitness band, smart scale and heart-rate monitor.The companies will replace VF (VFC)-owned Majestic Athletics. VF said in March that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its licensed sports group business, a division that includes Majestic.In a statement, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank called the deal a ""watershed moment"" for the brand. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, San Francisco Giants catcher Buster Posey and Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper are just a few of Under Armour's MLB endorsers, and viewer enthusiasm for baseball reached fever pitch this year as the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908.Shares of Under Armour rose 1.4% to 30.44 in the stock market today.Meanwhile, Nike received an upgrade from HSBC to buy from hold and a price target bump to 60 from 56. The bank acknowledges that the stock is the worst performer on the Dow this year, but the ""reality isn't that grim,"" and Nike ""could be a good stock or 2017 ... and beyond.""IBD'S TAKE: Some fear that Nike's innovation streak is slowing, but a recent patent-application dump from the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office show that the Swoosh has some futuristic offerings in the works.""The company epitomizes, in our view, the 'captain of industry' status in a growth sector, and even though we accept that alternative brands may be gaining share at times, we feel the company is still poised for superior growth and returns long term,"" wrote HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg in a Monday note.Nike shares climbed 2.75% to 51.85, retaking their 50-day average for the first time in three months.RELATED:Major League: Under Armour-MLB Deal Means It's Here To Play BallUnder Armour Challenges Nike Dominance With NBA Deal

28,UA,"Nike (NKE) beat first-quarter forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, but futures orders growth was weaker than expected, sinking shares initially late Tuesday.Going forward, the impact of ""futures orders"" on the stock is changing, however, as Nike CFO Andy Campion announced during the call that the sports apparel titan is no longer releasing those figures with its quarterly reports.""The relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix,"" said Campion. From now on, futures will ""first be referenced in the context of broader guidance"" in the earning call instead of as a standalone, forward-looking metric in its earnings releases.The Nike-created metric, which represents products scheduled for delivery to retailers, is probably the most closely watched quarterly result outside of earnings and revenue.The change in futures reporting could be indicative of Nike's continued investments in its direct-to-consumer business, which grew 22% on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter, including 49% growth at Nike.com.@IBD_elow i think it indicates that the metric is less important as their owned retail business grows— Matt Powell (@NPDMattPowell) September 27, 2016Shares closed up 1.8% to 55.36 in the stock market today, then dropped 2% after hours as investors focused on Nike's performance in the U.S. Rival Under Armour (UA) edged up 0.4% late.Here's the rest of Nike's quarter, by the numbers:Estimates: Analysts saw a 16% earnings-per-share gain to 56 cents on 5% revenue growth to $8.87 billion.Results: EPS of 73 cents on revenue of $9.1 billion. Futures orders ex foreign currency were up 7%, while consensus was reportedly about 8%. North America futures orders grew only 1%. Brean Capital had pegged its ""estimate buyside bogey in ~+6% range."" North America revenue, minus currency effects, grew 6% from the prior year, an acceleration from Q4's flat sales.China revenue rose 21%. Overall inventory grew 11%.Prior Quarter: Q4 2016 EPS was flat on 6% revenue growth. Worldwide futures orders, excluding currency effects, rose 11%.Stock: Nike breached its 50-day line on Sept. 8 and spent but a few sessions above the 200-day moving average since April. Nike scores a relatively weak IBD Composite Rating of 31, which means 69% of all other publicly traded companies outperform the sportswear giant in a combination of technical and fundamental factors.Why It Matters: The Swoosh dominates athletic apparel, but creeping competition from Under Armour, Adidas and other athletic brands is nipping at Nike's heels.IBD'S TAKE: Nike is part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing industry group, which currently ranks a lowly 189 out of 197 tracked sectors.

"
31,UA,"Among the latest crop of sometimes peculiar and futuristic patent applications from Nike (NKE), all in the name of getting you pumped for a workout: an ""energy harvesting device,"" an augmented-reality workout buddy, and motivational music streaming.Unlike Under Armour (UA) and its dive into fitness trackers this year, Nike's been rather quiet on the wearables front, instead opting to team up with Apple (AAPL) on a Nike-edition Apple (AAPL) Watch.But its 60-plus patent-application dump, which the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published Thursday, indicates that the Swoosh is still steadfastly working on wearable technology, particularly items designed to be integrated into workout clothes and footwear — i.e., stuff that not only can be tossed into the washer and dryer, but can actually be recharged in the washer and dryer.Remembering to charge a battery-powered fitness band (like a Fitbit (FIT), perhaps?) can be a chore, argues Nike in one set of patent applications, and can lead to inconsistent use, reducing its efficacy.Its solution? An ""athletic activity monitoring device with energy capture,"" which wouldn't necessarily need batteries to run. Just toss it in the dryer, and ta-da! — your wearable shirt is all powered up.""In one example, one or more energy harvesting devices may be incorporated into an item of athletic apparel of a user, and such that heat energy may be stored as the item of athletic apparel is laundered,"" says one application filing. ""This heat energy may subsequently be used to generate electrical energy using one or more thermoelectric generator modules.""Another Nike patent application published Thursday relates to an augmented-reality system in which a user's performance would be ""displayed during a future exercise routine to motivate the user to improve performance during their next workout"" — again, in the interest of motivating exercisers and making working out less of a ""chore.""Yet another application points to a way for a wearable to link to a training module, presumably app-based, to use current athletic activity levels — like heart rate, speed, even stride — to determine what kind of music to play next.""If the user is feeling mellow, the system may select slower-paced songs. If, on the other hand, the user is feeling upbeat, the system may select faster-paced (e.g., more beats per minute) songs,"" according to the filing.Such a system might even try to dangle a carrot in front of you, even if you're not feeling up to working out more.""The training module may, at a particular time interval of the workout, play a high-tempo audio track, regardless of the user's identified desired activity level to motivate the user to run longer or faster,"" it said.The global sportswear titan is on track to be granted 700 patents this year, up from about 500 a year for the last three years, according to recent research from Macquarie. By contrast, Under Armour racked up just 19 patents in 2014 and 20 in 2015.And innovation and investment in R&D can arguably translate to return on equity.In analyzing patent activity from Nike and its annualized ROE performance, ""we tend to see somewhat of a consistent pattern between ROE performance and the increase in the number of patents granted,"" wrote Macquarie analyst Lauren Vasilescu on Nov. 14.IBD'S TAKE: Nike has long been active in the patent-filing space. In fact, it has more U.S. patents than a defense contractor making stealth jets, a pharma developing cancer-fighting drugs, and an auto giant working on self-driving cars: ""Why Nike Has More Patents Than Lockheed, Ford And Pfizer.""While consumer demand and other factors are no doubt in play, Vasilescu pointed out that granted-patent growth is ""now surpassing the growth in ROE (year over year) for 2013.""""We believe this could bode well for Nike as the company begins to benefit from further product differentiation going forward,"" he said.Nike shares were up 1.2% to 50.65 on the stock market today. Under Armour fell 1.1%, Fitbit added 0.7%, and Apple dipped about 1%.Meanwhile, Skechers (SKX) shares are popping Thursday, up 16% at 26.40 following an upgrade from Buckingham Research to buy from neutral. Analyst Scott Krasik also raised his price target to 31 from 21 after liking Skechers' new assortment of products at a recent trade show.""We believe SKX is one quarter away from a potential sales inflection, which historically has been a catalyst for the stock as investors prioritize sales momentum over EPS growth by according SKX its highest P/E multiple in the first year of any new cycle,"" he wrote.Plus, a little insider trading appears to imply bullishness about the company. Skechers CEO Robert Greenberg disclosed in an SEC filing Wednesday that he had acquired half a million shares of the stock to the tune of about $11 million, which Krasik says is ""his first buy in 15 years.""Greenberg has ""historically has been a good stock timer (i.e., seller),"" he wrote.

Volume fell on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Top industry groups in the stock market today included fiber optic gear, wireless telecom service, chipmaking and fabless semiconductor stocks. A sharp drop in gold mining and various oil-related shares hurt the S&P 500 and the Dow more than the Nasdaq.Lumentum (LITE), a leading name in IBD's fiber optic industry group, rose more than 2% to 41.40 in dull trading. The maker of optical data networking components and lasers is set to report third-quarter results on Thursday. Wall Street sees earnings rising 76% to 44 cents a share.Lumentum's earnings dropped 14% in the year-ago period, then jumped 29%, 191% and 156% in the three most recent quarters. Lumentum has held above its 50-day moving average all throughout its run since breaking out past a 27.49 buy point in a cup with deep handle on July 20. (The accompanying chart shows Lumentum's solid move on a weekly chart, with the 10-week moving average painted in red.)In the restaurant sector, Burger King chain and Tim Hortons coffee and doughnut chain operator Restaurant Brands International (QSR) raced to a six-week high of 47.49 but then reversed badly, falling 5% to 44.67. Volume ballooned more than four times its normal level and the stock sank below its 50-day line.On Monday, the Ontario, Canada-based company reported a nearly 35% jump in third-quarter adjusted profit to 43 cents a share. That marked the sixth quarter in a row of solid earnings. Systemwide sales rose 4.8% at Tim Hortons and 7% at Burger King in constant currencies. Same-store sales rose mildly, up 2% and 1.7%, respectively.QSR had recently cracked above longtime resistance at the 45 price level with a high-volume breakout on July 20 past a 44.12 entry. Now, watch to see if the stock can find support at the former resistance level.Back to Apple, the mega-cap tech rose 0.9% to 117.65, meaning it's extended past a 110.33 buy point in a long cup with handle pattern. The pattern began to really take shape after the iPhone maker gapped up and tested upside resistance at its 200-day moving average on July 27, one day after it reported results for the June-ended fiscal third quarter.Six weeks later, Apple sold off but held above its now-rising 50-day moving average — a clear sign that the tables were turning for the largest company in the U.S. markets by market cap. That bullish action set up a breakout past the 110.23 intraday high in a handle that formed from Aug. 16 to Sept. 13. A day later on Sept. 14, Apple rallied more than 3% and cleared the 110.33 buy point. The cup with handle became a bottoming base.More recently, shares made another constructive pullback and the stock formed a second handle that featured the 116.38 buy point — 10 cents above the handle's high of 116.28. Keep in mind that's a risky alternative entry for the stock.The 5% buy zone from the new 116.38 buy point extends to 122.20.On Sept. 2, Apple's 50-day moving average crossed back above its slower-moving 200-day line, a positive sign.Apple is slated to report after the close Tuesday; earnings are seen falling 16% to $1.65 a share after jumping sharply in the year-ago quarter, up 38%.Wall Street sees revenue falling 9% to $46.9 billion. The most bullish estimate among 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is $48.3 billion, which would still be down 6.2% vs. the $51.5 billion Apple posted in the year-ago quarter.Also on Tuesday, expect quarterly reports from Under Armour (UA) (before the market open), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE). All four firms will report before Tuesday's market open. Under Armour is expected to deliver a 108% increase in earnings to 25 cents a share and a 21% rise in sales to $1.46 billion.Under Armour still lies 28% below its all-time-week peak of 52.95 and currently gets a lowly 34 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. The stock's 16 Relative Price Strength Rating is virtually no better than rival Nike (NKE), which is also lagging the market over the past 12 months with a 13 RS rating.The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to almost 1.77%. U.S. crude oil futures edged 0.6% lower to $50.52 a barrel.RELATED:Apple, GM Are Buys Ahead Of Earnings Tuesday: Investing Action PlanDo You Know How To Spot The Bottoming Base Pattern?T-Mobile US Posts A Strong BreakoutAre You Buying Top Growth Stocks At The Right Time?When Did Apple Initially Break Out?

39,UA,"Consumer adoption of wearable fitness trackers continues to rise and Fitbit (FIT) is well positioned to gain market share, Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a report Monday. But Fitbit's rising expenses are likely to ding earnings next year, he said.Kernan cut his price target on Fitbit stock to 18 from 20 and maintained his market perform rating. Fitbit stock closed down 0.4% to 14.78 on the stock market today.""Our survey data indicates consumer adoption of fitness wearables remains on a rising trend with Fitbit dominating the market, which should support future unit growth albeit with somewhat unpredictable product cycles,"" Kernan said. ""Consensus margin forecasts for fiscal 2017 are optimistic given the cost of funding global growth.""IBD'S TAKE: Fitbit ranks No. 10 out of 11 companies in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which company leads the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Cowen survey data shows adoption of fitness wearables is increasing among those who exercise. Fitbit had 49% usage share with that group in August, followed by Nike (NKE) (33%), Apple (AAPL) (20%), Under Armour (UA) (18%) and Garmin (GRMN) (13%).The Cowen survey showed Apple's Apple Watch making gains in the market, while Nike and Under Armour lost ground for their devices and mobile apps.Kernan said his estimate for Fitbit's 2016 earnings per share is within management's guidance. But he believes consensus EPS estimates are too high for 2017.Kernan lowered his 2017 EPS estimate for Fitbit to $1.29, below consensus of $1.43. He believes Fitbit's sales and marketing expenses will be higher than expected by Wall Street as the company increases its presence worldwide.RELATED:Fitbit Downgraded On Charge 2 Reception, Apple Watch Win

40,UA,"Under Armour (UA) reported a solid third-quarter earnings and sales beat, but that was overshadowed Tuesday morning by lowered growth projections, despite management's bullish assurances that it has the long-term game in mind.""While we expect to continue to significantly outpace the apparel industry, the growth rate going forward will be less than expected than investor day in 2015,"" said Under Armour CFO Chip Molloy in prepared remarks, outlining plans to ""invest more heavily in areas that we can grow faster,"" such as footwear, international and direct-to-consumer as it ""aggressively"" enters the sports lifestyle and sport fashion categories.""We could choose to optimize for more near-term profits but we believe it is more prudent to invest to maintain superior growth rates while gaining both share and scale,"" he said.At last year's investor day meeting, management planned for operating income of $800 million by 2018, a 23% compound annual growth rate.While it upheld broader revenue goals of $7.5 billion by 2018, Molloy said the company sees annual operating income growth ""in the midteens in each of the next two years as we focus on investing to get big fast.""Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, sounding agitated at times during the earnings call, repeatedly hammered home the point that his growth plans required more investment dollars in the short term.""We're not saying we're losing money,"" he said, ""we're moving and marching forward.""But investors fled, with shares nose-diving 13% to close at 32.89 on the stock market today. Under Armour has been under its 200-day moving average for most of the last 11 months.Meanwhile, Nike (NKE) shares finished 1.6% lower.Plank also laid out three key areas for Under Armour: ""getting big fast, making retail a core competency, and getting more shoes on feet.""Funding growing markets abroad might require additional investments in the near future, but they are ""central"" to the goal of market leadership, he told analysts on the call.Under Armour's footwear and international segments are performing better than the management expected, but the lost revenue from the recent sporting goods retailer bankruptcies — such as Sports Authority and Sports Chalet — weighed on the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Adidas first made inroads with the runway set, then came back with a vengeance for the retro-loving, sneaker-wearing masses. Now it's poised to get the spotlight this holiday season: ""Uh-Oh, Nike, Under Armour — Adidas Is 'It' Brand This Christmas."" Other costs are in play. Sponsorship partnerships are now 10- to 15-year deals, up from 5-year agreements, he said, citing the 15-year UCLA partnership.Plank said he is ""looking honestly at this moment in time and saying it is time for us to invest.""CFO Molloy said that as the company approaches the $10 billion revenue mark and gains scale, it should see gross margin improvement and be able to leverage its investments in IT systems, distribution and other areas.In the short term, however, gross margin should be ""flat"" over the next couple of years, Molloy told analysts.Before the call, at least one analyst didn't seem fazed.""While this is clearly below our expectations, we believe the sell-off in the stock is overdone and would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy early Tuesday.The company's quarter, by numbers, below:Estimates: Profit growth of 9% to 25 cents a share on 21% sales gains to $1.46 billion.Results: Earnings rose 23% to 29 cents a share as sales climbed 22% to $1.47 billion. But gross margins fell to 47.5% from 48.8% a year earlier ""reflecting negative impacts from the timing of liquidation, increased promotions, and foreign exchange rates.""Outlook: Q4 revenue growth of 20%, below consensus views for 22.2% growth. Management sees 2016 gross margin shrinking by 0.80 percentage points and slowing growth in the North American apparel business.Bonus detail: On Monday, Under Armour rolled out plans to launch the Curry 3 next week. The sneakers will retail at $140, slightly pricier than previous iterations. And if there are concerns about Kevin Durant nicking some of Steph Curry's Golden State glow — and Curry shoe sales — don't be worried, say R.W. Baird analysts on Monday.""Durant joining Golden State likely will help to elevate Curry's national presence, and the enhancements to the Curry 3 should strengthen broader confidence in near-term footwear projections ... and the longer-term opportunity,"" wrote Baird's Jonathan Komp.Here's a peek at the new shoe:

42,UA,"Major stock indexes were moderately lower with about one hour left to go in Tuesday's session, unfazed by a robust reading in consumer confidence from the latest IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.Leading growth stocks were under a lot of pressure, while earnings and tepid guidance from 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and Whirlpool (WHR) didn't help matters.The Nasdaq composite was down 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.3% each.One bit of good news was the latest reading from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index. It soared 9.9% in October to 51.3, its highest reading since April 2015.In the stock market today, New Oriental Education (EDU) jumped 10% despite reporting its third straight quarter of decelerating earnings growth. Investors focused on a sales beat and upbeat guidance. It's now extended from a 48.51 buy point. New Oriental was a rare bright spot in the IBD 50 as half the names on the list were down 1% or more in late trading.Steel name Ternium (TX) extended gains, rising 4% to 23.89. It's still in buy range from a 23.69 buy point from a cup-shaped base. Earnings are due Nov. 3 before the open.It was an ugly session for Under Armour (UA) as shares gapped down, falling 13%.

43,UA,"The major market indexes turned south Tuesday morning as earnings reports continued to dominate stock action and with Apple's (AAPL) results due out after the close.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sank 0.3%. Volume was mixed, tracking higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Monday.Apparel makers, restaurants and building-related stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today, while steel, gold and metals miners outperformed.Procter & Gamble (PG) led the Dow with a near-5% jump in heavy volume, regaining its 50-day moving average, after the consumer products giant reported better-than-expected quarterly results.Also among blue chips, United Technologies (UTX) rose 1.3%, Caterpillar (CAT) edged higher; 3M (MMM) fell 3%, while Home Depot (HD) and Nike (NKE) were each down 2%.Apple was quiet, falling fractionally ahead of its earnings report. Shares have trended higher the past four months and are 4% off their 52-week high. Analysts expect the iPad maker to earn $1.65 a share, down 16% from the prior year, on a 9% sales decline to $46.9 billion. That would mark a third straight quarter of year-over-year declines on both the top and bottom lines.Under Armour (UA) gapped down and tumbled 14% to a nine-month low after reporting Q3 results that beat estimates, but offering guidance below analyst forecasts.Sonic (SONC) crashed 17.5% to a two-year low in massive trade after the burger chain reported fiscal Q4 earnings that topped views, but revenue that missed estimates.In economic news, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index rose 5.1% year over year in August and 0.2% on a monthly basis, meeting views.

45,UA," Nike (NKE) has filed a patent application with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office for a ""portable steaming system for articles of footwear"" as its billion-dollar Flyknit business grows larger.According to the patent application, published with the USPTO on Thursday: ""Articles of apparel, including articles of footwear, may be placed in steaming system to help customize articles of apparel for a user's fit and comfort.""The boxy device looks peculiar to the uninitiated, but a select few wearers of Flyknit shoes — which mimic the feel of socks with their minimal material — may recognize the illustrated machine as a smaller version of the shoe-customizing equipment that reportedly popped up three years ago in London and New York.In videos from back then, the Flyknit shoes are placed in the black metal box for about half a minute, then re-emerge in a puff of steam. The shoes are then worn immediately, the idea appearing to be that they are essentially molded to the wearer's feet amid the steam shrinkage.TheNextWeb said in 2013 that the ""steaming lounge"" at London's Niketown was the only available steamer in the world, and gadget website T3 reported, also in 2013, that the custom steam-fitting was a limited-time offering in New York and London. (There is, however, a 2014 YouTube video of the steam-fit machine that is said to be located at the Nike store in Berlin.) Nike could not be reached for immediate comment.What the company intends to do with a portable version of the device — roll one out in every retail store? Sell them to Flyknit fanatics? -- is unclear.But what Nike has made clear is that it views itself as an innovation machine that values its knitted running shoes.Flyknit products are ""a premium business that lifts the premium nature and the financial impact of premium products on every category in our business,"" said Nike Product & Merchandising President Jeanne Jackson at the company's 2015 investor day last October.Shares of Nike rose 0.1% at 55.41 on the stock market today but have been trading below their 50- and 200-day lines for the past two weeks. Rival Under Armour (UA) rose 0.7% to 39.89, but hitting resistance at its 200-day average.IBD'S TAKE: Nike has more U.S. patents than a defense contractor making stealth jets, a pharma developing cancer-fighting drugs, and an auto giant working on self-driving cars. For more, read: ""Why Nike Has More Patents Than Lockheed, Ford And Pfizer.""Meanwhile, Nike is moving ahead with other product innovations. At an event in March, Nike introduced its ""Back to the Future""-inspired HyperAdapt self-lacing shoe, among other items. On Tuesday, Nike tweeted that HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes will be released on Nov. 28.HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available in the U.S. at select Nike retail locations. Appointments to experience & purchase begin 11.28.16. pic.twitter.com/t3YVLa8Rsl— Heidi Burgett (@heidiburgett) September 20, 2016Jefferies analyst Edward Plank said in March that Nike's new technologies would ""likely spark a wave of scalable revenue and category opportunities over the next several years.""""Flyknit became a $1B biz since its 2012 launch, and while it's admittedly early days, we see similar potential here,"" Plank wrote on March 21. ""Using Flyknit as a proxy for the HyperAdapt self-lacing and VaporMax Air technologies, assuming a conservative ASP of ~$195 on footwear, crossover to other platforms (as Flyknit did), and unit run rates of up to ~8M pairs gets us over $1.5B for those two technologies alone.""Add new technology, price hikes and newer versions of the product, and Plank sees a $2.5 billion-$3 billion opportunity, ""if not more.""Nike's shareholder meeting is today, Thursday.

46,UA,"Athletic-apparel powerhouse Nike (NKE) reports earnings and revenue results for the first quarter of its new fiscal year on Tuesday. Here's a peek at what to expect.Wall Street is anticipating Nike's Q1 earnings to decline 16% to 56 cents a share, in what would be its first decline in four years, on 5.5% revenue growth to $8.88 billion.Shares are trading below the key 50-day moving average after losing support at the line on Sept. 8. The stock has only popped up above its 200-day line for a few brief sessions since breaking support in April. Shares fell 1.4% Monday.Look for the usual update on what Nike calls ""futures orders,"" i.e. product orders scheduled for delivery, which are a watched closely as an indicator of demand. In Q4, that figure dipped into single-digit percentage growth, the first time that has happened since Q3 2014.Revenue has disappointed analysts for the previous three straight quarters.Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, who calls Nike a ""core (long-term) holding,"" said in a Friday report that the market is looking for 9%-10% in global futures orders, including 5%-6% in North America futures.Under Armour (UA), which recently debuted a new high-end, fashion-conscious line at New York Fashion Week, isn't helping. The Baltimore-based brand has the backing of star endorser Steph Curry, the NBA's MVP, and is increasingly ferreting its way into the wardrobes of young people across America.But Weiner noted that Nike's basketball business seems to be ""regaining traction"" and finding its footing again.""While we recognize that Nike's basketball category (ex. Jordan) is seeing greater competition from Under Armour, Nike has combated the Curry platform's growing popularity by introducing lower price point models of its KD and LeBron shoes,"" he wrote.IBD's TAKE: Nike is part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing industry group, which currently ranks a lowly 185 out of 197 tracked sectors. To figure out when a buying opportunity may present itself, IBD University has tips on ""How To Find And Evaluate Stocks.""Investors and analysts will also likely be listening for any commentary from management that relates to its sometimes-smaller but pesky rivals. Piper Jaffray downgraded Nike earlier in the month on ""accelerating"" pressure in Europe from not just Adidas but also Puma, New Balance and even Adidas-owned Reebok.Once a fading brand in the U.S., Adidas has re-emerged in popularity, upping its full-year guidance no less than four times this calendar year and getting the nod from the fashion crowd.The Swoosh may not need to worry just yet, though. Adidas' improving performance in the U.S. and Canada is a ""slight headwind for Nike, but probably less so than feared,"" wrote R.W. Baird analyst Jonathan Komp on Thursday. He has an outperform rating on the stock.""While the FQ1 report may not resolve all of these issues, we suspect Nike remains on track to achieve full-year targets and believe the stock should be bought during periods of controversy,"" he wrote.RELATED: Nike's Latest Patent Filing May Boost Billion-Dollar Flyknit LineFinish Line Win Streak Collapses On September SlipAdidas Isn't The Only Comeback Kid Nike Has To Worry AboutApple, Nike, Lululemon Downgraded; Western Digital PT Raised

47,UA,"Under Armour (UA) is no longer a smart-alecky young upstart but a well-known contender in athletic apparel, talked about in the same breath as Nike (NKE) and settled in the good graces of American teenagers.Yet sales threaten to slow, if Street estimates are correct, when Under Armour reports early Tuesday.Earnings are expected to rise 9% to 25 cents a share. Sales should grow 21% to $1.46 billion, which would mark both a sequential and year-over-year revenue deceleration.Under Armour shares closed down 0.1% at 37.90 on the stock market today. The stock has been trading sideways for the last month or so, remaining below their key 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Its peers haven't been doing much better. Nike stock rose 0.2%, but has been steadily sliding further below its two key averages since early September.Still, a solid swath of Wall Street has a positive view of Under Armour, with outperform, overweight, positive or buy ratings from the likes of Baird, Cowen, Piper Jaffray, Susquehanna and Mizuho Securities.The Sports Authority and Sports Chalet bankruptcies are in the rearview mirror, and Kohl's (KSS) will start carrying Under Armour merchandise nationwide in early 2017, which Cowen analysts see benefiting the brand by $400 million to $700 million in annual wholesale volume.Other positives from Q3 likely include: solid exposure at the Rio Olympics, back-to-school shopping season and Stephen Curry's Under Armour-branded tour of China as the company aggressively expands its reach in international markets.And Piper Jaffray's latest teen survey indicate that while Adidas might be the hot brand of the holidays, Under Armour is edging up in the rankings.However, Morgan Stanley remains typically bearish on the stock with an underweight rating, citing faster-than-anticipated brand maturation and valuation concerns.IBD's TAKE: Adidas first made inroads with the runway set, then came back with a vengeance for the retro-loving, sneaker-wearing masses. Now it's poised to get the spotlight this holiday season: ""Uh-Oh, Nike, Under Armour — Adidas Is 'It' Brand This Christmas."" Analyst Jay Sole said the bank's research suggests that Under Armour stores have produced same-store sales declines in two of the last three quarters.""Plus, our reads indicate sales in the premium channels not covered by industry data sources such as Foot Locker, Finish Line and Dick's Sporting Goods are average at best,"" he said.Foot Locker (FL) shares ended 1.4% higher Monday.

New Era still has hat rights.Under Armour and Fanatics replace VF (VFC)-owned Majestic Athletic, which has been MLB's on-field jersey partner and fan-gear maker since 2005. It also makes fan gear for NFL, NHL, NBA and collegiate teams. VF said in March that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its licensed sports group business, a division that includes Majestic.Under Armour shares closed up 1.8% at 38.30 on the stock market today.

Finish Line stock had risen for seven straight sessions after finding support at the 50-day line in mid-September.In Q2, Finish Line brought in sales of $509.4 million, a 5% rise, while per-share profit fell 7% to 53 cents, meeting forecasts. Wall Street had expected $494.8 million in sales.The sports apparel and footwear chain, which carries brands Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA), reported same-store sales of 5.1%, higher than some analysts' estimates. It maintained guidance for 3%-5% in revenue growth and $1.50-$1.56 in per-share earnings for the year.Current Street estimates have the company's full-year revenue growing 3.5% with EPS of $1.54.""We believe that new CEO Sam Sato continues to be conservative with guidance, store rationalization, and omnichannel initiatives; a better mix could drive upside to FY17 guidance in 2H,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson in a note released before the Finish Line earnings call.But she later told Bloomberg that September's performance was softer than expected.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Finish Line have been forming a yearlong cup-with-handle base. What does that mean, and how close is the stock to breaking out? Check out Thursday's Stock Market Today: Live Edition for chart analysis of the stock: ""Nasdaq Hits New High; Boeing, Yahoo, e.l.f.

53,UA,"Nike (NKE) rival Adidas ramped up its full-year forecast for the fourth time this calendar year, once again citing ""strong brand momentum.""Ahead of its second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 4, Adidas said it now expects a sales growth rate, minus currency impacts, in the ""high teens,"" up from prior guidance for 15% in revenue gains for the year. And it sees net income from continuing operations growing 35%-39%, vs. its earlier outlook for 25% growth.The company also reported preliminary Q2 revenue growth of 21% and basic EPS that doubled from the prior-year quarter.The quarter got a positive bump from the early termination of its sponsorship of Chelsea Football Club. (Nike was quick to pick up that endorsement deal, thought to be worth about $87.5 million a year.)Adidas has been enjoying something of a comeback. The Ultra Boost shoe is said to be selling well, and the retro appeal of footwear like the Superstar is making the Three Stripes a fashion favorite once again. The reportedly calculated disappearance and retail return of Stan Smith court shoes also helped drive demand.By contrast, Under Armour (UA) isn't exactly considered a style influencer -- although that hasn't stopped the much-maligned ""Chef Curry"" shoes from selling like hotcakes.Under Armour shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today, finding support at their 50-day average. Nike shares slipped 0.6%, closing just below their 50-day average.IBD'S TAKE: Nike may be king of the court, but its shares are off about 19% from their late December high of 68.19. And Under Armour's stock sliced support at the key 200-day line on Tuesday despite meeting expectations and announcing several new offensives.Experts say Adidas shoes are also performing solidly on the secondary, resale market, where exclusivity matters and limited-time-only collaborations with celebrities like Kanye West and Pharrell Williams translate to demand. But the Swoosh remains on top.""Despite losing dollar share to Adidas, Nike/Jordan still retains close to 90% share of the sneaker volume transacted through StockX, whereas Adidas' share is more like 6%-7%,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Edward Plank following a meeting with Josh Luber, the head of sneaker resale exchange StockX.""As the far and away leader in volumes, we think this is a clear indication of strong demand for Nike's products,"" he said.On the manufacturing side, each of the three athletic apparel brands has been working to improve their supply chains, toying with 3D printing and less-wasteful product creation. In the long term, the moves are expected to cut costs and bring product to shelves more quickly.And BB&T Capital analyst Corinna Freedman pegs Adidas as being ahead of its peers.""While both Nike and Under Armour have also unveiled plans to innovate their supply chains over the past year, we believe that Adidas appears to be the farthest along in rolling out these initiatives on a commercial basis,"" she wrote on July 19.

55,UA,"Run DMC's sneaker-themed hit came out 30 years ago, but 2016's teens are all about ""My adidas"": Piper Jaffray's semiannual teen survey points to the iconic Three Stripes — not Nike (NKE) or Under Armour (UA) — being the ""It"" brand this holiday season.The firm, which initiated adidas at an overweight, with a 173 euro ($190) price target, said that the brand is in a good spot to take advantage of the ongoing athletic trend. Adidas trades on the Frankfurt exchange.""For the last several years, Nike has dominated the athletic brand space from a share and growth perspective,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy on the heels of the firm's semiannual survey of teens. ""This year, we believe brands like adidas are clawing back share. We expect healthy competition between the major brands to fuel further innovation in the category.""The results suggest adidas is the ""It"" brand this holiday, she said.Adidas' popularity with the fashion crowd in recent years appears to be trickling down to mall shoppers, as shoes like the Superstar and Stan Smith — in all their retro goodness — make a comeback. The company has pumped up its outlook no less than four times this year.Once considered something of a fading star in the U.S., adidas burst through to the top 10 list for both young men and women who were asked about the most popular brands in school, according to the survey.It is now the No. 4 preferred footwear brand among upper-income teens, up from the No. 7 spot last year, and is gaining share among upper-income young women.Meanwhile, Under Armour received an upgrade to overweight from the firm. Under Armour shares are ""poised for re-accelerated global growth,"" wrote Murphy in a separate note following the survey, citing an uptrend in athletic shoes, improved traction in womenswear, accelerating growth abroad and Kohl's (KSS) introduction of the label to its stores.IBD'S TAKE: What else are the young excited about? Apple and Fitbit, says the survey. The GoPro? Not so much: ""Teens Stoked About iPhone 7 But GoPro Is So Yesterday.""The Baltimore-based brand, endorsed by NBA star Steph Curry, has been ""taking shelf space in markets like the UK and Germany, and brand awareness continues to rise."" And Curry's recent tour of China went over well, said the Piper Jaffray analyst, who expects more solid quarterly results from the company's China segment.Under Armour hit No. 7 — its highest spot ever in the poll — on the list of preferred footwear brands for upper- and average-income male teens.Under Armour shares rose 0.8% to 38.49 in the stock market today.

59,UA,"Adidas' Great American Comeback story is running on increasingly stylish shoes -- and picking up momentum.In news that might cause Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) to sit up a little straighter, Adidas (ADDYY) on Thursday reported hefty second-quarter North American sales growth.""Footwear . . . for us, in rebuilding the brand, is probably more key than apparel, at least short term,"" Adidas North America President Mark King told Investor's Business Daily. ""First half, we're up more than 50% in overall footwear sales, so that's a really great trend for us.""The ""Originals"" segment and the running shoes business both enjoyed 60% sales growth in the U.S. in the first half of 2016, King told IBD, adding that ""a lot of things are working for us.""The Originals unit includes iconic shoes like the Stan Smith, Superstar and Gazelle, all of which have been enjoying a moment in the spotlight as retro styles are back in fashion. The Ultra Boost in particular is ""doing very well,"" King said.IBD'S TAKE: As the Rio Olympics kick off, see how Under Armour could steal the spotlight from Nike, following a major shift in the rules for sponsorship.Adidas' ongoing image makeover has been well-documented, and its offerings have received a positive reception in fashion circles. Now Wall Street has taken notice -- or as Jefferies analyst Randal Konik put it in a Monday report: ""NOTE ADIDAS IS BACK! THIS IS A BIG DEAL!""He added that Adidas' domestic resurgence ""poses an ongoing threat"" to Under Armour.And Cowen analyst John Kernan said on Tuesday that the firm's surveys show that while Nike ""leads dramatically"" as a preferred clothing and shoe brand, Under Armour and Adidas have ""gained slightly recently.""Recent sales data are backing up the turnaround. In the U.S., Adidas had lagged Nike and Under Armour in recent years, with Under Armour overtaking the Three Stripes as the No. 2 athletic brand by sales, according to a Sterne Agee CRT analysis of SportScanInfo data.In the June-ended quarter, however, Adidas' overall North American sales of 788 million euros, or about $873 million, outweighed Under Armour's North America sales of $827.1 million. Q2 sales of the flagship Adidas brand in North America -- that is, minus Reebok -- grew 32%, accelerating from 31% in Q1 and 12% in Q4.By contrast, Nike recorded flat North American sales in the May-ended quarter, and Under Armour's sales for the region grew 22% in its June-ended quarter.Meanwhile, all three are forging ahead in making manufacturing advances that involve automation. BB&T Capital Markets analyst Corinna Freedman noted in mid-July that while Nike and Under Armour have also debuted supply chain innovation efforts, ""Adidas appears to be the farthest along in rolling out these initiatives on a commercial basis.""King said Adidas is looking to bring automated production to the U.S. ""in the next couple of years to be really fast on some footwear franchises.""How much of this is a reaction to the rise of ""fast-fashion"" brands? King says it's more about appealing to a consumer that wants new and exciting things often.""We're trying to react to this faster than we have in the past, faster than our competitors and the better we perfect this, the more we're growing,"" he said. ""So I think there's a long runway here for growth because of being able to adapt to consumer behavior, and I think that's really the key.""

60,UA,"Under Armour (UA) is still riding the Steph Curry wave, but macro factors might have weighed on the sportswear maker's apparel sales in the second quarter, says one analyst.""We expect Footwear to remain the strongest category, driven by the Curry 2 and 2.5, and while we model Apparel segment growth of 20%, we do believe there is risk that this category could post less than 20% for the first time since Q3 '09, given a weak domestic backdrop,"" wrote BB&T Capital Markets analyst Corinna Freedman, who rates Under Armour a hold.When Under Armour reports on Tuesday, Wall Street analysts are broadly anticipating the Baltimore-based company to report a penny in per-share profit, which would mark a 75% tumble from the prior-year's 4 cent take.Revenue is seen growing 28% to $1 billion.The Golden State Warriors' trip to the NBA Finals kept Under Armour star Curry in the spotlight through the spring.Perhaps surprisingly, however, a recent Cowen consumer preference survey reveals a decline in Under Armour's popularity as a basketball shoe brand over the last six months among the key 18-34 male demographic. (Nike (NKE) and its Jordan brand effortlessly dominate the space.)But the same survey also shows an uptick among women of the same age who gravitate toward Under Armour products, and results indicate that the brand is still on the path to increased popularity.""(Under Armour) continues to gain market share when it comes to the total survey population's brand preference for athletic apparel,"" wrote Cowen's John Kernan in a July 20 note.The lukewarm retail environment hasn't been kind to stores and brands, and Under Armour recently trimmed full-year revenue guidance to $4.925 billion from $5 billion following the news of Sports Authority's bankruptcy proceedings. Under Armour will take a $23 million write-down during Q2 related to the sporting goods retailer's liquidation.Jay Sole of Morgan Stanley, who has been bearish on the brand, ""continue(s) to believe (Under Armour) will not deliver the sales or EPS growth the market expects, and this could cause UA's 70x P/E to contract.""Morgan Stanley rates the stock underweight with a 31 price target, with Sole highlighting in his research a slowing U.S. athletic apparel space, among other factors.Athleisure may not be done with its run as a style statement just yet -- whether or not we have reached peak athleisure is a now-perennial topic of discussion -- but investors and analysts are likely also expecting some commentary about Under Armour's yet-to-be-released fashion-oriented line, Under Armour Sportswear, and how that could impact its appeal.""UAS gives Under Armour the opportunity to further expand its core apparel business in North America, including with women,"" wrote Deutsche Bank's Dave Weiner on July 12.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour is expected to record a year-over-year earnings decline for the first time in several years. Nike fell short of revenue views when it reported Q4 results in late June, but here are a few possible reasons why shares have been on an uptick since the report.Under Armour shares rose 1.7% to 43.59 on the stock market today, after regaining the key 200-day line in mid-July.

69,UA,"If you like energy stocks, perhaps you've been licking your chops lately.After crude oil peaked in the summer of 2014, oil stocks fell furiously. IBD's integrated oil & gas industry group fell 51% to multi-year lows in January 2016, even as the S&P 500 marked new highs. Continental Resources (CLR), part of IBD's U.S. oil exploration group, slid from a 2014 high of 80.91 to a January 2016 low of 13.94, down 83%.The market is changing, though.For a long time, Energy ranked dead last among the 33 sectors featured in IBD's Smart Tables for NYSE and Nasdaq-listed companies. No longer.As seen in the latest stock tables, viewable online in the Data Tables section of Stock Lists at Investors.com, the Energy sector is now ranked No. 2. With WTI (West Texas intermediate) near-term futures holding firmly above the $70 level, the gigantic energy sector is showing signs of life again.Marathon Oil (MRO), one of two energy plays in IBD Leaderboard, has excelled since it jumped out of a nifty cup with handle at 18.76 on May 3 this year. That 13-week base is part of a bigger, longer cup-type pattern. So, you can interpret Marathon's action since December 2016 as a base-on-base pattern.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGo to a weekly chart and you'll see the integrated oil firm went through an Odyssey-like venture to multiyear lows, going from a 2014 high of 41.74 to a low of 6.52 in 2016. Serious destruction. But Marathon has recovered. The company has recently scored two solid quarters of profits and serious revenue growth (up 23% in Q4 2017, up 62% in Q1 2018).Shake Shack (SHAK), seller of one of the most popular burgers in the country, is forming a bottoming base. And Apple (AAPL) has thrived since it broke out of its own bottoming base, an 11-week cup with handle that completed at the end of 2016.Apple broke out of that perfect base on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12. Today, shares are hovering near 172, up more than 45%. Not bad for the largest company in the U.S. equities markets in terms of market value.In many cases such stocks won't become CAN SLIM-quality leaders for years. Yet eventually any sector in the stock market that is bludgeoned this badly will come back. But what should the disciplined investor look for in terms of these stocks' chart action?After the bear market of 2008-09 ended, sending the entire market to its knees, some growth stocks stopped kneeling. After the S&P 500's March 12, 2009, follow-through bottoming signal took hold, companies with excellent products, top-drawer management and industry-leading margins came back. They formed what IBD Chairman William O'Neil likes to call bottoming bases.What are the characteristics of a bottoming base?First, they form when the market has undergone a cataclysmic bear market. When the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq composite drops 40% to 50% from its highs, expect former growth stock leaders to drop 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times that amount. That's why you'll see some former market darlings fall 60% to 75% from their peaks, even more.The stock needs ample time to form the right side of a bottoming base. Think months, even years. Why so long? You want confirmation that institutional investors accumulate shares in a big way and eventually tip the scale from one of excess supply (funds are extra-willing to sell their shares) to excess demand (extra-willing to buy at any price).The traits of good bases all apply. Look for big up weeks in price in heavy or rising weekly volume. Seek symmetry within the base. If a handle forms, it should slant downward along the handle's price lows and volume should dry up. The base should show tight trading.Finally, keep an eagle eye out for a strong breakout to a 52-week high in heavy trade to trigger a buy point. Remember, for a bottoming base to complete, a stock doesn't have to necessarily trade at or near an all-time high.

Shares dove 84% from its August 2007 peak during the 2008-2009 market slide. But the fast-growing sports apparel maker offered a stylish, performance-driven alternative to other brands. Yogafit founder Beth Shaw notes that UA was unusual in marketing its brand at trade shows for the exercise and health and wellness industries.The stock bottomed out at 11.94 on March 6, 2009, then rebounded for the rest of the year. Shares climbed more than 20% from an entry in September, but a breakout attempt in October flopped fast.But UA later formed better-quality bases, including a nearly six-week flat base with a 40.10 buy point in August to September 2010. The base showed light volume in each of the three down weeks.UA also showed solid ratings at its Sept. 9, 2010, breakout, including a 95 Composite Rating, 97 EPS, 93 RS and B+ for Accumulation/Distribution. Just days earlier on Sept. 1, the market followed through. UA doubled in six months before hitting choppy waters during the 2011 market correction.See Full Series On Smart Chart Reading(A version of this column was first published on June 6, 2016.

70,UA,"A solid concentration in top-performing stocks, including Facebook (FB,) Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC), and a strong fund management team have helped Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX) beat the S&P 500 and its large-growth Morningstar category in the past one, three and five years.X Those leading stocks, along with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), account for nearly a fifth of the $30 billion fund's assets.Since its inception in 2003, New Insights has been managed by the legendary Will Danoff, who ran it identically to its widely followed $134 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). In 2013, John Roth, who also manages $8 billion Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock (FMCSX), joined as co-manager, bringing with him his midcap expertise. Since late 2015, Danoff and Roth have been splitting the management of the fund 60%-40%.The fund focuses on companies that have strong growth prospects, solid management teams and whose potential is misperceived by the public.""If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, video ... we're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer,"" Danoff told IBD.Having two managers may well be the reason why New Insights is more diversified at the top than Contrafund with top 5 holdings representing 17.3% vs. Contrafund's 24.1%. In addition, 26.7% and 37.9% of each fund's assets are in the top 10 holdings, further drawing the distinction.New Insight also holds nearly 10% more midcaps, is somewhat underweight technology and has a lower overweight in financials vs. the benchmark and its peers than Contrafund. Both sectors have been strong performers in the past several years.As a result, New Insight's performance has been trailing a bit that of Contrafund's, returning 22.91%, 11.89% and 14.35% the last one, three and five years vs. Contrafund's 27%, 13.45% and 15.92%. Both funds pulled back slightly in the recent, albeit short, market correction, but quickly recovered ground and are up 5.44% and 6.57%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 2.41% year to date.Regarding concerns that we're late in the economic cycle, Danoff notes the differences between now and conditions that led to bear markets like 2008-09.""The starting point (after the crisis) was quite drastic,"" said Danoff. ""So even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing their costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending. ... The world is much more global, U.S. companies are able now to sell their products all over the world and the big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive, so they're high margin, high growth and they're highly cash generative.""But it's not just the top hot stocks that determine a fund's longevity and strong performance. Other winning names include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), PayPal (PYPL), Visa (V), Estee Lauder (EL), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and United Health (UNH), each of which soared between 40% and 87% last year, compared with the S&P 500's 21.8% return.Netflix, which the fund has owned since early 2015, has been benefiting from a strong international momentum for its brand and stronger-than-expected subscriber additions in the U.S. and overseas."" Netflix is crushing it overseas,"" said Danoff. ""They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding and it's a subscription model offering great value.""The top name for creative design programs, Adobe has successfully transitioned to a recurring revenue model by moving its product lineup to the cloud. Last month, the company said that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring, though he'll stay on until they find a replacement. Adobe's earnings jumped at least 40% in each the past four quarters, while revenue increased 22% to 27%. The company also raised its fiscal Q1 and 2018 guidance after adjusting for President Trump's tax cuts. Adobe's stock is up 12.5% year to date.Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder has been experiencing strong growth. Its most recent Q2 results saw a 25% EPS rise on sales that grew 17%, primarily driven by strong advances in its skin care product lineup. Analysts expect the company to grow its market share from a current 15% as the company further builds out its e-commerce business. It also stands to benefit from the recent tax reforms. The stock is up 9.8% this year.Customer relationship software maker Salesforce.com (CRM), which rallied 49.3% last year and has risen 6.6% so far in 2018, stands to benefit from a growing product offering and low customer attrition despite strong competition in the sector. The company earnings accelerated in the past two quarters, jumping 63% in the most recent one. Sales grew 25%. Salesforce.com also raised its 2018 sales guidance to $12.5 billion and plans to reach $20 billion by fiscal 2022. Earnings guidance was also upped. It is due to release its next earnings report Feb. 28.In the midcap arena, the fund holds names such as Under Armour (UA), U.K.-based Metro Bank and LogMeIn (LOGM). The fund bought Under Armour last quarter as a starting position and Roth says they'll continue to work on it going forward.""It's a great brand, the stock got to be pretty expensive and expectations were pretty high, they struggled a bit and they got massively re-priced, the Street turned on them and investors turned on them, and then it became an interesting opportunity. ... The ultimate bet is that brand's still good.""RELATED:In A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course?

72,UA,"Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) may be the dominant names in the sports apparel industry, but Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is seen finally engineering a turnaround as activewear remains trendy.Credit Suisse's research ""suggests Lululemon's long-awaited earnings turnaround is likely underway, driven by a best-in-class pricing strategy, normalized inventory levels and supply-chain-driven margin expansion,"" wrote analyst Christian Buss on Tuesday, adding that ""the likelihood of a multiyear merchandise margin expansion phase now seems well-embedded in expectations,"" so long as the retailer maintains momentum.The retail space has been volatile and prone to heavy discounting, but Buss noted that the ongoing activewear trends and ""recent product refreshes"" have kept Lululemon prices intact. The company's current, multi-pronged growth strategy includes product innovation, building out its North American and e-commerce presences and expanding abroad.When the athletic-wear retailer reports Thursday, Wall Street expects second-quarter earnings to rise 12% to 38 cents on 14% sales growth to $515.5 million. Lululemon reported a 12% EPS decline in Q1.Lululemon shares are hitting three-year highs, not far from their all-time intraday high of 82.50 on June 10, 2013. (On that same day three years ago, the company announced the resignation of then-CEO Christine Day, ultimately sending the stock tumbling almost 19% that week.)Lululemon fell 1.8% to 76.85 at the close on the stock market today, closing just above its 50-day moving average after undercutting that key support line intraday for the first time in three months. Lululemon shares may be falling in sympathy with apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and clothing maker G-III Apparel (GIII), which both suffered huge stock losses on their earnings reports Tuesday morning.IBD'S TAKE: Lululemon has earned an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of a possible 99, and is climbing into new-high territory. To see what that means, read: ""Lululemon Pushes To New Highs After Short Consolidation.""Wedbush analyst Morry Brown said he expects ""positive"" results, though those expectations are likely priced into the stock already. He also highlighted that since the beginning of May, Lululemon had outperformed the S&P 500 by 14% vs. its retail peers that Brown covers, which have underperformed the index by 7%.""In our view, the outperformance reflects expectations for strong comps, an inflection in gross margin, inventory realignment and upside to 2Q EPS,"" he wrote, raising his price target on Lululemon to 82 from 80 on Monday.The seemingly endless ""athleisure"" trend plays into Lululemon's strengths as a yogawear and activewear maker, and the brand is moving to grab market share in men's apparel amid Nike's ubiquity and Under Armour's assertive growth. In its previously recorded quarter, Lululemon said its men's category grew 21%, its sixth straight 15%+ quarter.One somewhat quirky innovation is finding success with male shoppers.CEO Laurent Potdevin said during the June earnings call that the company was integrating its ""ABC"" -- i.e. ""anti-ball-crushing"" -- technology into more men's styles ""to keep our male gear destruction-free throughout the day.""Nike shares fell 1.1% to 58. Under Armour lost 1.3% to 41.56.Meanwhile, Abercrombie & Fitch plummeted 20.3% to 18.29. G-III also plunged, losing 20.7% to 33.14, hitting a two-and-a-half year low intraday.RELATED:Abercrombie & Fitch Stock Falls As Tourism Decline Hits Earnings, Sales.

73,UA,"The Nasdaq ran ahead of the major market averages Friday, up 1.2% as rising optimism regarding a GOP tax reform effort helped drive blue chip tech names including Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and United Technologies (UTX) to the head of the Nasdaq 100.X Electronics makers and staffing companies, metals and drug distributors were among the many industries to post gains of better than 3% during the session.The advance was sufficient to lift the Nasdaq past its Nov. 28 peak to its first new high in three weeks. The S&P 500 gained  0.9%, also scratching off a new high as Under Armour (UA) took the index's largest gain, surging 9% after Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold.That put Under Armour shares back above their 10-week moving average and up 32% from a November low, although still deep in a 20-month correction.Railroad CSX (CSX), Barbie-maker Mattel (MAT) and chipmaker Oracle (ORCL) turned in the S&P 500's worst losses, down 8%, 5% and 4%, respectively.The Dow ran not quite as hot as its peer indexes, up 0.6%, but plenty strong enough to once again make news highs. Intel was the leader, up 3% on what appeared to be primarily a tax plan-related move.Small caps also did well with the Russell 2000 up 1.5%.Intel's gain put shares in a buy range on a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average. The rebound occurred in only modest volume, and the chart pattern is also a flat base, so investors have the option of waiting to see whether shares climb past the 47.40 buy point.Microsoft took out its 86.30 buy point, rising nearly 3%  in powerful trade, moving to a new high but remaining well within buy range.Bitcoin drew heavy attention, with the cryptocurrency jumping 10% — back above $17,800.

Goldman Sachs (GS) led the Dow in early action, up 0.5%. Apple saw a o,3% gain slip to flat trade, following Thursday's 1.9% downshift. Apple is attempting on its third weekly advance, holding just above a 156.75 buy point in a three-month cup base.On the downside, a very weak second-quarter report sent Foot Locker (FL) down 25% in opening trade. The undertow from that report sucked Under Armour (UA) to a 4% loss.Foot Locker's earnings miss also struck Nike (NKE), which posted the Dow's largest early loss, down more than 5% in a move that sent shares back below the stock's 10-week moving average.Among FANG stocks, Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) each traded up 0.5%.

77,UA,"Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and Ralph Lauren (RL) were three of the most recognizable U.S.-traded apparel names in Rio. How did they -- and their share prices -- fare at the Games?The clothier maintained its presence as Team USA's official ceremony outfitter, dressing the American athletes first in navy blazers and white trousers for the opening ceremony, then in boat shoes and button-downs for the closeout celebration.Stock: Since the close of Thursday, Aug. 4, the day prior to the Olympic opening ceremony, Ralph Lauren shares have gained about 15%, though much of that was due in part to a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.Win: Reviews of this Olympiad's outfits were mixed, but by virtue of being insanely popular athletes, flag bearers Michael Phelps and Simone Biles drew plenty of viewer attention to their outfits. And as other athletes from across the world clamored for a selfie with Simone -- reportedly backing up the whole procession -- the social media value alone was no doubt tremendous.Loss: Gold medalist Ryan Lochte crossed the line from goofy all-American frat boy to diplomatic disaster when he ""over-exaggerated"" about being the victim of an armed robbery in Rio.Ralph Lauren, along with Speedo and Gentle Hair Removal, have since dropped Lochte as an endorser. U.S. visitors seemed pretty apologetic about it as they left Brazil.Goodbye, Rio! Sorry about Ryan Lochte. https://t.co/bWXs3QfUoY— AP Sports (@AP_Sports) August 21, 2016The Swoosh: Still dominant as an athletic powerhouse, having sponsored a reported 1,500 athletes at the Olympics.Stock: Shares rose about 7% over the course of the Games.Win: People are already ruminating about Nike's new NBA jerseys, with Mashable taking a look at what Team USA's Rio gear means for the upcoming uniforms. Nike officially takes the reins from Adidas as the league's outfitter starting in the 2017-2018 season. The deal will last for eight years.Plus, the sea of neon-yellow shoes on the track made it very clear which brand dominates in running. Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards told Fortune that 70% of the track-and-field gold medalists were wearing Nike.Loss: As an Olympic sponsor, Nike must've spent a pretty penny on the ability to use the rings and other official imagery in its ads. But a key change in Olympic Rule 40 means that Under Armour and other brands have been able to essentially market their Olympians, so long as they're careful enough.IBD'S TAKE: The change to Rule 40 shook up the Olympic advertising landscape and gave Under Armour an opening to steal Nike's thunder in Rio. For a look at how other brands like Apple, McDonald's, Facebook performed at the Games, check out IBD's Brand Olympics series.The much littler athletic apparel brand, though only partnering with a fraction of the number of Olympians as Nike, worked hard to make an impact on the global sporting stage.Stock: Shares are up about 10% since the close of Aug. 4.Win: Sponsoring about 225 athletes in Rio, Under Armour's exceedingly well-chosen endorsement deals include G.O.A.T. swimmer Michael Phelps and Team USA's women's gymnastics team, which includes new all-American sweetheart Simone Biles. (Biles and fellow gymnast Gabby Douglas have individual endorsement deals with Nike, however.)Loss: Its hottest, brightest star of the moment -- i.e. Phelps -- was pictured on the cover of Sports Illustrated wearing Nike sweatpants. Not good.The cover could've been an opportunity for the Baltimore-based brand to shine, but possible confusion over the tricky endorsement landscape at the Games resulted in the Swoosh appearing prominently on the cover while the Under Armour logo on Biles' leotard couldn't be seen.This week's @SInow cover: The stars of a Red Hot American Summer! https://t.co/84wNGCoxLS pic.twitter.com/GpUnxdYPjM— SI Olympics (@si_olympics) August 16, 2016 RELATED:

78,UA,"While much has been written about information technology companies investing in artificial intelligence, Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton notes that many non-tech companies are capitalizing on AI technology as well.Clinton has put together a portfolio of 17 publicly traded non-tech companies that are making investments in AI to improve their businesses. In a recent blog post, Clinton notes that he assembled the portfolio as a ""fun exercise"" and a way to draw attention to the sweeping nature of AI advancements. Loup Ventures is an early-stage venture capital firm.Clinton selected the companies from a range of industries including health care, retail, logistics, professional services, finance, transportation, energy, construction and food/agriculture.""In 10 years, every company will have to be an artificial intelligence company or they won't be competitive,"" Clinton said.Among the companies included is IBD 50 stock Idexx Laboratories (IDXX). Idexx makes products for the animal health-care sector. On its last earnings call, the company said that its latest diagnostic products are using machine learning so the instruments always have the ability to learn and train on new data. One such product that leverages AI is its SediVue Dx analyzer, Clinton said.The other companies on the Loup Ventures list are: Accenture (ACN), Avis Budget Group (CAR), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Deere (DE), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), FedEx (FDX) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).There's also Halliburton (HAL), Interpublic Group (IPG), Macy's (M), Monsanto (MON), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Northern Trust (NTRS), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Under Armour (UA).IBD'S TAKE: Cloud-computing leaders Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google, along with internet giants, have the inside track in monetizing artificial intelligence technology, Mizuho Securities said in a report earlier this month.Among those venturing into the space, Clinton says:RELATED:Are Drone Deliveries And Robotic Gofers Ready To Serve You?Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?Shale Producer Eyes Drilling With Artificial IntelligenceIBM Rated Buy On 'Upside Potential,' Artificial Intelligence Move

79,UA,"Yet again, an NBA Finals that pits the Cleveland's LeBron James against Golden State's Steph Curry. Thus, yet again, another round of ""But what shoe company will win at the cash register?""Beyond the repeat matchup from last year, some things will still be the same when the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors square off for Game 1 on Thursday. LeBron's shoes are still Nikes (NKE). Curry still wears Under Armour (UAA), and his signature shoes are still getting roasted on the internet. A ratings boom could translate into a windfall for both companies, even amid concerns about casual footwear chewing away at basketball-shoe sales.Despite this being the third straight championship with the Cavs and Warriors, a few things are different this time around — namely, Kevin Durant, Donald Trump, and increasing alarm out of the retail sector.Last year, the Warriors didn't have Durant, who enters the finals with his own signature-shoe launch from Nike. The new shoe could lend the athletic-footwear giant, which still accounts for far more market share than Under Armour more star power this year and promotional intrigue.About that promotion: A version of the new KDX sneaker, Durant's 10th signature, will be available on Thursday through Nike's SNKRS app starting at tipoff. But they'll only be available for purchase during the minutes when Durant is actually on the court during Game 1.Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel said in a research note that the KDX shoes ""have been sold out on Nike.com, and multiple stores we checked noted they did not receive pairs (although select locations did highlight having some sizes available).""Nike also said the LeBron Soldier 11 Court General would be available on Saturday. That shoe, the company said, was made ""with direct insight from the top scorer in playoff history"" and featured a gold swoosh intended as ""a nod to LeBron's quest for his fourth championship.""What's more, last year, the United States didn't have President Trump, who has presented a PR problem for Under Armour.In February, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said Trump was an ""asset"" to the U.S. In response, Curry, who supported Trump's election rival, Hillary Clinton, said that word choice was appropriate ""if you remove the 'et.'""Plank later tried to clarify his comments about Trump, taking out a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun to say that the company stood ""firmly for equal rights"" and was ""publicly opposing"" Trump's travel ban.Backlash aside, the vacuum in the retail industry has only deepened over the past year. ""Peak athleisure"" for Under Armour has been a concern.Adidas throwback shoes have hurt Nike and Under Armour, but Foot Locker (FL) this month said the demand cycle for retro shoes has also been ""slowing down."" Sluggish sales related to the NBA All-Star Game in February and delayed tax refunds hurt overall U.S. athletic-footwear unit sales, which fell 2% in the first three months of this year, NPD Group said.And Under Armour in April said sales of its Curry shoes were ""sluggish.""Nike shares were up 0.1% at 52.99 on the stock market today, while Under Armour fell 2% to 19.16.IBD'S TAKE: Even as Under Armour struggles, one analyst in March said that the 'bottom' for its stock has formed, making for a possible buy opportunity. Last June, the austere white signatures released under Curry's name were seen as a kind of accidental foray into norm-core, and were likened to the bathtubs in a Cialis ad and photoshopped into a still from ""Forrest Gump.""In April, it happened again. Curry's new line of ""Oxblood Leather"" shoes were compared to ""a PT cruiser for your feet,"" ""the leather seats to an Acura"" and ""what Darth Vader wears when walking on a treadmill in a hotel gym at 6 a.m.""Curry has worn different versions of the Under Armour Curry 3ZERO during the playoffs, while Nike has rolled out new LeBron shoes during that time. Either way, many of Nike's Jordans series led sales in Q1, according to NPD Group.RELATED:Macy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will WorkJ.C.

80,UA,"Stocks held narrow losses heading into the final hour of trade Friday, with the major market indexes poised to close flat to slightly lower for the week. On the Dow, Nike (NKE) scored big gains on the heels of Foot Locker's bullish earnings report.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were each down 0.2%, while the Nasdaq edged 0.1% lower. Volume was tracking higher across the board vs. the same time Thursday.Steel, gold miners and utilities led the downside in the stock market today. Gold futures dipped nearly 1% to $1,348 an ounce. But farm machinery, semiconductor and apparel stocks outperformed.Applied Materials (AMAT) gapped up to soar 7% to a new high in rapid turnover on strong quarterly results. The chip gear maker could see more opportunities in the smartphone and TV markets, with Apple (AAPL) and Samsung reportedly considering a switch to organic light-emitting diode smartphone screens from liquid crystal display screens.Foot Locker (FL) vaulted 11% in heavy volume to a six-month high after the athletic footwear retailer reported better-than-expected Q2 results. The company cited comp sales gains across basketball, running and classic shoes, as well as apparel.The strong earnings report gave Nike shares a lift. Nike jumped 3% to a three-month high, nearly regaining its 200-day moving average. Volume ran about 41% higher than the usual pace.Nike rival Under Armour (UA) added 2% in light trade.GrubHub (GRUB) led the IBD 50 with a 3% jump in tepid trade, after paring an earlier gain of nearly 7%.

82,UA,"Under Armour (UA) is planning to make its mark in Manhattan. And the athleisure market. And in mid-level department stores across America. But investors soon soured on the athletic apparel maker's quarterly earnings and new moves.During the company's second-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Kevin Plank announced offensives on several fronts, including the takeover of the iconic former FAO Schwarz store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, reportedly beating out Nike (NKE) for the 53,000 square-foot space.He called the move a ""flag in the ground"" for Under Armour's product teams, ""putting the world on notice.""""Being there, at the mouth of Central Park, on the opening of Fifth Avenue, we think it's a great platform for the brand,"" said Plank. ""We're really going to be able to define ourselves as the company we expect to be.""Under Armour will move in by the middle of 2019 at the latest, he said, after another tenant uses the space temporarily.Plank also said the Baltimore-based brand will be found at Kohl's (KSS) as of next year, greatly expanding Under Armour's presence in U.S. stores. He also touted Under Armour's new premium sportswear line, UAS (which he also referred to as a ""flag in the ground."") The first pieces from the collection, designed by Tim Coppens, will be available this September.""This is not about being on trend or capturing the athleisure market,"" said Plank during the call. ""Consumers have the expectation that performance product is not just functional, but is fully executed through fit and style.""Plank sees the collection as an opportunity for customers to not just wear the brand on the field or at the gym, but ""to wear us to school, out at night and other wearing occasions."" He said he was wearing the new UAS line during the call.""I think I look great,"" he said.Investors weren't so sure, with some analysts worried that a move to value department chains would erode Under Armour's brand.Shares initially rose to 44.68 but reversed hard, falling 5.1% to 41.36 in the stock market today and undercutting the 200-day moving average. Nike shares fell 1.35%.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour rallied nearly 23% from its June 27 low to Monday's close. But the stock was working on the right side of a base heading into earnings. Buying before a proper buy point raises the risk of losses. For more on when to buy a stock, check out this Investor's Corner.For the second quarter, Under Armour's adjusted per-share profit of a penny met views, down 75% from the prior-year quarter and excluding the Class C dividend payout. Sales grew 28% to $1.001 billion, essentially in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.002 billion.Apparel revenue rose 19%. Footwear revenue grew 58%, thanks again to the popularity of Stephen Curry's basketball footwear. Accessories sales rose 21%.In North America, Q2 revenue rose 22%. Plank continues to see California as a growth opportunity and says he feels the company hadn't previously been aggressive enough in pursuing the market, hence the ""bold bets"" Under Armour has made in making sponsorship deals with the University of California at Berkeley and UCLA.""We're in the state of California,"" said Plank. ""We do think it's an opportunity for us, but we think it's also a top market globally and something we think is also a bit of a leaping board for us as we look to Asia and other markets abroad too.""International revenue rose 68% (72% excluding currency), and accounted for 15% of total sales during the quarter.The company said it continues to sees full-year revenue of $4.925 billion.Plank added that the ""Connected Fitness"" suite of apps now has 175 million users.""We continue to like UA, given the footwear opportunity (price realization/unit growth), international expansion opportunities and (direct-to-consumer) execution, and see rev growth of (roughly) 30% over the next several years,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson early Tuesday, prior to the call.
"
83,UA," Nike (NKE) rival Under Armour (UAA) reported first-quarter results early Thursday that were better than expected, sending shares soaring.Estimates: Swing to a 4-cent per-share loss from prior-year quarter profit of 4 cents a share, as revenue rises 6% to just a little under $1.11 billion.Results: Under Armour lost 1 cent a share as sales climbed to $1.17 billion.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said that Steph Curry basketball shoe sales are ""sluggish,"" but said that it is already factored into the company's guidance.Stock: Shares jumped 9.9% to 21.67 on the stock market today, moving above their 50-day moving average for the first time since August 2016.Under Armour is well off its all-time high of 52.95 from September 2015. The stock has come under pressure following investor disappointment from the previous quarter's results, CEO Plank's ill-received comments about President Trump, a lukewarm outing at Kohl's (KSS), and a resurgent Adidas, among other factors.Shares of Nike edged 0.6% higher. U.S. shares of Adidas (ADDYY) fell 0.15%.Leading up to the report, Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon expressed last Thursday that he remains cautious on Under Armour.""The trifecta of headwinds that plagued (Under Armour) last year (overexposure to sporting goods, overexposure to NA, and overexposure to performance apparel) has not abated, in our opinion,"" he wrote. ""While UA is working to diversify its channel mix as evidenced by its recent entry into KSS (and forthcoming entry into DSW and Famous Footwear later this year), our checks suggest the apparel segmentation efforts have fallen short of expectations.""RELATED:Foot Locker Sees Weak Earnings: Here's Why The Stock Is RisingGoogle Backs Up Teens: Nike Rival Under Armour Isn't Hot AnymoreNike Is No Longer The Top New Apparel Brand For Teen Boys: Piper Jaffray SurveyUnder Armour Falls On Tepid Kohl's Debut, 'Intensifying' Price War With Nike

86,UA,"Key stock indexes made mild moves en route to a dull finish Tuesday, but some stocks swung sharply following their quarterly results. Under Armour was a case in point, going as high as 44.68 before reversing to a sharp loss after the sports apparel firm reported its first net loss in more than four years.The Nasdaq composite inched up nearly 0.2%, and the S&P 500 edged fractionally higher. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 0.1% lower. Volume grew sharply on both exchanges in the stock market today, according to preliminary data. Under Armour (UA) said it lost 12 cents a share in the second quarter, but its adjusted profit of a penny a share met Wall Street's consensus view. Sales jumped 28% to $1 billion, continuing the firm's record of solid double-digit top-line growth. In the prior four quarters, sales grew a respective 29%, 28%, 31% and 30%. Strong footwear sales helped, rising 58% on the back of hot demand for the company's Stephen Curry-endorsed basketball shoes.As noted in an earlier IBD story, Under Armour wants to bolster its prestige with a new flagship store in the space formerly occupied by FAO Schwarz, the famed Manhattan toy store that closed years ago.It may be a while, however, before Under Armour becomes a stock market leader. It has been digesting long-term gains since topping at 52.95 in September last year. Tuesday's drop sent the stock back to its 200-day moving average -- useful as a gauge of long-term price trends -- and this line has been sloping lower since May.Under Armour gets a middling 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. An investor will likely have more success with growth stocks that are breaking out while showing a Composite Rating of 95 out of a maximum 99 or higher.Meanwhile, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped after hours after it reported bullish Q2 results. The IBD Leaderboard member earned 76 cents a share on an adjusted basis, well ahead of the consensus view of 70 cents. Revenue rose 23% to $759.3 million, sharply beating the $724 million consensus view. The 23% jump stretched Edwards' trend of accelerating top-line growth to a third straight quarter, up from gains of 1%, 9% and 18% in the prior three periods, respectively.Edwards ended Tuesday's regular session up nearly 2% to 108.31, just past a 107.69 double-bottom-with-handle entry.Small and medium-sized business expert Ultimate Software (ULTI) reported Q2 non-GAAP profit of 76 cents, up 23% and meeting the consensus estimate, as revenue rose 27% to $187 million. The stock fell 0.4% to 221.83 in the regular session, extended from a recent 209.81 pivot point.Earlier in the session, JetBlue (JBLU) gained 8% to 18.67 in triple the average volume after the airline posted a 20% jump in Q2 earnings to 53 cents a share, above Wall Street's view, with revenue gaining 2% to $1.64 billion. The stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average but was still flying below its downward-slanting 200-day line. The stock has a lot of lost ground to recover before getting to within proper buy range.The Dow Jones transport average climbed more than 1% on Tuesday.Among IBD 50 names, LGI Homes (LGIH) continued to roll higher, rising 2% to 36.20 in heavy trade. It's now advanced nearly 5% past a new handle entry point of 34.60. Homebuilders rallied on the back of better-than-expected U.S. new-home sales in June to an annualized rate of 592,000, sharply past the Econoday forecast of 562,000.LGI has increased its earnings per share a respective 53%, 124%, 121% and 73% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Wall Street sees Q2 earnings up 35% to 89 cents a share -- a slowdown from the prior four quarters, but an increase that would still meet the minimum 25% gain as required by IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend. This means an investor has a higher probability of making money when buying breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points. The market followed through on June 30.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

95,UA,"Soft basketball shoe sales hit Nike (NKE), while Under Armour (UA) logged another triple-digit sales gain for the week ended July 16.Nike athletic shoe revenue fell 5%, year over year, and Skechers (SKX) dropped 5.2% last week, said Deutsche Bank, citing SportScanInfo data. Under Armour shoe sales, meanwhile, rose 106.5%.Total athletic footwear sales for that week slowed to 5.5% growth, though average selling prices declined. Casual athletic shoes are still showing ""strong growth,"" according to Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, though sales in that category only rose 12.5%, a deceleration. Basketball shoe sales dipped 3.8% following two weeks of more-than-20% growth, he said.Adidas continues to notch decent gains. Sales grew 39.4% for the mid-July week, including a 52.1% gain at its namesake brand and a 51.8% sales decline at ailing Reebok.The Nike Flex and Free, Asics Gel-Nimbus 18 and Adidas Ultra Boost were top sellers.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday.

98,UA,"If the 2012 London Games were colloquially known as the first ""Social Media Olympics,"" then the Rio Games' sophomore outing is in full swing, as Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB), Instagram and Snapchat are abuzz with winning activity from athletes and fans alike.The previous two parts of this series have examined how brands such as Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and McDonald's (MCD) have been making the best -- or worst -- of their time in Rio.Now it's time for a look at perhaps the greatest beneficiary of these Summer Games: the social media universe.NBC's Rio ratings have tumbled about 15.5% vs. London, says the Wall Street Journal, with an even steeper decline of about 30% among 18- to 34-year-old viewers (though it's worth noting that NBC is both live-streaming events and splitting the broadcasting duties across Bravo, CNBC, the USA Network and other Comcast (CMCSA) properties).For younger viewers, for whom a tape delay can seem as antiquated as a rotary-dial phone, #Rio2016 might be more appealing than a remote control -- especially when it comes with direct, behind-the-scenes access to their favorite Olympic athletes.Zuckerberg's well-oiled social media machine has nearly doubled its daily active user base over the last four years, with an average of 1.13 billion DAUs in June 2016 vs. 552 million in June 2012. As the social action moves from desktops to smartphones, mobile monthly active users have nearly tripled since then. Small wonder, then, that Michael Phelps would bother to host a nearly hour-long Facebook Live chat with his fans on the day of his last Olympic race, wherein he confirmed that 1) his favorite dessert is frozen Reese's, ""without question, but the holiday ones, because they're better peanut butter-to-chocolate ratio,"" and 2) he is definitely retiring.""They're starting to hashtag #4moreyears!"" he tells his Olympic roomies during the live-chat. ""No, no guys. No, guys. No, guys. ... (But) I'll be in Tokyo, I'll say that. I'll be there. No competing.""The video has gotten about 3.7 million views since Saturday.
"
99,UA,"Facebook also has the benefit of social hotspot Instagram, which it acquired in 2012. Around the time of the London Games, Instagram had 80 million users; now it has 500 million, with about 60% of those users opening the app daily.And postings from Rio offer an intimate look at the athletes' living quarters, late-night shenanigans and teammate banter that viewers won't find in polished post-game interviews. The Real Athletes Of Olympic Village, if you will.NBC and the ""Today"" show can host formal sit-downs with the Final Five, but social channels are where fans can see the blossoming friendships among the gymnastics quintet play out -- particularly that of BFFs Simone Biles and Aly Raisman, who went 1-2 at the women's individual all-around final.helping a sista out(or should I say grandma👵🏽😘), so if anyone needs a back to be cracked. I gotchuuu 💕A photo posted by Simone Biles (@simonebiles) on Aug 13, 2016 at 4:34pm PDTWith the addition of Instagram Stories (read: the video feature ""inspired"" by Snapchat), the here-for-24-hours-and-then-they're-gone videos are a lure for return users.For what it's worth, NBC Olympics has been doing its part to keep up with its millennial fan base, striking a deal with Facebook to provide the social network with some exclusive content. It's a real change of pace from its official on-air commentary: Speaking of gold-medal activity: Facebook shares are still floating in buy zone after breaking out of a flat base with 121.18 entry in late July. Facebook fell 0.8% to 123.90 on the stock market today.(IBD University has pro tips on when to buy stocks.)There may be no greater testament to the Olympic-sized influence of social media than Leslie Jones' ascendance from live-tweeting mega-fan to official NBC correspondent over the course of the Games.The comedian -- an SNL castmate and 25% of the new ""Ghostbusters"" foursome -- is the Biggest Olympics Fan ever. Her unreserved enthusiasm primarily took the form of posting short Twitter videos from her sofa while clad in a star-spangled outfit and American flag, at least until NBC picked up on the viral popularity of her Games-related tweets and decided to fly her down to Rio.Much of her bleep-able commentary probably can't be rebroadcast on NBC's TV stations -- Vulture has a pretty comprehensive round-up of her pre-Rio coverage -- but it seems like she's keeping all her best work on Twitter and Snapchat anyway.

(The disappearing-photo app reportedly only had around 30,000 daily active users in early 2012.)This time around, it's huge.USA Today has dubbed Team USA Basketball the ""greatest Snapchat team of all time,"" regularly tracking the off-court antics of Kyrie Irving, Draymond Green and company.Example: Getting a mural selfie in a Brazilian favela = just another day for Carmelo Anthony.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said in April that Snapchat users have deeper engagement than those on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, with advertisers starting to allocate money to the rising platform.IBD'S TAKE: Who are the major winners and losers from the Olympics? Check out parts 1 and 2 of the series ""Brand Olympics: The Medal Count For Coca-Cola, Nike, McDonald's"" and ""Brand Olympics Part 2: The Medal Count For Apple, Under Armour And Visa.""The limited-time-only nature of Snapchat's content means users have to remain in constant connection with the app, lest they miss out on important happenings, like the Olympic Village fire drill that prompted Simone Biles to screech, ""The fire alarm's going off! But we got our gold medals!""Via Quartz, which saved the Snap:Save the medals, Simone!So basically, it looks like the Internet has won all the gold medals.

"
104,UA,"The Summer Games aren't just a noble gathering of the world's athletic elite: The event is also a marketing gold mine for official brand partners and sponsors of individual athletes.And perhaps more so in 2016 than in prior Olympic years, trying to harness the life force of the internet can lead to unpredictable results, thanks to an often-rowdy digital commentariat on Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Snapchat and elsewhere. Brands can emerge from the melee as social-media stars or as sore losers.So here's a glimpse at how Coca-Cola (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE) and others are performing in Rio so far:Not Coke's fault, but the soft drink giant got mixed up in a PR debacle when an Olympian from Egypt told NPR that there was no coffee in the Olympic Village, because it was a Coca-Cola-only zone.The story went semi-viral. The New York Daily News, Business Insider, Fusion and others picked up on the NPR segment -- Cosmopolitan even grouped it under a listicle called ""11 Rio Olympic Village Horror Stories.""Spokespeople from Coca-Cola, an official worldwide sponsor of the Games, told several of those outlets that no, the athletes aren't limited to Coke products and yes, there is coffee in Olympic Village, but the damage had been done.That's probably not what gold feels like.Shares rose 0.3% to 43.75 on the stock market today. Coca-Cola stock has been trading below its 200-day average since reporting Q2 results late last month.The Big Mac maker is doing lots of feel-good stuff around the Olympics -- it sent kids to the opening ceremony! Its McNuggets are pink-slime-free! -- but you can trust hungry, tired reporters to weed out the real news: there's no McDonald's in Olympic Park.According to USA Today, Olympiads of years past have prominently featured a McD's in the press center. But McDonald's told the paper that it wanted to get into the local spirit and feature dessert stands instead, of which there are 2,500 in Brazil.There is, however, a full-service McDonald's in Olympic Village. And it is very, very popular with the athletes.Line out the door at McDonald's in Olympic Athletes Village (via @JohnBranchNYT) pic.twitter.com/HJQrxqcP2k— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) August 9, 2016Shares rose 0.5% to 119.38 Thursday.

107,UA,"Nintendo (NTDOY) shares have more than doubled since the July 6 release and subsequent success of its augmented reality mobile game ""Pokemon Go."" But coincidentally, the video game maker isn't the only one bringing the budding technology to the masses.According to patent filings made public recently, Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) each have their own augmented reality (AR) features in the works.According to Nike's July 5 patent, which is a continuation of a previous filing, its augmented reality design system ""allows a user to create a design for an article in real time using a proxy,"" as the illustration above indicates.Basically, users could use the software to design their own custom shoes in holographic fashion, using what appears to be a Google Glass-style headset.This isn't the only instance of Nike delving into 3D technology. The Swoosh announced last October at its 2015 investor day that in partnership with DreamWorks Animation's (DWA) Nova, it is developing a 3D digital design system that will be capable of ""nearly instantaneous digital print applications, photo-real 3D visualizations and ultrarapid prototyping.""Shares of Nike edged up 0.2% to 57.74 on the stock market today.IBD's TAKE: Despite its dominant position in the athletic gear market, Nike's stock has been one of the Dow Jones industrial average's worst laggards.Meanwhile, Apple filed a patent application, published Thursday, for ""synchronized, interactive augmented reality displays for multifunction devices.""Like ""Pokemon Go,"" the tech could be used to create a 3D map of an area, overlaid with information. But Apple has a number of real-world applications in mind that go beyond capturing animated monsters.""For example, a car mechanic can hold (the AR-enabled device) over a car engine and an outline identifying parts and providing excerpts from a repair manual or schematics can be displayed in the live video to assist the mechanic in repairing the engine,"" outlined the Apple patent filing.Doctors might also use it to superimpose medical information over a live video of a patient, or an X-ray or MRI could overlay the video so medical professionals could better diagnose an issue.Apple is reportedly knee-deep in virtual reality and augmented reality development. Patently Apple, a site devoted to Apple's patent filings, has been tracking its augmented reality-related patents for years.Apple shares were up 1.1%  to 99.83 Monday.
"
108,UA,"Watching the Olympics is a decathlon in commercial branding. The mega-marketing schemes that accompany the Games aren't necessarily stock movers for sponsors, but they can go a long way to creating emotional resonance with consumers -- or make a laughingstock out of the brands involved, if the Twitterati are unkind.For Part 2 of the series, here's a look at how Apple (AAPL), Visa (V) and Under Armour (UA) are performing in Rio. (For Part 1, check out ""Brand Olympics: The Medal Count For Coca-Cola, Nike, McDonald's."")Samsung, one of 11 worldwide sponsors of the Olympic Games, is making full use of its official partner status. The gadget maker doled out 12,500 Galaxy S7 Edge special-edition smartphones to athletes in Rio (although whether the North Korean athletes received theirs is reportedly still a question mark). And through a deal with official broadcaster NBC, Olympics enthusiasts with a Samsung Gear VR headset can watch a 360-degree view of Simone Biles' superhuman somersaults.But Apple -- not an official sponsor -- is apparently getting as close to Rule 40 as it can without breaking it: The iPhone maker is stocking its Olympic-adjacent store in Rio with exclusive flag-colored Apple Watch bands, according to Reuters.The Olympiad and patriotism go hand-in-hand, which might make it easy for visitors to believe that the stuff is official merchandise. It's a small move compared with Samsung's enormous campaign, but still a cheaper way for Apple to make an impression than offering up millions of dollars to Olympic officials.Well, at least Samsung U.K. got English comedian Jack Whitehall to wear bike shorts.
"
109,UA,"Apple shares closed down less than 0.1% Thursday at 107.93 in the stock market today.The card processing giant is making sure it's everywhere Olympians want it to be by giving its 45 athlete endorsers an NFC-enabled ring that they can use to pay for things -- one payment-ring-to-rule-them-all, as it were.Visa also rolled out other payment wearables, including a bracelet and the Swatch Bellamy.Shy of some press, none of those widgets appear to have taken off on social media, at least not on Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB) or Instagram. Swimmer Missy Franklin gave #TeamVisa a shout-out almost two months ago, so there's that.Have you ever wondered how athletes get to the Olympic Games? #TeamVisa#Rio2016https://t.co/yhx7n4fEYD— Missy Franklin (@missyfranklin) June 23, 2016But Visa no doubt garnered some goodwill points for sponsoring the 10-person refugee Olympic team.The Baltimore-based athletic brand may have far fewer athletes on its roster than does Nike (NKE), but it has certainly chosen them wisely.Nike's having a pretty good run at the Games, being an official partner and all. (Being the No. 1 athletic apparel brand on the planet also helps.)IBD's TAKE: A change in Olympic rules opened up the playing field to nonsponsor brands that have athlete endorsements. Does that mean Nike is wasting its money by sponsoring the Games?

Volume was tracking lower across the board vs. the same time Wednesday.Retailers, apparel makers and oil stocks led the upside in the stock market today, as West Texas Intermediate crude surged 4.3% to just under $43.50 a barrel. Oil prices rallied after Saudi Arabia said it is watching oil prices closely and would take action if needed to help prop up the market.Under Armour vaulted 5% to retake its 200-day moving average as it works on a 10-month consolidation. The athletic apparel and footwear maker announced three additions to its executive team: Kip Fulks as chief product officer, ex-Amazon (AMZN) executive Andy Donkin as chief marketing officer, and Colin Browne as global sourcing president.Rival Nike, up 2.5%, took the lead among the Dow's blue chips.Macy's (M) gapped up to soar 17%, retaking its 200-day moving average in hefty trade en route to a three-month high. The embattled department store operator reported Q2 results that fell from last year but still topped views. It also announced plans to close 100 stores and focus on its online business.Kohl's (KSS) also gapped up, leaping 17% to a three-month high of its own and jumping above its 200-day line for the first time in more than a year. The department store chain's results beat forecasts, but it trimmed its full-year earnings guidance to lower-than-expected same-store sales.Nordstrom (JWN) jumped 7% to its best level in three months ahead of its quarterly results, due out after the close. Analysts expect a 40% drop in per-share earnings.Economic data slated for Friday, meanwhile, include retail sales for July.Alibaba (BABA) surged 6% to a 13-month high after reporting Q2 results that topped estimates. Yahoo (YHOO), which owns a stake in the Chinese online retailer, enjoyed a 4% pop to its highest level since June 2015.LGI Homes (LGIH) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) led the IBD 50 with gains of 3% or better.

112,UA,"Stocks opened higher Friday, as investors monitored an increasingly tense health care bill standoff in Washington.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1%, the S&P 500 added 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.GOP lawmakers delayed a scheduled Thursday night vote on their American Health Care Act, intended to revoke and replace ObamaCare. Lack of support for the bill led President Trump to urge the vote be pushed to Friday, and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney informed congressional leaders that the president had finished negotiating. He said if Congress was unable to pass the bill Friday, the White House would move on to other issues.How markets will react remains uncertain. The Dow industrial average ended Thursday down 1.2% for the week and tacking toward the index's worst performance since the week just prior to the Nov. 8 presidential election. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%, also looking at its worst weekly showing since the week before the election. The Nasdaq was down 1.4% — it suffered harder hits during two separate weeks in December.All three indexes are near their 50-day moving averages, which suggests a positive session could bring support at that technical level. A tumble below that moving average, particularly in heavy trade, would suggest a loss of support.Intel (INTC), DuPont (DD) and Untied Technologies (UTX)were modestly higher on the Dow industrials.Key tech names: Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) all traded 0.3% to 0.4% higher at the open.Micron Technology (MU) fired off an 11% gain after a huge jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings beat analyst forecasts, and revenue rose 58% to meet views. Management's third-quarter guidance was far above the consensus target. Micron shares are extended after an early March rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Under Armour (UA) gained 3% at the open, boosted by an upgrade to buy from hold from Jefferies. Shares have been in a steep sell-off for 11 months.Western Digital (WDC) climbed 6%.

The carmaker had earlier canceled plans to build a new plant in Mexico. While Trump criticized Ford during the campaign for making cars there, the company said canceling the plant was due to lack of demand for small cars.Others at the meeting included CEOs of Tesla Motors (TSLA), Under Armour (UA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Arconic (ARNC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and U.S. Steel (X).

It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected.

Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion.

Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase.

Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter.

U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains.

Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared.

Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point.

But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.
"
118,UA,"Watching the Olympics is a decathlon in commercial branding. The mega-marketing schemes that accompany the Games aren't necessarily stock movers for sponsors, but they can go a long way to creating emotional resonance with consumers -- or make a laughingstock out of the brands involved, if the Twitterati are unkind.For Part 2 of the series, here's a look at how Apple (AAPL), Visa (V) and Under Armour (UA) are performing in Rio. (For Part 1, check out ""Brand Olympics: The Medal Count For Coca-Cola, Nike, McDonald's."")Samsung, one of 11 worldwide sponsors of the Olympic Games, is making full use of its official partner status. The gadget maker doled out 12,500 Galaxy S7 Edge special-edition smartphones to athletes in Rio (although whether the North Korean athletes received theirs is reportedly still a question mark). And through a deal with official broadcaster NBC, Olympics enthusiasts with a Samsung Gear VR headset can watch a 360-degree view of Simone Biles' superhuman somersaults.But Apple -- not an official sponsor -- is apparently getting as close to Rule 40 as it can without breaking it: The iPhone maker is stocking its Olympic-adjacent store in Rio with exclusive flag-colored Apple Watch bands, according to Reuters.The Olympiad and patriotism go hand-in-hand, which might make it easy for visitors to believe that the stuff is official merchandise. It's a small move compared with Samsung's enormous campaign, but still a cheaper way for Apple to make an impression than offering up millions of dollars to Olympic officials.Well, at least Samsung U.K. got English comedian Jack Whitehall to wear bike shorts.
"
119,UA,"Apple shares closed down less than 0.1% Thursday at 107.93 in the stock market today.The card processing giant is making sure it's everywhere Olympians want it to be by giving its 45 athlete endorsers an NFC-enabled ring that they can use to pay for things -- one payment-ring-to-rule-them-all, as it were.Visa also rolled out other payment wearables, including a bracelet and the Swatch Bellamy.Shy of some press, none of those widgets appear to have taken off on social media, at least not on Twitter (TWTR), Facebook (FB) or Instagram. Swimmer Missy Franklin gave #TeamVisa a shout-out almost two months ago, so there's that.Have you ever wondered how athletes get to the Olympic Games? #TeamVisa#Rio2016https://t.co/yhx7n4fEYD— Missy Franklin (@missyfranklin) June 23, 2016But Visa no doubt garnered some goodwill points for sponsoring the 10-person refugee Olympic team.The Baltimore-based athletic brand may have far fewer athletes on its roster than does Nike (NKE), but it has certainly chosen them wisely.Nike's having a pretty good run at the Games, being an official partner and all. (Being the No. 1 athletic apparel brand on the planet also helps.)IBD's TAKE: A change in Olympic rules opened up the playing field to nonsponsor brands that have athlete endorsements. Does that mean Nike is wasting its money by sponsoring the Games? Read on for more: ""How Under Armour Hopes To Steal Nike's Thunder At The Rio Olympics.""In favor of Under Armour: strategic endorsement deals with the most decorated Olympian to ever live and the greatest women's gymnastics quintet to ever compete.It's what you do in the dark, that puts you in the light. @MichaelPhelps#RuleYourself 🇺🇸 🏊 👏 pic.twitter.com/3zcJiOaZWR— Under Armour (@UnderArmour) August 10, 2016The brand is perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the revisions to hotly-contested-but-slightly-loosened Rule 40, which allows nonsponsors to advertise their Olympians, so long as they refrain from using the words ""gold,"" ""medal"" and, depending on the context, ""summer"" in their marketing material.Curiously, according to this Adweek story, Rule 40 might actually have emerged from Nike's marketing campaign at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
"
120,UA,"A scruffy, bearded Michael Phelps swims punishing laps alone in a darkened pool as an Edith Piaf-like voice croons ""It's the last goodbye, I swear/I can't rely on a dime-a-day love that don't go anywhere.""Cue a montage of the elite swimmer lifting weights, enduring ice baths and fire-cupping therapy, staring wistfully at a leaf-strewn backyard pool as he contemplates something. Actually, it's pretty obvious what the Olympian -- who just won his 19th gold medal on Sunday -- is contemplating, even if Under Armour (UA) isn't allowed to say it explicitly in its ad.""It's what you do in the dark that puts you in the light,"" flashes on the pitch-black screen. ""Rule yourself.""Expect to see that commercial a whole lot over the next few weeks, thanks to a change to the International Olympic Committee's Rule 40 that finally allows non-Olympic sponsors to advertise athletes competing in the Games.The much-talked-about policy shift is a big positive for brands who aren't among the 11 official worldwide Olympic sponsors, like McDonald's (MCD), or any of the 28 U.S. sponsors, like Nike (NKE). But it could especially benefit Under Armour's march toward the global stage.Nike, the far-and-away leader in performance gear, still towers over Under Armour. But the littler athletic company's scrappy-underdog brand image and well-chosen endorsement deals have resonated with young people. Of the three major labels -- Nike, Adidas and Under Armour -- Under Armour is the only one that has not sponsored the quadrennial event before. But the new guidelines may mean that it doesn't have to in order to reap the benefits.""The Rule 40 change really gives (Under Armour) an opening to leverage their athletes,"" said analyst Matt Powell of the NPD Group market research company. ""Before, they were really restricted in how much they could actually (do).""Before Rio, Rule 40 meant that only companies that had plunked down major money to call themselves exclusive sponsors -- like Coca-Cola (KO) or Visa (V) -- were allowed to feature their Olympians in ads during the Games.The restriction ostensibly protected sponsor investments, but it also shut out athletes' ability to capitalize on their medal efforts after years of training, causing a kerfuffle at the 2012 London Games. Non-sponsor brands were not even allowed to tweet ""Good luck at the Olympics!"" to their qualifying athletes.They still aren't. But following the loosening of Rule 40, those that have gotten prior approval can now showcase their finest athletes in ""generic advertising,"" so long as the Olympic rings and the Games' associated verbiage -- ""Olympics,"" ""medal,"" even ""2016,"" depending on how it's used -- are nowhere to be found in the marketing material. Companies had to apply for the waiver six months ahead of the Games.Hence, Under Armour's sentimental Olympic-but-not-really-Olympic commercial that heavily alludes to Phelps' last appearance at the international event. Instead of being kept silent at the world's greatest sports stage, the Baltimore-based brand can tweet and post Facebook (FB) messages, and broadcast their heavy hitters from the rooftops.Under Armour's ode to Phelps brought the athlete to tears when he first watched it, a moment conveniently captured on film and posted on the brand's YouTube page. The reaction video has been viewed over half a million times. The ""Rule Yourself"" ad itself has attracted well over 5.8 million views, the company's second most-watched video on the site despite being posted only four months ago.
"
121,UA,"A similar Olympic-style campaign starring top U.S. gymnasts Madison Kocian, MyKayla Skinner and Maggie Nichols also made the rounds, garnering over 3 million YouTube views in the months before the Games. (Kocian made the Olympic team, and Skinner is an alternate.)""The changes to Rule 40 allow us to fulfill our No. 1 objective, which is to support the nearly 225 Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls tied to the Under Armour brand during the Games,"" an Under Armour spokesperson told IBD via email.And the timing of this effort coincides with Under Armour's push to assert itself not just at home, but abroad.International revenue, as of the company's June-ended second quarter, grew 72% year over year and accounted for 15% of total revenue. That's almost double the 8% of revenue that came from sales abroad just two years ago.""Between Nike and Under Armour, this is a big incremental opportunity for Under Armour and the reason they're being so aggressive,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner told IBD. ""Brazil is a huge market.""The Olympics' host country in particular has been a focus of Under Armour's push to grow its global soccer franchise and sell more cleats, he said. But for all the pomp and hype, the major sporting event only comes around every four years and lasts just two weeks, meaning it's not much of a needle-mover when it comes to stock price or annual revenue.For example, Ralph Lauren (RL), the official outfitter of Team USA, has seen its overall sales fall for four consecutive quarters and is expected to continue suffering declines for the next few years.And while the appeal of Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte in a preppy navy blazer and white pants has not been lost on his fans online, it is unclear whether that will translate into sales for a clothier whose Hamptons aesthetic is increasingly losing relevance on athleisure-dominated sidewalks.For Under Armour, the potential comes from establishing presence.""What it's going to do is allow them to get on conference calls and put together marketing with more confidence that they're one of the top three global brands -- help to solidify some long-term projections by country,"" said Weiner, adding, ""These are the kinds of events where you can drive home the point.""Powell echoed that sentiment, saying that this is an ""important"" Olympics for Under Armour.""But that said, the marketing around the Olympics is not really a visceral kind of marketing,"" but more to show ""that they're authentic and (their) Olympic athletes are performing at a high level.""He said he hasn't really witnessed a case of people watching the Olympics and then hopping aboard the brand train. Still, before the Games had even begun, at least one viewer of the Michael Phelps ""Rule Yourself"" campaign was sold.""I'll buy under armour (sic) just because of this commercial,"" said YouTube commenter Kevin Cass. ""Absolutely one of the best I've ever seen ... Under Armour,....you're the best in my books now. Good luck Michael!!!""As much as Under Armour and others are benefiting from the slight breathing room to Rule 40, the restrictions are still annoying parties on all sides of the equation.Athletes still have to watch what they say.How amazing is this! It's for that thing 😉 I'm doing this summer 😉 in South America 😉 #Rule40 pic.twitter.com/nJ2cQxPlXG— Jade Lally (@JadeLallyT69) July 27, 2016Even waivered sponsors must be careful, lest they face repercussions for accidentally using the trademarked #Rio2016 hashtag or mentioning the Olympics by name on Twitter.

"
127,UA,"Nike (NKE) late Tuesday reported slowing growth for North American sales and futures orders, a sharper gross margin decline than expected, and light sales guidance.But Nike shares -- after sinking after hours on its fiscal fourth-quarter report -- had their best day of 2016. Here's a look at a few reasons why:Analysts snipped away at their estimates, but sounded pretty positive on the athleticwear behemoth's continued reign.Jefferies said Nike is ""still a winning stock for the long term,"" reiterating a buy rating but trimming its price target to 65 from 67. Cowen and Macquarie are holding on to their outperform ratings -- Cowen lowered its estimates but said Nike's long-term potential and ""dominant global position"" meant that late Tuesday's after-hours tumble made shares attractively ""cheap.""BB&T also maintained its buy rating and held steady to its 70 price target. Brean Capital cut its price target to 62 from 68, but still recommends buy.Inventory issues -- as well as labor costs and currency rates -- weighed on Q4 gross margin. But Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards assured investors that inventory levels are ""clean"" and any remaining excess will be taken care of through its factory stores and third-party value channels.Under Armour (UA) had to cut full-year sales guidance due to the Sports Authority's liquidation, but Nike doesn't appear to be affected. The company reaffirmed fiscal 2017 revenue guidance for high-single-digit reported revenue growth.Breaking out its Jordan Brand sales for the first time, Nike said the segment's revenue grew 18% for the year and helped fuel North America revenue and futures orders (orders scheduled for delivery).Amid concerns over lethargy in the basketball space, Edwards said energy for basketball is at ""an all-time high"" and ""we feel really good about the trajectory of the Basketball business.""CEO Mark Parker also talked of ""unleash(ing) the power of the Jordan Brand across multiple categories"" in 2017, in keeping with management's previously touted plans to expand Jordan Brand beyond the mens category.That doesn't mean everything is perfectly rosy for the athletic apparel heavyweight, which will have to work to prevent Under Armour, Adidas and the plethora of other ""athleisure"" brands out there from eating away at its market share.Nike's North America futures orders in Q4 slowed to single-digit growth for the first time since Q3 2014, and overall futures orders for the quarter came in below consensus.Adidas' renewed popularity has come as a surprise to many, and doesn't appear to be slowing anytime soon, announcing Wednesday a new long-term alliance with Kanye West that includes retail stores and new ""performance-intended"" products. Terms of the deal were undisclosed.""Survey results show it gaining preference in (North) America while Boost and Yeezy prices in the sneaker resale market hit new highs,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Kernan, raising his Q2 estimates on Adidas ahead of its early August report. ""In a sector where we see few retailers or brands that can post upside to Street (estimates), adidas is a haven.""Nike stock rose 3.8% to 55.13, its best gain since Nov. 20, 2015, but just two days from hitting a 10-month low on Monday. Meanwhile, Under Armour spiked 5.9%, retaking its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 3.RELATED:Nike Revenue Disappoints For Third Straight Quarter; Orders Slow

131,UA,"LAS VEGAS – Consumer electronics companies already make gadgets for your every waking minute, and now they're going after the minutes when you're asleep.One of the breakout categories of products at CES 2017 involves devices related to sleep technology. Sleep gadgets ranging from smart beds and blankets to relaxation technology and devices that emit calming sounds and scents are on display at the four-day show, which ends Sunday.The Consumer Technology Association, owner of CES, even gave the category its own exhibitor floor showcase for the first time at the 2017 show.Michael Breus, aka ""The Sleep Doctor,"" said sleep technology at CES used to be limited to monitoring devices, usually fitness bands, which track if you had a restful sleep.""Right now one of the biggest problems in the sleep monitoring world is what I call the 'So what?' issue,"" Breus told IBD. ""Let's say I got 22% REM and 18% deep sleep. So what? What can I do with that information? That's where we're starting to head.""Many of the latest sleep devices offer personalized suggestions on how to get a better night's sleep. Others go a step further and help you fall asleep and stay asleep.Sleep tech products at CES fall into three buckets: monitoring devices, relaxation devices and technology infused into existing products such as beds, pillows and sheets, Breus said.Sleep Number, owned by Select Comfort (SCSS), introduced its Sleep Number 360 smart bed at this year's CES. The bed senses and automatically adjusts comfort to keep both occupants sleeping soundly depending on the circumstances, the company said.For instance, the Sleep Number 360 bed adjusts the air columns in the mattress to react to a person shifting from their side, back or stomach sleeping profiles. It also has automatic snore detection and adjustment.Plus, the Sleep Number 360 has a foot-warming feature to help people fall asleep faster.""At our company, what we're trying to do is be the conduit or liaison between real sleep science and translating that so consumers can benefit from what we learn by building it into our products,"" said Pete Bils, vice president of sleep science and research at Select Comfort.The Sleep Number 360 knows when you get into bed and can track your heart rate and respiration as well as sleep cycles and stores that information for you in the internet cloud for review, Bils said.""By the time you hit 50, you'll spend 17 years in a bed,"" Bils said. ""So is a bed important? You tell me.""Athletic apparel company Under Armour (UA) also has gotten into the sleep tech game. At CES, the Baltimore-based company launched its first Athlete Recovery Sleepwear.UA Athlete Recovery Sleepwear was developed in collaboration with Under Armour-sponsored athlete Tom Brady, who credits sleep as one of the most important components to his training regimen.The sleepwear uses bioceramics technology. A pattern of bioceramic particles on the inside of the fabric absorbs infrared wavelengths emitted by the body and reflects back Far Infrared, helping the body recover faster while promoting better sleep, Under Armour says.Under Armour also has added a sleep recovery feature to its UA Record fitness app for smartphones.Also at CES, ResMed (RMD), a medical device firm known for its sleep apnea products, launched a new joint venture to help all people improve their sleep.ResMed has joined surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz and private equity firm Pegasus Capital Advisors on a venture called SleepScore Labs. The initial focus of the venture is to compile and analyze the most comprehensive and accurate collection of consumer sleep data. It will use ResMed's sleep monitoring technology for consumers, the S+ by ResMed.""Our goal is to solve sleep using science,"" said Colin Lawler, chief executive of SleepScore Labs.The consumer sleep market currently generates about $58 billion in annual sales. That includes everything from mattresses, sleeping pills, lotions, accessories and other things, Lawler said.""The problem is nobody knows what works and what doesn't work,"" Lawlor said. SleepScore Labs wants to address that need with scientific research, he said.Cambridge Sound Management, the world's largest commercial sound masking company, debuted its consumer solution called Nightingale at CES 2017.Nightingale produces soothing ambient sounds, called sound blankets, to mask unwanted noises. The sound blankets take into account a room's acoustics and sleep conditions like snoring or tinnitus, said Meghann Ellis, chief financial officer of Cambridge Sound Management.Cambridge Sound Management decided to get into the consumer market after a lot of people asked it to provide a solution for the bedroom, knowing its work from office buildings, Ellis said.

132,UA,"Fresh from a holiday season that saw 4K ultra-HD TVs and Amazon (AMZN) Echo smart speakers among the hot-selling items, the consumer electronics industry is about to make its annual splash to show off its candidates for the Next Big Thing.At CES 2017, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and voice-controlled technology are expected to be among the hot topics of conversation.The annual consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas officially runs Jan. 5 — 8, but preshow events start Tuesday.Produced by the Consumer Technology Association, CES will be celebrating its 50th anniversary with the 2017 show.The CTA expects the massive industry confab to draw more than 165,000 attendees and over 3,800 exhibitors covering more than 2.5 million net square feet of floor space. But the association is known for providing conservative guidance. CES 2016 reached a new attendance record, attracting 177,393 industry professionals from 158 countries. Organizers have been working to limit overall attendance to keep the show more manageable.CES 2016 played host to 3,886 exhibiting companies, and they took up nearly 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.CES 2017 will feature a diverse set of keynote speakers including the chief executives of cruise line operator Carnival (CCL), sports apparel maker Under Armour (UA) and graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).IBD'S TAKE: Has Nvidia peaked? The graphics and automotive chipmaker had its biggest decline of the year on Wednesday and continued falling Thursday. Even with that, though, shares have tripled this year and it remains No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks, a feature that should be on your regular checklist.At CES 2016, fitness wearables, drones, virtual reality, self-driving cars and hoverboards were headliners.The latest advancements of those technologies will be on display at CES 2017, but the tech press always gravitates to the next shiny new thing. After all, what's new is the nature of the news business.Six years ago, CES exhibitors en masse started labeling all their products as smart because they included a processor and connected to the internet. This year, companies are marketing their products as having artificial intelligence, or AI.Among the products at the show being promoted as having AI include cameras, drones, robots, autonomous cars, and even toothbrushes and patio umbrellas.""Artificial intelligence has the potential to be the story of the show,"" John Curran, managing director of Accenture's (ACN) Communications, Media and Technology business told IBD. ""It could be the golden thread that weaves together so much of what's happening at the show.""AI looks to be a core piece of many product categories, combining Big Data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, he said. AI allows for easy access to information and device controls as well as predictive capabilities for personalized experiences, Curran said.Another big theme of CES 2017 is expected to be products with voice controls and virtual personal assistants.Amazon is poised to dominate the show with its Alexa voice-response technology, which powers its Echo smart speakers. Amazon is working to make Alexa a standard interface across a range of consumer electronics devices.Companies at CES will be demonstrating Alexa voice controls in such products as air purifiers, smartwatches, speakers and sprinkler systems.Amazon is even hosting a series of educational sessions at CES on building next-generation voice interfaces with Alexa.Rival voice-based digital butlers, such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home and Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana also will be making their presence felt at the show.""One of the stories to watch at CES will be the platform aspects of these intelligent assistants,"" Curran said.Expect to hear about a lot of product partnerships using intelligent assistants from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and possibly Apple's (AAPL) Siri as those platforms seek to become standards in the home.""This has the potential to be a game changer and unlock a wave of innovation,"" Curran said.Intelligent assistants could spur sales of smart home devices and appliances such as connected thermostats, lighting and home security, he said.Augmented reality systems will be on display at CES 2017 for smartphones, smart glasses, toys, automotive head-up displays and other gadgets. Augmented reality overlays digitally created content into the user's real-world environment.""There's going to be a lot of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality"" at CES 2017, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News told IBD. ""There are going to be 360-degree cameras so people can create their own content (for VR headsets).""Major chip companies, which provide enabling technologies for consumer electronics, will be touting their latest advances at the show. Intel (INTC), Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among those planning a big presence at the CES 2017.Major car companies including Ford (F), Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) also are exhibiting at the show, as are auto tech suppliers such as Mobileye (MBLY), Continental and Valeo (VLEEY).As usual, there are some big no-shows among exhibitors at CES, including Apple and Microsoft, which prefer to do their own product events.Big-screen TVs will remain a staple of the show, with major vendors expected to show off super-crisp OLED TVs and lower-priced 4K TVs with high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging.RELATED:Amazon Gets Big Boost For Echo As Microsoft Readies A Rival DeviceThe Top Selling Products On Amazon Over Holidays Came From ...

133,UA,"Nike (NKE) reported flat year-over-year fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday, topping analyst estimates by a penny, but revenue growth of 6% to $8.24 billion was not enough to top views for $8.28 billion.Worldwide futures orders climbed 8%. Excluding currency effects, it rose 11%, below some estimates.Currency-neutral futures orders -- i.e. product orders scheduled for delivery, and an indicator of demand -- rose 6% in North America, the first time it has dipped into single digits since Q3 of fiscal 2014. The metric jumped 24% in China in Q4, a slowdown from 36% in Q3 and 34% in Q2.But Nike shares ended the day up 3.8% to 55.13 on the stock market Wednesday. Under Armour (UA) rallied nearly 6% to 39.75.Deutsche Bank said in a Sunday note that athletic brands like Nike are outperforming in China, despite indications of a slowdown there.For fiscal 2017, Nike reaffirmed expectations for high-single-digit reported revenue growth, reflecting currency-neutral high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth. Consensus is for 10% growth.In spite of recent volatility spurred by Brexit, management said full-year expectations are ""largely unchanged"" from a growth and profitability perspective.For Q1, it sees mid-single-digit revenue growth. Analysts sees 9% growth.Nike gets only about 3%  of its revenue comes from the U.K., and analysts at Jefferies even pegged Nike as a possible medium- or long-term buying opportunity in the wake of the EU referendum.Meanwhile, Sports Authority's liquidation is having an effect. Rival Under Armour recently took a $23 million write-down in Under Armour's Q2 and cut full-year revenue guidance due to the failed retail chain.Excess inventory issues weighed on Nike's Q4 gross margin, which dipped 30 basis points, due also in part to higher product costs and unfavorable exchange rates.But Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards said during the call that full-price channel inventory levels are ""clean,"" and that the company expects to clear remaining excess inventory through its Nike factory outlets and third-party value channels.By geographic segment, North American revenue was flat from the prior-year quarter, while Western Europe sales rose 19% and Central and Eastern Europe sales fell 4%.Revenue in China, an area of tremendous focus, grew 18%. Japan revenue rose 22%, while emerging markets revenue fell 7%.Converse brand sales grew 18%.RELATED:This Apple Chipmaker, Nike, Wal-Mart Among Post-Brexit Buys: Analyst.

135,UA,"Amid a sometimes-dicey retail atmosphere, Lululemon Athletica's (LULU) big beat late Wednesday surprised many and sent shares spiking 15% in the stock market today to a 3-month high.The yogawear retailer's third-quarter profit and sales figures handily topped forecasts, and same-store sales grew a better-than-expected 7%.Light Q4 guidance and mixed full-year outlook from Lululemon didn't seem to deter renewed enthusiasm for the stock, despite ongoing questions about when the activewear-as-streetwear trend will end.""We believe the 3Q print and the 4Q guide served to stifle what had become increasingly vocal fears, and although competition clearly abounds, we continue to believe LULU shares are attractive and think investor fear remains overblown,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel in a Thursday note to clients. Rating the stock a buy, Siegel upped his price target to 72 from 65.Lululemon faces rivals in the form of performance-focused gear makers Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA), as well as from the plethora of athleisure upstarts like Kate Hudson-founded Fabletics and Yogasmoga, the latter of which told the New York Times in March that it would ""be better than Lululemon, just more authentic.""Lululemon's apparent lack of innovation — at least as interpreted through patent activity — is one of the factors that worries Macquarie, which rates the stock at underperform.IBD'S TAKE: Lululemon received an upgrade to buy from Mizuho and Evercore. Check out this list of key stock upgrades and downgrades. But Wedbush analyst Morry Brown said that Lulumon's strong Q3 results point to bigger earnings power next year and the year after that.Plus, there are opportunities abroad.""Without a single store in China, LULU generated over 10,000 transactions during Alibaba's Singles Day — illustrating strong brand awareness and meaningful potential in the China market,"" wrote Brown, adding that Lululemon intends to ramp up its China presence with two store openings in Shanghai and one in Beijing this December.""We continue to expect meaningful contribution from international markets, particularly Asia, in the coming years,"" he said.Nike shares dipped 1.1% to 51.55.

136,UA,"Nike (NKE) might be losing its grip on young people, while Adidas is expected to log low-double-digit growth in fiscal 2017, according to one analyst. Meanwhile, another Wall Street pro sees Skechers (SKX) growth ramping up next year after losing half its share value over the last year and a half.""Nike's share loss to Under Armour (UA) and Adidas could accelerate,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Kernan on Tuesday, amid high promotional activity in North America and elevated inventory abroad. He downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform and trimmed his price target to 54 from 59.Kernan added that there's a ""high probability"" that Nike will trim its guidance for the second half of fiscal 2017 or guide third-quarter targets below analyst forecasts.Shares fell 2.5% to close at 50.57 on the stock market today, back below the 50-day moving average after retaking that level on Monday. Rival Under Armour shares climbed 1.7% to 30.94.While Nike.com sales growth is ""incredible,"" and its direct-to-consumer business as a whole continues to see growth above 20%, his concerns surround Nike's wholesale efforts — over two-thirds of its business — as athletic fashion trends slow down.Essentially, people's wardrobes are so full of athletic-inspired gear already that at this point they're just looking to replace items, said Kernan, who also sees ""slippage"" in Nike's millennial appeal.""We think competitive pressures from a resurgence adidas, who is leading with a compelling product cycle, and Under Armour, who continues to raise its brand awareness through product and geographic expansion, are chipping away at Nike's share leadership as our survey data implies slippage in the brand's appeal, particularly among millennials,"" he wrote.By contrast, Adidas is on a roll, with its three former Nike designers and limited-edition shoe releases, he wrote in a separate note.Cowen rates Adidas an outperform.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour's appetite for the U.S. market is only growing, and its recently announced deal with Major League Baseball marks its first professional sports league uniform partnership after reportedly losing out on the National Basketball Association bid to Nike last year.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo initiated Skechers at an outperform with a valuation of 30-32, calling it a ""compelling 2017 turnaround story.""Shares have fallen about 50% from their highs 18 months ago, but are ""poised for brighter days ahead,"" wrote analyst Tom Nikic.Analysts broadly seemed impressed by the lifestyle shoe brand's collection at a trade show last week, and Nikic sees double-digit retail store growth for the company.Skechers ended trading Tuesday up 1.4% to 26.50.RELATED:Under Armour Clinches First Pro-Sports Deal; Nike Gets Nod From HSBC

138,UA,"Athletic apparel powerhouse Nike (NKE) has fallen short of Wall Street's revenue expectations for two straight quarters, but analysts don't appear to be as concerned with fourth-quarter results as they are with the year ahead, given the swirl of industry-wide and global events taking place.""The bigger focus will be on (management's) comments/update on the FY17 outlook, particularly in light of the market's increased fears over competition, pressure in high-end basketball and potential risk to (average selling prices)/futures, and inventory hangover in N. America,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Edward Plank.Among the goings-on: Adidas has been enjoying a resurgence in popularity, Sports Authority is kaput, and Under Armour (UA) continues to nip at Nike's heels, though the smaller sportswear brand now also has to contend with an Adidas comeback and liquidation-related inventory issues. There's also concern about lethargy in the basketball category.When Nike reports after the close Tuesday, analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings to slide a penny, or 2%, year over year to 48 cents a share. Revenue is seen growing 6% to $8.27 billion.As always, keep an eye on what Nike calls ""futures"" orders -- global footwear and apparel orders scheduled for delivery for the next several months -- which are seen as an indicator of product demand. At least two analysts are predicting a sequential decline from the third-quarter's 17% order growth, with Cowen seeing a 12% gain and BB&T expecting a 9% rise.Investors can also probably anticipate at least some discussion of world affairs, ranging from the expected, such as growth in China and emerging markets as well as the 2016 Olympics in Rio. to the less so like Thursday's surprising Brexit vote.In a report released days prior to the EU referendum, BB&T Capital Markets analyst Corinna Freedman indicated that a U.K. decision to leave the EU would likely prompt near-term pressure on the macro environment, with the implication being that Nike would also feel the weight of a so-called Brexit.""At a conference in May, UK's House of Fraser CEO, Nigel Oddy, noted that apparel sales were down 9% (year-to-date), with many consumers pausing purchases given uncertainty over Brexit,"" she wrote.""Given that there is no historic example to compare Brexit to, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how this would impact the British and EU economies, as well as consumer spending and retailers.""The U.K. accounts for an estimated 3.4% of Nike's fiscal 2016 revenue and 3.1% of fiscal 2017 projected revenue, or about $1.1 billion in revenue for both years, noted Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu, who examined how various dollar-to-pound exchange rate changes would impact Nike's per-share profit in the upcoming fiscal year.If the British pound settles at $1.30 per pound for the rest of the calendar year, that would weigh on Nike's fiscal 2017 earnings by 2 cents, or 0.7%, he projected. A dip to $1.25 per pound would hit next year's earnings per share by 1.1%, and so on.As of its previous earnings conference call, Nike said it expects high-single- to low-double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth and low-teens earnings growth in 2017.For rival Under Armour, which has less global exposure, U.K. revenue makes up 1.8% of its estimated revenue.""(Under Armour)'s overall exposure to the Pound is very small and shouldn't have much impact if there is negative currency movement in the Pounds value relative to the USD,"" wrote Vasilescu.The pound was down 8.1% at $1.3676 late Friday, the lowest since 2009, after earlier plunging to a 31-year low.Shares of Nike closed 2.8% lower amid broader market turmoil prompted by the winning Brexit vote. Under Armour fell 2.45%.RELATED:Under Armour Still Sees Triple-Digit Growth; Casual Athletic RulesWhy This Analyst Is Bullish On Nike, Even With EPS Decline SeenWhy Nike Has More Patents Than Lockheed, Ford And Pfizer.

139,UA,"Nike (NKE) lifetime endorser LeBron James came out ahead of Under Armour's (UA) golden boy Stephen Curry on Sunday night, as James' Cleveland Cavaliers took home the NBA championship, but shares of both athletic powerhouses were up early Monday.Under Armour's bump could be attributed to Buckingham analyst Scott Krasik upgrading the stock to buy and boosting his price target to 48 from 44. According to a note acquired by Benzinga, Krasik cited expected Under Armour margin expansion down the road despite current higher promotional activity.Nike shares ended the day up 1.2% to 54.36 on the stock market today, though the stock remains well below its 50-day and 200-day lines. Under Armour climbed 2.4% to 38.11, also below both key moving averages.Loss or no, Golden State Warriors' star Curry has helped rocket Under Armour's footwear line to success.

140,UA,"When it comes to basketball shoes, it's no surprise that Air Jordan maker Nike (NKE) still dominates. But Under Armour (UA) is the only major sneaker brand seeing sales growth in this category so far this year, said NPD Group, mostly thanks to Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry.Meanwhile, Adidas is having a ""fabulous"" year, according to Matt Powell, NPD's sports industry analyst. The brand is now reclaiming the No. 2 share in the U.S. athletic footwear market, he said, noting its strong showing in performance running and casual athletic shoes.""Looking at positive brand growth year to date, Nike/Brand Jordan and Converse performed well, but it’s Adidas and Under Armour, with sales up more than 40% and 70%, respectively, that stand out,"" he wrote on Monday.Overall, U.S. athletic footwear sales were ""solid"" in the first third of the year, said the firm, which examined sales through April.One area where Nike is a ""big winner""? Sport slides -- aka the rubbery, Birkenstock-style shoes that typically lurk in dorm-room showers. Powell credits the retro trend for driving sport slide sales up 10% for the year.Powell sees sports retailer bankruptcies doing the most damage early in the second quarter, with sales likely to be ""a little choppy early on"" before leveling out. Both Sports Authority and Sport Chalet parent Vestis Retail Group have filed for bankruptcy. But overall, industry bankruptcies haven't shaken up sales so far, said NPD.Sneaker sales in the latter half of the year should ""bounce back to previous levels,"" he said.Nike shares closed down 1.4%, trading well below their 50-day and 200-day lines. Under Armour shares rose 2.6% in the stock market today, also below both key moving averages.

141,UA,"Lululemon Athletica (LULU) posted first-quarter sales that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by new products like an expanded selection of women’s tops.Sales rose 17 percent to $495.5 million in the quarter ended May 1, the Vancouver-based company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts projected $487.6 million, on average.The results signal that Lululemon’s new merchandise is gaining traction. The yogawear retailer has been adding more innovative pants and fabrics that will appeal both to hardcore athletes and casual buyers. Chief Executive Officer Laurent Potdevin also has focused on efficiency to improve results. Those efforts helped Lululemon report a gross margin of 48.3 percent in the quarter, wider than the 47 percent analysts had estimated.“In terms of the key metrics we were looking for in the quarter, we got everything we wanted, and then some,” Howard Tubin, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said in a note. “Lululemon’s merchandise assortment is resonating with shoppers.”Lululemon shares were up 1.4% to 69.07 as of 9:39 a.m. ET on the stock market today. The stock had gained 30 percent this year through Tuesday.However, challenges remain. Lululemon is facing increased competition from upstart brands as well as larger rivals like Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA). The larger retail environment also has been turbulent as consumers restrain spending amid an uncertain economy.First-quarter profit was 30 cents a share, excluding some items. That missed analysts’ 31-cent average projection. The company forecast that second-quarter profit will be 36 cents to 38 cents. Analysts estimated 39 cents, on average.The retailer also is fending off criticism from its founder, Chip Wilson, who says the company lacks a clear strategy. In an open letter to investors last week, he slammed the chain for losing ground to competitors like Nike and Under Armour. Wilson said he remains the largest Lululemon owner with a stake of almost 14.2 percent.Lululemon responded that it has posted a “strong operational performance” and that it is focused on customers.

Small caps have been leading the current market uptrend. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 trimmed 0.3%, respectively. Volume was sharply higher vs. Friday's half-session pace.The Dow Jones utility average spurted 1.5% higher, while the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index dropped 1.1%.

145,UA,"In June, Investor's Corner covered the basics of a bottoming base pattern.In that story, IBD presented Under Armour (UA) as a stock that hit bottom in March 2009, rallied, took another brief spill, then formed a sound flat base more than a year and a half after the March 2009 lows.A savvy investor needed patience for the Baltimore-based sports apparel innovator to find its footing and then hit its stride by breaking out and rushing to 52-week highs. Yet in other cases, the bottoming base may take less time. So be nimble. You might not need to wait many months, let alone years, to find a golden apple.William O'Neil, who founded IBD in 1984, presented Apple (AAPL) during a two-day CAN SLIM Masters Certification seminar in Santa Monica in June 2010. Apple broke out more quickly from its bottoming base. It also revealed a subtle clue of how a future leader acts when the market is in free-fall.The S&P 500 slid nearly nine weeks in a row from early January to March 2009. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008 and the near collapse of insurer American International Group (AIG) symbolized the mortgage debt crisis. New business orders, lending and jobs came to a halt.Over that nine-week maelstrom of selling, the S&P 500 fell more than 28%. It also undercut a 52-week low of 741 marked in November 2008 (1). During the week ended Nov. 21, Apple also reached new lows; at 79.14, the iPhone maker dropped 61% below its then all-time peak of 202.96. Nine weeks later, Apple tested that low.But in the week ended March 6, 2009, even as the S&P 500 careened lower, undercutting the 741 low (2), Apple held above its recent lows (3) and reversed higher. That was a truly subtle clue of strength.On March 12, 2009, the S&P followed through, rising 4.1% in heavier volume on Day 5 of a fledgling new advance. A follow-through signals that the market may be ready to turn.Turn it did. Just four months later, Apple roared out of a five-week flat base buy point at 146.50 on July 15 in light trade. Turnover accelerated over the next few weeks. By October 2011, Apple hit a high of 426, up 191%.RELATED:Know This Chart Pattern: Under Armour's Bottoming Base In 2010Using Stock Charts Correctly: How To Use Daily And Weekly Charts TogetherThe 2-Minute Tip: IBD Videos On Smart Growth Investing
"
146,UA,"After financial tremors in China sent global stock markets cascading lower in August and again in January, a period of calm has returned, and risk-aversion has receded.Triggered by yuan devaluation fears, the Shanghai composite tumbled more than 25% from the end of 2015 to its Jan. 27 low, hitting its worst level since the tail end of 2014. The Nasdaq fell 16% to start 2016, bottoming on Feb. 11.Yet the risk of even more major shocks coming out of China, rather than going away, has continued to grow. The reckoning has only been postponed by Chinese government efforts to keep the economy afloat with an unsustainable rise in debt.China's $1 trillion first-quarter credit surge, equal to an annualized 46.5% of GDP, was ""one of the highest ratios ever,"" wrote Societe Generale economists Wei Yao and Claire Huang.Unlike China's debt binge at the end of 2008 that helped lift the global economy out of recession, this latest surge of government-funded infrastructure spending and an easy-credit-fueled spike in property values didn't buy much growth. China's GDP expanded just 6.7% in the first quarter, the slowest pace in seven years.Slowing growth amid rapidly escalating debt has troublesome implications. Much of the credit is going to unproductive uses and propping up bad debts. The longer that continues, the bigger the eventual debt implosion may be.A China debt crisis would ripple through the global economy. Commodity producers that rely on China demand would buckle. Global financial markets would see a stampede away from emerging markets and risk generally, exacerbating the direct effects of a China hard landing. U.S. Treasuries, gold and other traditional safe havens may fare well, but not much else.The Shanghai composite rose 0.5% Friday, capping its first up week in seven weeks. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% Friday while the S&P 500 slipped 0.3%.China's official data suggest no great cause for alarm. They put problem loans to the corporate and household sectors at a moderate 5.5% of the total, equal to $641 billion or 6% of GDP. Yet few analysts are willing to depend on China's government data. The International Monetary Fund took a deeper dive into corporate balance sheets and concluded that up to 15.5% of commercial bank loans to the corporate sector, equal to $1.3 trillion, were potentially at risk.A broader look from Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA included banks' off-balance-sheet lending. It concluded that 15% to 19% of outstanding loans are nonperforming, with the potential to rise as high as 25% as the economy deteriorates. CLSA sees potential losses of $1.5 trillion -- nearly 15% of GDP -- or more. That's about twice the amount at risk seen by the IMF, assuming the banks will recover some assets even on bad loans.Now, with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's in March putting China on notice of possible credit downgrades to come, adding to warnings from the IMF and others, China's leaders are talking up a new era of moderation and reform: ""A tree cannot grow up to the sky -- high leverage will definitely lead to high risks,"" declared an unnamed ""authoritative person"" (speculated to be President Xi Jinping) in a page-one interview published by the People's Daily. ""Any mishandling will lead to systemic financial risks, negative economic growth, or even have households' savings evaporate. That’s deadly.""Here's the problem: China has given up trying to rev up the pace of growth. But it's still trying to maintain 6.5% to 7% GDP gains for fear that a bigger slowdown will be too painful and destabilizing. Even that target is likely to be unobtainable, Goldman Sachs predicted earlier this year in a report advising investors to further reduce emerging market exposure.China is ""walled in"" between two likely fates, Goldman Sachs said. It could try to keep the economy from slowing further, letting bad debts fester and swell, ultimately triggering a financial crisis. Or China heads off a debt meltdown with reforms that aren't aggressive enough to prevent ""a prolonged period of slow growth and possibly deflation,"" similar to Japan.""Every major country with a rapid increase in debt has experienced either a financial crisis or a prolonged slowdown in GDP growth. History suggests that China will face the same fate,"" Goldman wrote.From the end of 2007 through mid-2014, China's government, corporate and household debt surged from 158% of GDP to 282%, McKinsey noted in a 2015 analysis. Nominal debt levels quadrupled from $7 trillion to $28 trillion. A more up-to-date analysis from the Institute of International Finance finds debt-to-GDP rising to 295%.Whichever path it takes, most analysts think China has ample resources to stave off a crisis for a year or two, thanks to a high level of domestic savings and prospects for government stimulus and financial bailouts.George Soros, who made $1 billion betting against the British pound in 1992, has said China's credit growth looks reminiscent of the period before the U.S. financial crisis. ""Most of the money that banks are supplying is needed to keep bad debts and loss-making enterprises alive,"" Soros told a crowd at the Asia Society in New York in April. But he noted that the country may be able to keep feeding its bubble for somewhat longer.The comparison with the U.S. subprime real-estate bubble seems apt because it was only when lower-credit-quality mortgage securities lost their AAA credit ratings that liquidity dried up and the financial house of cards started tumbling. China's credit bubble is likewise built on a belief that high-risk investments there are essentially risk-free, writes Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance professor, Ning Zhu, in ""China's Guaranteed Bubble.""Unlike in the West, many ""bond-like"" products in China ""carry implicit guarantees from their underwriters, regulators and, in the end, the Chinese government,"" Zhu writes. ""Many investors believe that, as long as financial institutions are concerned with their reputations, as long as the regulators are concerned with career advancement, and as long as the Chinese government is concerned with social stability, they will take care of the risks that investors themselves should bear when investing in such products.""Zhu cites $500 million in financing provided to the Shanxi Zhenfu Energy Group via the trust product China Credit Equals Gold #1 with a promised annual return of 9.5% to 11.5%. Financing was arranged via state-owned giant Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. After coal prices plunged, the mining company appeared set to default in January 2014, with ICBC denying any responsibility for repaying investors.Nevertheless, investors and lawyers remained calm, Zhu writes, which ""cannot be attributed to Chinese Taoism or Confucianism,"" but only to the expectation of an eventual bailout.As The Economist wrote in 2014, ""Days before the threatened default, a mystery buyer suddenly appeared and acquired some of Zhenfu Energy’s assets. That allowed all the principal to be repaid; in the end, investors lost only a portion of their last interest payment.""In other words, the Chinese government was unwilling to risk the fallout from the removal of its implicit guarantee, which would cast ""dark clouds over China's economic growth and its economic growth model transition,"" Zhu wrote.But this moral hazard only encourages investors and banks to take more and more excessive risks.Chinese authorities' failure to prevent the stock market rout over the past year following a massive run-up has set off a flight to safety for investors. But in China that means a rush into areas of the economy and financing vehicles more assured of government support. Real estate has been the prime benefactor, with home prices rising 12.4% in May from a year earlier, including a 28.3% surge in tier-one cities.Property might seem like an odd choice for a safe haven. China has a glut of unsold apartments -- 13 million, mainly in mid-sized and inland cities, according to Reuters. But local governments, which went on a borrowing binge in recent years to fund infrastructure, rely on property sales for about one-third of revenue and can't afford a prolonged real estate slump. And regulators, trying to revive soft demand, cut down-payment requirements for first-time buyers to a record-low 20%.Demand for new apartment construction, along with stimulus-fueled infrastructure spending, helps keep orders for commodities such as steel afloat and keeps a lid on bad industrial-sector debt. But that props up inefficient industrial state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and delays a transition to a consumer- and services-based economy.Despite becoming an increasingly important market for the likes of Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), Starbucks (SBUX) and Under Armour (UA), China has mostly moved in the wrong direction from its goal of rebalancing the economy, notes Goldman Sachs. Since 2007, when then-Premier Wen Jiabao set the goal of moving away from an export- and investment-driven economy, investment has climbed from 40% of GDP to 45.3%.Goldman says China desperately needs productivity-enhancing reforms that would help revive economic growth without the fuel of rising debt. The largest industrial SOEs generated $1.8 trillion in profits from 2001 through 2013, with a deteriorating performance since 2010. But even that was only thanks to $2 trillion in subsidies, implying a net loss. The investment bank sees dim prospects for much of a lift from reforming SOEs, noting the inherent conflict between economic efficiency and protecting the position of the ruling Communist Party.Productivity growth is so important to China's future in part of because of its demographics, which resemble Japan's shrinking workforce since 1990. China's working-age population is set to decline by 0.5% a year over the next 25 years, a legacy of its one-child policy replaced last October.""Will China grow old before it grows rich? That was an oft-asked question over the past couple of decades. The probable answer, which seems more apparent every day, is: 'Yes,' "" wrote investment strategist Ed Yardeni.One move by China to begin addressing high corporate debt levels would have banks swap nonperforming loans for equity stakes in the borrowing companies. But such efforts ""could actually worsen the problem, for example, by allowing 'zombie' firms (nonviable firms that are still operating) to keep going,"" the IMF said in a blog post.No matter how hard China tries to keep growth going, the days of it rescuing the global economy appear to be over. Data from April suggest that the government began tapping the brakes on the rise of debt in the second quarter, with areas outside of real estate showing further slowing.""Industrial output and investment surges in March led many in China to expect, or unrealistically wish for, a sustained rebound in the economy. In our view this is almost impossible,"" wrote IHS Global Insight economist Brian Jackson.Moody's sees growth slowing from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.3% this year. ""Near-term downside risks to China’s growth have receded for now, due to the ample support provided by the government. However, the sheer scale of leverage ... exposes the economy to the risk of a rapid deterioration in the event of a negative shock.""If and when a China debt crisis erupts, U.S. investors will find few stock winners. Utilities and other defensive stocks outperformed early this year amid China fears, but in a true crunch such stocks may only fall less. U.S. Treasuries, gold -- and moving to cash -- would once again likely be the safe harbors.

147,UA,"Under Armour's (UA) Golden State golden boy Steph Curry and Nike's (NKE) lifetime endorser ""King"" James are going head-to-head Thursday night, but how is their battle playing out off the court?According to a Slice Intelligence report that examined sales of the top four NBA-player shoes, Curry kicks are in vogue, but Nike is still king of the cash register.Sales of LeBron James-branded gym shoes outpaced Curry's signature lines at the start of the year, between January and March, said the digital commerce data firm, but Curry's sales topped James' in April to May.No matter how the first game of the NBA Finals turns out, they'll still both be overshadowed by legend Michael Jordan. Nike's Air Jordans accounted for 75% of online sales of the four most popular player-branded sneakers.Kobe Bryant's Nike shoes came in with 14% share, while James' and Curry's shoes pulled in 6% and 5%, respectively.Under Armour's selection of footwear and other apparel is about to get bigger, though, with Bloomberg reporting Thursday that the company has tapped Tim Coppens to become the executive creative director of a new Under Armour-branded fashion line.No word yet on what the collection will look like or how it will be priced.

148,UA,"The Dow Jones industrial average has reclaimed the ground it lost after the U.K.'s vote last month to leave the European Union -- and then some. The blue-chip index rose to record highs in the past week.But some Dow stocks have been dogs. Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS), Boeing (BA), Nike (NKE) and American Express (AXP) are the biggest year-to-date laggards.Goldman Sachs is down 10.3% so far this year, the worst on the 30-stock Dow. A turbulent trading environment weighing on the bank's financial performance. But Goldman is up 8.8% so far in July. Fellow Dow financial JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported strong second-quarter results on Thursday. Goldman Sachs reports its Q2 results on Tuesday.Cheap fuels also has hurt aircraft maker Boeing, the Dow's second-worst performer. Cheap fuel has given airlines less of an incentive to order new jets and allowed them to hold onto older, less-fuel-efficient planes for longer. That environment, however, could change as some carriers, like Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), begin to see higher fuel costs.But Airbus (EADSY) easily trumped Boeing for jet orders at the Farnborough Airshow in the past week.Boeing shares are down 8.4% year-to-date.American Express, the third-worst Dow performer, is down 8.3% year to date. The credit card issuer's partnership with Costco (COST) ended this year, and other partners like JetBlue (JBLU) and Fidelity have also bailed. Amex's stock price was gutted in January after the company forecast a difficult road ahead. The company had also been contending with low gas prices and the strong dollar.IBD's TAKE: Not all Dow stocks are laggards. UnitedHealth (UNH) is up about 20% so far this year. UNH cleared a short base pattern on June with a 135.21 buy point. The stock is just in range up to 141.97.

151,UA,"After upping its outlook no less than four times this year, Nike (NKE) rival Adidas didn't raise guidance again, but the maker of the iconic — and now cool-again — Superstar and Stan Smith shoes did confirm its full-year outlook and said it would spend 30 million euros ($33.2 million) on restructuring its ailing Reebok business.Sales rose 17% in Q3 to 5.41 billion euros on a currency-neutral basis, said the company, with diluted per-share earnings rising 21% to 1.88 euros ($2.08) during the quarter, the latter of which Piper Jaffray said missed Street estimates for 1.90 euros.Sales in North America — a key market in which the brand competes with Nike and Under Armour (UA) — rose 20.2% in Q3.

153,UA,"Athletic apparel maker Under Armour (UA) beat out much larger rivals Nike (NKE) and Adidas for a record 15-year, $280 million contract to provide UCLA with apparel and other supplies, in a deal that adds a key West Coast location to its list of college sponsorships.The contract with Under Armour, as reported by the Los Angeles Times, is said to be the largest such apparel deal ever for the NCAA. The deal followed talks with Nike and Adidas, whose sponsorship contract with UCLA ends in 2017, the L.A. Times said. But UCLA, it said, was ""increasingly drawn toward the new kid on the block.""“This deal was about geography,” Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was quoted as saying. “It was important for us to plant our flag in L.A.”Under Armour shares ended trading up 2.6% in the stock market today, attempting to rebound after senior management departures announced earlier this month yanked the stock below its 50-day line. Shares of Nike rallied 1.1% to 56.59.The UCLA deal is Under Armour's latest attempt to wrest control of the college sponsorship landscape from its larger rivals, with the company and Nike breaking their own apparel contract records or each other's in recent years.Under Armour in 2014 announced a 10-year, $90 million deal with Notre Dame to supply the school with apparel in what was then seen as the largest such deal ever in college athletics. Last October, Under Armour announced a $100-million-plus apparel deal with the University of Wisconsin.Both those deals came as the schools' contracts with Adidas were expiring. Under Armour also has a similar deal with Auburn.Meanwhile, Nike in January worked out a contract extension with Ohio State for $252 million. That followed a $250 million deal with the University of Texas and a $169 million deal with the University of Michigan last year.Under Armour, Nike and others have also battled each other in the arena of professional endorsements and connected fitness, with Nike attempting to shut out potential innovations from rivals in part through a flood of patent filings in recent years.

The stock could still add a handle, which would yield a lower buy point.As seen in Wednesday’s Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market is currently in a confirmed uptrend, which means an investor may buy breakouts of high-quality growth stocks at proper buy points with a reasonable amount of risk.

161,UA,"Under Armour (UA) shares were tumbling Wednesday on its Sports Authority-related guidance cut, while Nike (NKE) was feeling the weight of two downgrades.How concerned should investors be about the two popular sportswear brands? Here's what some analysts on Wall Street are saying.Nike's probably not the biggest Kanye West or Steph Curry fan right now. The athletic apparel leader received downgrades from Bank of America to neutral and from Morgan Stanley to equal-weight, with the former reportedly citing footwear market share losses, and the latter citing a ""weakening"" U.S. sportswear category and rising competition.Under Armour and Adidas are nipping at Nike's heels. Morgan Stanley's Jay Sole said Under Armour's Steph Curry basketball shoes have nabbed 800 basis points from Nike so far this year.Meanwhile, Adidas' U.S. shoe sales growth has accelerated to 26% across April and May, while Nike's has slowed to 4% from the prior year, he wrote. Products like the Kanye West-designed Yeezy -- and Kanye West-approved Ultra Boost -- are helping the once-lagging three stripes stage a comeback.An Adidas resurgence could present a risk for Under Armour, wrote Jefferies' Randal Konik separately on Wednesday.In the case of Sports Authority, reports of its demise were not so greatly exaggerated after all, and the bankruptcy court's approval of its liquidation -- vs. a restructuring or sale -- means that Under Armour will have to take a $23 million write-down in Q2.The Baltimore-based sportswear brand late Tuesday revised its full-year revenue outlook downwards to $4.925 billion from $5 billion to reflect both the impairment charge as well as unrealized planned sales to the Sports Authority. Under Armour also revised its operating income expectations. CEO Kevin Plank dismissed the impact as a ""one-time event.""Besides battering the stock with a slew of price target cuts, most Wall Street analysts don't appear to be panicking just yet. Sterne Agee CRT's Sam Poser said Under Armour's outlook still appears healthy ""despite the hiccup"" from the Sports Authority's liquidation.But the situation may be indicative of broader industry troubles.""Ultimately, this admittedly one-time event highlights that even Under Armour is not impervious to the challenges occurring within the sporting goods retail space,"" wrote Credit Suisse's Christian Buss.Cowen's John Kernan noted that inventory growth in retail is still outstripping sales growth, an ongoing trend ""especially in the sporting goods, footwear, athletic and apparel industries, and (which) is showing no signs of correcting.""Given the proximity of many Sports Authority locations to those of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dick's could be a beneficiary of the situation and pick up lost sales, says BB&T Capital Markets' Corinna Freedman.Again, Morgan Stanley provides the most downbeat view, arguing in a separate report that Under Armour would have sent its Sports Authority inventory somewhere else if it were not for slow U.S. sportswear demand and inventory that is believed to be ""at a multiyear high.""""Bulls will view this news as a one-off, but we believe new guidance better represents UA's growth rate,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Sole, who thinks ""more negative consequences of this (U.S. athletic apparel) slowdown are possible.""Shares of Nike closed down 0.5% on the stock market today. Under Armour fell 3.9%. Dick's Sporting Goods edged up 0.3%, while rival Foot Locker (FL) lost 1.8%, and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) fell 0.3%.

180,UA,"Nike (NKE) may be king of the court (and the field, and the track), but it's also facing more brutal competition from Under Armour (UA) and Adidas -- which could weigh on top-line gains, says one analyst.The threat from Under Armour was underscored Tuesday when Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, who has an Under Armour endorsement deal, became the first unanimous winner of the NBA's Most Valuable Player award. It is his second straight MVP and came a day after a stunning late-game playoff performance.Nike shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today. Under Armour added 1%.""(W)e believe the 10%-15% top-line growth NKE has achieved since the recession may prove more difficult to sustain going forward, now that previously-slumping peers (Adidas) are gaining steam and previously-small competitors (Under Armour) are now large enough to move the needle,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Tom Nikic on Tuesday.The Beaverton, Ore.-based athletic apparel maker is ""one of the strongest consumer brands in the world"" with ""one of the clearest paths to long-term margin expansion"" in its industry, he said.But the costs associated with the Olympics this summer could make for ""noisy"" near-term financials, and the renewed strength of Nike's competitors is noteworthy, prompting the bank to withhold a more bullish view for now.Wells Fargo is resuming coverage of the stock at market perform with a 58-62 price range.Adidas' U.S. resurgence has sparked much analyst chatter lately.

181,UA,"Yoga-inspired athletic apparel maker Lululemon Athletica (LULU) reported first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts' forecast but said revenue rose more than expected on strong comparable store sales.Lululemon's first-quarter adjusted earnings fell 11.8% to 30 cents a share, a penny less than Wall Street had projected. After topping views six quarters in a row in 2014 and early 2015, the company's earnings have been uneven, and it's missed estimates for two of the last four quarters.Revenue grew 17% to $495.5 million, topping views for $487.7 million. Total comparable store sales, which includes sales at stores open more than a year as well as direct to consumer, increased by 6%, or by 8% on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales increased by 3%, or by 5% on a constant dollar basis.Lululemon shares closed up 4.9% on the stock market today.

Among other leading athletic apparel makers, Under Armour (UA) rose 3.4%, and Nike (NKE) climbed 1.1%.Lululemon Chief Executive Laurent Potdevin said in a prepared statement: ""We are pleased with our first-quarter performance, delivering strong sales results and gross margin that exceeded expectations. We finished the quarter with our inventory levels rebalanced and on track to achieve our goals for the year.""Gross profit rose 16% to $239.1 million, and as a percentage of net revenue, gross profit was 48.3% compared to 48.6% in the first quarter of 2015.Looking ahead, Lululemon expects second-quarter net revenue of $505 million-$515 million and 36 cents-38 cents per share in earnings.

"
185,UA,"Nike (NKE) has more U.S. patents than a defense contractor making stealth jets, a pharma developing cancer-fighting drugs, and an auto giant working on self-driving cars.The athletic gear maker was granted about 500 patents last year and ended 2015 with 5,060 issued patents, which include those that expired, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). That tops Lockheed Martin (LMT) (4,113), Ford Motor (F) (3,563) and Pfizer (PFE) (2,587). And that doesn’t even include patent applications.Nike’s patents have nearly doubled since 2009, and CEO Mark Parker boasted last year the company has the third-largest U.S. portfolio of design patents. Nike has buried rivals Adidas and Under Armour (UA) in patents, as it looks to maintain its dominance with an avalanche of innovations in manufacturing and design while potentially toying with a wearable device that could appear alongside Apple's (AAPL) smartwatches and Fitbit's (FIT) trackers.""Generally, you should see some type of correlation when a company is releasing innovative, game-changing products,” said Envision IP Managing Attorney Maulin Shah, who said that of Nike’s thousands of granted patents, over 4,200 of them are still active and in force.As Nike doubles down on automation and 3D printing capabilities, a recent Macquarie analysis of the USPTO library observed “a meaningful acceleration of (Nike) patents in recent months focusing on new ways to manufacture products.”Nike already has its own army of shoe-painting and water-free dyeing robots, just to name a few. And in October, it announced a partnership with Flextronics (FLEX), a manufacturer that has developed an automated way to cut material waste by 50%. Such savings, if flowed to the bottom line, could add 23 cents to Nike's 2016 earnings per share, Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu estimated in April.Separately, Nike is building a “3D digital design system” in partnership with DreamWorks Animation (DWA) that includes “nearly instantaneous digital print applications, photo-real 3D visualizations and ultra-rapid prototyping.”Compared to Nike's more than 4,200 active patents, German rival Adidas has “kind of been stagnant,” with a U.S. patent portfolio that is about a ninth the size of Nike’s, not including those gained in its acquisition of golf equipment maker TaylorMade, said Shah. But Adidas does have a “relatively large” patent portfolio in Europe, he noted. Globally, Nike has about 19,500 patents and patent applications vs. Adidas’ roughly 2,400.Under Armour, which has been happy to be framed as a tech company with a penchant for snapping up fitness apps, only has about 104 issued U.S. patents, almost two-thirds of which are design and not utility patents, by Shah's count. Utility patents in athletic apparel primarily deal with material -- think compression, moisture-wicking -- and manufacturing methods vs. patents for clothing designs.Innovation aside, patents can also be an indicator for something far juicier: a peek into a company’s product strategy.For example, Under Armour was granted on March 29 a patent for a one-armed compression sleeve designed to warm a pitcher’s throwing arm between innings -- an interestingly specific item that indicated potential future investments in baseball. Indeed, a few weeks later, the company signed Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper, the reigning National League MVP, to what ESPN said is the biggest endorsement deal ever for a baseball player, though terms weren't disclosed.Source: USPTOWhile most of Nike's recent patent activity is related to manufacturing, a dive into its sprawling portfolio indicates a potential shift in its device strategy.Nike hasn’t been in the wearables business since axing most of its FuelBand team two years ago, and the TomTom-powered Nike+ Sportwatch is no more. Nike instead has been pushing its revamped Nike+ app over any hardware.Some have said the athletic apparel giant is shying away from hardware development because of its partnership with Apple, particularly since its Nike+ app can be used on the Apple Watch. But its patents say otherwise.There has been a ""surge"" in wearable-related applications from Nike in the last two or three years, Shah said, and the company now has 261 active patents related to wearable tech vs. Adidas' 99 and Under Armour's dozen patents.Published with the USPTO recently, images from a patent for an “athletic watch” look an awful lot like the TomTom version of Nike’s watch: a boxy-looking accessory with a perforated band and large numbers. In fact, given the slight aesthetic differences -- an extra button here, a missing button there, a thinner wristband -- the drawings could easily be a newer edition of the Nike+ SportWatch, though it is not clear if that is the case.Both Nike and TomTom did not immediately respond to a request for comment..Source: USPTO“It definitely seems that Nike is keeping its options open on this front,” Macquarie's Vasilescu told IBD after viewing an earlier trio of patent applications for an athletic watch that were published on March 17 and first filed last September.Meanwhile, about 20% of Adidas’ patents are focused on wearables. But such products may never come to market, Shah said, noting that companies also license ideas if they aren't in a position to make gadgets themselves.Given the sheer number of applications that are filed with the USPTO each year – 629,647 in 2015 alone – some might consider it folly to think digging through musty government archives might shed any light on what kind of consumer products could hit shelves.Indeed, trying to decipher a company’s product pipeline by looking at the U.S. patent library is a little bit like astronomy -- both constellations and published patents are maps of the past. Starlight has to travel so far to reach Earth that some of those celestial bodies that appear to be burning in the night sky may already be dead, or dying.Similarly, it takes about 24.6 months on average for filed patent applications to be published on the USPTO database, according to the agency. Most are actually published within a year and a half, Santa Clara University School of Law Assistant Professor Brian Love told IBD, though ideas were conceived and worked on well before a filing.“It’s probably at least two years old, if not more, and then by the time the patent issues, you’re talking about tacking on a couple more years on top of that,"" he said. ""So it is kind of a window into the future, but it’s not that far of a window into the future.”Still, filings can offer clues years in advance. Case in point: Nike rolled out self-lacing Marty McFly-inspired shoes in March, after Nike designer Tinker Hatfield confirmed in early 2014 that power lacing would be unveiled the following year. But the company's “Back to the Future” resurrection could've been foreseen long before that. Nike's first granted patent for an “automatic lacing system” appeared in 2011.Of course, some companies stake out IP turf not for the purpose of developing those ideas, but to thwart competitors’ dreams. This type of defensive patent publishing, as it is known, is not uncommon with tech giants like IBM (IBM) or Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, say experts.“The consequence of publishing something is that you lose any sort of trade secrets rights you might have in it, but you’re also stopping somebody else from patenting it,” said Love.Watchmaker Swatch has reportedly been on a smartwatch-patent filing spree over the last few years. What it intends to do with them is a mystery.“There’s a lot of rumors in the patent industry: Will Swatch start suing competitors, or are they actually just building up patents because they’re about to launch an entirely new product line?” said Shah.Regardless, no matter what Nike, Under Armour or Adidas wind up bringing to market, all of this patent-filing and R&D means that investors and consumers can likely expect growth from the activewear space.“I think we are in the golden age of tech in the athletic footwear business,” said NPD Group analyst Matt Powell. “I have never seen so many new tech advances (in products and manufacturing) that we are currently seeing. So add that to the fact that there’s a record number of patents and the future looks really bright.”

It's No. 1 probable victim? Under Armour (UA).Online searches for ""Adidas"" have risen into the double digits over the last two years, he said, and athlete endorsements plus celebrity collaborations from the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams have been fueling interest in the brand.""We think its resurgence within athletic apparel and footwear could pose a credible threat to UA,"" he wrote, though Nike (NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) will likely remain unscathed.Under Armour not too long ago bumped Adidas from the No. 2 spot in activewear brands in the U.S. Now, Adidas' ""dominant"" presence at Foot Locker (FL), Finish Line (FINL) and other sportswear stores could mean pushback vs. Under Armour as they jostle for second place to market leader Nike.""Over the past few years, we believe (Under Armour)'s stellar growth in men's apparel and growing presence in footwear has come at the expense of shelf space for Adidas, especially since Nike has remained strong,"" Konik wrote. ""Now with Adidas starting to come back, we think UA (where expectations are high) could see downside risk.""Konik isn't alone in his view. Following Adidas earnings, Cowen's John Kernan noted that Under Armour is ""likely seeing increased competition in (North) America"" from the Germany-based brand.Adidas noted 22% constant-currency sales growth in North America, a steep bump from 7% growth in the prior-year Q1.Amid the comeback play by Adidas, which is prepping for a transition to a new CEO later this year, Under Armour has been losing some of its top brass, including its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer.Under Armour shares finished unchanged on the stock market today after sliding almost 12% last week.And what about Nike? The Swoosh isn't budging.""Bearing in mind that Adidas’ N. America biz is roughly 1/7th that of Nike’s, we believe any share shift would be minor at this stage and more likely (to) come at the expense of other brands,"" said Konik. ""It’s also probable that Adidas’ strength is helping to expand the overall market as well.""Nike shares closed up 0.5%.Foot Locker climbed 2.3%.

The sneaker maker said Wednesday that it now expects 15% currency-neutral sales growth and a 15%-18% rise in net income from continuing operations this year, up from prior guidance for 10%-12% increases on both ends.This perhaps signals the start of a momentous streak for the No. 2 global sportswear company -- and could pose a threat to dominant athletic wear player Nike (NKE).""Adidas' global brand momentum could be coming at the expense of global brand leader Nike, as evidenced by (Nike's) sequentially slowing constant-currency futures growth in N.

Meanwhile, comeback kid Adidas reported 22% currency-neutral sales growth in North America.Alleviating worries of a slowdown amid a lethargic local economy, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth reported a view-topping 39% Q4 sales leap to $3.75 billion -- the highest growth rate in four quarters.

Hulu -- a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast (CMCSA) -- also reportedly plans to expand beyond on-demand content and stream live TV.By 2017, Verizon Communications (VZ) will likely expand its ad-supported Go90 mobile video service to multiple video streaming platforms.Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Networks' (DISH) “Sling” Web TV service, meanwhile, seems to be gaining traction.Wild cards?

But shale firms are hesitant to resume drilling until prices hit at least $50 for a sustained period of time, and not just a uptick from OPEC meetings or supply disruptions from the Middle East. ""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" Continental CEO Harold Hamm said on the company's conference call. Even as crude prices rebound, E&Ps will be looking to first use cash flow for capital spending and to reduce debt, then complete drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs), before considering drilling again.Oil prices finished the week near $45 a barrel.After missing analyst estimates in March, the Big Three U.S. automakers -- GM, Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler -- showed only marginal improvement in April U.S. sales, seeming to confirm predictions by some analysts and industry executives that domestic demand could plateau this year. GM sales fell 3.5% vs. April 2015 to 259,447, in large part due to a drop in low-margin sales to rental fleets. Ford sales rose 4% to 231,316, but both GM and Ford were below forecasts. Fiat Chrysler rose 6% to 199,631 units, beating Edmunds.com’s 5% estimate.Meanwhile, Ford sales in China fell 11% in April, while GM’s sales there rose 7.5%, partly on a 13% pop in Cadillac sales.GM shares fell 2.6%, Ford 0.9% and Fiat Chrysler 4.6% for the week, trading near their 50-day lines.Gunmaker Sturm Ruger (RGR) on Monday handily beat first-quarter forecasts and boosted its quarterly dividend by 37%, following similarly strong results in March from rival Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Both companies have benefited from an increasingly diverse crowd of shooting enthusiasts. Regulatory concerns and widening fears following mass shootings like those in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Europe have also made guns more popular in the U.S.On Wednesday, the FBI reported 2,145,865 NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) firearm background checks for the month of April. That’s the best April on record for the system but lower than recent months, in keeping with similar patterns in previous years. The background checks are used as an indicator of gun demand, and stocks of both companies have been sensitive over the years to signs of demand topping out.Sturm Ruger rallied 5.5% Monday ahead of results and climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, but the stock found resistance at the 50-day line and ended the week up 2.6%. Smith & Wesson also wrapped the week with pared gains.

192,UA,"Call it the Return of the Three Stripes. The Superstar, revived. Adidas is ""back from the dead in the U.S.,"" and it's a ""BIG DEAL,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Randal Konik on Monday. It's No. 1 probable victim? Under Armour (UA).Online searches for ""Adidas"" have risen into the double digits over the last two years, he said, and athlete endorsements plus celebrity collaborations from the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams have been fueling interest in the brand.""We think its resurgence within athletic apparel and footwear could pose a credible threat to UA,"" he wrote, though Nike (NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) will likely remain unscathed.Under Armour not too long ago bumped Adidas from the No. 2 spot in activewear brands in the U.S. Now, Adidas' ""dominant"" presence at Foot Locker (FL), Finish Line (FINL) and other sportswear stores could mean pushback vs. Under Armour as they jostle for second place to market leader Nike.""Over the past few years, we believe (Under Armour)'s stellar growth in men's apparel and growing presence in footwear has come at the expense of shelf space for Adidas, especially since Nike has remained strong,"" Konik wrote. ""Now with Adidas starting to come back, we think UA (where expectations are high) could see downside risk.""Konik isn't alone in his view. Following Adidas earnings, Cowen's John Kernan noted that Under Armour is ""likely seeing increased competition in (North) America"" from the Germany-based brand.Adidas noted 22% constant-currency sales growth in North America, a steep bump from 7% growth in the prior-year Q1.Amid the comeback play by Adidas, which is prepping for a transition to a new CEO later this year, Under Armour has been losing some of its top brass, including its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer.Under Armour shares finished unchanged on the stock market today after sliding almost 12% last week.And what about Nike? The Swoosh isn't budging.""Bearing in mind that Adidas’ N. America biz is roughly 1/7th that of Nike’s, we believe any share shift would be minor at this stage and more likely (to) come at the expense of other brands,"" said Konik. ""It’s also probable that Adidas’ strength is helping to expand the overall market as well.""Nike shares closed up 0.5%.Foot Locker climbed 2.3%. Finish Line shares rose 0.45%. Lululemon advanced 1.9%.

Hiring marked a three-year low, as private employers added 156,000 jobs in April, well below economists' projections. But the Institute for Supply Management's services sector index climbed 1.2 points in April to 55.7, above views for 54.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.Online travel bookers, gold and biotech stocks led the downside in today's stock market action. Utilities, Internet content and real estate investment trusts advanced. Priceline (PCLN) gapped down to sink 10% in speedy trade as it fell below its 200-day moving average. The stock is now 10% below a 1361.73 handle buy point it had been flirting with.

The athletic apparel and shoe maker on Tuesday said its chief merchandising officer and chief digital officer will leave in July.On the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC) and biotech Medivation (MDVN) rose 4% and 3%, respectively, in heavy volume. Pfizer (PFE) has approached Medivation about a possible takeover, according to reports late Tuesday.All eyes will be on Tesla Motors (TSLA) after the close of trade, when it's due to report its Q1 results. Analysts expect the electric car maker to post a loss of 58 cents a share vs. a 36-cent loss in Q1 2015. Revenue is forecast to rise 45% to $1.59 billion.

Financial terms weren't disclosed. ESPN reported that Harper got a 10-year extension, the largest endorsement deal in history for a Major League Baseball player.Under Armour shares closed down 7.5% in the stock market today, tumbling below its 50-day line.IBD's Take: How fit is Under Armour stock?

209,UA,"Facebook (FB), Under Armour (UA), United Airlines (UAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and FedEx (FDX) top brass led this week’s insider trades, as earnings season remained busy.Facebook’s chief product officer, Christopher Cox, unloaded more shares this week. He disclosed on Wednesday a sale of 15,600 shares for a total transaction value of $1.71 million.The social-networking giant has seen regular sales from board members and C-suite executives in recent months.Facebook late Wednesday crushed first-quarter earnings and sales estimates. Shares closed Friday with a 6.35% weekly gain.Robin Thurston, Under Armour’s chief digital officer, disclosed on Tuesday the sale of 17,140 shares for a little more than $796,000. Other Under Armour executives disclosed sales this week as well, one week after the company beat quarterly expectations.Earlier this week, rival Adidas raised its full-year sales growth outlook as it pre-announced some Q1 results, ahead of its full report May 4.Under Armour shares fell 6.5% for the week, near sell territory.United COO Gregory Hart and Director James Kennedy disclosed Wednesday the purchase of 2,000 shares for a total of about $99,800 each. Another director, Robert Milton, disclosed the purchase of 1,000 United shares for a little over $49,000.Meanwhile, Southwest Director David Biegler disclosed Thursday the sale and options exercise of 8,000 shares for a total of nearly $376,000.Airline stocks have been under pressure recently amid signs that expansion plans are eroding unit revenue. Last week, United said that it would curb growth as industry capacity outpaces traffic.United shares plunged 9.5% vs. a week ago, and Southwest fell 5.6%.FedEx CEO Frederick Smith disclosed on Monday a sale and options exercise of 200,000 shares for a total transaction value of $33.2 million.The sale came ahead of rival UPS’ (UPS) earnings on Thursday. UPS beat views but warned that pension cuts may result in a $3.8 billion charge that could lower full-year earnings.FedEx shares dipped 0.7%, and UPS eased 0.4%.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.
"
210,UA,"Fitbit (FIT) is due for a health checkup late Wednesday and the prognosis for its first-quarter earnings report is looking favorable.But investors got the jitters on the eve of the company's Q1 report. Fitbit stock fell 6.5% to 17.18 in heavy volume on the stock market today. Fitbit stock has tumbled more than 40% this year as competition has risen and the pace of growth has slowed.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the maker of wearable fitness devices to earn 2 cents a share excluding items on sales of $443.1 million. On a year-over-year basis, sales would be up 32% if it meets the consensus forecast. That would be down from 92% growth in Q4, 168% in Q3 and 253% in Q2. Fitbit made its IPO last June, pricing shares at 20.For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Fitbit to earn 26 cents a share, up 24%, on sales of $532.8 million, up 33%.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson on Monday reiterated his sector weight, or hold, rating on Fitbit stock.Erickson expects a “beat-and-raise” quarter from Fitbit, but is cautious based on “longer-term views of poor category user trends, a lack of sensor differentiation and a more limited total addressable market.”In the near term, demand appears relatively healthy for the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch and the Alta activity tracker, he said. Fitbit also has stocked the retail channel with Charge HR devices for Mother’s Day sales, he said in a research report.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy maintained her neutral rating on Fitbit with a price target of 16.“While data points during the quarter have been positive, with strong Amazon (AMZN) trends for the newly launched Alta and Blaze models, we remain on the sidelines behind the second-half weighted earnings (we estimate 70% of earnings lie in 2H) and given the tougher product launch comparisons in 2H,” she said in a report Monday.Mizuho Securities analyst Betty Chen kept her buy rating and price target of 20 on Fitbit stock in a report Monday.“Our recent survey highlights increases in Fitbit ownership as well as planned purchase intent at higher average selling prices,” she said. “Moreover, data indicates increased upgrade intent and attachment rate, with 21% of Fitbit device buyers purchasing at least one additional wristband in the last three months. We believe this bodes well for Fitbit’s long-term growth and margin profile.”Last week, diversified rival Garmin (GRMN) said its sales of wearable fitness devices rose 9% year over year in Q1, to $142.4 million, but profit margins declined because of intense competition in the category. Garmin also makes GPS navigation devices for automotive, aviation, marine and outdoor markets.In addition to Fitbit and Garmin, other companies competing in the health-and-fitness wearables sector include Apple (AAPL), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).RELATED:Fitbit Bolsters China Prospects With E-Commerce Deal

213,UA,"By nailing their 73rd win Wednesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies, the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors broke the 72-10 single-season record set by the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls.That means, at least in the way of regular-season wins, Stephen Curry and Under Armour (UA) now have a place in the NBA history books right above Michael Jordan and Nike (NKE), a setting that not too long ago might have been seen as unlikely for the slender point guard and relatively recent entrant to the basketball footwear space.Nike still dominates the market, but win No. 73 will no doubt boost Curry's brand -- Curry also set a record for three-pointers as the first player to score 400 in one season -- which could translate to more shoe sales for the Baltimore-based sportswear maker.The popularity of Curry's signature Under Armour shoe line has rocketed 170% in the last six months vs. the previous six months, according to Slice Intelligence, and Curry's shoes are largely credited with helping the brand's footwear sales pop 95% during its most recent quarter.Under Armour shares closed up 1.2%,nearing their 200-day line. Nike shares dipped 0.15% on the stock market today, as they remained in an area of consolidation.While basketball shoes may be selling well, other areas may be seeing deceleration. Earlier in the week, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said in a note to clients, citing SportScan data, that Under Armour's domestic wholesale apparel sales growth -- women's apparel in particular -- was slowing. He also called out ""soft"" running footwear trends.That could cause a future quarterly sales miss and P/E contraction, he wrote.

Late Wednesday, the casino operator reported Q1 earnings that fell 32% to 45 cents per share, well under estimates for 63 cents.

Find out at IBD Stock CheckupUnited shares tumbled 10%, after rising for eight straight sessions. Late Wednesday, the carrier said it would curb growth plans as industry capacity outpaces traffic.

Under Armour earnings rose, defying forecasts for a decline. Under Armour also raised its full-year sales outlook above views.

215,UA,"Stocks finished lower Thursday as earnings reports continued to pour in, with some big names falling after hours on quarterly misses.The Dow Jones industrial average led the downside with a 0.6% loss, the S&P 500 gave up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq edged nearly 0.05% lower. Volume was mixed in the stock market today, slightly higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary figures. Losers topped winners by a 5-3 margin on the NYSE; decliners barely outpaced advancers on the Nasdaq.The biggest losers included transportation, retail and homebuilder stocks. Oil drillers also lagged, as West Texas intermediate crude slid 2% to $43.26 a barrel. United Continental (UAL) slumped 10% to a two-month low in turbulent trade. The airline on Wednesday reported Q1 earnings and sales that fell 19% and 5%, respectively.On the Dow, Travelers (TRV) gapped down and sank 6%, closing well below its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover. The insurance giant reported Q1 revenue that beat, but earnings that missed consensus estimates.Mellanox (MLNX) gapped down and plunged 12% in massive volume. Shares fell below their 50-day line and undercut a 47.79 buy point of a cup with handle. The chip designer announced Q1 profit and sales that topped views, but its Q2 revenue outlook came in below estimates.Apparel makers and drug stocks outperformed. Among apparel makers, Under Armour (UA) gapped up and leapt 7% to a four-month high, clearing a 34.33 buy point of a cup with handle in fast trade. The sports apparel and athletic shoe maker reported Q1 results that beat forecasts.On the IBD 50, Citrix Systems (CTXS) surged as much as 12% to a 16-year high before easing to close with a 4% gain. The stock cleared an 84.27 buy point in brisk trade, but closed slightly below the entry. RBC Capital and Needham raised their price targets on the software maker, whose Q1 results late Wednesday crushed forecasts.After the close Thursday, Starbucks (SBUX) reported fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue that missed views, and provided a lower-than-expected outlook. Shares fell 5% after hours.Alphabet (GOOGL) was also down in extended trading, after the Internet giant's Q1 results came in below forecasts. As usual, the company didn't offer forward guidance.Microsoft (MSFT) fell 4% after hours, also on a miss on both the top and bottom lines.Economic news was mixed. Jobless claims fell for a second week, by more than 2% to 247,000, well below views for 265,000 claims. The Conference Board's leading economic indicators index climbed 0.2% in March, up from a 0.1% dip in February but below projections for a 0.5% increase.A light slate Friday includes the Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing Index for April and Baker-Hughes' weekly rig count.Earnings are on tap Friday from McDonald’s (MCD), Caterpillar (CAT), General Electric (GE) and American Airlines (AAL).
"
216,UA,"Under Armour (UA) CEO Kevin Plank talked a big game on the first-quarter conference call Thursday, projecting each quarter this year would rake in more than $1 billion in revenue after the athletic wear brand topped forecasts and bumped up full-year guidance.He sounded especially bullish on women’s apparel growth, telling analysts that the women’s e-commerce growth rate at Under Armour is still outpacing men’s growth online and seeing strong demand.“This year, our women’s business will surpass a billion dollars -- a billion U.S. dollars -- that’s a billion-dollar women’s business, a milestone we are proud of, that puts us among very select company in a space that continues to attract a lot of interest and competition,” Plank said.Shares closed up 6.8% at 46.93, well into buy range, after forming a wide cup-with-handle base. Shares of rival Nike (NKE) climbed 0.8%. Skechers (SKX) finished 2.5% higher, then jumped 7% after hours on strong quarterly results.IBD's Take: How fit are the shares of Under Armour and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupUnder Armour's optimism on its women's segment contrasts with a recent Morgan Stanley report that noted a 7% decline in Q1 women’s clothing sales, citing SportScan figures (a data set Under Armour management has previously called out for not fully representing the business).Plank's prediction also came as Q1 results were boosted by its more male-oriented basketball shoes.Earnings rose to 4 cents a share from 3 cents a year earlier, surprising analysts who broadly expected a decline to 2 cents a share. (An early April Class C stock dividend effectively acted as a 2-for-1 stock split, which is reflected in the results.)Revenue grew 30% to $1.05 billion, edging past forecasts for $1.04 billion.Under Armour now expects 2016 sales to increase 26% to $5 billion, up from a prior outlook for $4.95 billion.""We believe the beat-and-raise story will continue to play out in 2016 as the increased 2016 guidance will once again prove conservative, given the footwear opportunity (price realization/unit growth), international expansion opportunities, and (direct-to-consumer) execution,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson in a note prior to the company's conference call Thursday, adding that she continues to expect revenue growth of about 30% over the next few years.Apparel revenue grew 20% in Q1. Shoes continue to be a growth area for Under Armour, rising 64% to $264 million as Stephen Curry's signature line of basketball shoes and new running products continued to drive sales. The brand also debuted Jordan Spieth golf shoes and a smart shoe during the quarter.Wholesale revenue rose 28%, and direct-to-consumer revenue grew 33%, with Plank noting that more than half of online sales came through mobile devices. The company is seeing “meaningful improvements” to its direct channels via its growing “connected fitness” app family, which includes UA Record, Endomondo, MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal.Connected fitness segment revenue more than doubled in Q1, a quarter that also saw Under Armour's fitness-tracking UA Healthbox kit hit shelves. The fitness band/heart-rate monitor/smart scale trio was the company's second-bestselling item online during the reporting period, said Plank, behind the Curry 2 shoe.North America sales saw a 26% increase as revenue abroad grew 56%.""(Under Armour) continues to deliver impressive growth, driven by share gains, brand strength and a robust athletic backdrop,"" wrote Jefferies' Randal Konik, who has a hold rating and 45 price target on the stock. ""Footwear remains a remarkable standout, and we are also pleased to see better overall margins flowing through.""Skechers' Q1 EPS popped 70% to 63 cents, said the shoe maker late Thursday, on 27% revenue growth to $978.8 million. That beat analyst forecasts for profit of 54 cents a share and $913.4 million in sales.RELATED:With Warriors, Under Armour’s Got A Place Above Nike In NBA HistoryFickle Teens: Adidas Hotter Than Under Armour, Lululemon; Nike Rules.

217,UA,"Stocks were mixed going into the noon hour Thursday, but the indexes masked turmoil beneath the surface as unexpected earnings jerked stocks up or down.The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.2% in the stock market today. Volume was running higher than the same time Wednesday on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.The ""good"" was Under Armour (UA). It was no sweat for the sports apparel maker to report better-than-expected earnings of 4 cents a share, 2 cents above estimates and 33% above the year-earlier number. Revenue came in a $1.05 billion, beating estimates of $1.02 billion. The stock gapped up and was trading 8% higher, as it broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 45.53 buy point.The ""bad"" was chip designer Mellanox (MLNX), which gapped down, tumbling 13% and carrying the stock below a 47.70 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. It reported Q1 EPS of 81 cents and sales of $196.8 million, both above estimates, but it projected Q2 sales between $210 million and $215 million, below the consensus of $216.22 million.The ""ugly"" was Sherwin-Williams (SHW), which was painting a hideous outside reversal, falling more than 1% on above-average volume. It had been up 3% minutes after the open. The company reported earnings of $1.81 a share vs. forecasts of $1.62. The company is buying rival Valspar (VAL), and adjusted figures do not include 24 cents a share in acquisition costs.Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) jumped 3% after it reported EPS of 52 cents, 5 cents better than the consensus estimate and 30% better than a year earlier.

228,UA,"The major indexes continued a slow burn in early-afternoon trading Thursday, hurt by another day of intense selling in one of the best-performing sectors this year -- the utilities.The Dow Jones utility average shot 2.2% lower amid the recent jump in long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields. On Thursday, the 10-year yield headed toward 1.9%, up sharply from its Feb. 11 low of 1.63%. With positive economic data arriving week after week, it's possible that the market is anticipating higher inflation, which would justify the Federal Reserve's decision to press on with additional rate hikes.The U.S. central bank raised its fed funds rate target by 25 basis points in December last year to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Higher interest rates boost operating costs at utilities and also makes their dividends less competitive.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 each fell 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite was trading flat in the stock market today; volume was running at a moderately higher pace vs. the previous day on the NYSE and was roughly even on the Nasdaq.Back to the Dow utilities, all but one of the 15 components were seeing sharp declines.

The stock remains above its rising 50-day moving average and is up more than 15% past a 59.30 base-on-base buy point.On the upside, generic drug makers, apparel makers, educational software firms, specialty enterprise software names and biotechs all rallied sharply. Under Armour (UA) and farming and ranching goods retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) continue to act well, rising 8% and 5%, respectively. UA, which reported Q1 results this morning, is nearly 5% past a 45.53 cup-with-handle buy point; Tractor, which serves rural communities throughout the U.S., is holding above a 92.10 entry on a long cup-like base.Tractor Supply late Wednesday posted a 19% rise in earnings to 50 cents a share, the biggest EPS increase since a 20% lift in the year-earlier quarter. Sales picked up 10% to $1.47 billion; the average year-over-year revenue increase in the prior four quarters was 9%. Wall Street continues to see modest double-digit EPS growth both this year and the next. Tractor earns an 86 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.

232,UA,"Stocks reversed their opening gains Thursday and backed into mild losses, as mixed economic news and earnings reports energized busy early trade.The Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 dipped 0.3% each. Volume jumped 20% on the NYSE and was up 5% on the Nasdaq, relative to action at the same time Wednesday. Rising volume suggests that funds and other institutional investors are driving a large share of trade.Today's stock market received mixed economic news before the open.

The company announced better-than-expected revenue and adjusted earnings late Wednesday, but management trimmed the Q2 revenue guidance to below the consensus forecasts.

The stock recovered to just above that buy marker.Citrix Systems topped the IBD 50 list. Its big-volume, gap-up gain sent shares easily to a new high, leaving it extended 8% above an 80 buy point in a six-month cup with handle.

The Baltimore-based brand now appears poised for another round of victories if Curry and Spieth have their way.Curry's signature basketball shoe line was the main driver behind Under Armour's 95% footwear sales pop in the fourth quarter, and growth in golf apparel helped push up overall clothing revenue during the quarter.And as playoff season looms, the NBA MVP was spotted possibly giving the yet-to-be-released Curry Three shoe a test run at Warriors practice this week, according to the web site Complex.

236,UA,"Adidas is making a comeback in the hearts and minds of those who arguably matter most: teenagers. According to Piper Jaffray's latest semi-annual survey, the label has bypassed Under Armour (UA) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) in popularity as an athletic apparel brand.As a favorite activewear clothing brand, Adidas' share rose to 7% from 4%, year over year, shooting straight up to the No. 2 spot after sitting in fourth place for the previous three surveys. The brand was a ""positive standout in the athletic footwear and clothing category,"" said Piper Jaffray analysts.Under Armour and Lululemon ranked third and fourth, respectively, with 5% apiece in the spring poll.Nike (NKE) still reigns supreme, unsurprisingly, with 81% share as a preferred athletic footwear brand and 71% as a favorite athletic clothing brand, though it's losing a little luster among teen boys as Adidas picks up the pace.""The athletic brand grouping as a preferred apparel brand moved from 28% to 26% (year over year) with the decline entirely led by Nike (No. 1 brand) which moved among (upper-income) males from 40% to 33%,"" wrote Piper Jaffray. ""Adidas helped in part to offset the decline in Nike.""The survey, which found that the upper-income U.S. teen is spending more on footwear and less on apparel, said that Adidas doubled its ""mindshare"" (read: popularity) as a fashion footwear brand with more affluent teen boys. That figures is still in the single digits, but it represents much-needed gains for a brand that is No. 2 globally but has struggled Stateside in recent years.Adidas also appears on the top 10 list of favorite clothing brands among all upper-income teens for the first time in at least two years.

Obviously they're both repped by Under Armour, and they've built a friendship because of that,"" said ESPN's Marc Stein, later adding that Curry's collapse on the court ""was mock agony, but it wasn't really mock agony. ... He was shaken up by it and shocked by it.""Under Armour has built a solid roster of star athletes, with NBA MVP Curry at the front of the line and Spieth as the face of its golf apparel.Shares fell 5.5%, closing just above their 50-day line. The stock has been trading below its 200-day level since November, minus a brief peek above the key level on Friday.The knock to shares may be tied to Morgan Stanley's report from analyst Jay Sole calling out slowing U.S. wholesale apparel sales growth -- women's apparel in particular.""We think this, as well as soft running footwear trends, ultimately cause a future (quarterly) sales miss plus P/E contraction,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Sole pointed to SportScan figures that show a 2% decline in Q1 domestic wholesale apparel growth and 7% decline in women's apparel.Under Armour management has previously noted that SportScan data aren't representative of its entire business and shouldn't be used as a proxy for its success. Sole acknowledged that, but maintains the figures accurately point to a slowdown.""However, UA's own SEC filings show sales to its biggest customer, which we believe is Dick's Sporting Goods, were -8% in 4Q15,"" wrote Sole. ""We think this data point corroborates SportScan. Plus, we believe UA 4Q SSS were negative.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 3 cents and $444.3 million. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 sales rose 50%.

241,UA,"Under Armour (UA) star endorser Stephen Curry and his Golden State Warriors on Thursday became the second NBA team in basketball history to reach 70 wins in a regular season, bringing them ever closer to meeting and possibly beating that vaunted 72-10 regular-season record from the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls.By Friday afternoon, 22-year-old golf star Jordan Spieth was still leading the chase for another Masters as the reigning winner at Augusta.The continued success of both the Warriors and Spieth have put Under Armour in the spotlight, as the sports apparel brand builds out a lean but formidable presence in a market dominated by Nike (NKE).With a roster of athletes that also includes Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, Cowen analyst John Kernan told IBD in February that Under Armour has the ""best endorsements in the whole sector."" The Baltimore-based brand now appears poised for another round of victories if Curry and Spieth have their way.Curry's signature basketball shoe line was the main driver behind Under Armour's 95% footwear sales pop in the fourth quarter, and growth in golf apparel helped push up overall clothing revenue during the quarter.And as playoff season looms, the NBA MVP was spotted possibly giving the yet-to-be-released Curry Three shoe a test run at Warriors practice this week, according to the web site Complex.

252,UA,"Under Armour (UA) is gaining popularity in China, and that could mean big trouble in the not-so-little market for athletic gear rivals Nike (NKE) and Adidas.According to FBR's Chinese consumer preference survey, 64% of those polled had heard of Under Armour, up from 58% the previous year, and of those respondents, 82% were likelier to buy Under Armour branded products this year. Only 2% were less likely to make a purchase of the Stephen Curry-endorsed brand.""Our results give us substantial confidence in UA’s growth trajectory in the market over the next few years, and 2016 could be a larger growth year than 2015 driven by the Curry tour in fall 2015,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson in a Tuesday report, estimating that China revenue could reach about $400 million by 2018.The Baltimore-based company recorded $30 million in revenue in China in 2014, she noted.

253,UA,"Express may not have the cachet of power brands like Nike and Under Armour, but the specialty retailer of clothing for consumers ages 20-30 thinks it has elevated its image among millennials using some of the same marketing tactics.Express (EXPR) has signed sports stars and models to serve as ""brand ambassadors,"" a variation on the promotions used by such sportswear giants as Under Armour (UA) and Nike (NKE). The effort may never become part of the public conversation like Nike's famed ""Air Jordan"" campaign featuring basketball great Michael Jordan, but it is unusual for fashion retailers to employ the move.All-Star third baseman Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs signed on in March with Express. He joins supermodel Kate Upton and Golden State Warriors basketball guard Steph Curry -- arguably the best player in the game today. Curry and Upton became brand ambassadors in 2014.""Express recognized the value of elevating a brand around ambassadors,"" Nomura Securities senior analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""The athletic companies do that very well, but generally speaking, mall-based fashion companies have not utilized that approach. Express has embraced that and is appealing to millennials.""It's just one tactic Express is using to create buzz in the hotly competitive fashion retail arena. Since taking the helm in January 2015, Chief Executive David Kornberg has implemented a number of initiatives that have vaulted the company's financial performance after some years of tough times.His efforts are bearing fruit. Express has logged four straight quarters of at least double-digit earnings growth. Now, after a strong performance in 2015, Express is expected to keep up its winning streak.Kornberg has a number of new initiatives on tap, including the launch of new planning systems expected to come online soon, an upgrade to its e-commerce experience and a continued rollout of its off-price store concept.It also is improving store productivity through individual outlet closures. Express closed 27 stores in 2015, and another 17 are set for closure in fiscal 2016. It now operates more than 650 retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and in Canada.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Express to see a 16% rise in earnings this year to $1.68 a share after an 79% year-over-year earnings gain in 2015. They forecast a 9% increase in 2017.But it could take some doing for Express to keep up the momentum, say analysts.""(The year) 2015 benefited from a regime change that drove some really strong improvements in the business in its first year,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Paul Alexander told IBD. ""I think they harvested a lot of low hanging fruit in 2015, but I don't see as much opportunity in 2016.""""Their goal is to continue to be lean on inventories, to continue to improve the fashion and to continue to be conservative (on the financial front),"" Alexander went on to say. ""This year, they're focused on rolling out state-of-the-art retail systems that should start paying off in 2017.""Kornberg modified the retailer's product makeup to incorporate more fashion items and bring newer fashions more often, as well as expand product categories and launch new collections, he said on the company's recent fourth-quarter conference call.It's no easy feat marketing and selling to millennials in an environment where it is competing for their business with cheap chic ""fast-fashion"" retailers like privately held Forever 21 and Sweden-based H&M.""They're definitely in direct competition for the millennial wallet with the fast-fashion guys,"" said Alexander. He says Express differs from these competitors by offering better quality merchandise and by having an assortment of clothing that covers a ""broad array of occasions,"" from casual and jeans to clothes for work.The company also put in new inventory management, speed-to-market and product testing disciplines. Express also continued to upgrade its systems and processes. And Kornberg laid out a financial plan.""Kornberg put an emphasis on consistent and steady, modest gains in both comps and margins, as opposed to swinging for home runs,"" said Alexander.Alexander sees Express growing earnings over the next few years.""But I worry if they don't get enough benefits out of implementing these new systems, competitive headwinds may weigh on EPS growth, and we will likely see the pace at which they grow earnings moderate,"" Alexander said.For now, Express is on a growth trajectory. One sign of that came during its holiday fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, when earnings jumped 37% to 67 cents a share. Sales increased 5% to $765.6 million. Same-store sales, including e-commerce sales, rose 4% from a year earlier.Total e-commerce sales increased 8% to $156.3 million. Merchandise margin grew by 180 basis points, due to carefully managed promotions and inventory levels, the company said. Its gross margin rose to 34.0% from 31.7% a year earlier.Kornberg, who had been president, added the title of chief executive when Michael Weiss retired after a longtime stint in the post. He immediately set out to make some changes where Express -- which got its start in 1980 as a division of L Brands (LB), formerly Limited Brands -- had been lacking, analysts say.""The new CEO looked at this business and wanted to build a sustainable business model, which involved (reporting) a low-single-digit comp, and on top of that, if they spent a few years updating their systems, then the low-single-digit comp would translate to low double-digit operating income growth,"" said Nomura's Siegel.""The stock is now at a crossroads,"" Siegel said. ""They had a very successful year. Now investors will find out if it was because of the strength of the business, given the right processes are now in place, or if it was simply due to a year of strong products and the right merchandise.""Siegel believes it is the former. He says investors often mistake Express for ""the old, fashion-driven"" company it was as a part of Limited.""Express has the opportunity to see both upward earnings revisions and upward multiple expansion,"" Siegel said. ""I think it is an under-appreciated story. I think the appreciation will come when people see that Express is not the Express of old.""

254,UA,"Last week, Nike (NKE) gave consumers a peek into a future of self-lacing shoes and more footwear with knit uppers. Meanwhile, one analyst has provided a glimpse into third-quarter futures orders growth -- a key metric for the sports footwear and apparel maker that indicates demand.Profit-wise, Nike's Q3 earnings are expected to grow 7% to 48 cents a share, ending a string of six straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth ranging from 18%-28%. Wall Street analysts expect revenue growth to ramp up to 10%, however, to $8.2 billion. That would reflect a quarter-over-quarter acceleration from 4% revenue growth in the previous quarter.On Monday, JPMorgan Chase added Nike to its Analyst Focus List as a growth strategy pick, saying channel checks point to continued sales growth and ""rational"" promotions and inventory levels. Nike also reportedly hired a top footwear designer from rival Under Armour (UA).Aside from earnings and revenue, futures orders -- which are orders scheduled for delivery to retailers over the next several months -- are another stat that will get close inspection from analysts and investors when Nike reports Tuesday after the close.In Q2, the company logged currency-neutral growth of 20% in futures orders. Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu had called the figure ""absolutely astounding"" and above consensus estimates for midteens growth.Investors shouldn't expect to see quite the same spike in futures orders this time around, according to Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser, who is predicting a 13.4% currency-neutral increase in futures orders for the quarter.""We . . . contend the 20% increase in FX-neutral futures at the end of 2Q was an anomaly,"" he wrote Wednesday, but added that any deceleration in futures orders growth should ""not be cause for concern.""""For a company that posts $30B in annual sales, 13% growth is still very impressive,"" he said.Nike remains the dominant force in athletic footwear and sportswear, but Under Armour has been hustling to score more market share from the legacy brand. And Adidas is working on a turnaround after slipping to the No. 3 position to Under Armour in recent years.Both Under Armour and Adidas are getting more love during March Madness. But Nike likely won't fall to its competitors anytime soon.""We believe the recent strength of Adidas add more focus to the sports business, and will do nothing to slow Nike's momentum,"" wrote Poser, who has a buy rating and 75 price target on the stock.And with the Olympics in just a few months, investors can perhaps expect to hear some chatter about the games on the company's conference call.Jefferies analyst Edward Plank believes ""trends through the quarter, coupled with (Foot Locker)'s recent results and comments about the health of the athletic cycle, point to potential upside as well as a positive forward outlook and likelihood for futures growth to exceed expectations.""Nike shares rose 0.3% to 64.90 on the stock market today. Nike stock rose 2.75% on Monday to 64.72, clearing a resistance area near 63.50.The stock is moving toward its December intraday high of 68.19, with a current buy point of 68.29.Foot Locker (FL) shares fell 0.7%, finding resistance near its 200-day line, after rising 2.2% Monday.

255,UA,"Nike (NKE) missed third-quarter revenue forecasts and offered fiscal 2017 guidance that came in below views, prompting shares to tumble 4% in Wednesday morning trade but hold above their 50-day line.However, analysts generally remain bullish on the athletic wear market leader as China's performance stood out, North American inventory levels appeared to normalize, and futures orders growth of 17% exceeded expectations during the quarter.Here's what they had to say:Jefferies Edward Plank cut his price target to 74 from 76 but reiterated a buy rating, citing ""strong underlying demand coupled with a compelling slate of new product innovations and sporting events over the course of the year"" as driving optimism.Nike management said during the call that it is investing in ""significant brand initiatives"" early in fiscal 2017 that include the Rio Olympics and European Football Championships. It sees low-teens EPS growth for 2017, weighted more toward the latter half of the fiscal year due to those brand investments and ""also due to unfavorable FX comparisons being more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year.""""But its long term prospects are very favorable, given the brand's vibrant health globally and likelihood for numerous product launches and major sports catalysts to fuel demand and results beyond current expectations,"" wrote Plank.Nike's business ""remains very healthy,"" said Sterne Agee CRT's Sam Poser, adding that the company's product and innovation pipeline are ""incredibly robust."" He sees the low-teens EPS and high-single-digit revenue growth outlook for 2017 as a ""base case ... (that) will likely be raised as the year progresses.""Credit Suisse's Christian Buss bumped up his price target to 68 from 67.""We continue to view Nike as an exceptional executor within the maturing athletic market and see the potential for double-digit earnings growth to be sustained going forwards,"" he wrote Wednesday.The company's story remains ""fully intact,"" wrote Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu, who told IBD late Tuesday that foreign-exchange woes are starting to abate, which is ""really encouraging.""But ongoing foreign-exchange pressures, for now, remain a concern for some analysts. And a possible comeback by Adidas plus Under Armour's (UA) aggressive growth Stateside loom.Nike CEO Mark Parker, speaking to analysts Tuesday, emphasized the company's focus on innovation (a word that was uttered at least two dozen times during the conference call), both in products and on a digital front with its new Nike+ app.""(W)e’re incredibly proud of the spectrum, the scope of innovation that we had in footwear, in apparel, competitively in sportswear really much across the spectrum, the complete offense that I had talked about,"" Parker said during the call. ""And then in digital, obviously that continues to be incredibly important for us. I think you’ll see a stream of innovation coming from Nike in that area. It continues to be a high priority for the company and obviously important to the consumer and the athletes that we’re hear to serve.""Nike shares closed down 3.8% at 62.44 on the stock market today after scuttling as low as 61.15. Under Armour shares fell 1.9%.Foot Locker (FL), which sells a lot of Nike gear, fell 3.6%, dropping below its 50-day moving average.Image provided by Shutterstock.

256,UA,"Nike (NKE) is drifting further away from a potential buy point and breaching two critical levels in the stock market today.The athletic shoe and apparel leader is involved in a Kenyan corruption probe for allegedly bribing officials to keep Nike as the sponsor of Kenya’s famed runners, according to the New York Times. Nike says the money was intended to train poor athletes and denies any wrongdoing.Nike sank 3.3%, dropping below its 50-day and 200-day lines in slightly above-average volume and marking its fourth straight day of declines. Nike fell below the 50-day line on Friday but was able to pare its losses and close above the line.The stock is now 7% below a double-bottom-base buy point at 63.60 and 13% below its December high.Still, Nike looks to be performing better than its peers.Under Armour (UA) is trading 21% below its high reached last September, and dipped nearly 1% Monday. The stock was able to retake its 50-day line last month, but has still yet to retake its 200-day line.Similarly, Skechers (SKX) is above its 50-day line but below the longer-term 200-day line. Shares are trading 40% below their August peak, and lost 3.1% Monday.And Foot Locker (FL) is trading 19% below its September high as it continues to consolidate. The stock fell 1%.Last week, sporting goods retailer Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy. Under Armour reaffirmed its full-year guidance, saying it does not believe that exposure to its receivables from Sports Authority is materially impacted by the bankruptcy.Nike has not issued a statement regarding Sports Authority’s filing.

257,UA,"Lululemon (LULU) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results early Wednesday, giving shares of the yogawear maker a boost as investors shrugged off sluggish Q1 and full-year earnings guidance.Per-share earnings grew 9% to 85 cents in the quarter ended Jan. 31, a nickel above forecasts. Revenue climbed 17% to $704.3 million, ahead of estimates for $693.4 million.Total same-store sales, including direct-to-consumer sales, increased 11%. Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 33%.""As expected, LULU ended 4Q15 with elevated inventory levels, up 36.5%,"" wrote Sterne Agee CRT's Sam Poser in a brief note prior to the Lululemon earnings call. ""Lululemon is still in the process of clearing the excess inventory from the port disruptions of last year in a methodical manner.""Lululemon shares closed up 10.7% to 67.80 on the stock market today, breaking out of a consolidation to a nine-month high. Athletic apparel peer Nike (NKE) shares rose 0.9%, and Under Armour (UA) added 2.55%.For Q1, Lululemon expects 28-30 cents in EPS, well below current expectations for 37 cents, on $483 million-$488 million in revenue. Wall Street sees $485.2 million in sales, in line with the midpoint of guidance. The apparel maker sees midsingle-digit comps.FBR analyst Susan Anderson said the slowdown in Q1 comp guidance from the previous quarter was ""likely due to less clearance sales as we believe this has driven (about) 3%+ of the comp.""The company guided for $2.05-$2.15 in 2016 EPS on sales of $2.285 billion-$2.335 billion. Analysts expect $2.16 in per-share profit and $2.328 billion in revenue for the year.

Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.
"
259,UA,"Under Armour’s (UA) fourth-quarter same-store sales likely weren't very strong, said Morgan Stanley, partly because women may not love the brand as much as men do.Under Armour's most recently reported quarterly comps were likely flat or declined 3%, year over year, said the firm, which pointed to store-count growth outpacing direct-to-consumer growth in Q4.Shares closed down 1%, having found support at their 50-day line on Feb. 16.The company, which had 191 standalone and factory stores by the end of 2015, does not break out same-store sales for those locations. Much of its merchandise is sold through chains such as Foot Locker (FL) and Sports Authority, the latter of which just filed for bankruptcy protection.While warmer-than-expected weather, poor mall traffic and other factors could have impacted comps, analyst Jay Sole also noted a maturing brand, more women's activewear choices on the market, and the idea that some women may be put off by the brand's ""aggressive, young and fearless"" image.Plus, ""we don't think (Under Armour)'s product has been as good as it needs to be to fend off competition from Nike (NKE), Victoria's Secret, Lululemon (LULU), and others,"" he wrote, adding that women have far less brand loyalty than men. Victoria's Secret is owned by L Brands (LB).Under Armour has been making a big push for more female customers with endorsers such as dancer Misty Copeland and model Gisele Bundchen.Among other concerns highlighted in Sole's lengthy analysis are a decline in average sale prices for running footwear and the stock's high valuation.Shares of Nike fell 1%, Lululemon lost 1.6% and L Brands dipped 0.6%.Morgan Stanley's commentary comes just a day after William Blair said Under Armour lost market share with teens and young adults in 2015.Meanwhile, Adidas recently brought on former Lululemon CEO Christine Day as a strategic advisor as it looks to capture more market share among women.Adidas, once a much more dominant force in sportswear, slipped to the No. 3 spot in the U.S. in 2014 behind Under Armour. (Nike continues to sit pretty at the top of the heap.)But on Thursday, Adidas said Q4 sales grew 8% in North America -- Adidas brand sales alone grew 12% in the region -- a marked difference from the 4% North American sales decline that it logged in the year-ago Q4. Management also forecast 10%-12% in currency-neutral sales in 2016 as management sounded bullish about the brand's year ahead.It remains to be seen whether Adidas can retake its second-place spot and displace Under Armour, but activewear makers won't be able to rest in the competition for women's wallets.Speaking broadly about women's apparel in his Under Armour note, Sole said: ""Women will search each season to find the best product for them and go with it, no matter what brand it is. To have a strong and growing women's business, apparel companies have to earn it, year after year.""RELATED:Under Armour Share Loss In This Key Demographic Is ‘Disconcerting’Can Stephen Curry Be Under Armour’s Michael Jordan?Adidas Boosts Outlook, Seen Heating Up Race Vs.

Adidas and Converse also declined in popularity from the previous year. Lululemon (LULU) remained in the No. 5 spot and gained slightly.Under Armour's downward trend isn't reflected in its booming sales, which have been bolstered by star endorser Steph Curry's upward trajectory. William Blair notes that the brand is still one of the survey's top share gainers since 2009 among young men.""While it is disconcerting that Under Armour lost share for the first time in our survey, we are hard-pressed to find a correlation between the survey and recent sales trends at Under Armour, which remain stellar,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia.But as it loses favor with young people, could that spell trouble down the road?""However, given Under Armour’s status as the athletic brand of the next generation,"" she said, ""we would be concerned to see Under Armour’s share continue to wane in future surveys.""Under Armour shares fell 1.2% in the stock market today.

But what does that strategy entail?While Under Armour's (UA) digital arm involves the development and sale of wearable fitness technology, Nike has shied away from hardware after abandoning its Nike FuelBand in 2014. But digital is a ""vital accelerator"" for the business, it said Tuesday.""We think this is e-commerce related,"" Cowen & Co. analyst John Kernan told IBD, given that Nike ""sees its e-commerce platform growing by $6 (billion) into 2020.  (Nike) is managing their content very tightly but has no interest in wearables.""The Swoosh has set its sights on e-commerce reaching $7 billion in revenue by that time. On the company's Q2 earnings call in December, CEO Mark Parker said that the Nike.com business grew ""nearly 50%"" on a constant-currency basis in that quarter alone.And it is plowing ahead into new online markets. In Q2, Nike launched e-commerce sites for Canada, Switzerland and Norway, and has broadened its Nike.com coverage to include the ""sports-obsessed cultures"" Mexico, Turkey and Chile during the current quarter.The sportswear market leader may want little to do with wearables, but it is undoubtedly still looking to connect with athletes and potential customers through its suite of Nike+ apps.  Nike has a long relationship with Apple (AAPL), and Mark Parker told CNBC last May to expect ""more from Apple and Nike -- two great brands, lots of potential and opportunity.""""Digital, of course, also allows us to deepen the relationships we already have with consumers by tailoring every interaction to their specific needs,"" said Parker in December's call.

But shares slid late Tuesday after the sportswear giant's third-quarter revenue and fiscal 2017 guidance fell short of views.Earnings rose 22% to 55 cents a share, well above forecasts for 48 cents a share and continuing a string of double-digit earnings gains ranging from 18% to 28% over the past six quarters.Reported revenue grew 8% to $8.03 billion, which fell short of estimates for $8.2 billion but marked an acceleration from the prior quarter’s 4% sales gain.Nike shares dropped 6% in after-hours trading.Revenue for the Nike brand alone rose 15% on a currency-neutral basis to $7.6 billion, said the company, while Converse revenue fell 5%, ex-currency, to $489 million.Nike recorded currency-neutral futures order growth of 17%, ""reflecting continued strong demand for the Nike brand around the world,"" said management during the post-earnings conference call. Sterne Agee CRT analysts had estimated 13.4% growth, minus currency swings, while Macquarie’s Laurent Vasilescu had forecast a low-teens rise. Consensus estimates were for mid-teens futures orders growth.For fiscal 2017, Nike executives said during the call, the company expects currency-neutral revenue to grow in the high-single to low-double-digit range, and it anticipates reported revenue to grow at a high-single-digit rate. It also expects low-teens EPS growth.That guidance falls below current analyst estimates for 15% per-share profit growth on 10% reported revenue gains for 2017.During the quarter, Nike management said that its women's business continues to outpace the men's business and that the company is heading into the Rio Olympics with ""plenty of brand momentum.""“The one disappointment is emerging markets, (which were) a little lighter than expected, and Western Europe,” which also fell slightly short of his estimates, said Vasilescu.Excluding currency changes, Nike’s emerging markets segment revenue grew 11%, and Western Europe revenue rose 12%.“The big question from an investor standpoint is: Is Adidas waking up?” Vasilescu told IBD prior to Nike’s earnings call with analysts. “And if that’s the case ... how do we think about Western Europe’s growth algorithm going forward?”Adidas, which has slid to third place behind Under Armour (UA) in the U.S. in recent years, has been in the process of engineering a turnaround.Amid the ongoing popularity of ""athleisure"" -- that is, activewear as regular street wear -- and the broader struggling retail environment, competition for consumer dollars has been particularly fierce.Late Monday, reports surfaced that Nike had hired top Under Armour designer Dave Dombrow, who was most recently the Baltimore-based company's senior vice president of design.""We do not expect the poaching to end anytime soon as the battle for footwear supremacy continues,"" wrote Sterne Agee CRT's Sam Poser on Monday, calling it ""just the beginning among the top companies.""Under Armour shares dipped 1.5% late after closing down 1.2% during the regular session.Nike also unveiled a number of product launches at its innovation event last week, debuting ""Back to the Future""-style self-lacing shoes, a number of new additions to its Flyknit line and a revamped Nike+ app likely designed to compete with the likes of Under Armour's assertive push into connected fitness.
"
266,UA,"Nike (NKE) announced the June launch of its new Nike+ app, which now includes features like a customized feed and access to Nike experts.The company rolled out a number of new items at its innovation event Wednesday in New York City, including anti-clog cleats and a ""Back To The Future""-style ""adaptive lacing"" shoe that allows the wearer to tighten and loosen the fit via two buttons. Its revamped app follows the recent creation of a chief digital officer position and an announced acceleration of its digital strategy as it aims to bag $50 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal 2020.Rival Under Armour (UA) has kept its focus on building out a wearables portfolio and ramping up its online community via a series of app acquisitions. Its collective platforms now boast a total of 160 million users.""(Nike) also announced that it will more directly compete with Under Armour's (UA-$81.03-Hold) Connected Fitness App, UA Record, by re-launching its own app as a sports training app and mobile store,"" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Corinna Freedman in a brief note Wednesday.Nike nixed its hardware development some time ago. The overhauled Nike+ app now offers a customized feed comprised of training tips and news, an online shop, and a ""services"" function that offers direct contact with Nike+ experts and the ability to make reservations to certain Nike stores, among other things.The new app, which connects to its running, training club and sneaker apps, also comes with an inbox and a personal QR code that can be added to Apple (AAPL) Wallet or used at a Nike store or event, said the company.Nike shares closed up 0.75% to 61.86 on stock market today. Under Armour shares fell 2 cents to 81.RELATED:Nike Is Ramping Up Its Digital Strategy: What Does That Mean?

267,UA,"Shares of G-III Apparel (GIII) tumbled early Tuesday after the company fell well short of quarterly earnings views and offered disappointing guidance.Reporting before the open, G-III posted adjusted earnings of 17 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in January. That was down from 49 cents the prior year and well below consensus estimates for 42 cents.It was the first time in four years the company logged lower earnings. The results also ended a run of four straight quarters of double-digit or better EPS growth for G-III, which sells everything from swimwear and accessories to outerwear and performance wear under its own Vilebrequin, Andrew Marc and Marc New York brands as well as licensed brands like Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Kenneth Cole and Tommy Hilfiger.Quarterly revenue gained 2% to $527.4 million, also well below estimates.G-III shares sank 19.4% to 44.52 in the stock market today after falling as low as 41.14. The stock had been rallying since mid-January and closed Monday’s session up 1% to 55.23.In a statement, CEO Morris Goldfarb called fiscal 2016 “a very strong year” for G-III, but said the company was “disappointed by our wholesale and retail outerwear business, which was heavily impacted by the warmest winter ever recorded. ... That said, we had excellent performances from our nonouterwear Calvin Klein businesses, as well as our dress and team sports businesses. We have significantly expanded our relationship with the Tommy Hilfiger brand and increased our financial investment and partnership with the Karl Lagerfeld brand. We will be making significant investments in these brands going forward.”G-III guided fiscal 2017 earnings in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 a share, below the $2.69 expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Another apparel company, PVH (PVH), is slated to report fiscal Q4 results after Wednesday’s close. Analysts expect a 17% earnings dip to $1.46 a share. Revenue is seen inching up less than 1% to $2.073 billion. PVH shares fell 1.7% Tuesday.IBD’s Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing group ranks No. 83 out of 197 industries tracked. That’s up from No. 179 as recently as 13 weeks ago.

268,UA,"Athletic apparel-related stocks are on the move today, with JPMorgan (JPM) dumping Lululemon (LULU) from its focus list for Nike (NKE).The analyst called Nike’s brand “best-in-class” and added that it has a “significant runway remaining” in the long term, with strength in footwear and an under-penetrated women’s apparel market. The analyst also raised its price target on the overweight-rated stock from 67.50 to 72. Nike is currently trading around 64-65.Shares climbed 2.8% in quick turnover, hitting a three-month high. The stock is now trading about 5% below a consolidation base buy point at 68.29.Nike reports quarterly results after the close on Tuesday. Analysts see earnings growth of 9%, a deceleration from last quarter’s 22% gain.Meanwhile, JPMorgan sees a “tough” first half of the year for Lululemon and expects the company to guide first-quarter earnings below the Street estimate when it reports fourth-quarter results on March 30. The Q4 consensus forecast is for earnings growth of 3%, a turnaround from the prior quarter’s 17% decline.Lulu shares dropped 3.7% in heavy volume, breaching its 50-day line in intraday trade but finding support at that level.

270,UA,"There's a new wearables game in town, but it's not from a traditional hardware maker like Fitbit (FIT) or Apple (AAPL), but from sportswear maker Under Armour (UA).Under Armour Chief Digital Officer and MapMyFitness co-founder Robin Thurston told Investor's Business Daily about the company's wearables strategy and about its focus on fitness technology.The company's new HealthBox kit -- introduced at CES -- includes a fitness tracker, smart scale and heart-rate monitor that can all connect wirelessly to its app, UA Record. The app is powered by IBM's (IBM) cognitive computing wiz Watson.""Consumers are still a bit confused about how all of this stuff works together, what do they need to get started, it's still a little too complicated, there's too much friction, and so there isn't necessarily one specific feature of HealthBox that is not out in the market,"" he said. ""There are some things that we think are innovative in there, but it's really the collection, it's the system, it's giving someone a starter kit to basically to get going, to understand the four quadrants that we're really aiming at, which are sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition, and bringing them and making it super easy for them to get those insights and to achieve those goals every day. Healthbox as a starter kit and system is really what we think is going to differentiate us in the marketplace.""What's the next logical step for Under Armour?""We've been pretty clear that we think some type of smart technology will be in all of our products,"" said Thurston. ""That might mean biometrics, it might not. It might just be being able to tell you how long a product should last, or kicking off an application in a phone easily. So logically, we wanted to build HealthBox to make it simple for the user, with products that are there now in the marketplace and make it even easier for them to interact with our products. But ultimately, we've been pretty clear that we think everything is going to be smart that we make.""Watch the video for more excerpts of IBD's interview with Thurston.RELATED:

It will be necessary for them to capitalize on social fitness in order to grow in the months ahead.”Nike shares closed down 3.7%. Under Armour shares tumbled 6.2%, Skechers (SKX) lost 2.9% and Foot Locker (FL) fell 2%.Powell had told IBD in January that millennials are very social in their fitness activities, unlike their older peers, ""who would lift some weights and leave without talking to anyone.""""(They're) taking more classes, and with the rest of social media they’re sharing their experiences with their friends,"" he said at the time. ""They are really focused more on the social side.""Under Armour has been aggressively pursuing the social-media-attuned workout junkie with a series of app acquisitions and, most recently, the debut of wearable fitness gear as well as a rebooted app powered by IBM's (IBM) Watson supercomputer.In athletic footwear, more casual and retro styles gained popularity last year, while growth in performance styles -- running and basketball in particular -- eased, NPD found.But retro running and retro basketball shoes helped the classics category climb by 30%, year over year.Powell said he expects last year's momentum in athletic footwear to continue into 2016.RELATED:Can Under Armour’s Wearables Woo The Next Generation From Nike?

274,UA,"Superstitious investors may be aware of the ""Super Bowl indicator,"" which says that if an original NFL team wins, the market will end the year up, but an original AFL win translates to a down year for stocks.Regardless of who triumphs on Sunday, these four names are likely to appear at the big game, whether at the stadium or in living rooms across America:The Swoosh is a recurring member of the IBD 50 and also the NFL's official outfitter, which means that both the Denver Broncos and North Carolina Panthers will be geared up in Nike on the field.Nike (NKE) remains, far and away, the market leader in sportswear, but Under Armour (UA) has been aggressively trying to capture more market share. Panthers quarterback Cam Newton endorses Under Armour. His Broncos counterpart, Peyton Manning, has a Nike endorsement deal.For the week that ended Jan. 30, Nike's athletic footwear sales fell 9.1% from the previous year, while Under Armour's jumped 70.5%, according to Deutsche Bank, citing SportScanInfo data.Shares fell 5% in the stock market Friday, hitting the lowest close since Sept. 15.The hawker of football jerseys and other sports apparel is another recurring member of this IBD hot list.Sterne Agee CRT noted in November that Foot Locker (FL), following a view-topping Q3, was ""clearly taking share"" from the likes of Finish Line (FINL), Hibbett Sports (HIBB) and others.Foot Locker stock fell 3.3% on Friday, moving back below its 200-day moving average.Fans are likely to put down a cold beer or three this Sunday.The parent of Corona Extra, Svedka vodka and Robert Mondavi trounced Q3 earnings last month, with Argus Research analyst John Staszak telling IBD in January that Constellation Brands (STZ) had a ""sensational quarter, driven by strong beer sales.""Constellation's in-development $1.5 billion brewery in Mexicali, Mexico, is expected to start operating in 2019. In addition, the company has a $500 million expansion in store for its Nava brewery, also in Mexico.

Nevertheless, the stock sank 6.1%, tumbling below its 50-day moving average and closing below that level for the first time since late September. Constellation hit a record high on Monday but ended the week down 9.5%.Both victory and defeat will surely spill over onto social media after the game, and clips of Budweiser's Clydesdales and wacky Super Bowl ads are bound for Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR).Facebook recently said that it intends to raise 2016 capital spending by about 70% to $4 billion-$4.5 billion.The company has also been working on turning social networking into social commerce as it develops M, a virtual personal assistant that can help make appointments or buy movie tickets.

278,UA,"Stocks rebounded in early afternoon trading Thursday amid strong earnings reports and a rebound in oil prices.The Nasdaq was up 0.9%, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%. Volume was running higher on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq compared with the same time Wednesday.Oil was up 3%, climbing above $33 a barrel, after Russia's energy minister reportedly said Saudi Arabia proposed that oil-producing countries cut output by 5% to bolster plunging crude prices.The reports boosted oil stocks such as Devon Energy (DVN), which jumped 9%, and oil and gas transporter Kinder Morgan (KMI), which rose more than 8%. Yet both stocks remain battered, down more than 60% off their 52-week highs.Elsewhere in the stock market today, social media giant Facebook (FB) and athleticwear maker Under Armour (UA) soared after their quarterly earnings reports.Under Armour rocketed 20% after reporting that Q4 profit rose a better-than-expected 20% from the same period last year on a 31% gain in sales. Chief Financial Officer Brad Dickerson also dismissed concerns about a possible decline in market share. Volume was huge as the stock retook its downward-sloping 50-week line.Facebook soared more than 15%, leading the IBD 50. The stock rebounded above its 50-day line and approached a new high after the company reported that Q4 profit jumped 46% to 79 cents a share. Revenue rose 52% to $5.84 billion. Both figures easily beat Wall Street estimates. Facebook also reported an increase in the number of daily active users.On the downside, biotech stock Celgene (CELG) dropped 4%, falling further below its downward-trending 200-day and 50-day lines, on a disappointing quarterly earnings report.Hawaiian Holdings (HA), which provides passenger and cargo service between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland,  dropped more than 2% in heavy volume.

She reiterated her overweight rating on the stock but slashed her price target to 24 from 60 on reset expectations for the San Francisco-based company.Fitbit went public on June 18 at 20 and climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5. The stock cratered after a disappointing showing at the CES consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas in early January.On Friday, Fitbit stock fell 2.5% to 15.60 after rival Garmin (GRMN) announced two new fitness wearables that will ship in the second quarter.Garmin introduced the Vivofit 3 daily activity tracker and Vivoactive HR smartwatch. The Vivofit 3 starts at $99.99 and features one-year battery life and automatic activity detection. The Vivoactive HR is a GPS smartwatch with wrist-based heart-rate tracking and costs $249.99.“While Fitbit has clearly been a very challenged stock year-to-date, we remain overweight on the stock into the Q4 print,” Murphy said in a report. “As we are now past the share lockup period, investors should begin looking at fundamentals again.”Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Fitbit to earn 25 cents a share excluding items on sales of $648 million in the December quarter. Sales in the year-earlier period were $370 million.For the March quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Fitbit to earn 23 cents a share on sales of $485 million. In Q1 2015, Fitbit reported sales of $337 million.“We view fiscal 2016 favorably, given already announced new product launches (with more to come), the opportunity on the corporate wellness side, and an attractive multiple entry point into shares,” Murphy said.Fitbit’s newest products, the Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband, are set to go on sale in March.Fitbit faces a host of competitors in addition to Garmin. They include Apple (AAPL), Fossil (FOSL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).On Wednesday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson reiterated his overweight rating on Fitbit but cut his price target to 31 from 47.“Demand appears steady after the holiday, but days of inventory are higher,” Erickson said. “Our upside bias to numbers remains and valuation is compelling, but we are tempering our expectations for multiple expansion, given inevitably slowing growth in 2016, even as corporate wellness remains a free call option in the name.”RELATED:Fitbit 2016 Outlook An Exercise In Worry For Investors?Fitbit Gets Fashionable With Alta Fitness Wristband.

(The Journal says that Nike is providing both uniforms and sneakers to 41 teams, but only its footwear will be found on players from Austin Peay State University, Hampton University and Southern University; their uniforms will come from Russell Athletic.)Under Armour has been steadily elbowing its way into basketball territory, picking up an endorsement deal with the University of Cincinnati last year. The Cincinnati Bearcats are seeded No. 9 in the West region.And on a pro level, Golden State Warriors point guard and NBA MVP Stephen Curry has brought Under Armour center stage as the team aims to topple the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls' single-season record of 72 wins.Each team on the March Madness court could translate to dollars. According to NPD Group analyst Matt Powell, March Madness is the fifth most important selling period for basketball shoes during the year.""Sales during this period are not that much higher than an average week but still enough to move the weeks into a top spot for the year,"" Powell wrote Wednesday.Adidas backs the South region's No. 1 seed, Kansas, but Nike sponsors the other three top seeds -- North Carolina in the East, Oregon in the West, Virginia in the Midwest.Under Armour shares have been trading above their 50-day line since finding support in mid-February, but they remain below the key 200-day level.

282,UA,"Nike (NKE) has suspended its endorsement deal with tennis star Maria Sharapova following the Monday shocker that she failed a doping test. But who will step into her multimillion dollar shoes, now that she has been suspended by the International Tennis Federation?Sharapova held a press conference in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, not to announce her retirement from the sport -- as many had anticipated -- but to say that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug that was recently added to the banned substances list. The 28-year-old, five-time grand slam winner said she had been taking meldonium since 2006 for several health issues that included a magnesium deficiency and irregular EKG results.""It’s very important for you to understand that for 10 years, this medicine was not on WADA’s ban list, and I had been legally taking the medicine for the past 10 years,"" she said at a press conference Monday. ""But on Jan. 1, the rules had changed, and meldonium became a prohibited substance, which I had not known.""She acknowledged that she would face consequences, and those consequences came swiftly. In addition to Nike, Tag Heuer and Porsche have also distanced themselves from Sharapova in the wake of her admission.Nike's eight-year contract with the 2014 French Open winner, signed in 2010, is reportedly worth $70 million. According to Forbes, Sharapova was the 26th highest-paid athlete in 2015, with $23 million in endorsement deals making up the bulk of her $29.7 million earnings.Shares of Nike closed up 1% to 59.81 Tuesday, closing just below the 50-day moving average and above the 200-day -- after crossing both lines intraday. Nike hit a record high of 68.19 on Dec. 23.Under Armour (UA), whose tennis stars include Andy Murray, fell 2.3%.Sharapova is not the only tennis pro on Nike's roster, or the winningest. Serena Williams, the No. 1 ranked women's player in the world, also has a deal with the Swoosh. And she has racked up far more wins that Sharapova, who is ranked No. 7. Williams has 69 career singles titles to Sharapova's 35, according to the WTA, and has won more than twice the prize money in her lifetime.The value of Williams' current contract with Nike is sketchy. Forbes put her 2015 endorsement earnings at $13 million for a total haul of $24.6 million.Victoria Azarenka and Eugenie Bouchard are among those in the tennis world also sponsored by Nike. On the men's side, Nike still has a number of champions in the way of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Sharapova, whose suspension takes effect on March 12, hopes to make a comeback soon.""I don’t want to end my career this way, and I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,"" she told reporters on Monday. ""And I know many of you thought that I would be retiring today and announcing my retirement, but if I was ever going to announce my retirement, it would probably not be in a downtown Los Angeles hotel with this fairly ugly carpet.""

283,UA,"The weekly sales figures are in yet again, and Under Armour (UA) sales growth outpaced that of Adidas (ADDYY), Nike (NKE) and Skechers (SKX) for the week ended March 12.Under Armour athletic footwear revenue grew 61.8% year over year that week, wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, citing SportScanInfo data. The Curry Two remains hot as Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors' record stands at 61-6, meaning they are still on the path to beating the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls' record of 72 wins in a single season.But total weekly athletic footwear sales decelerated to 7.9% growth, he said, adding that the strongest performances were in sandals, golf and casual athletic footwear.Adidas revenue grew 17.6% and its brand sales alone rose 30.5%, while Reebok sales tumbled 48%. After slipping to the No. 3 spot in the U.S. behind Under Armour two years ago, Adidas has been working to regain favor Stateside, an effort that appears to be working. Earlier in the month, the company reported 8% sales growth in North America in its fourth quarter, up from a 4% North American sales decline in the prior-year Q4.""Adidas transcended the slowdown in overall Athletic Footwear and accelerated on strength in its namesake brand,"" wrote Weiner of the week's sales.

Volume was mixed: slightly lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary figures.Oil stocks scored big gains as West Texas Intermediate crude rose 4% to $33.67 a barrel.

290,UA,"Warmer weather, online shopping and heavy discounting have made retail a tough space to be in right now, but at least five stocks on the IBD 50 list are bucking the trends.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has held off Amazon (AMZN) better than its retail peers, partly because of the experiential nature of buying beauty products and partly because of the dedicated customer loyalty that companies like Ulta and Sephora have built, according to analysts.Notably, specialty beauty retailers have the benefit of not being in a seasonal industry, say experts, which means that they are not subject to the promotional pressures that department stores and clothing retailers face.Ulta, a member of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, has risen 35% over the last year. The group has collectively lost 6%.Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have also fared well amid a struggling retail backdrop as ""athleisure"" continues to make its way out of the gym and into offices and even major fashion houses.Health and wellness trends -- think juice bars, cleanses and the much-anticipated SoulCycle (SCYL) IPO -- have worked in both companies' favor, and Under Armour's push into wearable technology has inserted itself into the tech conversation alongside Fitbit (FIT) and the Apple (AAPL) Watch.Nike's stock has climbed 31% and Under Armour has grown 17% since Jan. 29, 2015. Shares of the Apparel-Shoes and Relating Manufacturing group and Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing have risen 5% and declined 15%, respectively.Both companies are not the only two activewear companies on the list. Foot Locker (FL), which carries both Nike and Under Armour in its stores, also made the cut.Starbucks (SBUX), for its part, isn't afraid of a slowdown in China. The java giant is expanding assertively into the country, with a goal of operating 3,400 stores there by 2019.Starbucks missed Q1 revenue and guided Q2 below consensus estimates when it reported on Jan. 21, but CEO Howard Schultz expressed enthusiasm about bringing Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature to Chinese consumers. He anticipates that it will be a ""runaway success.""Domestically, its mobile efforts have yielded success, with over a fifth of all U.S. transactions now made via smartphone.Starbucks shares have grown 36% while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group has tumbled 15%.Ross Stores (ROST) doesn't even have an e-commerce presence, but the chain of off-price stores has been labeled ""un-Amazonable"" by Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the appeal of the ""treasure hunt"" experience that compels shoppers to visit brick-and-mortar stores.Amid a shift to off-price retailers, analysts agree that there's room for square-footage growth as Ross expands into other regions stateside.Ross Stores' stock has risen 20% over the last year, compared to the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which has declined 14%.A number of other consumer stocks abound on the IBD 50 list, including energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST), discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG), and baby-clothing merchant Carter's (CRI).RELATED:Why Under Armour’s Market Share May Be Bigger Than You ThinkThink We’re In A Recession?

291,UA,"Nike (NKE) has suspended its endorsement deal with tennis star Maria Sharapova following the Monday shocker that she failed a doping test. But who will step into her multimillion dollar shoes, now that she has been suspended by the International Tennis Federation?Sharapova held a press conference in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, not to announce her retirement from the sport -- as many had anticipated -- but to say that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug that was recently added to the banned substances list. The 28-year-old, five-time grand slam winner said she had been taking meldonium since 2006 for several health issues that included a magnesium deficiency and irregular EKG results.""It’s very important for you to understand that for 10 years, this medicine was not on WADA’s ban list, and I had been legally taking the medicine for the past 10 years,"" she said at a press conference Monday. ""But on Jan. 1, the rules had changed, and meldonium became a prohibited substance, which I had not known.""She acknowledged that she would face consequences, and those consequences came swiftly. In addition to Nike, Tag Heuer and Porsche have also distanced themselves from Sharapova in the wake of her admission.Nike's eight-year contract with the 2014 French Open winner, signed in 2010, is reportedly worth $70 million. According to Forbes, Sharapova was the 26th highest-paid athlete in 2015, with $23 million in endorsement deals making up the bulk of her $29.7 million earnings.Shares of Nike closed up 1% to 59.81 Tuesday, closing just below the 50-day moving average and above the 200-day -- after crossing both lines intraday. Nike hit a record high of 68.19 on Dec. 23.Under Armour (UA), whose tennis stars include Andy Murray, fell 2.3%.Sharapova is not the only tennis pro on Nike's roster, or the winningest. Serena Williams, the No. 1 ranked women's player in the world, also has a deal with the Swoosh. And she has racked up far more wins that Sharapova, who is ranked No. 7. Williams has 69 career singles titles to Sharapova's 35, according to the WTA, and has won more than twice the prize money in her lifetime.The value of Williams' current contract with Nike is sketchy. Forbes put her 2015 endorsement earnings at $13 million for a total haul of $24.6 million.Victoria Azarenka and Eugenie Bouchard are among those in the tennis world also sponsored by Nike. On the men's side, Nike still has a number of champions in the way of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Sharapova, whose suspension takes effect on March 12, hopes to make a comeback soon.""I don’t want to end my career this way, and I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,"" she told reporters on Monday. ""And I know many of you thought that I would be retiring today and announcing my retirement, but if I was ever going to announce my retirement, it would probably not be in a downtown Los Angeles hotel with this fairly ugly carpet.""

294,UA,"Under Armour (UA) was the frontrunner in the race to lure shoppers last week, with athletic footwear sales that far outpaced those of rivals Nike (NKE) and Skechers USA (SKX).In the week ended Feb. 27, Under Armour's athletic shoe sales surged 70.7% from a year earlier, according to a report by Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, citing data from market researcher SportScanInfo.Under Armour's shares closed up 1.1% on the stock market today.Sector leader Nike's athletic footwear sales rose 23.5% from a year earlier. Basketball shoe sales overall rebounded last week to 24.3% year over year, with Nike's Air Jordan Retro 12 Masters as the week's top seller, Weiner noted.Nike's shares ended down 0.3%.Skechers, which is expanding into athletic footwear, came in second behind Under Armour last week, with athletic footwear sales up 40.6% from a year earlier.Skechers' shares dipped 0.2%.Adidas, including the Reebok brand, saw athletic footwear sales slip 1.8% from a year earlier last week, despite the increase in the Adidas brand's shoe sales of 8%, noted Weiner.Total athletic footwear sales improved sequentially to an increase of 18.6% year-over-year last week, driven by both higher units and average selling prices and growth in every category, said Weiner.The running shoe category's sales growth sequentially decelerated to 10.8% from the prior week's 14% gain, Weiner said. Best sellers in the running shoe category included Nike's Roshe Run, Nike's Flex Experience 4 and Nike's Air Max 2016.Casual athletic shoe sales remained ""robust"" with a 27.5% year-over-year gain last week, Weiner noted.

296,UA,"Teens have worshipped at the altar of Nike (NKE) since the mid-1980s, helping it become a $31 billion powerhouse. But Under Armour (UA) is rolling out wearables and powering its app with AI to hardwire the next generation of believers to its brand.Some type of smart technology will eventually be in all Under Armour products, Chief Digital Officer Robin Thurston told Investor's Business Daily. That might mean biometrics, a tool that tells users how long a product should last or something that kicks off a smartphone app.But either way, Under Armour believes sensors and data collection will be among the needs of tomorrow's athletes.“For the first 20 years (of the company’s history), it was about changing the way athletes dress, and we fundamentally believe that the next 20 years are going to be about changing the way athletes live,” said Thurston. “And technology is going to play a massive part in that.”The Baltimore-based sportswear maker, which reports earnings on Thursday, launched a range of smart gadgets at CES earlier this month, including wireless headphones, connected running shoes and the UA HealthBox -- a kit with a heart-rate monitor, fitness tracker and scale.Those devices connect to the upgraded UA Record app, which can provide personalized insights like the best time of day to work out, with help from IBM’s (IBM) Watson supercomputer.Such tech efforts may seem odd for a company that sells compression shirts and athletic footwear, particularly when the field is already populated by Apple (AAPL) Watch, Fitbit (FIT), Jawbone, Garmin (GRMN) and other fitness trackers.But today's workout junkie is very different from the spandex-clad aerobics enthusiast of yesteryear. Younger people tend to take more classes instead of working out alone and enjoy sharing their experiences on social media, said Matt Powell, NPD Group’s sports industry analyst.""The millennial consumer is very social when it comes to their fitness activities, as opposed to the older consumer ... who would lift some weights and leave without talking to anyone,"" Powell told IBD.Under Armour hasn’t been shy about its quest to essentially become the Facebook (FB) of fitness. The UA Record app allows users to share their workout goals and accomplishments with others online, as well as follow the feeds of Under Armour endorsers like ballerina Misty Copeland or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.Amid the fast-growing industry of fitness tech, developing an emotional bond with future customers while they’re young is crucial.“All of this is positioning (Under Armour) for something that is five to 10 years away,” said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser. “When those kids grow up and then the technology moves along, then it all comes together even more.”But for now, Nike is still far and away the top brand among the adolescent set, according to Piper Jaffray’s latest Taking Stock With Teens survey. Over a quarter of respondents called Nike their No. 1 clothing brand, and half said it is their favorite footwear brand.Under Armour is also on the radar of both teens and kids. Children's shoe sales spiked 103% in 2015 vs. 62% growth in men’s and 69% growth in women’s footwear, said Poser, citing SportScanInfo data.Yet not everyone is convinced that Under Armour’s move into gadgetry is quite so necessary.""I commend (Under Armour) for taking this approach, but we are getting in a space where Apple and Google play in,"" said Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu. ""And these companies have the best technology guys.""Under Armour isn’t exactly going solo; it has a partnership with HTC to make its wearables. But perhaps as an indicator of how difficult going it alone can be, Nike shuttered its wearables development in 2014 and -- outside of an ongoing partnership with Apple -- doesn’t appear to be planning a connected-product launch anytime soon.Still, Nike’s hardware pullback shouldn’t necessarily be seen as a retreat from fitness tracking. That it isn’t pushing wearables could be a sign of a deepened relationship with Apple, Vasilescu said.Ultimately, to capture the younger workout crowd, Under Armour might have to do more than stuff their gear with chips -- it will have to cultivate the same kind of must-have feeling that Apple products inspire.Poser thinks the brand’s apparel already has that sort of appeal. But for its new tech gear, he said Under Armour must find a way to convince people that ""this is good, you gotta have it, the same way people have to have the new iPhone.""To be sure, Under Armour's push into heart-rate monitors and smarter apps is all in service of an oft-repeated goal: Don’t forget to sell shirts and shoes. And many shoppers are younger people, particularly younger people who want a holistic, data-centered view of their day-to-day activities.""Sixty-five percent of the (Connected Fitness) audience is under 40,"" said Under Armour’s Thurston. ""They’re tech savvy. They’ve kind of raised their hand and said, 'I want to quantify at some level,' whether that’s food tracking or activity tracking or logging workouts. ... We think there’s hundreds of millions of people out there that still need these products.""RELATED:

302,UA,"Under Armour (UA) scored a slam dunk with athletic footwear sales doubling in the second week in January,  far outpacing rivals Nike (NKE) and Skechers USA (SKX), as the trendy sportswear brand continues to gain share in basketball shoes, according to a report.In the week ended Jan. 16, Under Armour's athletic shoe sales soared 102.6% from a year earlier, according to a report by Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, citing data from market researcher SportScanInfo.The favorable report, though, didn't keep Under Armour's shares from falling 1.9% Monday afternoon on the stock market today, ahead of its fourth-quarter  results on Thursday.Sector leader Nike saw athletic shoe sales rise 7.7% from a year earlier for the week.  Nike's shares rose 0.6% intraday Monday.Skechers USA, which is expanding into athletic footwear,  saw an 8.6% rise in athletic shoe sales from a year earlier for the week.  Skechers' shares were down 0.8% in afternoon trading.Adidas, including its  Reebok brand, declined 7.7% from a year earlier for the week,  but ""progress"" at the namesake brand continues, Weiner noted.  Adidas brand athletic shoe sales rose 5.7% from a year earlier for the week, while Reebok brand athletic shoe sales fell 58.6% from a year earlier.Total athletic footwear sales growth slowed to 1.8% from a year earlier, Weiner noted. The ""weak performance"" was due to declines in the running, sport specialty, training/fitness, and walking/toning/shaping  athletic shoe categories, he added.While the basketball shoe category ""slowed considerably,""  the basketball shoe sales still finished up 4.7% year-over-year for the week, he noted.""While Nike continues to dominate the bestseller list in the (basketball shoe) category, Under Armour has quickly gained share,"" Weiner noted.On a trailing 13 week basis, Under Armour now holds a nearly 7% share in basketball compared with about 2% in the prior year period, he added.Under Armour's top basketball endorsement deal is with Steph Curry, point guard for the Golden State Warriors, the reigning NBA champs. Curry was one of the leading vote-getters in All-Star Voting, above long-time great LeBron James. Nike recently extended James to a lifetime contract. But Curry is in his prime and the Warriors are on pace for a record-setting season, recently crushing James' Cleveland Cavaliers on the Cavs' home court.Running shoe sales  slipped 4.3% from a year earlier from the week.""As has been the trend for some time now, fashion running sales were robust, but performance running sales weighed on overall performance,"" Weiner noted.Casual athletic shoe sales ended the week with a hefty 21.5% year-over-year gain.

"
304,UA,"Under Armour (UA) and Stephen Curry are chasing legends. The Golden State Warriors need two dozen more wins to surpass the 72-10 record set by Michael Jordan and the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls.For Curry, those wins would mean making NBA history. For Under Armour, Curry's rising star means another step toward a billion-dollar basketball business as it looks to dethrone Nike's (NKE) $31 billion empire.“It’s hard to find a more likable athlete that’s performing at a higher level than (Curry) is right now,” said Cowen & Co. analyst John Kernan. At the moment, “Under Armour has the best endorsements in the whole sector.”The Baltimore-based activewear maker has a number of high achievers on its roster, including Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton and golf star Jordan Spieth. But the 27-year-old point guard is the brand's headliner, and perhaps most representative of the fight-to-the-finish spirit that Under Armour aims to embody.Both began as underdogs hustling in the shadows of giants. Under Armour didn’t even sell shoes 10 years ago; Curry’s slender frame meant that he was neglected by college recruiters.That, of course, is a little different now. Under Armour, while still about an eighth of Nike’s size by annual revenue, has already displaced Adidas as the No. 2 sportswear brand in America. And Curry is the league MVP on a reigning NBA championship team, with his sights set on beating what some thought was an unbeatable winning record.""I never thought that record would be broken, because I got a chance to play against that team,"" said former pro player and current NBA TV analyst Steve Smith, who faced off against the '95-'96 Bulls during his time with the Atlanta Hawks. ""(Not to mention) just looking at how hard that is to win 72 games out of 82.""But if the Warriors stay healthy, i.e. injury free, beating that record is ""definitely possible,"" he said.Now the conversation has turned to Curry’s place in basketball history, and whether he can be the next Michael Jordan in a landscape littered with supposed “nexts,” from Kobe to LeBron.Under Armour, which first scooped up Curry from Nike in 2013 for less than $4 million and then extended his endorsement deal through 2024 for undisclosed terms, is betting on it. But Jordan’s shoes are daunting ones to fill, even 13 years after his retirement from the game.""I know kids still go crazy over Michael Jordan shoes,"" said Smith.And Nike and its Jordan brand shoes have deep, decades-long roots in sneaker culture, making it tough for any newcomer to topple.Athlete shoe endorsements pre-date World War II. Basketball player-turned-sneaker salesman Chuck Taylor lent his name in 1934 to Converse's now iconic Chuck Taylor All Star. Years later, 1970s basketball stars Walt ""Clyde"" Frazier and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would strike deals with Puma and Adidas, respectively.But by the 1980s, a “radical shift” in men’s fashion was happening, according to Elizabeth Semmelhack, senior curator at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto. And the 1985 debut of Nike’s Air Jordan 1 coincided with the popularization of hip hop, the rise of Casual Friday and Silicon Valley’s rejection of traditional board-room attire.“Prior to that men were just supposed to wear the suit, which is kind of an anonymous garment,” Semmelhack told Investor’s Business Daily. “All of a sudden, as men become more interested and invested in proclamations of identity through clothing (in the '80s) . . . they actually start to do that from the feet up.”Fast-forward 30-plus years, and Air Jordans have long cemented their place in the cultural lexicon, earning casual mentions in movies and songs, such as Beyonce’s new “Formation”: Drop him off at the mall/let him buy some J’s/let him shop up/’cause I slay.“Nike has been extremely dominant and the Jordan brand features into popular culture in a way that most other sneaker companies do not,"" said Semmelhack.And Michael Jordan's namesake brand is only poised to grow. Embedded in Nike's plans to boost annual revenue to $50 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 is a goal for Jordan brand product revenue to nearly double to $4.5 billion.Under Armour has a lot of work to do before pop superstars name-drop Curry in song. His signature shoe gave the activewear maker's Q4 results a major boost. But its footwear business remains a “speck on the map,” according to Cowen's Kernan, who said its basketball market share is “a decimal point of Nike.”Under Armour logged $678 million in footwear net revenue in all of 2015, a 57% year-over-year jump. But Nike in its most recent quarter alone brought in $4.59 billion in Nike brand footwear revenue. (That figure doesn't include an additional $398 million from Converse.)Steph Curry's sneaker line is expected to drive much more revenue Under Armour's way. Under Armour management projected at the company’s investor day in September that footwear would become a $1.7 billion business by 2018, and highlighted the halo effect that Curry lends its basketball shoes and apparel.“Curry gives them a very legitimate presence in the (basketball space),” said Kernan.This season aside, breaking a 20-year-old record is the least of Curry’s worries if he wants to start stacking up stats to rival the Greatest Of All Time and his six championship rings.""If (Curry) can mount some of those championships up, then you start to get into the conversation,"" said Smith. ""(It’s) a little early now. But you know, he still has a good run, when you start looking at his age. (He has) at least a good 10 years left.""And maybe another decade is what Under Armour needs to build the kind of revenue-generating machine that comes with pop culture immortality.""I think that when Under Armour gets discussed in rap songs and in movies and on the red carpet, and in many places, outside of the basketball court,” said Semmelhack, “that will be evidence of its wider influence.""

307,UA,"LAS VEGAS — Fitbit (FIT) stock has lost over 20% of its value in the last three sessions as investors shunned the introduction of the wearable maker's newest product, Blaze.IBD had a chance at CES to speak one-on-one with Fitbit CEO James Park about the company's outlook.Park says there's a disconnect between investors and retailers, who are ""excited"" about Blaze.But with the new smart fitness watch looking very similar to the Apple (AAPL) Watch, investors may be worried that Blaze might not hold up against the tech giant's product, although it's half the price.Fitbit is also now facing competition from Under Armour (UA), which just came out with a suite of tech products including a fitness band.Park says that since Fitbit has such a large fitness social network, consumers are more likely to buy its products.But Under Armour has acquired several fitness apps with big followings, including MyFitnessPal and Endomondo.When asked if Fitbit was looking to be acquisitive itself, Park said M&A will be a ""big part"" of the company's strategy in 2016.Watch the above video to learn more.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter @IBD_AWilliams and Facebook.

321,UA,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) on Wednesday expanded its product portfolio with a fashionable new fitness wristband called the Fitbit Alta.Fitbit began taking pre-orders for the device, which sells for $129.95, on Wednesday, with retail availability starting in March in North America.Alta activity trackers feature stylish, interchangeable bands in a range of colors and materials. Extra bands in Fitbit's ""classic"" style cost $29.95 each. It's also selling luxe leather bands for $59.95 apiece and stainless steel bands for $99.95. Plus, Fitbit is working with designer Tory Burch on fashion accessories for the Alta.In addition to tracking regular activity, exercise and sleep, the Fitbit Alta includes reminders to move when you’ve been sitting too long and smartphone notifications of calls, texts and appointments. Fitbit Alta has a five-day battery life.The Alta provides personal pep talks and motivation, with on-screen messages to meet mini-goals like 250 steps per hour. It tracks steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned and active minutes. It automatically recognizes when someone is exercising.Users can track their progress with a smartphone app and online tools.The Fitbit Alta ultimately will replace the Fitbit Charge, but not the Charge HR, which measures heart rate.“Alta is going to be the premier product for the biggest segment of the market, which is everyday fitness,” Woody Scal, Fitbit’s chief business officer, told IBD. “We think this will broaden our addressable market significantly by bringing in people who care a little bit more about style.”From a business perspective, Alta provides Fitbit the opportunity to sell more high-margin accessories. That’s also a focus with the upcoming Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch.Plus, the Alta provides an upgrade path for owners of Fitbit Flex devices, Scal said.“Fitbit is more than just cool stuff on your wrist or clipped to your waist,” he said.Fitbit has differentiated itself by focusing on software and building a platform for providing personalized fitness insights and coaching as well as social and motivational tools, Scal said.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy on Wednesday reiterated her overweight rating on Fitbit stock with a price target of 60. Fitbit stock was down 1% to about 16 in midday trading on the stock market today.The Alta “combines a higher level of fashion and functionality at the sweet spot of pricing,” Murphy said in a report. Fitbit launched its latest device in tandem with New York Fashion Week.“The infusion of fashion in their product should aid the company to convert retail consumers and help drive a product upgrade cycle,” Murphy said.Fitbit competes with a host of companies, including Fossil (FOSL), Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).RELATED:Fitbit Given Physical, Passes With Outperform Rating.

324,UA,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsShares of wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) dropped to their lowest level ever on Monday, following a rough week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.Fitbit stock was down nearly 12%, near 18, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The San Francisco-based company went public last June at 20. Monday marked the first time that Fitbit had fallen below its IPO price.Fitbit stock crumbled last week at the annual CES trade show. First, it disappointed investors with the introduction of the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch, which drew comparisons to Apple'S (AAPL) Apple Watch smartwatch. Then it faced a slew of new products from competitors both new, such as Under Armour (UA) and New Balance, and old, like Garmin (GRMN).Baird analyst William Power on Monday slashed his price target on Fitbit stock to 30 from 54.""Fitbit unveiled its new product, the Fitbit Blaze, which, while sporting solid functionality, was panned by many for its design and potentially greater competition with Apple Watch,"" Power said. ""The company is betting that the device should drive incremental sales in addition to providing a natural upgrade patch for current Charge HR users. The device should benefit Q1 sell-in, though sell-through will be key.""Power says he expects Fitbit to post strong Q4 earnings results, but he says the company will face difficult year-over-year comparisons in early 2016. Fitbit also faces investor concerns over increased competition and the positioning of the Fitbit Blaze, he says.""On the other hand, Fitbit should continue to benefit from ongoing fitness trends along with longer-term digital heath secular trends,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy remained positive on Fitbit in a [PAGE[research]] note Friday. She rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 60.The Fitbit Blaze is likely to support three favorable trends for Fitbit: increased retail store space, higher portfolio average selling prices and improved gross margins, she says. The new smart fitness watch also could expand the total addressable market for Fitibit's products, she says.RELATED: Fitbit CEO says retailers, consumers excited for Blaze watch

326,UA,"Fitbit (FIT) stock fell off the treadmill Tuesday, a day after the maker of wearable fitness devices reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but guided Wall Street much lower than expected for the current quarter.Fitbit shares were down 19%, near 13.40, in midday trading on the stock market today, and at least five investment banks downgraded their rating on the company. Fitbit stock hit its all-time low of 12.90 on Feb. 11, after the company went public in June at 20 a share and peaked in August near 52.Several analysts downgraded the stock or cut their price targets after the San Francisco-based company late Monday posted Q4 earnings and gave Q1 and full-year 2016 guidance.In Q4, Fitbit earned 35 cents a share, excluding items, on sales of $712 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose 67%, and sales jumped 92% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 25 cents ex items on sales of $648 million.But for the current quarter, Fitbit is targeting non-GAAP earnings per share of 1 cent on sales of $430 million, at the midpoint of its guidance range. Analysts were modeling 23 cents and $485 million.Fitbit Chief Financial Officer Bill Zerella said Q1 is a product transition quarter, with the launch of the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband in March, as well as the discontinuation of the Fitbit Charge. Fitbit expects to incur higher sales and marketing expenses because of the global product launches, plus additional manufacturing expenses to maximize production of the new products.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy downgraded Fitbit stock to neutral from overweight and slashed her price target to 14 from 24. The outlook for Fitbit’s new products is cloudy, and the company faces tough year-over-year comparisons in the second half of the year, she said in a research report.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson downgraded Fitbit stock to sector weight from overweight. He cited the risk of hardware commoditization and poor user metrics as reasons for the change.“We see little likelihood of dispelling anytime soon the longer-term bear thesis of slowing growth, pricing pressure and longer-term commoditization,” he said in a report.Fitbit is looking like the next GoPro (GPRO), a hardware company facing market saturation, slowing growth and margin and earnings erosion, he said.Erickson is also concerned about active-user trends. Fitbit added 18 million new registered device users in 2015, of which 13 million, or 72%, were active users at year-end.Erickson says Fitbit stock has a fair value of 14.Cowen analyst John Kernan reiterated his market perform rating on Fitbit stock but axed his price target to 19 from 41.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi maintained his outperform rating but cleaved his price target to 25 from 50.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Rob Cihra kept his neutral rating on Fitbit and price target of 18.To turn things around, Fitbit needs to show leverage in the corporate wellness market, improve customer retention, and come out with new products with breakthrough sensors.Despite shipping over 30 million devices in the past two years, Fitbit ended 2015 with 16.9 million active users.“This kind of ‘churn’ is likely just natural and systemic to the health/fitness market, as some Fitbits ending up in drawers seems comparable to well-intentioned health club memberships that don’t get used,” Cihra said in a report.Fitbit faces competition from makers of dedicated fitness products such as Garmin (GRMN) and Under Armour (UA), but also from makers of smartwatches with fitness features such as Apple's (AAPL) Apple Watch.

348,UA,"Nike (NKE) released a wave of new product launches Wednesday, including ""Back to the Future""-inspired self-lacing shoes, anti-clogging cleats and a new edition of its Nike+ app. But what really stands out? Here are three key takeaways from yesterday's announcements:Marty McFly would've really dug Nike's Hyperadapt 1.0, ""adaptive lacing""-enabled footwear that can tighten or loosen the fit at the push of a button. While Under Armour (UA) recently rolled out its own smart shoe, the UA SpeedForm Gemini 2 Record-Equipped, that can track running data and send stats to an app, Nike prefers to keep its R&D focused on product instead of metrics. The self-lacing shoe will debut later this year.""The technology was long-rumored to be in the pipeline but was previously expected to be a one-off style; however, the company is launching three styles featuring the technology for holiday 2016 for a bigger launch,"" wrote BB&T analyst Corinna Freedman late Wednesday.Other new products include the cushioned Nike Air VaporMax, compression tights, and several variations of its Flyknit footwear, which features a knit upper.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank remains intensely focused on data collection through his company's suite of apps and newly launched UA HealthBox wearables, which include a fitness tracker, smart scale and heart-rate monitor. But when asked about the phased-out Nike FuelBand on ""Bloomberg Markets"" Thursday, Nike CEO Mark Parker dismissed the focus on hardware and data in favor of a personalized experience, presumably through product.""The access to data and a dashboard is not enough, in our opinion,"" Parker told Bloomberg. ""It's part of the process, so people will be collecting data with other devices. That's just not what we're doing. We're not creating the devices. But the devices can be actually input (into the app), and they are. That's an important part of the experience, and an important part of making it more personal.""That sentiment is also reflected in its revamped Nike+ app, which offers not just a link to its fitness-tracking running and training club apps, but a gateway to a customized news feed, concierge-style link to Nike+ experts, in-store reservation system and, of course, online shop.""We are impressed and encouraged by the level of technological advancement Nike delivered in this latest round of innovation, as it reinforces our belief in the company's ability to lead and dominate the industry,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Edward Plank on Thursday, pointing to the company's billion-dollar Flyknit business.""As Nike did with Flyknit four years ago, we believe these newest technologies will likely spark a wave of scalable revenue and category opportunities over the next several years.""Plank said he expects the new products to deliver ""solid margin benefits."" He reiterated a buy rating and 76 price target on Nike.Nike shares rose 2.1% to 63.18 Thursday, on track to gain for the sixth straight session.The company reports Q3 results after the close on Tuesday.Under Armour shares rallied 2.6%. Late Wednesday, the Baltimore-based company announced that it had OK'd Class C non-voting shares that would be issued ""through a stock dividend on a one-for-one basis to all existing holders of Under Armour's Class A and Class B common stock, which will have the same effect as a two-for-one stock split.""RELATED:Nike Unveils Latest Digital Push In Fight Vs.

349,UA,"Fitbit (FIT) hit a new all-time closing low Tuesday on the heels of its weak outlook for the current quarter late Monday.Fitbit beat holiday-quarter estimates, as fitness bands and the Apple (AAPL) Watch proved to be popular gifts.

That’s its lowest close ever, and just 18 cents above its all-time intraday low of 12.90 on Feb. 11.

351,UA,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsLAS VEGAS — IBM's ([STOCK[IBM]]) cognitive computing system, Watson, has graduated from winning ""Jeopardy"" to predicting hypoglycemic events for diabetes patients and providing the brains for a customer service robot.IBM CEO Ginni Rometty discussed three partnerships involving IBM's Watson during her keynote speech at CES 2016 on Wednesday in Las Vegas. The massive annual Consumer Electronics Show ends Saturday.Rometty talked about how Medtronic ([STOCK[MDT]]), Under Armour ([STOCK[UA]]) and SoftBank Robotics are using Watson's big data analytics capabilities in vastly different ways.Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak said his company is using Watson [PAGE[technology]] for diabetes [PAGE[management]]. In a new app rolling out this summer, medical technology firm Medtronic will track a diabetes patient's blood-sugar levels and predict life-threatening hypoglycemic events up to three hours in advance of symptoms.Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said his company hooked up to IBM's Watson because he wanted his customers to get more meaningful data-backed health and fitness insights.The company's UA Record app will provide athletes with timely, evidence-based coaching around their sleep, fitness, activity and nutrition, including outcomes achieved based on others ""like you.""The app can act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer and assistant, he said.Plank said he was driven to create the app because he was frustrated by the fact that people have more data about the health of their cars or investments than their own bodies.Watson also is providing artificial intelligence for a social humanoid robot called Pepper from SoftBank Robotics. Pepper currently is being used as a customer service robot in a limited number of Mizuho Financial Group's ([STOCK[MFG]]) bank branches and Nestle ([STOCK[NSRGY]]) coffee shops in Japan.Watson's cognitive computing capabilities are ready to be put to use in a host of industries, Rometty said.Also at CES, IBM announced ventures involving Watson with medical diagnostic firm Pathway Genomics and home appliance maker Whirlpool ([STOCK[WHR]]).Pathway Genomics unveiled a test version of the Pathway Genomics OME app, powered by Watson. The app merges cognitive computing and deep learning with precision medicine and genetics to enable Pathway Genomics to provide consumers with personalized wellness information.Meanwhile, connected appliances from Whirlpool, such as kitchen and laundry machines, will use Watson services, including cognitive analytics, to provide more personalized services to consumers.

361,UA,"LAS VEGAS — Fitbit (FIT) stock has lost over 20% of its value in the last three sessions as investors shunned the introduction of the wearable maker's newest product, Blaze.IBD had a chance at CES to speak one-on-one with Fitbit CEO James Park about the company's outlook.Park says there's a disconnect between investors and retailers, who are ""excited"" about Blaze.But with the new smart fitness watch looking very similar to the Apple (AAPL) Watch, investors may be worried that Blaze might not hold up against the tech giant's product, although it's half the price.Fitbit is also now facing competition from Under Armour (UA), which just came out with a suite of tech products including a fitness band.Park says that since Fitbit has such a large fitness social network, consumers are more likely to buy its products.But Under Armour has acquired several fitness apps with big followings, including MyFitnessPal and Endomondo.When asked if Fitbit was looking to be acquisitive itself, Park said M&A will be a ""big part"" of the company's strategy in 2016.Watch the above video to learn more.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter @IBD_AWilliams and Facebook.

Foot Locker rose 0.5%, Finish Line 1.2%, and Dick's 0.9%.Mall merchants have been struggling with inventory pileups, and the guidance from one of retail's brightest stars is worrisome to some.""I think the investment community is a bit skittish about the overall U.S. consumer discretionary space as there is too much inventory,"" Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu told IBD in an email.But Jefferies analyst Edward Plank said that the inventory clearance is specific to Nike as the company makes room for new merchandise.""They called it out last quarter as well and (it has) to do with excess inventory from the port delays,"" he said via email. ""Not a concern as they will make up for it in 4Q. So no implications for the broader retail space insofar as what Nike called out.""Plank added that he doesn't see any fundamental reason why Nike shares reversed Wednesday, and that investors may be engaging in some profit-taking on the stock's strength.Overall, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Nike, which continues to expect full-year gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points, citing strong performance from the first half of fiscal 2016.Cowen's Kernan reaffirmed his outperform rating and 150 price target in the same report, noting that Nike's strength abroad will offset near-term inventory issues. And Vasilescu on Tuesday called the activewear maker's Q2 futures orders growth ""absolutely astounding.""The Jordan Brand parent topped Q2 earnings expectations late Tuesday, though revenue came in a little light. Hefty futures orders growth of 20% surpassed forecasts for mid-teens growth.""2015 was the single greatest calendar year ever for the Nike brand,"" said Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards during Tuesday's conference call.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Nike Futures Orders Growth 'Absolutely Astounding'Retail Sales Rose In Nov.

394,UA,"A survey of athletes, mostly runners, finds that Garmin (GRMN) is running away from the pack in terms of sports watch ownership and fitness app usage. But in the fitness band category, Fitbit (FIT) is the leader.Piper Jaffray surveyed 221 athletes across 16 states in November for the firm's second annual athletic and connected fitness survey. Of those surveyed, 95% said running is their No. 1 sport.Some 91% of respondents said they wear a watch when running, and Garmin is the top brand with 70% market share. Also, 19% wear a fitness band (up from 14% last year), with Fitbit the leader at 73% market share, Piper Jaffray said Wednesday.The survey revealed that 55% of respondents use a fitness app to monitor their exercise, vs. 49% last year. The top three fitness apps are Garmin Connect, Strava and Under Armour (UA)-owned MapMyFitness. Fitbit's app came in fifth after MyFitnessPal, another app owned by Under Armour.Fitbit increased its market share among athletes who own fitness bands to 73% from 64% last year. Garmin jumped to second place with a 24% share of fitness band ownership among athletes, vs. 9% and third place last year. Nike (NKE) came in second last year with a 14% share, but it didn't make the top three this year because it exited the hardware business in 2014.The general trends of increased ownership of fitness bands and fitness app usage bode well for Fitbit, Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said in a report Wednesday. She reiterated her overweight rating and price target of 60 on Fitbit stock. Fitbit fell 3.4% to 31.25 in the stock market today, a down day for major stock indexes.One area that saw a decrease in the latest survey is intent to buy fitness bands. The survey found that 6% of respondents plan to buy a fitness band over the next six months, compared with 16% in the year-earlier survey. Meanwhile, 5% of respondents said they plan to buy Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch, the Apple Watch, in the next six months.In the sports watch category, Garmin increased its market share to 70% this year from 65% in fall 2014. Timex remained in second with 14% share, down from 17% a year earlier.

426,UA,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsLAS VEGAS — As Fitbit ([STOCK[FIT]]) stock fell hard for a third straight day, the company's chief executive remained upbeat that the maker of wearable fitness devices is on the right track.In an interview with IBD on Thursday, Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park defended the company's ""smart fitness watch,"" the Fitbit Blaze, announced Tuesday at the CES trade show. Some analysts speculated that the device could fare poorly against the full-featured Apple ([STOCK[AAPL]]) Watch smartwatch.""There's clearly a disconnect between investors and what our customers and retail partners are excited about,"" Park said. ""We've had a lot of great meetings at CES with Wal-Mart ([STOCK[WMT]]), Target ([STOCK[TGT]]), Kohl's ([STOCK[KSS]]), etc. They expect Blaze to do really well. And the feedback we're getting from customers (is positive).""The Fitbit Blaze fills a gap in the company's product lineup, he said. It's targeted at fitness enthusiasts who want a device with a bigger screen that has more general-purpose capabilities.For Fitbit, the device will provide a higher average selling price and offers high-margin accessories.Fitbit Blaze will cost $199 when it goes on sales in March. That's a ""sweet spot"" for consumers, Park said. By comparison, the entry-level Apple Watch costs $349.People like to speculate about how competitive Fitbit is with Apple, but Park says that's not his concern.""Ultimately we are focused on our customers,"" Park said. ""General-purpose smartwatches really haven't taken off. There's confusion about what they're good for. Consumers are confused by the shear amount of stuff that these devices can do.""So, look, our focus is: Fitness first. Our mission is around digital health, having devices and services that address people's lifestyle health goals, and in the future, hopefully more chronic conditions.""Meanwhile, new competitors in the fitness tracker space emerged at CES including Under Armour ([STOCK[UA]]), Fossil ([STOCK[FOSL]]) and New Balance.Fitbit has successfully fended off such rivals as Nike ([STOCK[NKE]]) and Philips, Park said. It will continue to focus on its competitive advantages of its large user base and community features.Park says it's still early days for market penetration of wearable fitness devices.Fitbit also is facing a consumer class-action lawsuit about the accuracy of the heart-rate monitors on its fitness bands. Park said the lawsuit is without merit.""Consumers are really happy with the device,"" Park said. ""All you have to do is go to Amazon ([STOCK[AMZN]]) and see the reviews for Charge HR. Regardless of what the litigation says from the plaintiffs' attorneys, you have to look at the true consumer sentiment and I think people are pretty satisfied.""Fitbit stock fell 6.1% to 21.50 on the stock market today, hitting a record low for a third straight day. Fitbit stock fell 18.4% on Tuesday and 5.8% on Wednesday, as the stock market overall corrected. On Thursday, Fitbit came close to hitting its IPO price of 20 from last June, but it closed its first day of trading near 30.

(VFC) were more insulated.Under Armour gets 14.4% of its sales from Dick's, Piper Jaffray said, while Nike gets 2% of sales from the athletic retailer and VF Corp. likely draws less than 2%.Dick's said in its Q3 earnings release that inventory rose 13.1% during the quarter, and that it was ""working with its vendors to reduce its exposure to slow-selling merchandise by returning product, canceling orders and securing markdown allowances.""""While we note that this will throw yet another cautionary blanket on the athletic vendor group,"" Piper Jaffray said, ""we believe it is important to gauge exposure and risk appropriately. Not all brands are created equal.""Shares of Under Armour fell 5.6% to 85 on the stock market today, closing below its 200-day moving average for the first time since April 2013.Nike and VF Corp. didn't fare as badly, down 0.7% and 1.3%, respectively. VF Corp. has a variety of apparel brands, from Nautica to Vans to Wrangler jeans.Dick's gapped down 10.5% to 36.53 after tumbling as low as 33.42, the worst since January 2012. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) sank 4.8% to a 5-year low. Hibbett Sports reports earnings on Friday.Warm Weather Chills SalesDick's also said that its fourth quarter would be marked by a ""more promotional environment"" and that it will work to ""actively manage our inventory levels."" The rise in inventory, Sterne Agee CRT said in a note Tuesday, was likely in part due to ""slow selling cold weather product"".Dick's CEO Edward Stack said in the earnings release that ""record warm weather in more seasonal categories"" offset a stronger showing in athletic apparel, footwear and accessories. He also said that same-store sales growth in the quarter initially got a boost from the back-to-school season but that sales fizzled as the quarter progressed.Macy's (M) and other retailers also have warned of excess inventory due to warm weather.Dick's consolidated Q3 same-store sales grew 0.4%, well below expectations of 1.9%. Dick's earnings per share increased around 10% to 45 cents, missing views by a cent. Net sales rose 7.6% to $1.642 billion, just beating estimates.The company sees full-year EPS of $2.85-$3.00, well below Street forecasts for $3.20. Dick's said it expects Q4 EPS of $1.10-1.25, well short of views for $1.41.The results came a week after Piper Jaffray cut its price target on Under Armour to 97 from 105, citing the company's recent management shake-ups.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

444,UA,"Like championship boxers, mutual fund managers who outperform for extended periods know how to roll with the market's punches and how to attack an opening.The portfolio managers of the $17.7 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth A Fund have demonstrated both skills recently, coping with the market's summer volatility and adding to their portfolio strategically.""We upgraded the portfolio as some great growth companies' prices corrected,"" said co-manager Justin Kelly of subadvisor Winslow Capital Management.The fund has generated an average annual return of 8.45% the past 10 years, vs. 7.35% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 7.38% for the S&P 500.This year going into Tuesday, the fund gained 4.88%. vs. 3.39% for its peers and 1.45% for the S&P 500. The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A. The third-quarter stock market nose dive pulled down Regeneron (REGN) to what the MainStay managers saw as an attractive entry point.The fund invests in three types of growth stocks: those with long-term sustainable earnings growth, with quality cyclical earnings growth and in industries with rapid growth.The fund bought shares in Regeneron, which has the leading treatment for retinal eye disease and a compelling pipeline, including a new cholesterol drug, Kelly says.For investors who follow IBD's CAN SLIM method, the stock shows a 588.15 entry point.Regeneron has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, powerful on a scale of 1-99.More Health StocksIn Q3, the fund started a stake in Edwards Lifesciences (EW). Its products treat advanced cardiovascular disorders. Kelly cites Edwards' leadership in transcatheter heart valves. ""Their end market is bigger than most investors believe, which will propel earnings growth above what the Street expects,"" he said.The stock has an 89 Composite Rating and is trading a little above its 154.84 cup-with-handle entry.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is another health care name in which the fund began a position in Q3.Kelly likes the company's new lung cancer drug, Opdivo. The company's blood thinner Plavix is the world's second best selling drug.Also active in other sectors, the MainStay fund boosted its overweight in the consumer discretionary sector.The fund started a position in Under Armour (UA). Kelly says that the company continues to take market share in the growing athletic-leisurewear market.The stock advanced in Q3 but has trended lower since then, slipping beneath its 10- and 40-week moving averages.Dick's Sporting Goods' (DKS) weak Q3 hurt Under Armour, according to Piper Jaffray.Dick's also issued a weak outlook Tuesday. The stock market news helped send Under Armour down 5.6% that day.MainStay's managers — Kelly plus Clark Winslow and Patrick Burton — added to stakes in Amazon (AMZN) and Home Depot (HD) in Q3.Kelly likes Amazon Web Services, whose business is mushrooming, he says. Amazon, which has a 97 Comp Rating, is extended past its 549.88 buy point. After four quarters of earnings per share declines, Amazon's EPS rose 170% and 118% the past two stanzas.Home Depot, with an 88 Comp Rating, is about 7% above its 118.09 entry point. Benefiting from demand for home improvement, the company reported an 18% jump in EPS on Tuesday.

Revenue is seen climbing 30% to $876.5 million.BB&T initiated coverage on Skechers on Thursday with a buy rating and 150 price target. As gym shoes continue to be popular, analyst Corinna Freedman said she believes the company will continue to benefit as it adds more ""athletic-inspired"" and performance styles.""In our view, more consumers are accepting of SKX as an athletic brand with an appealing assortment of lower-priced technical footwear, which helps to drive ASPs (average selling prices) higher, as well as bolster wholesale distribution,"" she wrote.Skechers has carved out a niche with its ""walking shoes,"" leading the domestic casual athletic footwear category with 22% share in Q1 2015, according to research firm NPD Group.Converse, a Nike-owned brand, came in second with 15% share, while Nike (NKE) trailed in third place with 10% of the market.But Nike remains the overall sports footwear leader with 62% share, while Skechers sits a distant second at 5%. Under Armour (UA), with a footwear category that is booming but nascent, has yet to crack the top-five list.Even though Skechers isn't usually uttered in the same breath as Air Jordan, it is slowly but surely making a name for itself among athletes.The brand is ""gaining credibility in the performance market, given its sponsorship of key athletes (Meb Keflezighi) and events (Los Angeles Marathon),"" wrote Freedman.She sees Skechers' international business accounting for half of total revenue by 2020.Skechers shares rose 5.1% to 47.47 in the stock market Monday.

"
483,UA,"The $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.
"
484,UA,"The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.
"
485,UA,"That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.
"
486,UA,"Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.
"
487,UA,"Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.
"
488,UA,"And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.
"
489,UA,"IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?
"
490,UA,"Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.
"
491,UA,"It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.
"
492,UA,"And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.
"
493,UA,"From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.
"
494,UA,"IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?
"
495,UA,"Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.
"
496,UA,"We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.
"
497,UA,"IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?
"
498,UA,"Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.
"
499,UA,"The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.
"
500,UA,"IBD: You like innovators, right?
"
501,UA,"Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.
"
502,UA,"We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.

503,UA,"IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?
"
504,UA,"Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.
"
505,UA,"So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.
"
506,UA,"We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.
"
507,UA,"IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?
"
508,UA,"Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.
"
509,UA,"We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.
"
510,UA,"Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.
"
511,UA,"IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).
"
512,UA,"Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.
"
513,UA,"They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.
"
514,UA,"What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.
"
515,UA,"That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.
"
516,UA,"IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?
"
517,UA,"Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.
"
518,UA,"Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.
"
519,UA,"As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.
"
520,UA,"But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.
"
521,UA,"IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?
"
522,UA,"Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.
"
523,UA,"IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?
"
524,UA,"Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.
"
525,UA,"What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.
"
526,UA,"IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?
"
527,UA,"Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.
"
528,UA,"They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).
"
529,UA,"Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.
"
530,UA,"IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?
"
531,UA,"Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.
"
532,UA,"NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.
"
533,UA,"So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.
"
534,UA,"IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?
"
535,UA,"Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.
"
536,UA,"IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?
"
537,UA,"Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.
"
538,UA,"A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.
"
539,UA,"Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.
"
540,UA,"You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.
"
541,UA,"IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?
"
542,UA,"Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportThe $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.IBD: You like innovators, right?Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone.

Many of those employees will ship packages to Amazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year for free shipping and video streaming. Amazon has around 47 million U.S. Prime users who spend about $1,200 a year each on its site, MarketWatch recently reported, citing Consumer Intelligence Research Partners data.Consensus is for e-commerce leader Amazon to report a 13-cent per share loss, improved from a 95 cent loss in Q3 2014. If Amazon tops estimates, it would be the third time in the last four quarters. Revenue is expected to jump 21% to $24.91 billion. That would be the best sales gain in five quarters.Under ArmourSome analysts project that athletic clothing, shoes and accessories maker Under Armour got a boost from back-to-school sales, continuing its four-year-plus streak of double-digit quarterly sales gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q3 EPS minus one-time items to rise 7% to 44 cents, reversing the prior quarter's 12% decline. Q3 sales are expected to rise 25.3% to $1.175 billion, a bit lower than the 29% pop it saw in Q2 but still a strong gain. Cowen & Co. analyst John Kernan is more bullish, forecasting 45 cents EPS on 26% sales growth, led by a 35% surge in footwear, ""in line with management's guidance,"" Kernan said in a report.AlphabetAs of early October, Google became a unit of Alphabet, an umbrella company that includes the company's future-looking projects such as research into how to improve human longevity and contact lenses that measure glucose levels to relieve diabetics from painful pinpricks.Analysts will look for info on how Google mobile search is faring. Mobile revenue is expected to top desktop search revenue next year, Evercore ISI said in a recent report. Under its new structure, the Google business — search, YouTube, Android and most of the previous company — have become the biggest segment within Alphabet.Consensus is for Alphabet to report $18.5 billion Q3 revenue, up 12% vs. the same quarter a year ago. EPS is expected to rise 13% to $7.20.Skechers USAIBD 50 stock Nike (NKE) has long dominated the athletic shoe market, but Skechers — although much smaller — is gaining acceptance as a top athletic brand, analysts say. BB&T launched coverage on Skechers last Thursday with a buy rating and a 150 price target, citing Skechers' ""appealing assortment of lower-price technical footwear.""Skechers has also become the category leader in walking shoes, with a 22% market share. Analysts expect a 67% surge in Q3 EPS to 55 cents, continuing a two-year streak of double-digit quarterly increases. Revenue is projected to climb 30% to $876.5 million.McDonald'sShares of the world's biggest restaurant chain hit an all-time intraday high at 105.20 on Thursday, Oct. 15, with shares pulling back modestly since then.

(Notice all the adjectives suggest no big deal.....little bit, slight build up, extra merchandise).  None of them are telling us the truth......and Macy's laid it out yesterday......They are seeing an emerging consumer recession.....retailers will most likely take it on the chin this Christmas......The SPDR S&P Retail ETF, (XRT) lays it out clearly...this  ETF is down 5.6% in 5 days.... and is down some 12% since the summer highs...(individual names have experienced even more dramatic moves).    Names like Lululemon (LULU), Nike (NKE), Under Armour  (UA), VF Corp  (VFC), Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstroms (JWN), DSW  (DSW), The Gap  (GPS), etc......all under pressure as we move into the most significant time of the year for these companies....expectations for a strong holiday shopping season may be a 'little bit' overdone.....so for stock investors in those names - it's a bit tough, for those companies - it's a bit tough,   but for consumers - the sales will create a frenzy of opportunity for more stuff you most likely DON'T really need.....but can't justify leaving on the shelf...I mean - It's On Sale!And therein lies the opportunity for longer term investors.....retail stocks have been are ON SALE - But we have not seen the 'EVERYTHING MUST GO' signs just yet......but it is coming....and that will surely signal the bottom.........In the meantime - maybe, just maybe - the action in the retailers is challenging what those analysts  are telling us.....maybe the action is forewarning us of tougher times ahead?  Next up - and not new to the conversation at all.....OIL.......the mkt continues to be undermined by weak oil prices - U.S. crude stockpiles jumped by 6.3 million barrels last week.  Furthermore, Iraq - is sending some 19 million barrels supply directly to US ports this month.....This news caused oil prices to fall $1.28 to $42.93 - readying to test the October lows at $42.58. If the October lows in oil get violated - my sense is that the broader mkt  will not like that......Which brings us right back to the FED......How is this idea of a rate hike going to work out - when it feels like the consumer is exhausted, the macro data does not support real strength, the dollar continues to move higher creating more distress and the ECB this morning hints of MORE stimulus to a struggling European economy?   This morning European mkts are all lower -  Uncle Mario hints at more stimulus......warning that""the signs of a sustained turnaround in core inflation had weakened...... Downside risks stemming from global growth and trade are clearly visible in the Euro zone.""while reminding us that the ECB still has a ""range of instruments available in case more accommodation should be seen as necessary"" And the mkts turn south.....at the same time - Rolls Royce cuts its 2016 forecast causing that stock to give up 20% in just a few clicks......FTSE -0.52%, CAC 40 - 0.86%, DAX - 0.40%, EUROSTOXX -0.62%, SPAIN -0.88% and ITALY -0.76%. Here at home - we have  full day of FED speakers....It kicks off with Bullard (9:05 a.m. ET), Yellen (9:30 a.m. ET), Lacker (9:45 a.m. ET), Evans (10:15 a.m. ET), Dudley (11:45 a.m. ET), and Fischer (6:00 p.m. ET).  Eco data includes Init Jobless Claims - exp of 270K, Cont Claims 2,155 mil, and the JOLTS report of 5.4 mil supposed job openings.......Tomorrow retail sales are expected to show +0.3%, ex autos & gas of +0.4% - a miss will surely send those stocks lower.....and any upside surprise will ignite the algos causing any sellers left to get out of the way......And we will be off to the races......US futures are flat and trading will be driven by all the sure to be conflicting FED comments....Support continues to be at 2065 on the S&P with resistance at 2100.  No reason to break either way - just yet....Take good care.

637,UA,"Little Lies.....Fleetwood Mac - Tango in the Night - 1987 ""If I could turn the page, In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two, I couldn't find a way, So I'll settle for one day to believe in you........Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies...Oh no, no, you can't disguise....""
"
638,UA,"And so - let the confessions begin - or not......Yesterday - Citron Research - a firm that publishes negative research and actively makes bets against companies - made some very high-profile allegations against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) using phrases like - ""web of deception"", ""Fraud"", calling it the ENRON of the pharmaceutical industry.....Now for those of us who actually remember the ENRON scandal - that was not good.... and or those of you who do not - let me outline it....
"
639,UA,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
640,UA,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......
"
641,UA,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
642,UA,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......
"
643,UA,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.
"
644,UA,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
645,UA,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....
"
646,UA,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......
"
647,UA,"More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....
"
648,UA,"European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing..... Will they increase their current 1 tril Euro QE program? My guess is - not yet......FTSE flat, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.37%, EUROSTOXX + 0.33%, SPAIN +0.36% and ITALY flat.
"
649,UA,"US futures are up 7 pts at 2015...I suspect that with oil a bit higher and the dollar flat - as long as we get better earnings the market will hold steady here....Resistance still holds at 2035.....with short term support right here at 2015.....if that does not hold - then look for 1980 to be the next real support level.

Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing..... Will they increase their current 1 tril Euro QE program? My guess is - not yet......FTSE flat, CAC 40 + 0.14%, DAX + 0.37%, EUROSTOXX + 0.33%, SPAIN +0.36% and ITALY flat.US futures are up 7 pts at 2015...I suspect that with oil a bit higher and the dollar flat - as long as we get better earnings the market will hold steady here....Resistance still holds at 2035.....with short term support right here at 2015.....if that does not hold - then look for 1980 to be the next real support level.Take good care -KpFollow Kenny on Twitter at @kennypolcari, or on his website at Kennypolcari.comKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

Today, it ranks in the top 10.The consumer sector contingent also includes Priceline Group (PCLN), which has gotten a lot bigger via acquisitions and entry into new travel-related markets; video game software giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI); Delta Air Lines (DAL), which scored $40.9 billion in sales in the most recent four quarters and has averaged 26% EPS growth in the past three quarters; and Under Armour (UA), the Baltimore-based sportswear and shoemaker that has become a global brand just like its top rivals Adidas and Nike (NKE).The large contingent of health care stocks in the list also bespeaks the strengthening confidence of American households as jobs are more plentiful and joblessness has come down to 5.1% vs. 10% in October 2009.Mohawk represents the rebound in the home improvement and housing industries as home owners and sellers update their flooring. Acquisitions have boosted growth in the past. However, top line growth has slowed to a low single-digit pace in four of the past five quarters. In the second quarter of this year, sales were flat at $2.04 billion.So why has Mohawk been able to grow its earnings per share 20% or faster over the same five-quarter period?According to an RBC Capital Markets analyst quoted by IBD in August, Mohawk enjoyed improved productivity, lower raw material costs and synergies from its June 2015 merger with companies such as IVC Group, which specializes in sheet vinyl, luxury vinyl tile and laminate.In May, Mohawk completed its buy of KAI to attain the leading position in the Bulgarian and Romanian ceramic tiling markets.Priceline has expanded its online travel booking business from hotels and airline flights into rental cars and private driver services. More recently, it's grabbed space quickly in the online restaurant reservations field with its 2014 buy of OpenTable and an announcement Sept. 3 to acquire AS Digital. The Melbourne, Australia-based firm has seated 250 million diners through its software.Priceline CEO Darren Huston noted that in Q2, the firm saw a second straight quarter of accelerating growth in both hotel room nights and rental car days booked.

903,UA,"They argue the settlement forces them to give up rights to sue over some of Visa's practices and policies. The merchants also claim that Visa and MasterCard fixed the fees they were charged each time customers used their cards.

But Under Armour recovered Friday to close the week still within buy territory with a buy point of 86.40.BB&T Capital Markets remains bullish, lifting Under Armour's price target to 98 on Wednesday as it anticipates a ""solid"" earnings report, updated guidance at its investor day in September, and the upcoming stock split. (In mid June, the company announced a new class of non-voting Class C common stock, which will have the same effect as a 2-for-1 split.)Spieth and Curry's wins are believed to have driven direct-to-consumer sales in Q2, wrote BB&T analyst Corinna Freedman.A member of IBD's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group, Under Armour boasts a 94 Composite Rating, which means it has outperformed 94% of publicly traded companies in a mix of technical and fundamental factors.Fellow group member VF (VFC) reports Q2 results on Friday.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Under Armour Up As Jordan Spieth Collects Another WinCrystal Slippers To Air Jordans: Shoes Still A Smart Buy.

956,UA,"Fitbit could use a spotter. The maker of wearable activity trackers saw its shares tumble Thursday, a day after the company reported a second-quarter earnings beat that prompted several analysts to raise their price targets.Fitbit (FIT) stock plummeted 13.6% Thursday to 44.60. This comes after shares hit a record high of 51.90 on Wednesday, ahead of Fitbit's first quarterly report as a publicly traded company.Fitbit went public on June 18 at 20.A decline in the company's gross profit margin — to 47% in the second quarter from 52% in the year-earlier quarter — spooked investors.The gross margin decline ""is a sticking point in what's otherwise a strong beat-and-raise quarter,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue said in a research report Wednesday.Foreign currency exchange impact accounted for about a third of the decline, with upfront costs for increased production capacity and a mix shift to newer products making up the rest.""Cost optimization, supply-chain improvements and scale should help gross margins get back closer to 50% longer term,"" Sue said.Sue raised his price target on Fitbit stock to 53 from 45 and reiterated his outperform rating.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said that the market overreacted to Fitbit's gross margin decline. She raised her price target on Fitbit to 60 from 52 and maintained her overweight rating.The San Francisco-based company earned 21 cents a share excluding items on sales of $400 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Fitbit to earn just 8 cents a share on sales of $319 million. On a year-over-year basis, EPS rose 133% and sales jumped 253%. Fitbit also guided analysts higher for the current quarter and full year.A Growth Market""It's early days in a growing market,"" Sue said. ""Fitbit's focused on long-term execution, innovation and investing in the business in a methodical manner.""Fitbit is working on improvements to its software and services platform to increase user engagement.It also is spending on a global multimedia campaign to drive global awareness of its products and brand ahead of the holiday shopping season.To increase brand awareness last quarter, Fitbit collaborated with Kellogg (K) cereals, ESPN and the CBS (CBS) show ""The Amazing Race.""Fitbit sold 4.5 million devices in Q2, which was above the consensus estimate of 3.9 million, William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart said in a report Wednesday. Average selling price was $88, which was higher than the consensus view of $82, he said.Fitbit competes with fitness bands from Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and others. Smartwatches made by companies such as Apple (AAPL) also offer fitness-tracking features.Fitbit has not seen any negative impact from the launch of the Apple Watch, Fitbit CFO Bill Zerella told IBD.""Our view is that we're targeting a different customer,"" Zerella said. ""Apple is selling a general-purpose smartwatch with fitness features, and we are health and fitness focused.""But Apple likely increased awareness for fitness wearables by touting those features of its smartwatch, Zerella said.Also, Fitbit sells a range of products costing $60 to $250, he said. The Apple Watch starts at $349.Fitbit's biggest challenge has been meeting demand for its fitness bands, Zerella said. Last quarter, Fitbit ramped up production capacity for the Charge HR fitness band, which has been supply constrained, he said.""Our biggest hurdles have been figuring out how to meet the demand, which is a good problem to have,"" Zerella said. ""For the first time, we are in a position across all of our products to meet demand. And that's never been the case before.""Sportswear In The MixAlso interested in the digital fitness market are sportswear companies like Adidas, Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA).Germany's Adidas on Wednesday agreed to pay $239 million for Runtastic, an Austrian fitness app maker.

997,UA,"Apple (AAPL) didn't make Goldman Sach's list of stocks that are most exposed to China's slowdown, but many beaten-up semiconductor stocks did make the list amid a rising toll on industrial companies. While as much as 60% of Apple's revenue and 80% of its fiscal Q3 operating income growth came from China amid strong iPhone sales, Goldman Sachs economist David Kostin identified other stocks with the highest overall revenue exposure to China, in a research report published on Monday.
"
998,UA,"Apple's iPhone sales in China might have topped the U.S. in fiscal Q3, but the companies with the most revenue exposure include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM), Micron Technology (MU) and Avago Technologies (AVGO). Some of those stocks have sold off on Apple's weaker-than-expected iPhone sales in its fiscal Q3 ended June 27.
"

"

1001,UA,"Industrial companies, however, have been harder hit by weak China economic data than consumer sectors, he wrote.

"
1003,UA,"""S&P 500 firms explicitly attribute just 2% of their revenues to China and 8% to the broader Asia-Pacific region,"" Kostin said. ""Analysts have slashed EPS estimates of U.S. firms with high sales exposure to China by 15% year-to-date vs. 8% for the overall S&P 500.""

While as much as 60% of Apple's revenue and 80% of its fiscal Q3 operating income growth came from China amid strong iPhone sales, Goldman Sachs economist David Kostin identified other stocks with the highest overall revenue exposure to China, in a research report published on Monday.Apple's iPhone sales in China might have topped the U.S. in fiscal Q3, but the companies with the most revenue exposure include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM), Micron Technology (MU) and Avago Technologies (AVGO). Some of those stocks have sold off on Apple's weaker-than-expected iPhone sales in its fiscal Q3 ended June 27.Skyworks and Avago had been among the best-performing stocks in 2014 and early 2015, but they've fallen in the past couple of months.""Information technology stocks are the most exposed to China, with 10% of revenues generated in the region,"" said Kostin in the report. ""Sales to China account for less than 2% of revenues from the industrials and consumer sectors.""Industrial companies, however, have been harder hit by weak China economic data than consumer sectors, he wrote.Many companies have lowered guidance amid China's stock market turmoil, though the impact on its overall economy is still being debated by economists.""S&P 500 firms explicitly attribute just 2% of their revenues to China and 8% to the broader Asia-Pacific region,"" Kostin said. ""Analysts have slashed EPS estimates of U.S. firms with high sales exposure to China by 15% year-to-date vs. 8% for the overall S&P 500.""Bank of America/Merrill Lynch also weighed in on Monday, noting that ""China-exposed"" stocks have seen a lower proportion of June-quarter earnings beats and have given weaker guidance. BofA says the companies impacted experienced slowing demand — from ""autos to TVs to iPhones to machinery.""Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Yum Brands (YUM) are among the companies with revenue exposure, says Goldman Sachs.""Industrial companies in both the U.S. and Europe witnessed a negative Q2 earnings impact from a slowdown in China,"" said Kostin. ""Company managements of firms such as 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), and United Technologies (UTX) addressed the weakness during earnings conference calls.""In contrast, consumer-facing firms did not echo the negative sentiment toward China expressed by many industrials. Companies such as General Motors (GM), Under Armour (UA), Coca Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) benefitted from the Chinese consumer.""

"
1110,UA,"Apparel company Hanesbrands has found its comfort zone. The maker of underwear, socks and T-shirts benefits from a string of intersecting trends: consistent demand for undergarments and other everyday apparel, a shift toward activewear clothing, strong brand recognition, its own low-cost production platform and a series of strategic acquisitions that have helped it bolster sales, analysts say.
"
1111,UA,"""There's a lot to like here,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar told IBD.After Hanesbrands (HBI) reported in April that its first-quarter adjusted earnings per share rose 16% from a year earlier to 22 cents on net sales that climbed 14% to $1.21 billion, the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based outfit raised its guidance for the full year. It forecast net sales of $5.9 billion to $5.95 billion for 2015, up from previous guidance of $5.78 billion to $5.83 billion, and adjusted EPS of $1.61 to $1.66, up from $1.58 to $1.63.2015 Gains In SightThe guidance represents an increase over 2014 results of 10.9% to 11.8% for net sales and 13% to 17% for adjusted EPS.The company, which sells its products wholesale to department stores and mass retailers, is cash-rich and expects to remain so, forecasting net cash from operating activities to total between $550 million and $600 million this year.Hanesbrands' stock is up 24% so far in 2015.Its strong financial performance and stock price appreciation help it earn an IBD Composite Rating of 95, meaning it outperforms 95% of stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors.The company belongs to IBD's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing group. Hanes ranks third in the group by Composite Rating, behind G-III (GIII) and Carter's (CRI).The group's largest name by market cap is VF Corp.VFC, which owns 7 For All Mankind, Lee and Wrangler jeans among its brands, which also include activewear names Lucy and The North Face.Second in the group by size isUnder Armour (UA), a big beneficiary of the activewear trend, along with Nike (NKE), in the Apparel-Shoes & Related Manufacturing group.Knights Apparel For SchoolsHanesbrands' elevated outlook reflected a solid start to 2015 and the anticipated impact from its latest acquisition, it said. Early in the second quarter Hanesbrands closed its buy of Knights Apparel, which sells clothes such as t-shirts and sweatshirts with licensed college logos.The deal amplified two key trends for Hanesbrands: ongoing growth in activewear and related clothing, and expansion via acquisitions.Hanesbrands' product lines include Hanes and Playtex. The Knights Apparel acquisition complements its Gear for Sports operation, as well as its prominent Champion brand.""They are riding the athletic apparel cycle for sure,"" John Kernan, an analyst at Cowen & Co., told IBD.Analysts say that popular fashion has in recent years moved away from the likes of skinny jeans and toward activewear and sports-themed clothing, including workout pants, bolstering Hanesbrands' fortunes. On top of this, as consumers discard former fashion preferences for newer ones, they often also buy new undergarments that mesh with their newer designs, analysts say, and this too benefits Hanesbrands' core Hanes innerwear business.Acquiring The GoodsThe company in 2013 bought Maidenform Brands, a seller of bras and other undergarments for women, and in 2014 bought DBApparel, a marketer of intimate apparel and hosiery in Europe.Those two deals bolstered sales last year and Hanesbrands' bottom line, with fourth-quarter profit more than doubling.Morningstar's Weishaar said Hanesbrands produces most of its merchandise in-house and uses its massive scale to keep costs relatively low. When it looks at acquisitions, it typically eyes targets that outsource at least some of their production work. After closing a deal, it then brings the acquired company onto its own manufacturing platform, lowering expenses and boosting profits, she said.""So I think that the M&A play just continues on for them,"" Weishaar said. ""I think that's going to be one of their biggest growth drivers.""Cowen's Kernan agreed. ""They are going to make more acquisitions for sure,"" he said.""They do a really good job rolling up companies and putting them on their platform.""In a report, Kernan estimated that Hanesbrands could reach a run rate of $700 million in annual free cash flow next year, bolstering its ability to pursue more deals.""With only 6% of sales in Europe, we see opportunity for HBI to acquire brands in a fragmented market,"" he wrote in the report.Kernan projected that Hanesbrands could complete an additional $1.7 billion in deals over about five years. That, he noted, would leave the company generating double-digit earnings growth for years even if expansion in its core innerwear business were modest.But the core business, Kernan added, is on solid ground. The company's brands, he wrote, are ""enduring and powerful.""Within the $20 billion U.S. innerwear market, Kernan estimates that Hanes holds an 18% share at retail.Weishaar noted that innerwear is still Hanesbrands' biggest business. That, she added, is a good thing because it infuses reliability.She said most of the innerwear business consists of ""very basic"" undergarments. People tend to know their size and what brand works for them. Most don't want to try on undergarments at stores, so tend to go with a familiar brand. Hanesbrands is familiar to a big share of them. ""They just want to pick it up and go,"" she said.New Socks And UnderwearUnlike other lines of clothing, consumers need to regularly replace their supplies of apparel such as underwear, t-shirts and socks.""It's a replenishment business, so demand is steady,"" Weishaar said. ""It's a really great space to be in.""Hanesbrands declined IBD's interview request, citing a customary quiet period ahead of reporting second-quarter earnings.While speaking at a May conference, CEO Richard Noll acknowledged that Hanesbrands' business may fluctuate quarter to quarter ""as retailers can adjust their inventory levels up and down."" But over the course of a typical full year, ""our business is remarkably stable due to the replenishment nature of most of our categories.""That, along with boosts from acquisitions, makes him confident in Hanesbrands' long-term growth.""I feel really good about our ability to drive EPS up double digits for many years to come,"" he said.

In Q1, earnings fell 17%.As ""athleisure"" — think yoga pants, sweat-wicking tops and colorful sneakers — continues to dominate the weekend warrior wardrobe, activewear companies such as Under Armour, Nike, Foot Locker (FL) and others have benefitted from the trend.Athletic footwear, in particular, is the ""earnings season trend to play"" in Q2, says Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole in a Friday note.""Valuation remains at a high peak, but our view is as long as UA's 2Q report indicates its story is getting better, and we think it will, the stock should rise,"" he said of Under Armour specifically.Under Armour has also made a foray into the white-hot wearables space, currently led by fitness band IPO Fitbit (FIT) and kept in the headlines by the Apple (AAPL) Watch.But the Grip, backed by Under Armour and HTC, will reportedly be delayed in its rollout. The wearable is now expected to debut later in the year alongside a suite of health and fitness products, said HTC on Thursday.Fitbit shares dipped 1.3% Friday to 47.17. Apple rose 0.8% to 129.57. Shares of Under Armour rose about 2% to 87.20. The stock slid more than 3% Thursday following a downgrade from OTR Global, citing delivery delays and poor weather that led to below-plan domestic apparel sales. But Under Armour recovered Friday to close the week still within buy territory with a buy point of 86.40.BB&T Capital Markets remains bullish, lifting Under Armour's price target to 98 on Wednesday as it anticipates a ""solid"" earnings report, updated guidance at its investor day in September, and the upcoming stock split. (In mid June, the company announced a new class of non-voting Class C common stock, which will have the same effect as a 2-for-1 split.)Spieth and Curry's wins are believed to have driven direct-to-consumer sales in Q2, wrote BB&T analyst Corinna Freedman.A member of IBD's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group, Under Armour boasts a 94 Composite Rating, which means it has outperformed 94% of publicly traded companies in a mix of technical and fundamental factors.Fellow group member VF (VFC) reports Q2 results on Friday.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Under Armour Up As Jordan Spieth Collects Another WinCrystal Slippers To Air Jordans: Shoes Still A Smart Buy.

1296,UA,"RISKS/CHALLENGES
"
1297,UA,"Though a relatively new category, the wearable device sector is highly competitive.
"
1298,UA,"In addition to Apple, other players in the wearable field include Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA). Microsoft recently announced a wide-ranging software update for its Microsoft Band fitness tracker. In its IPO prospectus, Fitbit also lists Samsung, Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone and Misfit.
"
1299,UA,"Vendors tripled their wearable shipments in the first quarter to 11.4 million units from just 3.8 million in Q1 2014, reports IDC.
"
1300,UA,"While Fitbit dominates in its core fitness tracking market with an 85% share, that's not so in the overall wearable market.
"
1301,UA,"IDC says that shipments of Fitbit wearables rose 129% to 3.9 million in the first quarter. Fitbit held the lead with a 34% market share, but that's down from 45% in the same quarter a year ago, as more competitors have entered the market.

1305,UA,"Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves expects 11 million Apple Watch unit sales this year. But ""after strong initial demand, follow-on interest in Apple Watch appears mediocre,"" he said in a research note Monday.
"
1306,UA,"Fitbit is not a one-size-fits-all like the Apple Watch. And users could buy three Fitbit devices for the price of an Apple Watch.
"
1307,UA,"""There are a lot of different devices on the market,"" Llamas said. ""Fitbit is not looking to be all things to all people, and the market is still very young.""
"
1308,UA,"PROCEEDS
"
1309,UA,"Of the $621 million expected to be raised, based on the midpoint of its offering, $218 million will go to selling shareholders, of which Fitbit will not receive any of the proceeds.

1426,UA,"How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market
"
1427,UA,"Investing in growth stocks during a choppy market is a tricky business that's usually best avoided.
"
1428,UA,"But if you happened to buy a stock that broke out before the market began wobbling, it pays to be defensive. While growth stocks rise much faster than their peers during a market uptrend, they can fall twice as fast if the market heads south.
"
1429,UA,"Making a profit, even a small one, is difficult when the market toggles between confirmed uptrend and correction. That's true no matter how great the stock's fundamentals and regardless of whether it broke out of a beautifully shaped base in big volume.
"
1430,UA,"In uncertain markets, tighten your sell rules and divorce yourself from the idea that your stocks are too good to fail.
"
1431,UA,"The market went through choppy periods in 2011, 2012 and 2014. This year has also been choppy.
"
1432,UA,"Let's look at how Under Armour (UA) behaved last year after it cleared a cup-with-handle base on July 24 while the market's uptrend was under pressure. The gap up established a buy point at 65.51, as defined by the opening price on that day. Under Armour rose even as the market bounced between ""Confirmed uptrend"" (as noted in the Market Pulse, today on Page B3) and ""Market in correction."" The stock climbed to a high of 73.42 on Sept. 8, up 12% (1).
"
1433,UA,"The stock's healthy gains in the face of the market's headwinds might have given a new investor the sense that Under Armour was invincible.
"
1434,UA,"An experienced trader would have known to keep the impulse to get greedy in check, especially since UA's base was a riskier late-stage pattern. Such an investor may have started to sell into strength instead of waiting to see if the stock could achieve a 20% gain, which would have triggered a profit-taking rule.
"
1435,UA,"Sure enough, UA quickly began to pull back (2) as the market once again came under pressure on Sept. 15.
"
1436,UA,"On that day, the stock fell 3% in volume that was 28% above normal, briefly slicing through its 50-day moving average (please view a daily chart). The stock ended in the lower half of its intraday range and finished below the buy point.
"
1437,UA,"For those who were still holding on, the stock's action was a sign of weakness that would have justified selling at least a portion of one's shares. In a choppy market, investors need not wait for the 8% sell rule in order to limit losses.
"
1438,UA,"For those who chose to hang on, the roller-coaster ride continued. UA seesawed around the buy point for several weeks as the market gyrated between uptrend and correction. UA gave shareholders a couple of chances to sell, slicing through its 50-day line in heavy volume on Sept. 22 and again on Oct. 1, when the market slipped back into a correction.
"
1439,UA,"Finally, in the week ended Oct. 17, UA sank to a low of 60, triggering the 8% sell rule along the way.
"
1440,UA,"Investors who had bought shares much earlier in the run would have still had a big profit and could have afforded to hold on as the stock went on to form a new cup-with-handle base. But those who had arrived late would have done well to take profits or cut losses in order to protect capital and reduce the risk of further declines.

Its shares are up 11.1% so far this year, but are down 8.8% from a high reached on Jan. 27.Supermodels have come into the fray to boost women's apparel marketing, with Nike (NKE) recruiting Karlie Kloss and Under Armour (UA) sponsoring Gisele Bundchen. Gap (GPS) is also seeing success with its Athleta line of women's sports wear.And in the latest sign of growing competition, ""American Idol"" singer Carrie Underwood recently launched her Calia line of fitness apparel. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) said this week the new offering will displace some Adidas and Reebok products from shelves. The retailer later clarified that stores will continue to sell Adidas products.Amid the proliferation of choices, Lululemon's entry-level price points are about twice as expensive as those for Nike and Under Armour, Goldman noted.""The competitive dynamic today is far more intense, coming from the improved women's offerings at NKE/UA, 'me, too' yoga brands like Athleta, and increased 'athleisure' focus from fashion brands,"" the note said.Analysts also said business in Canada, where Lululemon generates 25% of its sales, has plateaued with possible brand fatigue among consumers and the unlikelihood of further stores built in Canada.And the devaluation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar will put a negative impact of 500 basis points on earnings before interest and tax, Goldman added.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter: @CiaranJMcEvoy.

1574,UA,"Steep early promotions led to a disappointing Thanksgiving weekend. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) and other online rivals continue to take a bigger slice of a limited retail pie.Still, retailers are on track to deliver the best holiday season in three years.Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, is sticking to his forecast for combined November-December sales growth of 2.9% after a Scrooge-like 0.9% increase last year. That's based on Census Bureau's GAFO (general merchandise, apparel, furniture and other, including electronics and sporting goods), and would be the best gain since 2011.""The key difference this holiday vs. last year and the last few years is the stronger economy, which is the underpinning for holiday spending,"" Niemira said.Mobile Still ActiveTop gift items were consumer electronics, especially mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, says Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst. Home decor products, small appliances and activewear were also big winners, he says.Bill Martin, founder of ShopperTrak sees retailers on track to show a 3.8% gain in GAFO sales for November and December.""That's a pretty good number,"" he told IBD.November retail sales rose 5.4%, fueled by an ""early push"" that helped offset an underperforming Thanksgiving weekend, says Martin. It took until the week before Christmas for consumers to get ""ramped up again, which is going on right now.""Sales on the last pre-Christmas Saturday likely rose 0.5% above last year to about $9.16 billion, according to Martin's preliminary tally. That would just top Black Friday's sales of roughly $9.1 billion, making Super Saturday the No. 1 shopping day for the first time in 10 years.Thomson Reuters analysts see December same-store sales rising 4%, up from 2013's 3.5%.""That suggests shoppers hit the malls this month,"" said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research, via email.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, says it was a ""decent holiday, fueled by a good jobs picture and significantly lower gas prices.""But apparel was ""soft"" due to a lack of fashion and as consumers focused spending on other areas, such as home furnishings, electronics and accessories.Best Buy (BBY), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) were among retailers with good holiday sales, he says.Thomson Reuters analysts forecast the home improvement segment will be the big winner in the November-to-January quarter with a 5.3% same-store sales rise, followed by footwear at 4.6% and jewelry at 4.1%.""The season shows that the consumer is alive and kicking a lot harder than you would think,"" adds Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors. ""You really got a good feel of what 5% GDP (growth) meant for retailers during this holiday.""Consumers were buying the priciest items at stores such as Best Buy, J.C. Penney (JCP) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Sozzi said. At Best Buy they snapped up GoPro (GPRO) action cameras and the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.Expensive lightweight jackets and hoodies from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) were also hot, says Sozzi.Cohen says the season turned out OK. ""Retailers had an early start, a lull (later) that was expected, and a strong finish through Christmas (Eve),"" he said. ""Now they have the gift cards, the returns and exchanges. There's still more revenue to come for retailers.""Retailers Didn't 'Panic'Retailers did a ""very good job"" all year managing inventory, including doorbusters, Cohen said. Except for mall-based apparel chains, they mostly stuck to their planned holiday promotions, a good sign for profit margins.""They weren't in a panic mode,"" Cohen said.Perkins estimates holiday online sales — from pure play e-tailers to brick-and-mortar stores — rose 15%, with traditional chains' online business up 10% to 15%.He says traditional stores such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) are getting a ""handle on"" ecommerce with features like ordering online and in-store pickup.""They're doing a better job of capturing online sales and not just feeding them to Amazon.""

1598,UA," Nahin Monsoor just can't seem to have enough Nike basketball shoes.The 12-year-old New York City native already owns four pairs of Nike (NKE) basketball shoes and was eying several more at the Foot Locker (FL) store on Manhattan's Upper East Side on the last Sunday in October.Monsoor says he only wears Nike basketball shoes.""The style is really good and they're comfortable,"" said Monsoor, who has worn Nike basketball sneakers since he was seven.Monsoor isn't alone. Basketball shoes continue to be big winners in the hotly competitive athletic footwear game, with IBD 50 stock Nike scoring big points among consumers with its namesake and Jordan brands as well as collections from basketball stars LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant, say followers.The apparel and footwear powerhouse has stayed on top of its game by continually rolling out more shoes named after star basketball athletes. Its latest was the LeBron 12 'HRT of a Lion' basketball shoe launched at retail on Oct. 30 after being delayed due to what Nike said was a ""small cosmetic issue."" The debut coincided with the Cleveland Cavaliers forward playing in his first NBA regular-season game for the team in four years that evening.Playing The FieldNike has been gaining traction on several fronts. Ongoing innovation in areas such as its Flyknit technology, now expanded beyond use in running shoes to several other categories such as football and basketball shoes, has helped vault Nike's business to new heights.It has also seen a big jump in its business in Western Europe and in China; and Nike is also riding the crest of the athleticwear wave that's taken workout clothes and sneakers out of the gym and onto Main Street as ""the"" fashion trend.Nike scored a slam dunk in its most recent fiscal 2015 first quarter. Earnings soared 27% to $1.09 a share, ahead of views by 21 cents. Revenue rose 15% to $7.98 billion, beating analyst forecasts for $7.83 billion. It was Nike's biggest quarterly revenue gain since the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Nike has logged double-digit revenue gains the past three quarters.Revenue climbed 25% in Western Europe, 12% in North America and 20% in greater China.Strong performance came from Nike's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through its website. Revenue increased 22%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and significantly higher Nike.com revenue.""In this current macro environment and given the size of the company, for Nike to be able to grow this quarter's revenue 15% with the expectation of 20% EPS growth for the full year, this early in the fiscal year, is nothing short of an outstanding performance, we think,"" wrote Nomura analyst Bob Drbul in a note following the results.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to climb 21% to $3.60 a share, roughly double the 10% gain it saw the prior year. They see a 15% gain in fiscal 2016 and a 14% rise in 2017.Nike Stock JumpsNike shares hit an all-time high on Friday. They have surged 17% since the company reported first-quarter results on Sept. 25, and more than 30% from a February low.""The reason Nike's stock is doing so well is their products are some of the only ones selling with strength globally,"" Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, told IBD. ""So they are not having to cut prices for their products.""Adds Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Svezia: ""They've executed pretty well. To some investors who need to look at big consumer discretionary names, Nike is doing well in the face of fiscal and global economic challenges vs. its consumer discretionary peers like McDonald's (MCD) and Coke (KO).""Basketball's Bank ShotThe basketball shoe category was among Nike's fastest growers and strongest performers in the quarter, with double-digit sales gains in North America.""Nike has always dominated the basketball business,"" said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a weekly newsletter. ""Clearly we're in a big basketball up-cycle (as) fashion. Nike has been through these up-cycles in basketball before and never has been able to sustain the up-cycle the way it has this one.""In this up-cycle, he adds, Nike's product development is much ""broader and deeper"" than it was before in terms of materials, colors and technology used in designing the shoes, and they're keeping the products new and fresh.He cites the point that Nike has continued to broaden the offerings in its Air Jordan franchise, which the company has ""kept bigger than ever, and it's been years since Michael Jordan played his last game.""Among the technologies he refers to is Flyknit, a special yarn and computer-controlled weaving method that lets footwear be ""engineered to provide a more precise fit for the specific needs of the foot,"" according to RunningShoesGuru.com.Nike's popular Flyknit athletic shoes are known for comfortable woven uppers that still provide support and come in bright colors and patterns.A Friend In The TrendNike is also benefiting from how athleticwear has become a go-to wardrobe for women and men to sport in most any casual setting. Power brand Under Armour (UA) is also cashing in on this trend.""Nike owns this business in theory,"" said analyst Svezia. ""It's the $30 billion gorilla in the market. They have significant market share and scale and have their weight behind them in terms of growing this business. They should do better than anyone else.""Drbul is upbeat about Nike's recent performance and prospects.""Overall, we think Nike has separated itself from the competition at the greatest level in the history of the company,"" he said. ""They are the creative machine and the innovation they have is second to none. They're hitting on all cylinders with growth in footwear, in apparel and in equipment. There's really very little weakness in its business.""In a report, Drbul said he was ""encouraged"" by Nike's ""robust"" direct-to-consumer performance in the first quarter, which was driven by a 70% increase in e-commerce and comp growth of 15%.He also noted that the company's efforts to ""reset the Chinese market are also clearly paying off.""He expects the Greater China region to grow at a low-mid teens rate for the full year.Sozzi expects Nike to be the ""winner"" in holiday season sales along with Under Armour and the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and Apple iPhone 6 Plus smartphones.Nike competes with sports apparel outfits such as Under Armour and yoga-inspired clothing company Lululemon (LULU).

1604,UA,"Amid a broader market selloff, it can be tough to know which stocks to let go of and which to accumulate.The IBD 50 features a number of consumer stocks with solid fundamentals that are holding up well and still poised to rise along with the steadily improving job market.Under Armour (UA) continues to impress, with analysts noting the activewear seller's good momentum despite the fact that many other retailers are struggling.Deutsche Bank recently reiterated its buy rating and raised Q3 earnings estimates to 41 cents from 38 cents a share on the strength of the athletic apparel and footwear sector. The Wall Street consensus is for the company to report a 18% earnings rise to 40 cents a share in Q3.The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, which means it has outperformed 98% of other publicly traded companies in areas such as earnings and relative strength ratings. In the IBD Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing group, Under Armour ranks third.In the same vein, Foot Locker (FL), a national retailer that carries Under Armour and Nike (NKE) merchandise, rode the back-to-school shopping wave with solid September same-store sales.

1690,UA,"A thoroughly vetted stock on your watch list is breaking out. You are finding breakouts can be hectic times.You dig through the news trying to understand what is driving the move. You pyramid into the stock as shares climb through the buying range. You also tend to other stocks in your portfolio.Then, just after you've set up a full position in the hard-charging stock, the breakout veers sharply lower.Rather than enjoying a nice cushion to keep you from being shaken out of the stock, you are trapped in a purgatory, with a part of your position underwater, and waiting to see what the stock does next.You'd love to see it reverse again, pick up the breakout baton again and sprint higher. Other than that, the next best scenario can go a couple different ways.One, maybe the stock spends a lethargic day or two, tests your patience, then begins to move higher. Or two, the stock falls below your tolerance levels, and you sell.While waiting for it to choose a path, investors should be clear on where the market stands. In an uptrend under pressure or market in correction (follow this via the Big Picture column, today on B3), you'll want to have your tolerances pulled in tight. This means selling at a 2% to 3% loss, if not before, rather than at the 7% to 8% allowance for healthy markets.Be sure to scan both the daily and weekly charts for the stock. They can reveal different nuances. Is volume coming in as the stock retakes ground, suggesting some institutional support? Are shares rising in light trade and seeing volume on the downticks, a sign of institutional selling?Also, review the other stocks in the industry group. Are there peer stocks breaking out without reservation? Is it possible that your stock is a follower, not a leader? If so, it might be a good idea to exit and look for a top dog stock in the group.Know the status of the stock's industry group: Is it rising, holding steady or falling? Weakness in the industry can be telling, and is a good reason for backing out of a stalled breakout.Breakout reversals regularly correct themselves and preface winning runs. But that can occur in a multitude of ways.Under Armour (UA) reversed back below a cup-base buy point of 36.59 in early July 2010. It undercut the buy point by 13%, triggering the automatic sell rule. Savvy investors would have opted out, noting that the market had just slipped into correction status. They also would have kept the stock close on their watch lists. When the market followed through into a new uptrend, and Under Armour retook its buy point in September. It rose 116% in nine months.More recently, TAL Education (XRS) snapped past two buy points in heavy volume on June 9. It was possible to read the base either as a double-bottom with a 25.41 buy point, or a cup base with a 26.68 pivot.On June 23, the China-based chain of after-school tutoring centers made a sharp dive (1). It undercut the 26.68 cup buy point by 5% and briefly sliced below the 25.41 entry. But TAL reversed to end the session up 2% and at the top of the day's trading range. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. TAL was the clear industry leader.The stock resumed its run. It's now up 36% from the 25.41 entry.

"
1693,UA,"For nearly three weeks, this space has been dedicated to answering the question: ""What makes a great base?"" If you're relatively new to IBD, the term base is used a lot. It's an area of price consolidation for a stock. A base forms when a stock takes a breather after a solid run up in price of 30% or more. Bases can be short (five weeks) or several months long.
"
1694,UA,"While IBD has identified certain chart patterns that have repeated decade after decade, the process of gauging supply and demand in a stock is a lot more than just recognizing chart patterns. Cup-with-handle patterns, flat bases and double bottoms can reveal solid demand for a stock. In other cases, not so much.
"
1695,UA,"Here are some highlights from the latest Investor's Corner series:
"
1696,UA," Avoid wide-and-loose bases. The less volatile the price action in a base, the better. Wide-and-loose price action is seen in large intraday swings as opposed to tight, orderly trade. Volatility in a stock is usually an indication of uncertainty.
"
1697,UA," Target early-stage bases. After a lengthy run-up, big market winners ultimately end up forming late-stage bases. By the time a stock forms a third-, fourth- or fifth-stage base, a good argument can be made that the big money already has been made in a stock. So avoid late-stage ones.
"
1698,UA,"After a multiyear run, Under Armour (UA) recently cleared a late-stage base. It's still holding above a buy point of 73.08 but the breakout hasn't made much progress. Since the bull market that began in March 2009, the stock is up more than 300%.
"
1699,UA," Look for symmetry. If you're having problems identifying the type of base a stock is forming, it's probably not a valid base. Demand the base to show a nice shape and smooth contours.
"
1700,UA,"In an eight-week cup-with-handle pattern, for example, a left side that forms in six weeks and a right side that forms in two weeks will not be a symmetrical base. In the same vein, a flat base that shows wide-and-loose price swings is less desirable than one that shows tight, orderly trading.
"
1701,UA," Look for signs of institutional buying. Bases with the best chances of yielding powerful breakouts show more accumulation than distribution. Accumulation is synonymous with heavy institutional buying. Distribution means institutional selling.
"
1702,UA,"On a weekly chart, look for weekly price gains in above-average volume, particularly when the stock is building the right side of a base. If a weekly gain comes in below-average weekly volume but is higher than the prior week, that's still a positive and a sign of at least mild accumulation. Distribution weeks, or weeks down in heavy volume, should be limited in a base.
"
1703,UA," Look for a volume dry-up. It's good to see attention turn away from a stock ahead of a breakout. A volume dry-up is good to see when a flat base forms. It's also ideal when a handle area forms in a cup-with-handle pattern.
"
1704,UA,"Actavis (ACT) was featured in this series last month because it formed a base with good symmetry in the summer of 2013. It also had other aforementioned features going for it.

"
1723,UA,"""The estimates reflect a moderately decent back-to-school shopping period,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Traffic picked as the month progressed. Retailers were very promotional making it worthwhile for people to get out and shop. It should turn out to be an OK back-to-school shopping season, unlike last year, which was very difficult. That doesn't mean that all retailers fared well, because it's very competitive and cutthroat out there.

Highly rated Foot Locker (FL) and Finish Line (FINL) could also benefit.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting August retail industry sales at stores open at least a year to rise 4.2% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.The final tally for August, the key back-to-school selling month, will be released Thursday.All retailers reporting same-store sales are expected to show positive same-store sales growth, Perkins says.""The estimates reflect a moderately decent back-to-school shopping period,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Traffic picked as the month progressed. Retailers were very promotional making it worthwhile for people to get out and shop. It should turn out to be an OK back-to-school shopping season, unlike last year, which was very difficult. That doesn't mean that all retailers fared well, because it's very competitive and cutthroat out there.Retailers, he adds, need to have the ""right product mix as well as the right price points"" to have a good back-to-school season.Among the 11 retailers that report monthly same-store sales Perkins cites action-sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ) as one that's positioned to fare well for back-to-school. It gets a Composite Rating of 89 from IBD, out of a possible 99.Perkins says Zumiez is ""best placed"" among the publicly traded teen-apparel retailers to perform the best for back to school, citing the fact that it operates in a niche area as a positive.That sports-related niche is likely helping Zumiez ride the crest of the athleticwear wave that's sweeping the apparel industry and likely to be the big winner for back-to-school.Investors will learn more about how Zumiez is faring when it reports second-quarter results on Thursday after the closing bell.Separately, power brands such as Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (which has an IBD Composite Rating of 98) are seen cashing in on the back-to-school buying spree in athletic attire as are athletic footwear retailers Foot Locker and Finish Line, which hold a 98 and 94 IBD Composite Rating, respectively.Gap's Old Navy brand is seen having a good August, says Perkins. As of Wednesday, Old Navy was expected to show a 3.6% rise in August same-store sales vs. a year earlier.But overall, Gap (GPS) is seen posting August same-store sales up 1.7% vs. a year earlier. Gap gets an IBD Composite Rating of 89.""Things are tough at the company's namesake brand,"" Perkins said.Warehouse club powerhouse and typical top retail performer Costco Wholesale (COST) is expected to generate the strongest August same-store sales gain at 4.9%. Core Costco U.S. same-store sales that exclude gas and foreign currency are projected to rise a slightly greater 5.2%.Giant drugstore operator Walgreen (WAG) is expected to post a solid 4.4% rise in same-store sales for August. Rival Rite Aid (RAD) is estimated to post a 3.3% gain.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) is forecast to show a 2.8% same-store sales gain for August.Regional discount chain Stein Mart (SMRT) is projected to report a 3% rise.PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, is expected to see a 1.1% increase for the month.Teen-apparel retailer Buckle (BKE) is seen showing a 1.1% rise.Related: Gap Looks Hot For Autumn, Top Pick As Stock Hits High.

1768,UA,"Under Armour's nearly $300 million bid to steal Kevin Durant's endorsement from Nike could mean an entry into the big leagues and may be less costly than it appears.The offer, if accepted, would reportedly be Under Armour's (UA) biggest-ever endorsement deal and eat up around 10% of its annual marketing budget.""It would mean that they're really in the game,"" Sterne Agee analyst Sam Poser told IBD, adding that the contract would likely be paid out in a mix of cash and stock. ""It would probably be very good for Under Armour and the overall athletic category.""Under Armour is reportedly offering the Oklahoma City Thunder forward $265 million-$285 million, according to ESPN, but if Nike (NKE) asserts its right to match that bid, Durant will not be free to pick Under Armour.Global AmbitionsNews of the mega-bid comes weeks after Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, who sees his company eventually generating $10 billion in annual revenue, predicted that this year will mark a major turning point.""We will look back on 2014 as the year we transitioned from a company learning how to make great shoes into a truly disruptive voice in the global footwear market,"" he said in an earnings conference call last month.A Durant deal would be a significant chunk of change for Under Armour, whose expected full-year revenue of $3 billion pales in comparison to Nike, which brought in $27.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended in May.""A lot of people are fixated on how much money this is,"" Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu said in an interview. ""But (Under Armour) is in a hypergrowth stage. If you look just two years out to 2016, (the money) would be 5% of the marketing expense.""Low Risk Vs. Big RewardUnder Armour's sales could reach $4.8 billion in 2016, Vasilescu says. And if the company's marketing cost-sales ratio remains around 11%, Durant's annual take of about $25 million would constitute just roughly 5% of the athletic-wear maker's marketing budget.""The real potential of basketball is that it's becoming a global sport,"" said Vasilescu.While basketball currently accounts for a meager 1% or so of Under Armour's revenue, the segment's growth potential is enormous.At rival Nike, for example, basketball and running segment revenues have been growing in the high teens, says Vasilescu, compared to single-digit growth in sales of football and baseball, which are much more American-centric sports.According to the NBA, the 2013-14 season started with 92 international players on opening-night rosters. If basketball continues its upward trajectory both as an activewear segment and an international sport, stealing Durant could turn into a major score for Under Armour.While the company is smaller than Nike now, ""Kevin Durant can move the needle not just because of who he is and what he's become, but because the NBA is much more of an international league,"" said David Carter, executive director of the USC Marshall Sports Business Institute.And when it comes to being a face of the sport to the world, Durant is ""one of the wholesome beacons of the league.""""If you were to bet on a sport, bet on a player to help you — he would be the guy,"" said Carter. ""He wouldn't bring disfavor to your brand, and (he would) represent the league well as it continues global outreach.""It's All About The ShoesShould there be concern about Under Armour's bet on Durant, it might be better focused on what kind of product the company will roll out, regardless of how much money it spends.Macquarie's Vasilescu sees Durant-branded basketball shoes debuting within six to 12 months of a deal. But Under Armour can't use Nike's ""KD"" brand, Sterne Agee's Poser noted.""It's going to come down to how good the shoes are, to a large degree,"" he said. ""If the product isn't any good, then it won't matter what they do. But if the reports that I've read are true, Kevin Durant liked what he saw.""

1769,UA,"A thoroughly vetted stock on your watch list is breaking out. You are finding breakouts can be hectic times.You dig through the news trying to understand what is driving the move. You pyramid into the stock as shares climb through the buying range. You also tend to other stocks in your portfolio.Then, just after you've set up a full position in the hard-charging stock, the breakout veers sharply lower.Rather than enjoying a nice cushion to keep you from being shaken out of the stock, you are trapped in a purgatory, with a part of your position underwater, and waiting to see what the stock does next.You'd love to see it reverse again, pick up the breakout baton again and sprint higher. Other than that, the next best scenario can go a couple different ways.One, maybe the stock spends a lethargic day or two, tests your patience, then begins to move higher. Or two, the stock falls below your tolerance levels, and you sell.While waiting for it to choose a path, investors should be clear on where the market stands. In an uptrend under pressure or market in correction (follow this via the Big Picture column, today on B3), you'll want to have your tolerances pulled in tight. This means selling at a 2% to 3% loss, if not before, rather than at the 7% to 8% allowance for healthy markets.Be sure to scan both the daily and weekly charts for the stock. They can reveal different nuances. Is volume coming in as the stock retakes ground, suggesting some institutional support? Are shares rising in light trade and seeing volume on the downticks, a sign of institutional selling?Also, review the other stocks in the industry group. Are there peer stocks breaking out without reservation? Is it possible that your stock is a follower, not a leader? If so, it might be a good idea to exit and look for a top dog stock in the group.Know the status of the stock's industry group: Is it rising, holding steady or falling? Weakness in the industry can be telling, and is a good reason for backing out of a stalled breakout.Breakout reversals regularly correct themselves and preface winning runs. But that can occur in a multitude of ways.Under Armour (UA) reversed back below a cup-base buy point of 36.59 in early July 2010. It undercut the buy point by 13%, triggering the automatic sell rule. Savvy investors would have opted out, noting that the market had just slipped into correction status. They also would have kept the stock close on their watch lists. When the market followed through into a new uptrend, and Under Armour retook its buy point in September. It rose 116% in nine months.More recently, TAL Education (XRS) snapped past two buy points in heavy volume on June 9. It was possible to read the base either as a double-bottom with a 25.41 buy point, or a cup base with a 26.68 pivot.On June 23, the China-based chain of after-school tutoring centers made a sharp dive (1). It undercut the 26.68 cup buy point by 5% and briefly sliced below the 25.41 entry. But TAL reversed to end the session up 2% and at the top of the day's trading range. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. TAL was the clear industry leader.The stock resumed its run. It's now up 36% from the 25.41 entry.

1770,UA,"In the race to wow this back-to-school season, athleticwear is primed to be a front-runner.If followers are on target, power brands such as IBD 50 stock Under Armour (UA) and Nike (NKE) should keep up the fast pace as workout attire from leggings to sweat shirts ranks among uniforms of choice for youths heading back to the classroom.Highly rated casual/dress and athletic footwear outfit Skechers USA (SKX) should, according to analysts' forecasts, also be among the top performers this back-to-school season, which runs from the end of July to mid-September. So should action sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ).Athletic footwear retailers such as IBD 50 company Foot Locker (FL) and Finish Line (FINL) are also looking at the top of their game for this key shopping period.""Athletic leisurewear is huge,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, an industry research firm. ""More and more kids are gravitating toward fitness leisurewear to wear in the classroom, whether it's Under Armour or Nike.""Industry InnovatesPerkins says the trend is benefiting sporting-goods stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and department stores such as Macy's (M) that carry these types of offerings.""The whole athletic footwear and activewear segment has been on fire,"" adds B. Riley & Co. analyst Jeff Van Sinderen. ""You have to give credit to Nike. They have an amazing machine that comes up with phenomenal products, and that keeps demand high. It's all about product innovation, which is the biggest driver of this business.""Overall, retailers should fare better this back-to-school season than they did last year when factors such as heavy competition and economic and job concerns led to weak back-to-school spending.""I continue to be optimistic on this back-to-school season,"" said Michael Niemira, principal of the Retail Economist.He forecasts a 4.7% rise vs. a year earlier in back-to-school sales for electronics, family clothing, books and shoe store categories for July, August and September. That would be up from the paltry 0.9% rise in 2013 and the biggest gain since 2010, he says.The drivers? ""There's an underlying improvement in the economy that is finally helping to lift consumer demand, especially for back-to-school items,"" he said.Niemira says that retailers have moved beyond the weather-related ""soft patch"" earlier in the year, and are getting a ""broader-based lift"" triggered by pent-up demand.Adds Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors: ""I think back-to-school is shaping up better than the stock market may be expecting.""Sozzi expects the ""strong momentum"" he saw before Labor Day weekend to carry over through the first couple of weeks the kids are back to school and do more buying based on what their classmates are wearing.The strong momentum, he adds, will be driven by ""more exciting"" offerings for kids and their parents to buy, such as ""jogger"" pants. Printed pants for teens and girls and mesh tops for men and young adults are also hot.Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters, says retail sales have been improving, but at a very slow rate.""In general, earnings growth and revenue growth (for retailers) have shown improvement from a year ago for this past quarter, and our estimates show a strong third quarter and a healthy back-to-school season,"" she said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect same-store sales for the third quarter — which includes August, September and October for most retailers — to rise 1.4% vs. a year earlier. That would be higher than the 1.3% they forecast for the second quarter.Shoppers kicked their back-to-school spending into high gear in August, says Perkins, leading to a 5% pop in same-store sales for the month, ahead of views for 4.2%.He says based on his store checks, back-to-school season looks to be ""shaping up to be a decent one.""Under Armour ShinesIn terms of apparel brands, ""the big winner for back-to-school is Under Armour,"" said Sozzi.""Under Armour apparel has become the uniform of choice for teens,"" he said. And Nike, he adds, is the winner on the footwear side.Shoes, and athletic footwear in particular, continue to be hot sellers for back-to-school.In the four weeks ended Aug. 17, athletic footwear sales grew 3% vs. a year earlier and children's athletic footwear rose 5%, says an NPD Group report.Basketball shoes are a slam dunk for back-to-school, with a 70% year-over-year jump in sales in the four-week period, says NPD.Van Sinderen said that based on his channel checks for late August, Foot Locker, the leader in the basketball footwear category, and Finish Line, which leads in running shoes, were both doing well for the back-to-school season.Among teen retailers, Perkins cites Zumiez as being well-positioned. He says it's ""niche-oriented,"" with lots of products that you won't find in other stores.More traditional teen apparel retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Aeropostale (ARO) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) won't make the grade, says Martis. She says teens already have the ""basic items"" offered by these retailers. ""They want unique fashion trends for back-to-school,"" she adds.And fast-fashion chains such as Forever 21 and Zara will be the winners on the hot fashion front, according to Martis.Promotions ExpectedOverall, inventories are in ""better shape"" than in last year's back-to-school season, says Perkins. Retailers are carrying less inventory, so they don't have to run ""fire sales.""However, retailers continue to be highly promotional.""For the lower- and middle-income consumer, price points have to fit into a budget that's not growing,"" Perkins said. ""That leads to promotions. And pressure from online retailers is forcing brick-and-mortar retailers to discount and compete even more.""""Online will continue to erode in-store as retailers haven't yet learned how to compete and get online to complement their in-store business rather then detract from it,"" added Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD, in an email.Besides activewear and athletic shoes, hot sellers will include smartphone cases and handbags, he says.Tablets and smartphones, such as the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus introduced Tuesday, could also grab plenty of sales.""Electronics are a must-have for (back-to-school), and when it comes to tablets, Apple iPads are still a favorite,"" Martis noted.

1771,UA,"In the race to wow this back-to-school season, athleticwear is primed to be a front-runner.If followers are on target, power brands such as IBD 50 stock Under Armour (UA) and Nike (NKE) should keep up the fast pace as workout attire from leggings to sweat shirts ranks among uniforms of choice for youths heading back to the classroom.Highly rated casual/dress and athletic footwear outfit Skechers USA (SKX) should, according to analysts' forecasts, also be among the top performers this back-to-school season, which runs from the end of July to mid-September. So should action sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ).Athletic footwear retailers such as IBD 50 company Foot Locker (FL) and Finish Line (FINL) are also looking at the top of their game for this key shopping period.""Athletic leisurewear is huge,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, an industry research firm. ""More and more kids are gravitating toward fitness leisurewear to wear in the classroom, whether it's Under Armour or Nike.""Industry InnovatesPerkins says the trend is benefiting sporting-goods stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and department stores such as Macy's (M) that carry these types of offerings.""The whole athletic footwear and activewear segment has been on fire,"" adds B. Riley & Co. analyst Jeff Van Sinderen. ""You have to give credit to Nike. They have an amazing machine that comes up with phenomenal products, and that keeps demand high. It's all about product innovation, which is the biggest driver of this business.""Overall, retailers should fare better this back-to-school season than they did last year when factors such as heavy competition and economic and job concerns led to weak back-to-school spending.""I continue to be optimistic on this back-to-school season,"" said Michael Niemira, principal of the Retail Economist.He forecasts a 4.7% rise vs. a year earlier in back-to-school sales for electronics, family clothing, books and shoe store categories for July, August and September. That would be up from the paltry 0.9% rise in 2013 and the biggest gain since 2010, he says.The drivers? ""There's an underlying improvement in the economy that is finally helping to lift consumer demand, especially for back-to-school items,"" he said.Niemira says that retailers have moved beyond the weather-related ""soft patch"" earlier in the year, and are getting a ""broader-based lift"" triggered by pent-up demand.Adds Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors: ""I think back-to-school is shaping up better than the stock market may be expecting.""Sozzi expects the ""strong momentum"" he saw before Labor Day weekend to carry over through the first couple of weeks the kids are back to school and do more buying based on what their classmates are wearing.The strong momentum, he adds, will be driven by ""more exciting"" offerings for kids and their parents to buy, such as ""jogger"" pants. Printed pants for teens and girls and mesh tops for men and young adults are also hot.Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters, says retail sales have been improving, but at a very slow rate.""In general, earnings growth and revenue growth (for retailers) have shown improvement from a year ago for this past quarter, and our estimates show a strong third quarter and a healthy back-to-school season,"" she said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect same-store sales for the third quarter — which includes August, September and October for most retailers — to rise 1.4% vs. a year earlier. That would be higher than the 1.3% they forecast for the second quarter.Shoppers kicked their back-to-school spending into high gear in August, says Perkins, leading to a 5% pop in same-store sales for the month, ahead of views for 4.2%.He says based on his store checks, back-to-school season looks to be ""shaping up to be a decent one.""Under Armour ShinesIn terms of apparel brands, ""the big winner for back-to-school is Under Armour,"" said Sozzi.""Under Armour apparel has become the uniform of choice for teens,"" he said. And Nike, he adds, is the winner on the footwear side.Shoes, and athletic footwear in particular, continue to be hot sellers for back-to-school.In the four weeks ended Aug. 17, athletic footwear sales grew 3% vs. a year earlier and children's athletic footwear rose 5%, says an NPD Group report.Basketball shoes are a slam dunk for back-to-school, with a 70% year-over-year jump in sales in the four-week period, says NPD.Van Sinderen said that based on his channel checks for late August, Foot Locker, the leader in the basketball footwear category, and Finish Line, which leads in running shoes, were both doing well for the back-to-school season.Among teen retailers, Perkins cites Zumiez as being well-positioned.

"
1774,UA,"When Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) went public in January 2006, the stock doubled to 44 from an initial 22 price mark on its first day. The much-hyped burrito chain closed at 664.09 Friday as it makes its mark as the last decade's fastest-growing quick service/fast casual company, based on sales figures.
"
1775,UA,"Under Armour (UA) made a stylish debut as well, as it nearly doubled to 25.30 from an initial offering price of 13, reportedly second only to Chinese search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) in first-day gains for 2005 IPO debuts. UA shares closed at 68.41 Friday.
"
1776,UA,"Frequently compared to Nike (NKE), the activewear maker recently signed supermodel Gisele Bundchen as a spokesperson as it tries to find footing in women's apparel, and has been touted as a favorite among women.
"
1777,UA,"Chinese stock Tal Education (XRS), an after-school education company, gained 50% from its initial price of 10. The provider of K-12 tutoring debuted in four more cities during its most recent fiscal year. And it's expected to expand by two to four cities every year for the next several years, according to Deutsche Bank.
"
1778,UA,"One notable IBD 50 star that didn't get off to such a strong start is Vipshop Holdings (VIPS), which fell 15% from its 2012 IPO price of 6.50. But shares of the flash-sale online clothing retailer have since climbed steadily to a whopping 209 in just two and a half years with enormous earnings gains of over 200% for the last three straight quarters.
"
1779,UA,"Lastly, Facebook (FB) made a notable entry to much fanfare but little change during its first day of trading in May 2012, closing only 23 cents higher than its IPO price of 38. The stock fell as low as 21.66 in September. But, ultimately, Mark Zuckerberg's social-media firm has lived up to the hype, as it closed at 77.91 on Friday — just pennies from a record high — and has seen triple-digit earnings advances in the last three of four quarters.

"
1785,UA,"IBD 50 companies of all kinds are expected to report solid quarterly results in the coming week, potentially an indication that the gears driving our tech, retail, auto, medical and defense sectors are moving more freely. Here's a look at what analysts expect.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) — the security chipmaker that helps keep your Apple Pay transactions safe — reports fourth-quarter results after the close on Wednesday.The Netherlands-based company, which recently introduced technology allowing drivers to lock and unlock their cars via their phones, owes much of its success to the immense popularity of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6, of which NXP is a supplier.Analysts expect NXP's EPS to springboard up 33% to $1.32 — the strongest gain of any of the IBD 50 stocks reviewed here. Revenue is seen increasing 17% to $1.51 billion.NXP shares emerged from a first-stage flat base this month but have rattled around near their 50-day line, where investors will often buy shares if they have faith in the company. The stock has ascended 82% since 2014.Shares slipped 0.7% on the stock market Friday but are still holding above a buy point and are in buy range.Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) reports on Tuesday. The company's artificial heart valve, Sapien, has helped keep gains aloft in recent quarters.Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 4% from a year earlier to 95 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 14% to $610.5 million.Edwards' Q3 results in October indicated to analysts that growth in the global transcatheter aortic valve replacement market continues to exceed expectations.The stock is up about 86% in the last year but in recent weeks has converged with its 50-day line. Shares fell 3% Friday to below that key level of support.As more business adapts to so-called omnichannel retailing — in which customers might use a combination of online and in-store outlets to buy products — Manhattan Associates' (MANH) supply-chain-management software helps them keep track of the orders.When the company reports Q4 results on Tuesday, analysts expect to see EPS rise 16% to 28 cents and revenue elevate 10% to $118.9 million.Since July 2012, the last time the stock spent any extended time below its 200-day line, Manhattan shares have risen more than 300%.Shares tripped up last November after trying to clear a cup-with-handle base begun in March. But they ricocheted up off their 50-day line in early January and have remained above it since.Car-dealer operator Asbury Auto (ABG) has thrived in recent years on the auto industry's rebound. Analysts expect the company, which reports Q4 results on Wednesday, to grow EPS by 15% to $1.01, though that would mark the slowest growth since Q3 2011. Sales are seen increasing 8% to $1.48 billion.Shares entered into a sixth-stage consolidation from July through November and have been seeking support at their 50-day line for most of January. The later the stage, the greater a stock's chance of topping out, IBD research finds. Still, shares are up 48% since 2014.O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) also reports Q4 results Wednesday. With more cars lasting longer, the company has benefited from part replacements. As the months get colder, O'Reilly could also see sales pick up from repairs to winter-ravaged cars.Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) — a company whose propulsion, fuselage and wing systems go into military aircraft and passenger jets — reports Q4 results Tuesday. Analysts see EPS increasing 17% to 76 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 12% to $1.674 billion.Spirit serves such companies as defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) and aerospace giant Boeing (BA), which this week both reported estimate-topping Q4 results.Spirit shares cleared a flat base and have found support at their 50-day line.Apparel retailer Under Armour (UA), whose 'athleisure' wear continues to attract the athletic and the leisured alike, reports Q4 results Wednesday after the close.Analysts see EPS escalating 30% to 39 cents and revenue rising 24% to $849.63 million, which would continue a slight deceleration in sales gains over the past three quarters.Citigroup this month upgraded Under Armour to buy, citing the company's domestic and international prospects. But that upgrade came a day after Jefferies downgraded the stock, citing ""few near-term catalysts and valuation that accurately reflects the company's long-term growth prospects.""Under Armour stock cleared a fourth-stage cup-with-handle base on Thursday but struggled for momentum Friday as they slipped 1%.

1821,UA,"Lululemon Athletica (LULU) raised its fourth-quarter earnings and sales outlook after a strong holiday season.The yoga-apparel maker sees EPS of 71-73 cents, up from an earlier outlook of 65-69 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 69 cents.Lulu now expects Q4 sales to be $595 million-$600 million, vs. its prior guidance of $570 million-$585 million. Analysts expect $588.6 million. Same-store sales are seen as rising 6%-7%.""Backed by improving trends and strong holiday results, we are entering 2015 in very good shape. Our guests are responding positively to both the women's and men's product assortment,"" said CEO Laurent Potdevin in a release.Shares jumped nearly 8% to 63.24 on the stock market today, the highest since December 2013. Shares are up nearly 70% from a closing low of 37.25 on June 12.Lulu once was considered the most fashionable yoga-gear maker, but rivals like Gap's (GPS) Athleta and expanding women's lines from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have bitten into sales.The company also suffered from PR disasters in the past few years, including a type of yoga pant that was too sheer and founder Chip Wilson's comment that some women don't have the correct body shape to wear Lulu's clothing.But Lululemon has been in turnaround mode. Earlier this month, analysts were bullish on the appointment of Stuart Haselden, J. Crew's finance chief, as Lulu's new CFO.Sterne Agee analyst Sam Poser upgraded Lulu to neutral from underperform on its updated guidance.""Sales acceleration during the holiday leads us to reevaluate our negative sentiment of the brand,"" he wrote in a client note.But he still sees an expensive valuation for the stock.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

1822,UA,"Lululemon Athletica's (LULU) naming of Stuart Haselden as its new CFO received broad praise from analysts, who said that Haselden could help the yogawear company advance internationally after a tumultuous past two years.
"
1823,UA,"Haselden, a former U.S. Army officer and an outdoors and workout enthusiast, will replace John Currie, who last year announced that he would retire from the position at the fiscal year's end.

1867,UA,"Sports fandom often can be an expensive endeavor for consumers — pricey logo gear, limited-edition shoes, jerseys — but it can be even pricier for the brands supporting the competing teams.Top athletic-apparel maker Nike (NKE) is hawking $180 Nike Airs and $150 jerseys in the team colors of Brazil, England and the Netherlands leading up to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, which begins Thursday. And presumably in an effort to compete with the official World Cup sponsor, Adidas, Nike is also spending a ton on something it calls ""demand creation.""Nike's ""demand creation"" costs — i.e., advertising and endorsement-deal expenses — have leapt more than 30%. Overhead is up in the ""low double digits"" due to infrastructure and World Cup expenses, likely pushing up selling, general and administrative expenses in its 2014 fourth quarter, said Sterne Agee analyst Samuel Poser in a research note.By early afternoon, Nike shares had moved down 1.5% to 75.15 in the stock market today, Wednesday.Advertising expenses include a five-minute Pixar-style commercial featuring animated versions of everyone's favorite soccer stars, creating a lot of buzz. And for the first time, the company is out-sponsoring Germany-based Adidas at the World Cup, outfitting 10 teams to Adidas' nine, according to Barron's. Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike snagged World Cup home team Brazil; its own home team, the U.S.; and France, England, Portugal and others. Adidas got its hands on teams from Germany, Spain and Argentina.But creating demand can also create a lot of pressure on a company.""Investments to support the World Cup, and new infrastructure and (foreign exchange) pressures, especially in the emerging markets where many currencies were devalued, will pressure (Nike) EPS growth,"" Poser noted in his outlook for Nike for the rest of fiscal 2014. ""EPS is now expected to increase less than the standard midteen target.""The resulting stock-price instability from the surge of World Cup expenses and expectations may even cause some investors to avoid buying a company's stock.""Tactically avoiding NKE in the months preceding the World Cup through June earnings, followed by buying the stock roughly (two to three) months later provides the best return,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon in a research note, adding that Nike's 2015 estimates are ""too high.""""We believe the wide swings in NKE's stock in World Cup years are exacerbated by heightened sales expectations and/or forward-year guidance that end up disappointing,"" wrote Lyon.Fellow athletic-gear makers, Germany-based Puma and Baltimore-based Under Armour (UA), also are striving to make their mark on the crowd during this landmark sporting event that happens once every four years.The Italian, Chilean and Swiss teams, among others, will don Puma's flashy gear, including bright cleats that come in different colors for each foot.Under Armour has been elbowing for a spot on the international stage, generating 79% more international revenue, according to its Q1 earnings call. The company says that its brand awareness has doubled in Germany and France; in the U.K., it ""grew three times as we continue to bring new consumers into our brand through global football.""While it will not have as large of a presence as Nike or Adidas in Brazil during the World Cup, Under Armour will ""be represented in the (FIFA Club World Cup) tournament as we've just signed an agreement to outfit Cruz-Azul starting later this year."" The FIFA Club World Cup takes place in December 2014 in Morocco.""UA is becoming the predominant brand in youth footwear and apparel, which bodes well for the future of the company,"" said Poser. ""As with Nike over 30 years ago, we expect Under Armour to grow up with its young customers.""Under Armour shares were off 1% in midday trading Wednesday to 55.62.

"
2264,UA,"Innovation stands as the basic theme of all business strategies at Under Armour.From creating sportswear that can enhance an athlete's performance to a marketing scheme that grabs retail space from competitors, the Baltimore-based maker of athletic apparel says ""innovation"" is its mantra.In a world where few people carry the same phone they owned five years ago, innovation isn't just a way to stay ahead of the competition, or even keep up. It's a matter of survival; just look at BlackBerry (BBRY). Once the must-have smartphone, BlackBerry was caught off guard by the launch of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. Its failure to keep up with the iPhone has left BlackBerry in a fight, not only to stay relevant, but for its life. And with a lot of innovative development happening in the world of fabrics, footwear, and accessories, Under Armour (UA) strives to not only match the competition, but lead the pack.""I believe that 99.9% of the companies in the world say that innovation is really important, but not a ton of companies live by that rule,"" said Henry Stafford, Under Armour's president of North America. ""We truly do.""For Under Armour ""innovation"" isn't merely a buzzword or a newly adopted management style. It's in the company's DNA. As a football player at the University of Maryland, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank hated spending hours practicing in cotton T-shirts soaked with his own sweat.In 1996, he designed a lightweight compression shirt out of synthetic fabrics that kept athletes cool and dry by wicking away moisture. The next year he created a fabric that kept athletes warm and dry in cold conditions.Some of the newest products created by Under Armour include a speedskating suit for the U.S. team at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, a shirt that monitors an athlete's heart rate and new footwear: Speedskating Short Track Skin. In addition to wicking away moisture, the aerodynamic, skin-tight speedskating suit helps athletes move faster by reducing air drag and the friction that builds up between a skater's thighs. The Armour39 system. Currently used by the NFL, this shirt collects information such as maximum heart rate, ventilatory threshold and recovery rate, then sends it to a module fitted in the chest strap. This information is then transmitted to a display device, either a mobile app or special watch. Speedform running shoe. Much like Under Armour's clothing, this running shoe gives next-to-the skin support and comfort. The shoe's front has anatomical toe molding for a guided fit, while the back has a silicone grip to provide a locked-in fit for the heel.""The emphasis on technology for new products is the key strategy for staying ahead of the competition and keeping them differentiated,"" said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a national retail-consulting firm based in New York. ""As long as they have something that no one else has, then there's no price resistance. They can charge any price.""It doesn't hurt that the active sportswear business is doing very well right now. People don't just wear active sportswear in the gym. They now wear it for everyday use and some even wear it to work.While it might not make a splash at the Olympics, one of the company's most popular innovations has been a water-repellant sweatshirt.""Consumers say the products are almost indestructible and they have almost no quality complaints,"" said Britt Beemer, the founder of America's Research Group, a consumer behavior research firm in Charleston, S.C. ""And they like that it maintains its original color and original fit compared to some other brands.""Innovative products create a strong foundation for the business, but when you're competing against giants like Nike (NKE), Adidas and North Face, innovative marketing needs to be a big part of the equation. The company has endorsement deals with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Stephan Curry, a point guard for the NBA's Golden State Warriors.Under Armour outfits all the varsity athletic teams at 13 Division I universities, such as Notre Dame and the U.S. Naval Academy. It's also supplying uniforms and training outfits to the U.S. Olympic teams for speedskating, bobsled and skeleton.While endorsements capture the hearts and minds of young consumers, the key thing is grabbing their attention when they're ready to spend. Under Armour has kicked up its marketing with a strategy it calls ""shop-in-shop.""The company is taking anywhere from 2,000 square feet to 3,500 square feet to create boutique shops in Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) stores and the Sports Authority. In addition to providing a full range of Under Armour products in a wide selection of styles and colors, it aims to create a unique environment with digital screens, digital content, and other features.""Under Armour has said if you only show a little bit of it, it won't sell,"" said Beemer. ""You need massive displays to show the brand's importance and show the color selection.""

The Provo, Utah-based company, along with Herbalife, has come under fire for its direct-seller business model.But Nu Skin's earnings continue to post healthy gains and soared by 107% in Q3. Revenue in greater China jumped 240%.Earlier this month, Zacks upgraded the company to a strong buy as Nu Skin expects 2014 EPS to grow by 25%-30%, though the midpoint is below analysts' estimates.Nu Skin is also on IBD's Leaderboard list of top-rated stocks and hopes are rising for the company's new ageLOC TR90 weight management system.Herbalife's weight-loss and nutritional supplements have helped the company climb to No. 7 on the IBD 50. Recent news has also weakened accusations from activist investor Bill Ackman that the company is a pyramid scheme — a charge Herbalife denies.Earlier this month, a Belgian appeals court overturned a lower court's ruling that Herbalife operated a pyramid scheme, saying the sales model is in full compliance with the law.And last week, shares soared after Herbalife said new auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers rechecked financial records for fiscal years 2010, 2011, 2012 and part of 2013 and found no material changes.A sure-fire way to stay healthy is to exercise more. And Under Armour, ranked No. 16 on the IBD 50, provides workout clothing and accessories to help people stay in shape.Offerings from the apparel maker include shirts and pants made from moisture-wicking fabric designed to keep you warmer or cooler for longer.The company has been trying to compete with Lululemon Athletica (LULU) by offering more designs for women and endorsing skier Lindsey Vonn.Under Armour shares continue to trade above their 50-day line while athletic gear rival Nike (NKE) has fallen on lower-than-expected sales.A better you is about smarts as well as looks.

2425,UA,"Even when a base pattern has good characteristics, it could still be flawed if it doesn't have the right physical framework.That's because in stock charts, shape matters. In most cases the smooth-looking base wins over the jagged one.What exactly does this mean?In stock charts, it's the way the price bars are formed that can tell investors if the base is right or wrong. This goes beyond simply checking if the decline in the base is too deep (a fault) or too narrow in length (also a fault).A well-formed base has smooth contours and symmetry. It lacks the problematic shapes of weak bases, namely wide-and-loose price action or awkward-looking formations. For example, a sharp decline at the start of the base followed by a slow recovery would give a base an asymmetrical look.When a cup base shows symmetry, the stock tends to take a roughly equal number of weeks to form the left side as it did to form the right side.The well-ironed base shows the stock is in steady hands — institutional investors who are fairly committed to it. Wild bases indicate uncertainty in the market about the stock, and often a shortage of high-quality institutional sponsorship.To illustrate the proper shape of a base, let's break down an example of a good base vs. a bad one.From September to mid-January, Tableau Software (DATA) formed one of the cleanest-looking cup bases in a while. It had a reasonably shallow correction of 24%. It was easy to draw a curved line along the four-month pattern. Many weeks of the base had small price swings. The left side of the base was nine weeks long vs. 10 on the right side.This base showed smooth trading action.Tableau, which makes enterprise software to help analyze mounds of data, broke out Jan. 16 from a short handle and has soared as much as 42% from the 71.88 buy point.By comparison, athletic apparel firm Under Armour (UA) formed a clunky base in 2011 that had its share of faults. Although it had the rough shape of a cup with handle, the pattern was volatile, with large weekly price swings.That gave the base a sharp-edged V-shape. The handle was volatile as well. Its 23% correction from the handle high of 80.80 was excessively deep.Under Armour made barely an 8% gain from its breakout at 40.50 before it started correcting again. Its later bases were better crafted and resulted in much stronger gains than the crumpled mess of July-October 2011.

2501,UA,"Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.
"
2502,UA,"IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?
"
2503,UA,"Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.
"
2504,UA,"We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.
"
2505,UA,"IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?
"
2506,UA,"Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.
"
2507,UA,"Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.
"
2508,UA,"When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.
"
2509,UA,"The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.
"
2510,UA,"IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?
"
2511,UA,"Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.
"
2512,UA,"We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.
"
2513,UA,"IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?
"
2514,UA,"Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.
"
2515,UA,"Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.
"
2516,UA,"Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.
"
2517,UA,"They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.
"
2518,UA,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?
"
2519,UA,"Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.
"
2520,UA,"They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.
"
2521,UA,"They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.
"
2522,UA,"IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?
"
2523,UA,"Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.
"
2524,UA,"They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.
"
2525,UA,"Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.
"
2526,UA,"They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.
"
2527,UA,"IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?
"
2528,UA,"Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.
"
2529,UA,"They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.
"
2530,UA,"Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.
"
2531,UA,"IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?
"
2532,UA,"Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.
"
2533,UA,"Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.
"
2534,UA,"They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.
"
2535,UA,"IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?
"
2536,UA,"Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.
"
2537,UA,"So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.
"
2538,UA,"IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?
"
2539,UA,"Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.
"
2540,UA,"This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.
"
2541,UA,"IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?
"
2542,UA,"Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.
"
2543,UA,"The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.
"
2544,UA,"IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?
"
2545,UA,"Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.
"
2546,UA,"They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.
"
2547,UA,"IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?
"
2548,UA,"Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.
"
2549,UA,"In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.
"
2550,UA,"IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?
"
2551,UA,"Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.
"
2552,UA,"Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.
"
2553,UA,"Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.
"
2554,UA,"IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.
"
2555,UA,"Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.
"
2556,UA,"They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap .

Factory House sells its products directly to consumers, which enables it to control its inventory.

"
2787,UA,"It's all a little worrisome for analysts who are concerned Lululemon is still too reliant on the fashion whims of fickle consumers.
"
2788,UA,"But defenders of the company say there's much more to the story than that. They point to Lululemon's design, technology and operational prowess as proof that it is well positioned for the long haul.
"
2789,UA,"""Too many people still view Lululemon as a hot fashion fad,"" said John Kernan, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""But their store economics are as good as anyone in retail. They are phenomenal operators. They make one of the most unique, technically innovative products in the U.S. in terms of design, fit and functionality. They are much more than just a fashion brand.""
"
2790,UA,"On the design side, Lululemon has built a reputation for its innovative use of fabrics and technology, he says.
"
2791,UA,"The company's Luon fabric is designed to wick away moisture, move with the body and reduce irritation. Its Silverescent brand incorporates silver directly into the fabric to reduce odors.
"
2792,UA,"The popularity of these and other brands has helped Lululemon become one of the fastest-growing names in the specialty retail sector. It finished fiscal 2011 with 174 stores, up from 133 at the beginning of the year. Analysts reckon that number can eventually grow to more than 600.
"
2793,UA,"In addition to growing its store count, Lululemon has also improved its operating efficiency. Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 rose 20% from the prior year on a constant dollar basis. The company logged a record $2,004 in sales per square foot for the year.
"
2794,UA,"""It is clear that Lululemon's customer base is rapidly growing, and new product flows are very well received,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Andrew Burns noted in a report following Lululemon's fourth-quarter earnings release.
"
2795,UA,"Lululemon earned 51 cents a share for the quarter. That was up 59% from the prior year. Sales climbed 51% to $371.5 million. Analysts had forecast Q4 earnings of 49 cents a share on sales of $360.45 million.
"
2796,UA,"Same-store sales rose 26% for the fourth quarter vs. a 15% rise the prior quarter.
"

2807,UA,"Lululemon is slated to report fiscal first-quarter earnings May 22. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect profit of 30 cents a share, up from 22 cents the prior year.By most accounts, the practice of yoga dates back 5,000 years or so. You could hardly call it a ""fad.""Still, some folks insist that yoga's popularity over the past couple of decades owes more to trendy lifestyle choices than any fundamental shift in the way humans view health and exercise.Soon enough, the thinking goes, legions of yoga practitioners will grow bored with it all and trade in their pricey yoga clothes and accessories for something else.That's one reason some retail watchers remain cautious about the feverish growth of Lululemon Athletica (LULU), a leading designer of high-end yoga and athletic apparel.The company has run off nine straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth. It passed $1 billion in annual revenue last year, up from $453 million only two years earlier.Its stock price has more than doubled over the past 14 months and recently hit a record high of 77.13.Now, Lululemon has plans to launch an aggressive international growth campaign that would more than triple its current store count.Fashion WhimsIt's all a little worrisome for analysts who are concerned Lululemon is still too reliant on the fashion whims of fickle consumers.But defenders of the company say there's much more to the story than that. They point to Lululemon's design, technology and operational prowess as proof that it is well positioned for the long haul.""Too many people still view Lululemon as a hot fashion fad,"" said John Kernan, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""But their store economics are as good as anyone in retail. They are phenomenal operators. They make one of the most unique, technically innovative products in the U.S. in terms of design, fit and functionality. They are much more than just a fashion brand.""On the design side, Lululemon has built a reputation for its innovative use of fabrics and technology, he says.The company's Luon fabric is designed to wick away moisture, move with the body and reduce irritation. Its Silverescent brand incorporates silver directly into the fabric to reduce odors.The popularity of these and other brands has helped Lululemon become one of the fastest-growing names in the specialty retail sector. It finished fiscal 2011 with 174 stores, up from 133 at the beginning of the year. Analysts reckon that number can eventually grow to more than 600.In addition to growing its store count, Lululemon has also improved its operating efficiency. Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 rose 20% from the prior year on a constant dollar basis. The company logged a record $2,004 in sales per square foot for the year.""It is clear that Lululemon's customer base is rapidly growing, and new product flows are very well received,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Andrew Burns noted in a report following Lululemon's fourth-quarter earnings release.Lululemon earned 51 cents a share for the quarter. That was up 59% from the prior year. Sales climbed 51% to $371.5 million. Analysts had forecast Q4 earnings of 49 cents a share on sales of $360.45 million.Same-store sales rose 26% for the fourth quarter vs. a 15% rise the prior quarter.Direct-to-consumer sales more than doubled to $50.1 million, reflecting Lululemon's aggressive e-commerce push.""Management is still intently focused on increasing productivity of existing stores through better supply chain management and overall flow of goods,"" noted Claire Gallacher, an analyst at Auriga USA.Premium Price PointLululemon faces competition from some pretty high-profile names, including Under Armour (UA), Gap (GPS) and Nike (NKE) .

2870,UA,"Jonathan Grassi, a senior retail analyst at Cleveland-based Longbow Research, credited Under Armour's growth to four factors: a spike in apparel sales, growth in footwear sales, e-commerce and developing Factory House, a chain of 89 company-owned stores of which 84 are factory outlets. Factory House sells its products directly to consumers, which enables it to control its inventory.

2873,UA,"An example of Under Armour's marketing hoopla was a June 20 event in New York City where founder/CEO Kevin Plank, surrounded by its roster of sports stars including Super Bowl winner Tom Brady, Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn and NBA player Kemba Walker, introduced Spine, a new sneaker. It weighs 9.7 ounces. The sneaker will start selling as a running shoe and then branch out into basketball, football and baseball.

Another product, Under Armour's Cold Black T-shirts, are infused with a chemical that reflects sunlight and cuts the wearing temperature by seven degrees.
"
2878,UA,"In footwear sales, Under Armour faces stiffer going because many runners are loyal to the Nike, Adidas or Reebok (owned by Adidas) brands. To develop its sneakers line, Under Armour poached Gene McCarthy, currently its senior vice president of Footwear, from Nike in 2009.
"
2879,UA,"To compete, Under Armour introduced the running shoe Split II in 2011, which has been a solid seller, and RC Charge, a lightweight, high-end running shoe. But it has a ways to catch up to Nike, which holds 42% of the $14 billion U.S. athletic footwear market vs. Under Armour's 1%.

3002,UA,"While it's obvious to investors that the current market uptrend has shown impressive strength for three months, perhaps less obvious is the fact that the consumer goods and retail sectors have been a big driver of the move.That is, unless you have been carefully monitoring both the charts on the Stock Spotlight page and the top rungs of IBD's 197 industry groups.As of Thursday's IBD, those ranked in the top 40 include Leisure-Products (No. 9), Retail-Home Furnishings (No. 15) and Retail-Leisure Products (No. 29). Decades of IBD research shows that most of the greatest winners in bull markets hail from an industry group or broad sector that's leaving its peers in the dust.Many top consumer-related companies are already extended from proper buy points. That doesn't mean you should ignore them. It's better to grab shares in a true market leader on a secondary or even tertiary buy opportunity than to buy a laggard that's trying to break out late in the rally.Apple (AAPL) is part of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group, but it has skintight ties to the consumer and leisure sector. The digital computing and entertainment juggernaut is well extended from its 427.85 cup-with-handle buy point. Watch for a potential pullback to the 10-week line or a new base to form.Select Comfort (SCSS), a bed maker and operator of bed mattress stores, is a leader within the Retail-Home Furnishings industry group. Its Composite Rating is a maximum 99. Earnings per share rose 62% or better five quarters in a row.

Revenue is expected to rise 17% to $410.4 million.Apple (AAPL) climbed back into positive territory, gaining nearly 1% ahead of its fiscal Q3 results after the close.

"
3012,UA,"Soon enough, the thinking goes, legions of yoga practitioners will grow bored with it all and trade in their pricey yoga clothes and accessories for something else.

3017,UA,"Fashion Whims
"
3018,UA,"It's all a little worrisome for analysts who are concerned Lululemon is still too reliant on the fashion whims of fickle consumers.
"
3019,UA,"But defenders of the company say there's much more to the story than that. They point to Lululemon's design, technology and operational prowess as proof that it is well positioned for the long haul.
"
3020,UA,"""Too many people still view Lululemon as a hot fashion fad,"" said John Kernan, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""But their store economics are as good as anyone in retail. They are phenomenal operators. They make one of the most unique, technically innovative products in the U.S. in terms of design, fit and functionality. They are much more than just a fashion brand.""
"
3021,UA,"On the design side, Lululemon has built a reputation for its innovative use of fabrics and technology, he says.
"
3022,UA,"The company's Luon fabric is designed to wick away moisture, move with the body and reduce irritation. Its Silverescent brand incorporates silver directly into the fabric to reduce odors.
"
3023,UA,"The popularity of these and other brands has helped Lululemon become one of the fastest-growing names in the specialty retail sector. It finished fiscal 2011 with 174 stores, up from 133 at the beginning of the year. Analysts reckon that number can eventually grow to more than 600.
"
3024,UA,"In addition to growing its store count, Lululemon has also improved its operating efficiency. Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 rose 20% from the prior year on a constant dollar basis. The company logged a record $2,004 in sales per square foot for the year.

3032,UA,"""There is competition, but Lululemon's rivals still haven't figured out how to compete in the premium price point,"" Kernan said.
"
3033,UA,"The challenge now is duplicating that success on a much larger scale. The vast majority of Lululemon's current stores are located in North America. Analysts figure the company can get to 300-plus stores in North America and an equal amount in international markets.
"
3034,UA,"Lululemon's international growth plan was a hot topic of discussion during a recent investors day, analyst Gallacher noted. ""We believe the focus of investors shifted to the next avenues of growth rather than inquiring about the sustainability of the brand.""
"
3035,UA,"Lululemon has opened showrooms in London and Hong Kong this year that ""could convert to permanent stores,"" Gallacher said. In addition to the U.K. and China, likely international growth markets include Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Western Europe.

"
3252,UA,"John Del Vecchio co-manages the ETF.
"
3253,UA,"IBD: What does your shorting strategy entail?
"
3254,UA,"Del Vecchio: We identify companies where we think management is either aggressive in their accounting or using the financials to paste over a deterioration in their business to make revenue, earnings and cash flow look better than they truly are on a sustainable basis. We focus on individual companies that we expect will have an earnings-driven event, such as a shortfall to expectations or reduced guidance.
"
3255,UA,"In addition, we look at technical factors such as investor sentiment, volume, market breadth and other indicators to decide how aggressively we want to be short and adjust our exposure accordingly.
"
3256,UA,"We are not an inverse fund nor tied to an index. We do not use leverage or derivatives of any kind.
"
3257,UA,"IBD: Can you provide some examples of how companies use aggressive accounting?
"
3258,UA,"Del Vecchio: The best example is a company that steals revenue from a future quarter by offering incentives to a customer to purchase a product today that they otherwise would purchase at a later date. This allows the company to book the revenue now rather than in a future quarter.
"
3259,UA,"Of course, now the company needs to find a new customer to replace the revenue they just pulled into the current quarter. If demand was strong for a company's products in the first place, management wouldn't engage in such activity.
"
3260,UA,"Another example is changing a revenue-recognition policy to artificially boost sales figures. One of our biggest shorts last year, Juniper Networks (JNPR), got caught up in a revenue recognition change that clearly overstated reported growth and created tougher comparisons in the future. Once that became evident, the stock price got hammered.
"
3261,UA,"IBD: From a valuation perspective, how do you determine that a stock is overpriced?
"
3262,UA,"Del Vecchio: Often the reported multiples, such as price-earnings ratio, do not reflect unsustainable sources of earnings, such as when a company understates an expense. So, the ""E"" is overstated making the stock look cheaper than it actually is. We attempt to determine how much of the reported earnings are coming from management massaging the numbers.
"
3263,UA,"Say a company earned $1.00 last year and Wall Street expects them to earn $1.20 this year. But, we determined that only $0.80 of last year's earnings were sustainable and high quality. Then, they have to grow 50% ($0.80 to $1.20 is a 50% increase) rather than 20% to meet expectations. If the sources of unsustainable earnings are very aggressive, such as accelerating revenue recognition, then chances are the stock is overvalued.
"
3264,UA,"Valuation alone, such as a P-E of 100, won't sink a stock. Often, what's overvalued gets more overvalued because momentum is a powerful force carrying stock prices higher.
"
3265,UA,"IBD: How long do you usually hold your short positions?
"
3266,UA,"Del Vecchio: The perfect scenario would be a one day holding period! However, we are not that smart or prescient. It's typically less than a year because once financial statement issues (age a year), they become less relevant.
"
3267,UA,"We never look out over, say, a five-year period and think that XYZ is going to go bankrupt. The longer you hold a short, the more things can go against you. My favorite ideas are held 12 months on average.
"
3268,UA,"IBD: You have many positions that have gone against you this year. For example Netflix (NFLX), Pulte Group (PHM), and Under Armour (UA) have rallied 46%, 34% and 33% year to date (as of April 16). How do you decide that you were wrong and close a position?
"
3269,UA,"Del Vecchio: Nothing works all at once and I'm notorious for being ""early."" I look at this two ways. First, if nothing has changed fundamentally, we will continue to hold a position. However, if price is really moving against us we will scale back our exposure significantly, and add back when the stock chart looks more bearish.
"
3270,UA,"We did this quite well with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) last year. The stock was a huge momentum play early in the year. We scaled way back and then quadrupled the position once warning signs on the chart started flashing.
"
3271,UA,"We have a profitable position in Netflix, while Under Armour and Pulte have indeed been painful thus far in 2012.
"
3272,UA,"IBD: HDGE is currently overweighted in consumer cyclicals and tech stocks. Why is that?
"
3273,UA,"Del Vecchio: For every winner in technology, there are 30 losers. Everyone talks about Google (GOOG), but where are the other search engines? So, technology is full of companies that will fail in particular because expectations are so high and investors get enamored with the glossy story behind the stock rather than looking at the financial statements.
"
3274,UA,"Consumer stocks are easier to figure out than any other sector because we are all consumers. I think that the consumer is stretched. Underemployment is still very high and if you get a new job, chances are you're making less money.
"
3275,UA,"Real incomes aren't growing. Who has money for a $200 pair of Ugg boots? Not too many people. So, when Deckers Outdoor (DECK) is bloated with inventory, it raises a red flag.If the market follows the ""sell in May and go away"" script this year, short sellers — who profit from falling shares — may start to outshine their peers.That could explain why investors have been flocking to AdvisorShares Active Bear ETF (HDGE), which only shorts stocks.

3361,UA,"How To Profit From MAKING MONEY: Tenth In A SeriesDolphins and tuna. You wouldn't mistake one for the other. Yet they do have a lot in common.They swim fast. They thrive in saltwater. They travel in groups. And they enrich our lives.Think of leading stocks in the same manner. Some big movers hail from the same industry, such as restaurants or semiconductors. They may battle head to head in the marketplace. Or they might serve discrete markets.Two restaurant stocks — or three — can all become highly profitable investments in part because the entire industry is hot. If profits and sales are rising at a fast clip, you can expect a whale of buying among the big investors in the market.Use the IBD Industry Themes column as a compass to locate these top industries and the stocks leading them.Speaking of industries, there's good reason why IBD slices and dices the stock market into 197 separate groups. The paper's research has found that up to nearly half of a big stock's move can be linked to the strength of its individual industry and broad sector.The column tracks the broad movements within the table too.In the Nov. 21, 2011, column, IBD highlighted Hibbett Sports (HIBB), a Birmingham, Ala.-based company that has taken Wal-Mart's small-town strategy into the sporting goods business.The column noted that in the July-ended fiscal second quarter, Hibbett grew earnings per share 50% on a 10% sales increase. That 50% jump followed a 250% EPS increase in the year-ago-quarter.At the time of this feature, Hibbett was on pace for a second straight weekly decline 1. But volume shrank, and the stock held above the 10-week moving average 2. The stock was simply pulling back after trying to clear a shaky, four-month cuplike base 3.Hibbett's chart improved the next month just as the market firmed up. Weeks of tight closes led to a new breakout from a four-week square box at 47.32 4. Weekly volume rose, a good sign. The stock has since rallied more than 10%.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA), also mentioned in the Nov. 21 column, have also led the current rally.

G-III (GIII), which makes Levi's, Guess and Kenneth Cole clothing under license, was down 3% to 35.91. Sports apparel maker Under Armour (UA) skidded 4.4% to 50.51.Shares of Michael Kors and G-III both closed below their 50-day moving average price, a negative technical indicator. Strong stocks tend to stay above that price mark, and will often bounce back up quickly when they dip to their 50-day moving average.The exact culprit for the sell-off wasn't clear, but several retailers, including giants Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) are forecasting weaker holiday sales.Many of the luxury brands in particular have been bullish on Europe in the past, despite recessions there. But earlier this week, watch and accessory maker Fossil (FOSL) missed views, citing a deteriorating situation on that continent.

"
3374,UA,"John Del Vecchio co-manages the ETF.
"
3375,UA,"IBD: What does your shorting strategy entail?
"
3376,UA,"Del Vecchio: We identify companies where we think management is either aggressive in their accounting or using the financials to paste over a deterioration in their business to make revenue, earnings and cash flow look better than they truly are on a sustainable basis. We focus on individual companies that we expect will have an earnings-driven event, such as a shortfall to expectations or reduced guidance.
"
3377,UA,"In addition, we look at technical factors such as investor sentiment, volume, market breadth and other indicators to decide how aggressively we want to be short and adjust our exposure accordingly.
"
3378,UA,"We are not an inverse fund nor tied to an index. We do not use leverage or derivatives of any kind.
"
3379,UA,"IBD: Can you provide some examples of how companies use aggressive accounting?
"
3380,UA,"Del Vecchio: The best example is a company that steals revenue from a future quarter by offering incentives to a customer to purchase a product today that they otherwise would purchase at a later date. This allows the company to book the revenue now rather than in a future quarter.
"
3381,UA,"Of course, now the company needs to find a new customer to replace the revenue they just pulled into the current quarter. If demand was strong for a company's products in the first place, management wouldn't engage in such activity.
"
3382,UA,"Another example is changing a revenue-recognition policy to artificially boost sales figures. One of our biggest shorts last year, Juniper Networks (JNPR), got caught up in a revenue recognition change that clearly overstated reported growth and created tougher comparisons in the future. Once that became evident, the stock price got hammered.
"
3383,UA,"IBD: From a valuation perspective, how do you determine that a stock is overpriced?
"
3384,UA,"Del Vecchio: Often the reported multiples, such as price-earnings ratio, do not reflect unsustainable sources of earnings, such as when a company understates an expense. So, the ""E"" is overstated making the stock look cheaper than it actually is. We attempt to determine how much of the reported earnings are coming from management massaging the numbers.
"
3385,UA,"Say a company earned $1.00 last year and Wall Street expects them to earn $1.20 this year. But, we determined that only $0.80 of last year's earnings were sustainable and high quality. Then, they have to grow 50% ($0.80 to $1.20 is a 50% increase) rather than 20% to meet expectations. If the sources of unsustainable earnings are very aggressive, such as accelerating revenue recognition, then chances are the stock is overvalued.
"
3386,UA,"Valuation alone, such as a P-E of 100, won't sink a stock. Often, what's overvalued gets more overvalued because momentum is a powerful force carrying stock prices higher.
"
3387,UA,"IBD: How long do you usually hold your short positions?
"
3388,UA,"Del Vecchio: The perfect scenario would be a one day holding period! However, we are not that smart or prescient. It's typically less than a year because once financial statement issues (age a year), they become less relevant.
"
3389,UA,"We never look out over, say, a five-year period and think that XYZ is going to go bankrupt. The longer you hold a short, the more things can go against you. My favorite ideas are held 12 months on average.
"
3390,UA,"IBD: You have many positions that have gone against you this year. For example Netflix (NFLX), Pulte Group (PHM), and Under Armour (UA) have rallied 46%, 34% and 33% year to date (as of April 16). How do you decide that you were wrong and close a position?
"
3391,UA,"Del Vecchio: Nothing works all at once and I'm notorious for being ""early."" I look at this two ways. First, if nothing has changed fundamentally, we will continue to hold a position. However, if price is really moving against us we will scale back our exposure significantly, and add back when the stock chart looks more bearish.
"
3392,UA,"We did this quite well with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) last year. The stock was a huge momentum play early in the year. We scaled way back and then quadrupled the position once warning signs on the chart started flashing.
"
3393,UA,"We have a profitable position in Netflix, while Under Armour and Pulte have indeed been painful thus far in 2012.
"
3394,UA,"IBD: HDGE is currently overweighted in consumer cyclicals and tech stocks. Why is that?
"
3395,UA,"Del Vecchio: For every winner in technology, there are 30 losers. Everyone talks about Google (GOOG), but where are the other search engines? So, technology is full of companies that will fail in particular because expectations are so high and investors get enamored with the glossy story behind the stock rather than looking at the financial statements.
"
3396,UA,"Consumer stocks are easier to figure out than any other sector because we are all consumers. I think that the consumer is stretched. Underemployment is still very high and if you get a new job, chances are you're making less money.

3492,UA,"Everywhere you look there's an athlete on the go.
"
3493,UA,"Or so it seems from what people are wearing on the streets: running shoes, compression tees, bike shorts, yoga pants.
"
3494,UA,"The trend is a winner for a bunch of brands and the retailers that are scrambling to carry them or their own labels to meet demand.
"
3495,UA,"Active wear is the fastest growing apparel sector and performance wear is the fastest growing sub-segment, industry observers say.
"
3496,UA,"Overall active wear sales in the U.S. grew 9% in the 12 months ending in June, according to the NPD Group, to more than $30 billion.
"
3497,UA,"""Total apparel is growing 3.2% and women's apparel isn't growing much,"" said NPD Group chief retail analyst Marshal Cohen. ""So you can see why this is such a healthy business. Five percent growth is considered great growth; 9% is considered phenomenal .""
"
3498,UA,"Sporting apparel and footwear chains are natural-born players in the arena. And ""all of them, Lululemon (LULU), Hibbett (HIBB), Foot Locker (FL), are benefiting,"" said analyst Sam Poser of Sterne Agee.
"
3499,UA,"Mass-Market Niche Target
"
3500,UA,"So is Gap (GPS) with its fast-growing women's active wear concept Athleta, and Target (TGT) with its proprietary C9 by Champion line, soon to sport a standalone store in San Francisco.
"
3501,UA,"A number of mass-market and department store players also are trying to catch up by expanding assortments.
"
3502,UA,"""It's all about how good the product is and the product continues to improve,"" said Poser.
"
3503,UA,"Some major department stores have started carrying products from fast-growing performance brand Under Armour (UA),"" says Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners.
"
3504,UA,"""They know their customers are wearing the stuff,"" he said.
"
3505,UA,"Fabrics and fits are getting more technical and lighter to enhance performance, even if not all customers are training for marathons, triathlons, mud runs and adventure races.
"
3506,UA,"Fitness, But Fashion Too
"
3507,UA,"Enhancements include compression and wicking in apparel and lighter weights in running shoes, not to mention brighter colors, part of the new rule that products ought not to forget about fashion.
"
3508,UA,"""We support a high number of end uses, whether running, yoga, tennis, swimming,"" said Athleta's senior vice president and general manager, Scott Key, adding that a number of ""performance lifestyle"" items can be worn after workouts.
"
3509,UA,"""We put tremendous fashion sensibility into performance products,"" he said. ""Our customers want to look cute in them.""
"
3510,UA,"Gap opened 11 Athleta stores in the last quarter alone, more than any of its other concepts, and is about halfway to its goal of hitting 50 stores by the end of 2013. The first store opened two years ago.
"
3511,UA,"Key says Athleta is riding the wave of women's growing participation in sports and healthy living, and points to the Summer Olympic Games as evidence.
"
3512,UA,"""It was the first time at an Olympics that more women competed than men,"" Key said. ""They brought home 29 of the 46 medals for the U.S.""
"
3513,UA,"One of the medals went to the women's water polo team. Athleta was one of its sponsors, for the performance wear players used on land to prepare for the pool.
"
3514,UA,"Women's active wear in the U.S. grew faster than men's in the last year, with $13.7 billion in sales to men's $12.7 billion, says NPD Group. Children's, a smaller part of the pie, grew even faster.
"
3515,UA,"Some say Athleta is running after Lululemon, a hot concept from Canada expanding on U.S. turf. It's staked a claim in pricey yoga pants and other workout gear of its own design.
"
3516,UA,"Lululemon sales jumped 53% to $285.7 million in the quarter ending April 29 vs. a year earlier, with same-store sales up 25%. Athleta has not disclosed sales, but Johnson thinks they're growing more than 40%.
"
3517,UA,"""Both are doing well. Athleta has a little bit of a broader appeal. It doesn't take itself quite as seriously as Lululemon,"" he said.
"
3518,UA,"Generalists such as Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Hibbett play the field with a broad array of fitness apparel and footwear from popular brands such as Nike (NKE), Reebok's Adidas, Under Armour and North Face, a unit of VF Corp (VCF).
"
3519,UA,"At the Summer Games, logos of active wear brands were as much on display as the athletes. Adidas got a lot of mileage when the stylish Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton showed up in Adidas Team GB attire, including blazing red Adidas sneakers.
"
3520,UA,"U.S. sales of running shoes jumped 14.4% in the 12 months ended in June, to more than $4 billion, according to NPD.
"
3521,UA,"Dick's just opened its first standalone running store, True Runner, in Pittsburgh. It plans to open a second store in October.
"
3522,UA,"Since its 2004 launch, Target has expanded C9 by Champion into a $1 billion brand for families, adding performance products in expanded floor space.
"
3523,UA,"A premium women's line was launched last fall, followed by a men's premium line in the spring. They still sell for under $50 to keep true to Target's value focus.
"
3524,UA,"The brand's first stand-alone store — C9 Active Apparel — is set to open in October, on street level below a City Target store opening at San Francisco's Metreon complex.
"
3525,UA,"Target will take cues from customers before deciding whether to roll out other C9 stores, Thomas says.
"
3526,UA,"""C9 would allow Target to develop a free-standing, small-footprint strategy that could travel into any mall or strip center in America,"" said Dick Seesel, principal of Retailing In Focus. ""To me it signals it's a business they clearly believe in.""
"
3527,UA,"Kohl's (KSS) active and fitness apparel were bright spots in an otherwise disappointing quarter, outperforming other areas, thanks to robust sales of Nike, Adidas and proprietary brands Fila Sport and Tek Gear.
"
3528,UA,"Not to be left behind, Wal-Mart (WMT) is carrying more performance wear, Johnson says, ""But it's not as far along as Target.""
"
3529,UA,"While Target has carried C9 since 2004, Gap acquired Athleta in 2008, when it was a catalog company with a long and loyal following.
"
3530,UA,"Gap expanded the brand online and opened the first store in 2010. Boston's recent opening was the 23rd.
"
3531,UA,"Athleta products are designed in-house by women who also happen to be athletes. They often test run them on trails near their offices in Petaluma, Calif., a 45-minute drive north of Gap's San Francisco headquarters.
"
3532,UA,"Will fatigue in the category set in as players try to keep pace with past milestones?
"
3533,UA,"Analysts say the cycle still has plenty of room to run. But the category could get more crowded.

3604,UA,"Wells Fargo Advantage Emerging Growth Fund is among the top performing U.S. stock funds since 2010's market bottom in August.
"
3605,UA,"The $872 million portfolio's outperformance stems in large part from a solid 2010. Its 31.78% gain more than doubled the broad market's 15.06% and beat the 26.98% score posted by its small-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar.
"
3606,UA,"Its 4.95% gain in 2011 topped its peers' -3.55% average and the S&P 500's 2.11% gain.
"
3607,UA,"The fund has done that by aiming for small caps with a multiyear growth cycle in front of them.
"
3608,UA,"Co-lead managers Thomas Ognar, age 41, and Joseph Eberhardy, 44, along with 51-year-old manager Bruce Olson discussed their strategy with IBD from their offices in Menomonee Falls, Wis.
"
3609,UA,"IBD: Many investors are looking for companies with the resources to weather a stormy market and with little European exposure. That leads them to large U.S. multinationals. As small-cap investors, how are you coping?
"
3610,UA,"Olson: To be effective and analyze companies and try to model their growth going forward, we need to take account of market environments.
"
3611,UA,"But we don't think of the world first from a macro perspective. We look for companies like LogMeIn (LOGM), which provides on-demand remote connectivity software. Once we identify it as a growth company with the characteristics we want, we ask how the macro environment can impact its growth. Is it factored into its stock price?
"
3612,UA,"We look for stocks with a gap between what we think a company's value is given its growth prospects and where the stock price is.
"
3613,UA,"When there's at least a 20% upside to where it should be valued in perhaps one year, that's a stock we want if it shows the other characteristics we want.
"
3614,UA,"IBD: That underappreciation is one of three characteristics you seek, right?
"
3615,UA,"Olson: Correct. We look for smaller, new, faster growing companies with three characteristics.
"
3616,UA,"One is a robust growth, in the top 25% of cash flow and earnings in its industry.
"
3617,UA,"It must be at least 10% annual revenue and earnings growth.
"
3618,UA,"Second is growth that is sustainable. It can do that by creating a new market or taking market share. It can have a differentiated product or service that can continually grow at least 10% annually.
"
3619,UA,"And third is that 20% upside.
"
3620,UA,"IBD: But what about the danger of investing in small caps when many investors are tilting towards large caps?
"
3621,UA,"Olson: Smaller caps can be more volatile. We just try to take advantage of that volatility. We look for those gaps between price and potential.
"
3622,UA,"IBD: So have you been buying and adding to names you like as they pull back?
"
3623,UA,"Olson: We do put money to work in volatile periods. One thing (shareholders) should realize is that U.S. corporations, if you look at their cash as a percentage of assets, is at an all-time high, going back 50 years. And corporations are using that cash.
"
3624,UA,"It is being deployed in smaller companies like Brigham Exploration (BEXP) (being acquired by Statoil (STO), NetLogic Microsystems (NETL) (being acquired by Broadcom (BRCM) and SonoSite (SONO) (being acquired by Fujifilm Holdings). Big companies put that cash into faster growing assets, which a lot of times are stocks that we've invested in. So small caps can benefit from how large caps redeploy their cash through M&A activity.
"
3625,UA,"IBD: Do you wear blinders to limit your vision just to small caps?
"
3626,UA,"Ognar: We've found that doing research on mid and large caps helps us with small caps.
"
3627,UA,"To be good investors in small caps like Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) or Hibbett Sports (HIBB) or Life Time Fitness (LTM), we have to research Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and Wal-Mart (WMT). And we can own either in our multicap fund ($7.2 billion Wells Fargo Advantage Growth .
"
3628,UA,"IBD: I know you are bottom-up investors and do not invest based on sectors. Yet sector weights show where you expect to find leaders. Tech is still your largest sector. Through the 12 months ended Sept. 30 your weighting declined 11 percentage points to 24%. Mostly price action, or mostly sells?
"
3629,UA,"Olson: Both. When we take out assets, it's to deploy them into better ideas.
"
3630,UA,"IBD: Your weightings increased by about 5% in health care and 4% in industrials.
"
3631,UA,"Eberhardy: We look at the world bottom-up. When we see that valuation gap widen in names we like, we redeploy our cash.
"
3632,UA,"IBD: Akorn (AKRX) is a health name that you added to as of your latest disclosure. Sales have accelerated for two quarters. What's your thesis?
"
3633,UA,"Eberhardy: They focus on ophthalmology and hospital injectables, primarily generics. The main thesis is that this is an underappreciated name. The market has missed the fact that they have 27 abbreviated new product applications. That's a big pipeline. It shows what's before the FDA and has a chance to be approved.
"
3634,UA,"Those address about a $3 billion branded market. The company also plans to go into the private label ophthalmology market.
"
3635,UA,"And there's an underappreciated shortage of generic injectable drugs, due to manufacturing delays at some larger players like Hospira (HSP). So we believe Akorn is a 25% to 30% annual top line grower. It should have expanding margins, so it should get in excess of that on the bottom line.
"
3636,UA,"IBD: Zoll Medical (ZOLL) is another health name you added to. Return on equity jumped to 9.3% in 2011 from 6.4% the year before. What do you like here?
"
3637,UA,"Eberhardy: They have one main product, the LifeVest. It's a wearable defibrillator, which a patient can use while waiting to get an implantable cardiac defibrillator.
"
3638,UA,"There have been rule changes that the waiting period (during which a patient wears LifeVest while his doctor assesses his risk for sudden cardiac arrest and develops a treatment strategy) should be extended, and LifeVest is at the forefront of taking advantage of that.
"
3639,UA,"IBD: You added to your stake in Chart Industries (GTLS), an industrial. Sales growth has accelerated for six quarters. Earnings per share have grown at a triple-digit pace for three quarters but are decelerating. Your thoughts?
"
3640,UA,"Eberhardy: They're the leading manufacturer of equipment used in processing and storage of industrial gases and liquefied natural gas.
"
3641,UA,"There's a secular movement toward more use of LNG. This company is at the forefront of providing infrastructure for that distribution.
"
3642,UA,"Also, LNG is being used more as a fuel for transportation overseas.
"
3643,UA,"And here in the U.S. there is a big difference between the cost of producing gas and what it can be sold for overseas.
"
3644,UA,"IBD: Is Tractor Supply  (TSCO) doing well because it caters to people who ranch and farm more for fun than profit?
"
3645,UA,"Ognar: They don't sell to farmers. Their end market is more like the rural enthusiast, who has 10 acres, farms a little, has a horse and enjoys the rural lifestyle.
"
3646,UA,"They have an opportunity to double their store base. They're just starting to expand into the Western U.S. They've done a lot of productive things, from better merchandising, better inventory and distribution management — which are resulting in better sales experiences at stores — and (better) profitability and earnings.

"
3662,UA,"Big Apple, Big Plan
"
3663,UA,"After six years of struggle, Pickford vowed to be in a production on Broadway within a year or she would quit theater entirely. She set her sights on New York's top impresario, David Belasco.
"
3664,UA,"""Pickford spent most of the summer of 1907 sitting in his outer office on casting days, but went unnoticed,"" wrote Christel Schmidt, editor of a new assessment of her career, ""Mary Pickford: Queen of the Movies."" ""She decided to seek an introduction and approached the maid of one of his stars, receiving permission to use the star's name. She then caused such a fuss with the office boy that Belasco's manager came out to meet her.""
"
3665,UA,"When Belasco himself met with Pickford a few weeks later, he asked why she had chosen him. Her response: ""My mother always told me to aim high or not at all.""
"
3666,UA,"Charmed by her chutzpah, he cast her in a supporting role and chose her stage name.
"
3667,UA,"Pickford's early lesson is that persistence beyond reason will pay off.
"
3668,UA,"In 1909, director D.W. Griffith gave Pickford a screen test and was impressed by her grasp of a more intimate type of acting for the camera. He offered her the standard $5 per day, but in a show of brazen self-confidence, she insisted on double that and a guarantee of $40 a week — worth $1,000 today. The following year she traveled to Hollywood with Griffith's crew.
"
3669,UA,"""She was a naturalistic actor by instinct, feeling her way into character, at a time when broad gestures and melodramatic expressions were common,"" wrote Molly Haskell in the Schmidt volume. ""Director George Cukor said that Pickford invented screen acting and was the first method actress. In appearance alone, she ranges from the winsomely beautiful to the almost unrecognizably, even grotesquely plain. Then there are her amazingly varied incarnations: child, adolescent, and mother; she is a tomboy and coquette; the queen of Herzegovina and a cockney laundress; she is sweet, fierce and ingenious; she plays Spanish, French, Scottish, and even Asian.""
"
3670,UA,"Most of her movies — such as ""Tess of the Storm Country,"" ""The Poor Little Rich Girl,"" ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" and ""Stella Maris"" — were hits. Initially, they didn't mention the names of the cast; even so, Pickford soon became a household name.
"
3671,UA,"In 1916 she signed an unprecedented contract with the Famous Players studio, giving her half the profits of the movies she starred in, with a guarantee of $500,000 a year (at a time when the average job in the U.S. paid $750), as well as a signing bonus of $300,000 — and $40,000 to compensate her and her mother for the month they spent negotiating the deal.
"
3672,UA,"She also received creative control of her films. ""Pickford had a reputation as a savvy negotiator who was able to survey the landscape of the industry, assess the value she brought to the endeavor and make sure she was compensated for her contributions,"" said Laura Isabel Serna, a professor at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. ""Over the course of her career during the silent period she pursued profitable partnerships with producers and other performers. She managed her own career and was constantly analyzing trends in the types of films audiences preferred and positioning herself to not only make money, but also shape the power of the star system in organizing an entire industry.""
"
3673,UA,"Pickford's lesson is to develop the self-confidence to demand what you deserve.
"
3674,UA,"Bonding With America
"
3675,UA,"In 1918, having become a passionate American citizen, Pickford did an exhausting tour of the U.S. to promote Liberty Bond sales for the World War I effort. She spoke to 50,000 people at one rally on Wall Street, and at a speech in Chicago she raised $5 million, worth $75 million today.
"
3676,UA,"The next year, Pickford, her boyfriend, actor Douglas Fairbanks; their best friend, actor Charlie Chaplin; and director Griffith formed United Artists. This was an independent production company devoted to letting filmmakers and actors work on projects the way they wanted and distribute movies in the optimum way. Prior to this, studios distributed pictures only to theaters they owned.
"
3677,UA,"The UA actors whom they regularly worked with shared their vision of artistic integrity and stayed loyal through the firm's financial ups and downs. Some of Pickford's top UA pictures were ""My Best Girl,"" ""Little Lord Fauntleroy,"" ""Sparrows"" and ""Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall.""
"
3678,UA,"In 1920, Pickford and Fairbanks married and went to Europe for their honeymoon, meeting a mob everywhere from Paris to Moscow.
"
3679,UA,"""They became the first celebrity supercouple; their movies spread American culture and values around the world and made them the nation's unofficial ambassadors,"" wrote Schmidt.
"
3680,UA,"In 1927, Pickford was one of three women and 33 men who founded the Academy to promote quality filmmaking. Today, one of its offices in Hollywood is the Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study.
"
3681,UA,"Hands-On
"
3682,UA,"Pickford became devoted to preservation of early films and spearheaded what is now the Motion Picture & Television Fund to help those in the industry in need.
"
3683,UA,"In late 1927, the first movie with sound, ""The Jazz Singer,"" debuted. Most stars and directors of the silent-movie era, including Pickford, were convinced it was a passing fad. Yet two years later she became one of the first stars to appear in a talkie. ""Coquette"" was a smash hit and earned her the Academy Award for best actress.
"
3684,UA,"Although she had an adequate voice for the new medium, her other sound picture efforts didn't do well at the box office.
"
3685,UA,"Many silent-film producers went under once they turned to sound. Stars from the old era also had trouble. ""Silent-film actors were expected to have the voices that the audience had imagined for them,"" said Whitfield. ""Much of the dialogue in the early talkies was inane or incoherent. Performers spoke with exaggerated diction and were victims of bad recordings. The artists of the silent era were masters of a different, now discarded, art form.""
"
3686,UA,"In 1933, Pickford divorced Fairbanks and retired from acting, having appeared in 236 films. She continued to produce for UA. One of her best returns came from the Marx brothers' ""Love Happy"" of 1949.
"
3687,UA,"She sold her remaining UA shares in 1959 for $3 million, worth $23 million today. Pickford pursued other ventures, including nationally syndicated radio programs, advice columns, writing books and a cosmetics company, as well as philanthropy. In 1976 the Academy honored her with its Lifetime Achievement award.
"
3688,UA,"In 2009, a documentary, ""Mary Pickford: The Muse of the Movies"" was released to acclaim.
"
3689,UA,"When Pickford died at 87, her estate was valued at $10 million, but may have been worth as much as $50 million, says Whitfield. Her charitable work is carried on by the Mary Pickford Foundation. The Mary Pickford Institute for Film Education won an award in 2012 for its use of digital technology.Mary Pickford was a dirt-poor theater actress of 17 when she made her silent-film debut in 1909.Through a combination of pioneering acting skills, savvy business sense and fierce determination, she became the most famous woman in the world within a decade on her way to building a filmmaking empire.Pickford co-founded the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, whose 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony was to be held Sunday. The Academy's late historian Robert Cushman called her ""the most popular, powerful, prominent and influential woman in the history of cinema.""Pickford (1892-1979) was born in Toronto as Gladys Marie Smith (her stage name would come from her mother's side of the family).Her father, an alcoholic, left the family when she was 3 and died three years later. Her mother could barely pay the bills with sewing and taking in boarders.At 7, Pickford won a part in a local theater production and soon became the family's breadwinner. Two younger siblings joined the stock company and, accompanied by their mother, toured Canada and America.""She shouldered the family cause with focus and ruthless efficiency,"" Eileen Whitfield, author of ""Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood,"" told IBD.

But Tuesday's action has failed to produce either event when examining a volatility spread like Monday's ATM November 75 / 77.5 strangle. 
"
3774,UA,"Priced yesterday for $7.55 on mid 50s implieds, the spread did expand in value, theoretically at least, during Tuesday's first half. Despite only sporadic participation we know this to be true as the call contract did trade up to $7.50 at session highs and just five cents short of the spread's entire value.

3775,UA,"At the same time, with a contract low in the put at $1.35, we can make a reasonable guesstimate the spread could have traded for about $9 and maybe even more had spectators become active players. Thus, some forward motion, hypothetically speaking, into the P&L, was there during the first half of play.

3776,UA,"Late Tuesday with UA near 79.75, any would-be strangle holders have lost a bit of ground with the spread now trading at $7.20 and implieds dropping a couple percent into the high 40s to low 50s. Overall, the loss of about 5% in the strangle is mild, given the surrounding circumstances.
"
3777,UA,"Bottom line, the combination of shares moving through one of the two strikes has been a benefit for the strangle but the price swing higher hasn't proven large enough to prevent a rather meager but easy-to-eyeball dip in implieds from pressuring the overall premium into a loss. And as today's game nears its conclusion, while wearing this kind of Under Armour protection is likely a bit of a letdown, this type of premium bull is a lot better off than if the offensive and defensive lines were still lined up at last night's closing line of scrimmage.

It may be getting hit by selling ahead of the Supreme Court's ruling on ObamaCare, a decision that's expected next week. Cerner was No. 24 in the IBD 50 as of Monday, but it fell out of the lineup Wednesday.Celgene (CELG) slid 11% in big turnover after the biotech said it had withdrawn its application seeking the use of Revlimid as a treatment of multiple myeloma. The company said it planned to resubmit at a later date with more mature data. Celgene has dropped further below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 90 out of a best-possible 99.Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) fell 17% in giant turnover. Late Wednesday, the home goods retailer said first-quarter earnings rose 24% to 89 cents, a nickel above forecasts. But a 5% gain in revenue to $2.22 billion fell just short of expectations. The company put Q2 EPS between 91 cents and $1.03, below forecasts for $1.08. The stock, which has a 93 Composite Rating, sliced through its 50-day and 200-day lines.Red Hat (RHT) dropped 6% in big trade. It was down as much as 9.7% in the early going. Late Wednesday, the Linux operating system-based software maker said Q1 EPS rose 25% to 30 cents, topping expectations. Revenue climbed 19% to $314.7 million, above estimates. But Red Hat reported its booked business, called billings, rose 16%. That was well below the prior quarter's 23% gain and below analyst expectations for a 20% to 22% gain. The company also guided sales for Q2 to $322 million or less. Analysts had expected $330.8 million. The stock dropped below its 50-day line. It had been working to build the right side of a possible base.Among new issues, Burger King Worldwide (BKW) tacked on 4%. The No. 2 fast-food chain began trading Wednesday on the NYSE and now stands about 8% past its opening price of 14.50. Burger King last traded as a public company from 2006 to 2010, then 3G Capital took it private. 3G has sold a 29% stake to U.K.-based Justice Holdings for $1.4 billion in cash, and 16% of those shares have been made available for outside investors to buy, as IBD noted in an article Wednesday.

That's in line with Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. The company's results got a boost from rising aluminum prices.Alcoa's report is important because it's the first, but the company is not a leader. Alcoa entered the report after 11 straight quarters of shrinking sales.On Tuesday, look for reports from chip giant Intel (INTC), outsourcer Infosys (INFY) and rail company CSX (CSX). The latter is expected to snap a four-period losing streak of negative profit and sales growth. But Intel, a bellwether among chipmakers, is expected to net 55 cents a share, a booming 267% improvement from Q1 of 2009.U.S. Stocks Close Modestly HigherBY PATRICK CAINStocks finished slightly higher Monday despite selling off in the final hour.The NYSE composite, Nasdaq and S&P; 500 added 0.2%. The Dow rose 0.1%, closing above 11,000 for the first time since September 2008. Volume was lower on the Nasdaq and up slightly on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.VanceInfo Technologies (VIT) gained 3% in more than double its normal trade.

4072,UA,"Yesterday before the opening bell, the first indictments and first conviction in the Russia collusion scandal in the 2016 U.S. presidential election helped pump the brakes on the extended bull-market rally. Trump’s former campaign manager and a long-time aide face 12 grand jury charges, while a low-level Trump campaign operative has already pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Stock market indexes closed lower Monday, following seven straight up weeks.Whether or not this becomes an albatross on the stock market depends greatly on one’s perspective: Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, in his latest Profit from the Pros column this morning, sees the Paul Manafort indictments as little more than a temporary distraction. Those who believe Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller is likely to end his investigation soon and has already exhausted his findings will likely feel the same way: nothing more than a blip, a market breather. Though there does seem to be a greater risk hovering that the Mueller investigation is not wrapping up but just beginning to unfold. If such is the case, market participants may be more trepidatious moving forward.Not today, though: futures for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all up in Halloween Tuesday’s pre-market. Far from being spooked, or fear of a “trick,” traders and investors are apparently looking for plenty of “treats.”With good reason, as well: while the Case-Shiller August home sales report is expected to bring 6% growth in U.S. home sales (this is a trailing indicator, but is considered to be the most sound housing data economists see regularly), the Paychex small-business report this morning demonstrates the most stable quarter in the history of the small business index. Though jobs growth has begun to slow, wage increases look to be keeping pace with economic growth. Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle were among the cities seeing the strongest small business growth.And jobs data is expected to be strong, both tomorrow with the private-sector ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) payroll report and Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Even with a hurricane-affected quarter, jobs growth is expected to remain robust, with unemployment remaining around a low-to-mid 4% range, indicative of a very strong domestic labor market.Q3 Earnings RoundupAfter the bell we expect to hear from U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), but ahead of the opening bell we see plenty of strength in Q3 performance:Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) outperformed earnings and revenue estimates, posting $1.34 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion topping the $1.23 per share and $3.3 billion expected. Quarterly sales rose 18% year over year, with higher switched transactions in the quarter and cross-border volumes up 15%. Shares are up 1.7% at this hour in the pre-market.BP (BP  -  Free Report) also trounced expectations, reporting 57 cents per share on $60.81 billion in quarterly sales, which easily beat the $8.04 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Oil production year over year was up 16.4%, and shares of BP rose 2.5% initially upon the quarterly news.Other earnings beats this morning include pharma giant Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and consumer staples major Kellogg (K), which both beat earnings expectations. Pfizer was in-line on its top-line, while Kellogg outperformed our consensus. Both stocks are trading up in today’s pre-market.Under Armour , however, is a much different story: although earnings of 22 cents per share beat estimates by 4 cents, quarterly sales posted a miss. More importantly, revenue and sales guidance were both pointed lower on lower North American demand and other operational challenges. UA stock, which had already fallen more than 40% year to date, are another 14.5% lower ahead of the opening bell.

4074,UA,"High profile U.S. retailers continue to report Q2 results in this final leg of earnings season: specialty retailers Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Coach  and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) all posted July quarter numbers ahead of today’s opening bell. Retail Sales for last month also hit the tape. Finally, more CEOs have resigned President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council this morning, following Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier’s departure yesterday in the wake of Trump’s initial response to the white supremacist rally over the weekend that claimed one life and several injuries.July Retail Sales came in hotter than expected this morning, rising 0.6% from the 0.3% expected. Perhaps even more telling, June’s revision swung from a disappointing negative to a decent positive: from -0.2% in the initial read to a revision of 0.3% this morning. Behind the headlines, ex-autos and ex-autos & gas were a strong 0.5%, with the control number 0.6%. These indicate real retail sales growth and not a one-time anomaly making its way into the headline number.These figures also satisfy those economists who’ve been scratching their heads of late, trying to figure out how a robust labor market, surging consumer confidence and other growth metrics all pointing higher while retail sales continued to lag. Now growth of more than a full percentage point over the past two months look to keep these folks from tearing up their models in despair.Home Depot outperformed expectations this morning, beating on the bottom line by 3 cents to $2.25 per share (up 14.2% year over year) on quarterly sales that reached $28.11 billion, easily outpacing the $27.84 billion in the Zacks consensus (up 6.2% year over year). The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-ranked home improvement giant cranked up guidance in sales (from 4.6% to 5.3%) and earnings (from 11% to 13%). Even still, HD shares are trading down slightly in today’s pre-market — potentially a “sell the news” scenario for a company that is up 15% year to date.Specialty handbag retailer Coach beat earnings and sales estimates for its fiscal Q2, but guidance was down and so is the stock in pre-market trading. Earnings of 50 cents per share beat expectations by a penny, on $1.33 billion in revenues which surpassed the $1.15 billion we were looking for. Yet Coach lowered full-year earnings down nearly a dime per share from previous estimates. The company expects the Kate Spade purchase to yield $1.2 billion by the end of the fiscal year.And Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated Dick’s Sporting Goods is selling off “big league” this morning following its Q2 earnings release. Bottom line was worse than expected by 4 cents from $1.00 per share expected, while sales were a smudge under the $2.17 billion in the Zacks consensus. Guidance for both sales and earnings in the full year have also been ratcheted down, and Dick’s shares are selling off after already having tumbled more than 30% this year.CEOs from both Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and UnderArmour  have given up their seats on President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council early today. Intel’s Brian Krzanich and UA’s Kevin Plank both cited tacit support from the White House toward separatists who rallied and attacked protestors in Charlottesville, VA on Saturday as the reason for their forfeiting their posts.President Trump has since stated publicly that “racism is evil, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.” It is unclear if these corporate leaders will attempt to be replaced. To this point, the President has not yet tweeted anything disparaging about either CEO.

4076,UA,"We get into the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with almost 800 companies reporting results, including 191 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have crossed the halfway mark in the Q1 reporting cycle, at least for the S&P 500 index, and will have a far clearer view of the overall earnings picture. But with results from almost of a quarter of the index’s total market capitalization already on the books, we have good enough sense of how this earnings season is unfolding.What we are finding is that not only is an above-average proportion of companies beating estimates, particularly revenue estimates, but growth is steadily accelerating from what we saw in the preceding quarter and on pace to reach its highest level in almost three years. Importantly, estimates for the current period (2017 Q2) appear to holding up nicely as well. Continuation of these trends through the rest of this earnings season should serve as a reassuring development for the market.As of Friday, April 21st, we have Q1 results from 95 S&P 500 members that combined account for 24.9% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up +14.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, with 72.6% beating EPS estimates and 62.1% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.6%.The table provides the current earnings season scorecard, as of April 21st, 2017.Comparing Q1 ResultsThe chart below provide a comparison of the results thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 95 S&P 500 members in other recent periods.As you can see, the Q1 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 95 index members in other recent periods. A big part of the strong growth at this stage is thanks to the Finance sector, but the growth comparison still remains favorable even on an ex-Finance basis. We will discuss the Finance sector’s performance a little later, but the comparison chart below (right-hand side chart) shows how the ex-Finance Q1 growth at this stage tracks above other recent periods.Positive Revenue SurprisesThe chart below compares the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises in Q1 thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 95 index members in other recent periods.The proportion of Q1 companies beating EPS estimates is about in-line with historical periods, but positive revenue surprises are more numerous. You can see the same in the chart below that compares the proportion of Q1 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates with other recent periods.Finance Sector ScorecardFor the Finance sector, we now have Q1 results from 28 of the sector’s 94 companies that combined account for 48.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the index. Total earnings for these 28 Finance sector companies are up +23.0% from the same period last year on +7.7% higher revenues, with all 71.4% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating top-line estimates.This is better earnings growth than we have seen from the same group of 28 banks in other recent periods, which is having a favorable impact on the aggregate Q1 growth expectation for the sector as a whole. The chart below compares the growth pace (earnings and revenue) and proportion of positive surprises for these 28 banks with what we saw from this same group of companies in other recent periods.Total Q1 earnings for the Finance sector as a whole, combining the reported actuals with the still-to-come estimates, are expected to be up +14.8% from the same period last year. The table below shows the sector’s Q1 earnings growth expectations at the medium-industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding four periods.Please note that the Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and others are part, accounts for roughly 45% of the sector’s total earnings (insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor, accounting for about 25% of the total).Key Earnings Reports for the Week of April 24thWe are into the heart of the earnings season this week, with 191 S&P 500 members reporting results. The major reports this week include:Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) – Coke comes out with quarterly results before the market’s open on Tuesday April 25th, a very busy day on the reporting cycle with 44 S&P 500 members reporting quarterly results today (of which 27 are in the morning). The company is expected to earn $0.44 per share on $8.97 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of -2.7% and -12.7%, respectively. The stock has lagged the Zacks Consumer Staples sector as well as the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date as well as trailing 12-month periods on lingering questions about the company’s bottler refranchising strategy and outlook for the business. The stock is up +3.7% since the start of the year, but is down -3.4% over the past 12 months. Guidance and management outlook will determine how the stock reacts to this earnings report; Coke beat EPS and revenue estimates in the preceding quarter, but the stock was down in response on soft guidance.Caterpillar (CAT) – Caterpillar is another major company reporting before the market’s open on Tuesday April 25th, with the mining and construction equipment maker expected to earn $0.62 per share on $9.36 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year declines of -7.8% and -1.1%, respectively. Estimates have been trending up in recent days, with the current $0.62 per share estimate up from $0.53 per share a month back. Driving estimates higher is the expectation of an improving demand outlook for construction equipment on dissipating oil and gas industry headwinds and hopes of Trump infrastructure spending. The stock hasn’t done much despite this improving earnings picture; it has lagged the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the S&P 500 index this year – the stock is up +1.5% in the year-to-date period vs. +4.1% for the sector and +5.2% for the S&P 500 index. This stock market performance puts the spotlight on this earnings report, with management’s outlook for the end-markets as the key catalyst.DuPont (DD), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and AT&T (T  -  Free Report) are some of the other major companies reporting results on Tuesday April 25th.Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) – Proctor & Gamble is one of the major companies reporting results before the market’s open on Wednesday April 26th when a total of 50 index members will be coming out with quarterly reports (of which 27 will come out in the morning). The company is expected report $0.94 per share on $15.68 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +8.8% and -0.5%, respectively. The revisions trend has been positive, though the Zacks EPS estimate for the quarter hasn’t moved up by much in recent days. The stock has modestly done better than the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date period (+6% vs. +5.2%), though it has lagged the Zacks Consumer Staples sector (+7%). Management’s guidance about organic growth and trends in the men’s razors/blades market where it faces tough competition from Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club.Boeing (BA) – Boeing reports Q1 results before the market’s open on Wednesday April 26th, with the company expected to earn $1.91 per share on $21.44 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10% and -5.3%, respectively. Analysts have lowered their estimates for the quarter, with the current $1.91 EPS estimate down from $2.03 a month back, with the negative revisions reflecting delayed commercial aircraft shipments, leaving full-year estimates unchanged. The stock has done really well lately; it is up +16% this year, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace/Defense sector (up +7.5%) and the S&P 500 (up +5.2%). The stock was up big following the last earnings release when management offered positive cash flow guidance, which will most likely get reiterated in this earnings report.Amazon (AMZN) – Amazon isn’t the only major company reporting results on Thursday April 27th; it is one of 67 S&P 500 members reporting this day (of which 41 are in the morning). We actually have a who’s who of top-tier operators coming out with results after the market’s close at the same time with Amazon, including Google’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report). Under Armour , Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) and Ford (F) are some of the major operators reporting results before the market’s open.Amazon is expected to earn $1.05 per share on $35.4 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of -2.3% and +21.5%, respectively. Amazon always gives the impression of not caring about short-term profitability metrics, though it came out with strong EPS beats in the last two earnings reports and the stock was up big following each of those releases. The company’s cloud business, the Amazon Web Services, has emerged as a big growth driver lately and performance in that business will be key to the stock’s performance following this earnings report as well. Given the stock’s recent performance (up +20% year-to-date vs. +9.2% gain for the Zacks Retail sector and +5.2% for the S&P 500 index), expectations appear on the high side, leaving the stock vulnerable to a disappointment.Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX) are the notable reports on Friday April 28th.Expectations for Q1 As a WholeTotal Q1 earnings are expected to be up +9.1% from the same period last year on +6.0% higher revenues. This would follow +7.4% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.8%, the highest growth pace in all most two years.The table below shows the summary picture for Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q4.Please note that the Q1 earnings season follows the strong showing on the earnings front in the preceding reporting cycle. Not only did 2016 Q4 growth reach the highest in two years, but total earnings for the quarter also reached a new quarterly record. The strong Q4 performance came after the first positive earnings growth in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters.The chart below shows the Q1 earnings growth contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to ramp up in 2017.Please note that the earnings backdrop has not changed in any meaningful way since the November elections, notwithstanding the market’s strong gains since then.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.
