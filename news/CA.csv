See if CA can continue to rebound and clear that threshold.Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereCA broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 37.35 entry from a cup without handle. If a stock you're tracking breaks past a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also keep in mind that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one.The company reported 15% EPS growth in its most recent report. Revenue increased 7%. The next quarterly numbers are expected on or around Aug. 2.The company holds the No. 13 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Special Enterprise industry group.

1,CA,"Wall Street analysts are giving thumbs down to Broadcom's (AVGO) planned acquisition of CA Technologies (CA), saying the deal will muddle the chipmaker's strategic focus.Broadcom stock received several downgrades and price-target cuts on Thursday after the company announced its purchase of CA Technologies late Wednesday. At least five Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings on Broadcom stock and four others cut their price targets on the news.Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah kept his neutral rating on Broadcom but cut his price target to 225 from 250.""This deal hurts management's credibility,"" Shah said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBroadcom shares plummeted 13.7% to 209.98 on the stock market today. CA shares soared 18.7% to 44.15. Broadcom agreed to pay $44.50 a share in cash for CA in a deal worth $18.9 billion.The deal is out of character for Broadcom, which historically has bought other chipmakers. CA makes software for managing information technology systems. Broadcom said the acquisition will create a leading infrastructure technology company.After Broadcom's pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) failed earlier this year, the company said it would focus on delivering shareholder value through organic growth, capital return and tuck-in acquisitions, Shah said.Broadcom's move to buy CA Technologies comes ""out of left field,"" he said. ""CA is a legacy software company that specializes in mainframes — shared synergies are not obvious.""The deal also raises questions about long-term growth prospects for Broadcom's core wireless and wired communications chip businesses, Shah said.B. Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis lowered his rating on Broadcom to neutral from buy and slashed his price target to 245 from 308.He compared the deal to chipmaker Intel's (INTC) purchase of security software firm McAfee. Intel had trouble rationalizing that purchase and ultimately sold McAfee to a private equity firm.Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse lowered his rating on Broadcom stock to in-line from buy.The CA purchase lacks strategic rationale and seems more like ""financial engineering"" and a private equity play, he said.""Further, investors will likely be concerned on a 'loss of focus' in terms of broadening exposure outside of semiconductors,"" he said in a report.""We note that CA Technologies had been in the process of selling itself and had failed to attract a private equity buyer,"" Muse said. ""With software mainframe revenues in decline and no clear synergies to Broadcom's current revenue streams, we struggle to understand Broadcom's incentive here.""UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said he is willing to give Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan the benefit of the doubt. He noted that Tan has a proven track record of wringing value out of acquisitions.Arcuri maintained his buy rating on Broadcom with a price target of 330.Broadcom could become a consolidator in the infrastructure software space, he said.RELATED:Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

2,CA,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) announced late Wednesday that it plans to buy enterprise software firm CA Technologies (CA) for $18.9 billion in cash to create a leading infrastructure technology company.CA shares jumped over 16% to about 43.25 in after-hours trading on the stock market today after the Wall Street Journal reported a possible deal. Broadcom stock sank nearly 6% to 229 on the news.Under the terms of the agreement, CA's shareholders will receive $44.50 per share in cash. That represents a premium of about 20% to CA's closing price on Wednesday.The deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of CA shareholders and antitrust approvals in the U.S., European Union and Japan. It is expected to close in the fourth quarter.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""With its sizeable installed base of customers, CA is uniquely positioned across the growing and fragmented infrastructure software market, and its mainframe and enterprise software franchises will add to our portfolio of mission critical technology businesses.""He added, ""We intend to continue to strengthen these franchises to meet the growing demand for infrastructure software solutions.""The purchase marks a major change in Broadcom's acquisition strategy. It usually buys other semiconductor companies. CA makes information technology management software. Broadcom is a leading semiconductor device supplier to the wired, wireless, enterprise storage, and industrial markets.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the deal is a head-scratcher.""While we understand the logic behind the attractive free-cash-flow stream at CA, investors will wrestle (with the) strategic rationale,"" he said in a note to clients.Big questions that need to be answered by Broadcom include: Why is it moving into the software space and how does this business mesh with its core operations?Investors also will want to know how broad the company plans to move beyond semiconductors in future mergers and acquisitions, Daryanani said.The acquisition comes just months after President Donald Trump blocked Broadcom's $117 billion purchase of wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. Broadcom recently moved its headquarters from Singapore to San Jose, Calif.Broadcom said the CA acquisition will be immediately accretive to its adjusted earnings per share. It also will help Broadcom drive its long-term adjusted profit margins above 55%.It will fund the deal with $18 billion in new debt financing plus cash on hand. Broadcom expects to maintain an investment grade rating, given its strong cash flow generation and intention to rapidly de-leverage, the company said.RELATED:Broadcom Beats Wall Street's Fiscal Second-Quarter Targets

5,CA,"Most software stocks were hit hard Thursday amid the tech-driven sell-off. Yet, many industry group leaders are merely pulling back to potential support levels, like top growth stock HubSpot (HUBS). Meanwhile, VMware (VMW) continues to add to its gains following its recent earnings-related breakout.XThere are a number of high-quality growth stocks within the No. 18-ranked — out of 197 groups — Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry.VMware jumped past a 145.25 cup-with-handle entry on June 1 — according to MarketSmith chart analysis — one day after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and sales.

Shares are pulling back to their 55.05 flat-base entry and the 50-day moving average line.A flaw is the quickly declining relative strength line and the heavy volume declines during the past week.

8,CA,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1. The S&P 500, closing the session at 2798, is up 4.6%.On Friday, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey hits the wires at 10 a.m. ET.

13,CA,"Risk was once again the name of the game for the best bond funds securing top spots in IBD's 2018 Best Mutual Funds Awards.Winning mutual funds are those with at least $100 million in assets that beat their respective benchmarks in each of the one, three, five and 10-year periods through December 2017. Top bond funds are ranked by their average annual 10-year return in the categories of U.S. taxable bonds, international bonds and municipal bonds.Like last year, the five best funds this year were primarily in high yield and emerging markets. Longer duration funds also did well as long-term yields fell. That said, muni bond funds held their own with stellar returns not just for the 10 years, but also for 2017.The pickings were far from slim among U.S. taxable bond funds as 253 winning funds made the cut out of a total of 521 funds. That's nearly 100 more than last year.Among the top five, Pimco dominates with three of its funds: Extended Duration Institutional (PEDIX), Income Institutional (PIMIX) and Pimco Fixed Income Shares C (FXICX), having 10-year average returns of 9.43%, 9.15% and 8.68%, respectively, vs. the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond index's 4.01%.A repeat from last year and in second place is the $691 million Delaware Extended Duration Bond Institutional (DEEIX) with a 10-year average annual return of 9.41%, and handsomely beating the benchmark's 3.54% last year with a 12.38% return.First Eagle High Yield I (FEHIX) holds the fifth spot among the top bond funds in the category, sporting an average annual return of 8.59% for the past 10 years and a 4.87% gain last year. The $369 million fund prides itself on strong risk management and defensive positioning well ahead of market downturns.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs a result, its return may lag that of its peers when the markets do well, but it is usually well-positioned to weather tough times and take advantage of opportunities that arise when markets cheapen, fund co-managers Ed Meigs and Sean Slein told IBD. The fund surpassed its Morningstar high-yield category by 10.66 percentage points during the bear market in 2008, and it gained 13.3 percentage points more than its peers in 2009.""One of the things that makes us perhaps a little different from other funds is the way we rotate risk as we move through the cycle, as opposed to being a sector rotator, which is what a lot of people do,"" said Meigs. By looking at valuation through the cycle, Meigs will take more risk when properly compensated, and less risk when not properly compensated.Slein points out that no two credit cycles are alike. While there hasn't been steep deterioration in company quality as there was in 2005-07, ""as we've gone through this cycle since 2009, we haven't had the type of trend growth that we've seen in previous cycles,"" he adds. Normally economic growth will pick up above the trend line and companies are able to grow their cash flow and top line and effectively delever, Slein explains. But this hasn't happened this time around and ""as a result, leverage has continued to creep up ever so slowly,"" amounting to levels above those in the prior cycle.So, the managers have shortened duration and upped the quality of the fund holdings. ""We don't have a crystal ball, so we don't know when the party is going to end, but we clearly don't want to be the last people left at the party and we want to be prepared beforehand,"" said Meigs.BlackRock's Bob Miller agrees that caution is warranted. He's portfolio manager of $12 billion BlackRock Total Return K (MPHQX), a repeat award winning bond fund. ""Because of the potential for overheating in the economy, we think volatility in markets is going to be higher,"" he said. He expects interest rates to keep rising.Among the top bond funds in the nontaxable space, the number of winning funds was nearly the same as the prior year: 64 funds won best bond funds awards  for 2018 out of a total of 375 municipal bond funds evaluated. Many are repeat winners. Nuveen funds not only leads the pack with the top two positions, but four are among the top 10 cream-of-the-crop funds.Nuveen's CA High Yield Municipal Bond I (NCHRX), Municipal Total Return Managed Accounts (NMTRX), CA Municipal Bond I (NCSPX) and All-American Municipal Bond A (FLAAX) returned from 6.73% to 11.25% last year, and 5.44% to 6.46% for the past 10 years. The index was up 5.45% and 4.46% for the same periods.John Miller, fund manager and co-head of fixed income at Nuveen, says that the funds' performance is driven not so much by duration or yield-curve positioning, but more by yield, credit selection and bonds that have the opportunity for credit spreads to narrow over time.Last year, NCHRX benefited from a relatively stable interest-rate environment, as well as good credit selection and sector emphasis, helped by a moderate narrowing of credit spreads in the market.For 2018, Miller believes munis will outperform Treasuries and other taxable securities even as rates rise: ""There's some cushioning effects of rates within portfolios: higher coupons priced to shorter calls, wider credit spreads that can narrow in an improving economy, and then simply the income ... and scarcity of municipals that will grow throughout the year.""Outside the U.S., emerging markets once again got all the best bond funds trophies. All five top bond funds in the foreign bond category are repeats from last year. However, fewer international funds made the list, with hard-currency ones partially affected by the weakening dollar in 2017.Fidelity's veteran manager John Carlson once again helped secure top spots for his New Markets Income (FNMIX) and Advisor Emerging Markets Income (FAEMX) funds. With average 10-year returns topping 7%, they handsomely outperformed Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate index' 3.09%. In 2017, the funds were each up 10.15% and 9.68% vs. the index's 7.39%.Carlson is known for his extensive world travels to meet with country officials and dig up unique investment opportunities. He applies a mosaic model, overweighting improving credits and underweighting deteriorating ones.""Right now we're investing in about 95 countries and we probably cover 80 to 85 of those with on-the-ground travel,"" Carlson told IBD. ""The key is to stay focused, in control and very disciplined."" As such, the funds are two-thirds invested in sovereign and quasi-sovereign dollar bonds, ""and then I look to add alpha through either corporate bonds, local currency and on occasion equities,"" for a maximum weight of one-third of the fund.He also has risk limits on each of the countries. ""I am very aware of the index but also very wary of the index. Because these are bonds, a bigger weight (by a country) in the index usually implies that you're issuing more debt. That's not necessarily a good thing.""TCW Emerging Markets Income I (TGEIX) holds the second spot among international bond fund award winners, sporting an average annual return of 8.61% in the past 10 years and an 11.4% return last year. The fund's unique proposition is that it takes a total return approach, ""so it looks at all the asset classes in emerging markets and really picks what we think are the best opportunities across the entire asset class,"" said fund manager David Robbins. ""If we see better value in a credit in local currency, or in corporates than in sovereign bonds, we'll populate the portfolio with those type of opportunities.""As to why emerging markets have outperformed, Robbins says that they not only offer higher yields in a world where yields are low, but also that the fundamentals have turned around significantly. ""While many people are concerned that developed markets are very late-cycle, emerging markets are a much-earlier-cycle play,"" he adds. That said, he expects tougher returns in 2018, with hard- and local-currency markets providing mid-single-digit and high-single to low-double digit returns, respectively.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Read The Full IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards 2018 ReportHere's The List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryBest Mutual Funds: News, Performance Reports And Investing IdeasHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying — And Selling?

15,CA,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

17,CA,"Once again, New York and California are on Santa's naughty list for their misbehavior in the realm of economic policies.The Fraser Institute's latest annual Economic Freedom of North America (EFNA) report finds  New York ranked 50th and California 49th, based on an index of 10 variables related to government spending, taxes, and labor market freedom. California has been in the bottom five for 14 of the past 15 years. New York has been there in all 35 years of the dataset, and in last place 22 of those years. In contrast, Texas has been in the top five for 11 years in a row, and Florida has been there for 34 of the last 35 years.X One reason this matters is that residents and businesses frequently vote with their feet in favor of economic freedom. Since the last recession ended (in 2009), population in the 10 most-free states has grown 2½ times faster than it has in the 10 least-free states. It has grown nearly 3½ times faster in just the past three years. Employment and income have also grown faster in the freer states.Furthermore, over 230 scholarly articles by independent researchers have used the Economic Freedom data to examine economic freedom at the state level, while more than 400 articles have done the same at the national level (using its companion report that ranks countries). Most of that literature finds that economically free areas tend to experience more broadly positive outcomes, including more economic prosperity. One reason is that high levels of taxes, spending, and regulation make it harder for entrepreneurs to succeed. When businesses can't expand and hire new workers, it hurts everyone.States that have seen the fastest economic growth, like Texas and Florida, tend to have a common focus in their economic policies: low taxes (including low or no income taxes), a fiscally conservative approach to spending, and a common-sense approach to regulation that makes it easier for entrepreneurs to be successful. States that take the opposite approach, like New York and California, tend to see much less economic prosperity and many more moving trucks leaving the state for greener pastures.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveNew York and California ranking at the bottom of the Economic Freedom of North America report is not an outlier. Last year's Freedom in the 50 States report, which uses an entirely different methodology, came to the exact same conclusion on economic freedom: NY 50, CA 49. This year's State Business Tax Climate Index ranked New York 49 and California 48; only New Jersey was lower.If politicians in New York and California want their state's residents to thrive, they should follow the models of states like Texas and Florida. The first step would be to lower their income tax rates. California's are the highest in the nation and New York's are not far behind. Income taxes are particularly harmful for economic growth because they punish productive activity. It's no coincidence that Texas and Florida, to which many businesses and residents are fleeing, have no income tax at all.New York and California also need to rein in the growth of spending. Allowing the budget to grow only as fast as population plus inflation would make a big difference. Eliminating wasteful spending on things like corporate welfare programs that put small businesses at a disadvantage would be a good place to start. Reducing excessive regulations would also help entrepreneurs be more successful, allowing them to in turn expand their businesses and hire more workers, rather than leaving the state or shrinking payrolls and laying off workers.Taking the steps necessary to rank higher on the various measures of economic policies, like the EFNA, is a win-win for New York and California (and all other states). Politicians can take the credit for improving the economy, and residents can reap the rewards of that greater prosperity.Sounds like a great New Year's resolution for politicians everywhere: increase economic freedom. That'll surely get you off Santa's naughty list and onto his nice list!RELATED:China And Europe See What U.S. Critics Don't: A U.S. Tax-Cut Boom Is ComingBest-Run States Are Low-Tax Republican, Worst-Run Are High-Tax Democratic, Study FindsMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

24,CA,"In a good year for technology stocks, IBD's software sector has climbed nearly 30%. IShares North America Tech-Software (IGV) ETF has been a vehicle for that trade.The exchange traded fund is up about 38% in 2017 and trading near all-time highs. Its performance has earned the fund a spot on IBD's ETF Leaders screen, and it's the only pure-software ETF on this month's list.As happens with other leading ETFs, the success of many of its top components have carried the fund to a market-beating performance. In the case of iShares North America Tech-Software, solid advances for Microsoft (MSFT), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Intuit (INTU), Red Hat (RHT) and several others have combined into an attractive basket of software stocks.Microsoft — the largest holding, with a nearly 9% weighting — is near an all-time high as it stretches a fine advance of 33% that began a year ago. That's when the stock broke out of a base on a bullish earnings report.Activision climbed as much as 46% from a breakout on earnings Feb. 10. Red Hat is up about 50% from a February breakout. ServiceNow (NOW) has risen roughly 30% from breakouts in January and April.IShares North America Tech-Software includes companies in video game, medical, database, security, financial and other software segments. According to the iShares website, the ETF is about half invested in what it calls application software, about one-third in systems software and 14% in home entertainment.After its powerful run, is the ETF at risk of exhausting itself?The software industry is largely cyclical. Continued expansion of the U.S. economy, improving corporate profits and capital spending, plus low unemployment make for a good foundation for growth.But the software sector certainly follows pullbacks and corrections in the general market, and growth stocks tend to fall more than the main indexes during weak markets.A positive trend is that few of the 57 stocks in iShares North America Tech-Software are in risky late-stage bases, overstretched in their price runs or under stress.That also means there are quite a few stocks that have traded horizontally for many months and haven't participated in the software rally. But those are concentrated among the ETF's smaller holdings (Open Text (OTEX), Splunk (SPLK) and CA Inc. (CA), to name a few).Indeed, the top-weighted holdings are where most of the best stock gains are found.The ETF itself climbed past a 145.80 buy point in late August and remains in buy range. Shares pulled back to the 50-day moving average a few weeks back and found support at that level, a sign the ETF can continue to advance.RELATED:Technology ETF Rolling, But Will Q3 Earnings Halt The Party?Amazon, Microsoft Join To Offer Artificial Intelligence Platform

34,CA,"Canada's wheat farmers still have more than a month before they start the bulk of this season's grain harvest, but they're already worried about where to store a bumper crop.Even though growers planted less after prices fell last year, beneficial weather boosted the outlook for yields across Canada's Prairies. The potential for near-record output means farmers are stocking up on grain bags to store wheat on the ground amid expectations that bins and silos will be overflowing.""There's such a demand because the crop looks so big this year,"" said Bruce Nordick, a sales manager at Grain Bags Canada. He estimates that sales volume is the biggest he's ever seen for this time in the season in the 10 years that he's been selling equipment. ""We're leaps and bounds ahead compared to last year and even 2013,"" when farmers collected a record harvest, he said by telephone from Humboldt, Saskatchewan.The big crop in Canada, one of the world's top shippers, is adding to the outlook for a ballooning wheat glut. The U.S. Department of Agriculture already forecasts that global stockpiles will reach a record before North America's 2017 harvest. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg on average predict that supplies are so large that the agency will be forced to raise its inventory estimate. Benchmark prices in Chicago are down about 25% in the past 12 months, and hedge funds last week increased their wagers on further declines to the most since April.Globally, ""we had next to ideal conditions for wheat yields it seems, and we've been posting some very big numbers,"" said Gillian Rutherford, who helps oversee about $12 billion as a commodities portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management in Newport Beach, Calif. ""It's difficult to imagine that prices are going to rally sharply.""Hedge funds and other large speculators increased their net-short holdings in wheat to 102,244 U.S. futures and options in the week ended July 5, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released three days later. Money managers have been betting on price declines for 11 straight months, the longest streak in the government data that starts in 2006.Rolling most-active futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 8.4% this year. Prices touched $4.1575 on July 5, the lowest since 2007. Futures for spring wheat, the variety grown in Canada, have dropped about 16% over the past 12 months on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange.In Canada, farmers may collect as much as 31 million metric tons of wheat this season, according to trader Gap SA Grains & Produits. That would be 12% higher than a year earlier and among the top five largest harvests on record. A crop of that size could strain the nation's rail system and storage facilities, as it did in 2013 when CA$20 billion ($15 billion) of grain was left stuck on farms as grain bins and elevators were full.Warm weather and summer rain have boosted plants. Growing conditions in Saskatchewan, Canada's top grower, have been ""optimal in most areas,"" the province's agriculture ministry said Friday. More than 80% of the crops in Alberta, the second-biggest producer, were in good-to-excellent condition as of July 5, the latest provincial data show.""If things stay the way they are, I think we could probably have the best crop we've had,"" Ian Boxall 40, said in a telephone interview from his 8,500 acre farm in Tisdale, Saskatchewan. He's expecting to harvest at least 65 bushels of wheat per acre on the 1,600 acres he's sown this year. That would be 23% higher than the 53 bushels per acre Canadian farmers collected on average in 2013.It's not just Canada where supplies are large. Farmers in the U.S. could collect 2.164 billion bushels, according to the average of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. That would be the most in four years and top the USDA's June estimate for 2.052 billion. The agency will update its outlook for global crops on Tuesday at noon in Washington.Adverse weather in Europe could help to put a cap on the supply expansion. In France, the European Union's biggest grower, excess rain has raised concerns about yields and protein-content in plants. Soggy fields mean that the country's crop conditions have been falling.Crop losses and quality problems in France could be a boon to Canadian and northern U.S. farmers, who typically produce spring-wheat varieties with higher protein than their global counterparts. North American prices could rise as buyers bid higher for shipments of better quality, even amid the worldwide glut.""There's really only one region of the world that produces high-protein wheat, and that's the spring-wheat area of the U.S. Northern Plains and the Canadian Prairies,"" said Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities in New Richmond, Ohio, who has been analyzing the market since 1988. ""Countries looking to buy high-quality wheat to blend would look to the U.S. and Canada in particular.""
"
35,CA,"Realtors in Toronto and Vancouver are pitching Canadian cities as relatively safe property havens now that London, for years one of the world's leading targets of foreign capital, suddenly looks a lot riskier. Blame it on Brexit.""Brexit's good for us, not for them,"" said Anita Springate-Renaud, owner of Engel & Volkers' brokerage in Toronto, who expects to field calls from clients seeking to redirect their investments. ""We are a safe bet.""If Springate-Renaud is right, there may be heightened demand from moneyed clients for homes and condos as well as office towers in two of Canada's hottest real estate markets, which already have seen prices soar from an influx of foreign money. There's a record $443 billion in global capital allocated to commercial property that wealthy investors haven't deployed, according to figures from Cushman & Wakefield.Within hours of the stunning Brexit outcome, Brian Kriter, an executive managing director of valuation and advisory at Cushman & Wakefield, was on a 6:30 a.m. call from his home in Toronto to discuss the potential ramifications of the referendum with colleagues in London and New York.In the days since, Kriter has met with one Asian commercial real estate lender who decided to freeze plans for a multimillion-dollar financing deal in London and is considering channeling that money to North America instead. Cushman & Wakefield is organizing a client day in July, potentially in New York, to discuss the early implications of Brexit's fallout.""You have this phenomenal amount of capital that's looking to be placed in commercial real estate, and it's very fluid,"" Kriter said. ""Foreign investors view Canada as an island of certainty.""In the last decade, central London saw the biggest increase in residential property prices of any major city as the favored destination for global capital seeking a stable sanctuary. Nearly three out of every four newly built homes in 2013 were bought by foreign buyers, half of them from Asia, according to Knight Frank. On the commercial side, 70% of central London purchases were by foreigners in 2015.The U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union may not necessarily change that overnight. The pound's record plunge could attract buyers seeking a bargain, said Brad Henderson, CEO of Sotheby's International Realty in Canada. The vote may ironically bring more predictability to the U.K. but export uncertainty to the rest of Europe, Kriter said.But with China among Asia's most vulnerable economies to Brexit risk, there could be an even greater appetite from mainland buyers for North American assets, such as Anbang Insurance Group, which has snapped up multimillion-dollar assets in New York, Toronto and Vancouver.A record $18.3 billion flowed out of China globally in 2014 and nearly half of that went to just three markets: London, Manhattan and Sydney, according to a March report from Colliers International Group Inc., the Toronto-based real estate firm. As some markets take steps to temper demand from overseas investors, Canada has increasingly become a beneficiary. Australia's three largest states by population have announced an extra duty on foreign buyers of as much as 7%.In the six months to February, foreign investment into Canadian commercial real estate surged to $1.4 billion, more than double a year earlier, the brokerage said in a separate March report. Of that, 42% came from China, compared with just 5% in the previous period.Royal LePage is advising clients that Brexit is likely to cause the Bank of Canada to hold interest rates lower for longer, which will stoke demand in the residential market, said Adil Dinani, a Vancouver agent for the unit of Brookfield Real Estate Services.Any additional trickle of demand into Vancouver and Toronto could prove a headache for Canadian policymakers seeking to damp record-high home prices. In recent weeks, the International Monetary Fund, Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and Bank of Canada have all flagged the increasing risk of a potential correction.""It's something we're going to have to talk about because there are concerns about overheating,"" said Royal LePage's Dinani. ""We'll likely see more capital inflows into these cities, so what is that going to look like? Are there going to be policy tools put in place to protect the market from further increases?""In Vancouver, the price of a detached home rose 37% in the past year to CA$1.5 million ($1.2 million). In Toronto, the average price of a detached property rose 19%.""We're in the early days -- it's hard to sift through how the variables are going to play out,"" said Sotheby's Henderson. ""But capital will look for more attractive, stable markets. And Canada is still very much a bargain.""Related:How China's 'Smurfs' Send Real Estate SoaringTech-Fueled Land Grab Transforms Canada's Silicon Valley

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) rose 6%; Incyte (INCY), 5%; BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), 4%; Biogen (BIIB), 3.5%; and Celgene (CELG), 3%.Celgene broke out of a consolidation, clearing a 127.74 buy point in volume that soared more than 300% above average. The pattern is first stage. Celgene has been consolidating for almost two years. A consolidation that long will push down the Relative Price Strength Rating and that is what has happened with Celgene. The RS rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is 68, which means the stock is lagging about a third of the market in price performance.IBD-style investors will put less emphasis on the RS Rating when it comes from a long consolidation.Celgene's earnings picture is solid. The Street expects earnings to rise 23% this year and 21% in 2018. Pretax margin last year was 50.4%, the best in at least nine years.Blue chips meanwhile were mostly down.

39,CA,"XStocks opened higher and clung to narrow gains early Wednesday, as a string of positive earnings reports boosted early trade.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each fought to hold gains of less than 0.1%.

The gain hoisted AMD shares 38% above an early May low, and well up the right side of a three-month cup base.FedEx (FDX) dipped 1% after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday.Red Hat (RHT) spiked 9% as Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, following strong first-quarter results reported late Tuesday. A 12% earnings gain and a 19% rise in revenue neatly cleared analysts' targets, and management's second-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts were also above expectations. The move sent the open-source software innovator to new highs in heavy trade, after clearing a long, sloppy consolidation in February.CA, the former Computer Associates, spiked 15% on news reports that privately held BMC Software was exploring financing options to acquire the provider of information technology management software. CA has market capitalization of roughly $13 billion. The gap up move sent shares above a 35.09 buy point in a six-month cup base.Adobe Systems jumped 3% in early trade, after reporting better-than-expected 44% gains in earnings and a 27% rise in revenue. The company also guided third-quarter sales and earnings to above consensus views. Adobe shares spiked to a new high, leaving them extended above a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average.Winnebago (WGO) rolled up a 4% gain at the open, as a 75% surge in revenue and a 134% leap in gross profit apparently outweighed a miss on its earnings per share line for its fiscal third quarter. The strong-volume gain was enough to pierce resistance at the stock's 10-week line, starting it up the right side of a six-month correction.CarMax (KMX) vaulted 5% higher on better-than-forecast first-quarter results. The company said delays in federal income tax refunds shifted some sales from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, helping results.  The stock has climbed 35% in the past 12 months, climbing from a February 2016 low.Overseas, in Asia, markets dropped hard in Tokyo and Hong Kong with benchmark indexes down 0.5% on each exchange.

47,CA,"Apparently not too distracted by its reorganization, the highest-rated issue in IBD’s Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group, Citrix Systems (CTXS) boosted its Q1 earnings faster than analysts had expected.Reporting after the market close, the maker of cloud management software said Q1 adjusted earnings rose 81% to $1.18 per share, where Wall Street expected 92 cents. Revenue rose 8.5% to $826 million, while analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $789 million.Citrix stock was up nearly 7% in after-hours trading, following the company's Q1 earnings release. Shares closed up a fraction, at 80.56, in the stock market today, just 4% off a four-year high of 84.17, hit on Oct. 28.""I am very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and bottom line,"" Citrix CEO Kirill Tatarinov said in the company's earnings release. ""The progress we made in refocusing the company -- simplifying our portfolio and sharpening our message -- is starting to pay off.""We are seeing a strong improvement in our operating margin, and our focused strategy has made it easier for our field teams and channel partners to execute; consequently, we saw improvement in the top line. It gives us a measure of confidence that we are on the right path, and it gives us opportunities to solidify our leadership position in our core areas.""Q1 marks Citrix's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth following three quarters of 2%-to-7% growth. Profits have outperformed sales, up by only single-digit percentages, now for seven straight quarters.Last week, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley reiterated an outperform rating with an 85 price target on Citrix stock. He said Baird had surveyed 96 Citrix channel partners and got back mixed results, “consistent with management’s guidance that factored in normal (Q1) seasonality and allowed for possible disruptions from reorganizational activity.”“We continue to believe prospects for improved channel performance are underappreciated,"" Ashley said.The company's reorganization included the layoff of about 1,000 employees and contractors in December and January, the pending spinoff of Citrix’s GoTo lines and a $200 million annual reduction in other operating expenses. In February, Kevin Parker, former CEO of Deltek, was named chairman of the GoTo spinoff, expected to be completed late this year.The third-largest in IBD’s Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group, Citrix boasts a $12.45 billion market cap, half the size of the largest, VMware (VMW), but barely smaller than CA (CA).However, VMware carries an IBD Composite Rating of 47, compared with CA’s 54 and Citrix’s 92, meaning Citrix is outperforming  92% of all S&P 500 stocks based on earnings, sales, institutional ownership and other fundamental metrics.

53,CA,"The best mutual funds the past 10 years in U.S. taxable fixed income had a common thread: They were risk takers.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards were given to U.S. taxable, international and municipal bond funds. Winners had to have at least $100 million in assets and beat their respective benchmarks in each of the one, three, five and 10-year periods through December 2016. Best of the best awards went to the top five benchmark beaters ranked by 10-year returns.In the domestic taxable universe, the top three performers were BTS Tactical Fixed Income A (BTFAX), Delaware Extended Duration Bond Institutional (DEEIX) and AB High Income A (AGDAX) with 10-year returns of 8.53%, 8.47% and 8.17%, respectively. In 2016 alone, they racked up 13.79%, 7.5% and 15.17% each.The $665 million BTS fund focuses not just on providing income to bond investors, but also capital appreciation. Over 85% of the fund is in high-yield bond ETFs, but it also uses defensive capital preservation strategies such as stop-loss measures to reduce downside risk. This top performer doesn't come cheap: it has a maximum load, or commission, of 5% and a 1.58% expense ratio. Its current yield is 2.8% and it has a duration, a measure of sensitivity to interest changes, of a relatively low 3.89 years.Delaware Extended Duration is much more sensitive to rate changes, having a duration of 13.4 years. That sensitivity has propped up its yield to 3.7%. The fund charges a 0.71% annual fee. Its average credit quality is BBB.As spreads have tightened significantly in the corporate bond market and interest rates are expected to rise in 2017, the key message is to ""follow coupon, because coupon is going to help offset some of your price declines,"" said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed income research at U.S. Bank.Internationally, GMO Emerging Country Debt III (GMCDX), TCW Emerging Markets Income I (TGEIX) and Fidelity New Markets Income (FNMIX) were the winners with 8.37%, 7.89% and 7.26% 10-year average annual returns, respectively. Last year paid off well in the emerging markets as those funds brought in between 13% and 15% in returns.Fidelity's $5.2 billion New Markets Income fund mostly invests in dollar-denominated sovereign and parastatal debt of emerging market countries. Manager John Carlson, who has run the fund since June 1995, keeps about two-thirds in sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt, and allocates the rest in sources of alpha such as local currency bonds, whether corporate or government, or even equities.""I tend to keep the fund in more liquid positions rather than illiquids,"" said Carlson. ""My approach is based on the mosaic approach. I'm looking to build a picture of a sovereign country's ability and willingness to repay their debt.""To achieve this goal, Carlson travels to those countries to speak with top government and corporate officials. Carlson does not use derivatives, leverage or shorting, and prefers to manage the fund in a consistent manner.Last year, Carlson successfully took advantage of very wide credit spreads in the oil-producing countries when oil prices fell to below $30 a barrel. As such, he overweighted oil bonds such as Petrobras, Petroleos De Venezuela, Argentina Republic and Russian Federation. ""Those oil credits were responsible for probably a couple of 100 basis points of outperformance,"" he said.At the same time, he went underweight investment grade credits, such as the Philippines, China, Poland and Indonesia, where he felt spreads were too tight.Aside from the strong performance exhibited by emerging markets bond funds, global bond funds with a more broadly diversified bond portfolio also did well. GuideStone Funds Global Bond Investors (GGBFX)'s 10.91% return in 2016 got a lift from an opportunistic allocation to high yield, bank loans, convertible debt, emerging markets and U.S. investment grade financials and industrials credits.""We provide a fund that has a very broad opportunity set and give the ability to our underlying subadvisors to have the flexibility and opportunity to go where there are dislocations in the market place,"" said Matt Peden, chief investment officer at GuideStone Capital Management. The $444 million fund is subadvised by Loomis Sayles and Western Asset Management. It carries a yield of 3.83% and a fee of 0.82%.Prudential Global Total Return A (GTRAX) looks for as many different alpha drivers as possible. The $730 million fund has a strong focus on security selection and sector allocation. ""While interest-rate and currency positioning for some global funds are the primary focus, for us those are secondary activities; primary for us is bottom-up asset selection — finding a diversified set of the best risk-adjusted opportunities,"" said fund manager Robert Tipp.The fund benefited from high-quality structured credit such as CMBS, emerging market sovereigns and high yield corporate bonds in 2016. ""It was an environment where expectations of economic growth and a relatively docile Fed backdrop was very conducive to spread contraction,"" Tipp noted.The fund returned 2.59% in 2016 and 5.01% for the 10 years. It yields 3.52% and has an expense ratio of 0.97%.Among nontaxable bonds, performance was quite even for the 10-year period. Top three performers are the Nuveen CA Municipal Bond (NCSPX), Ivy Municipal High Income I (WYMHX) and Delaware National High-Yield Muni Bond A (CXHYX) with 4.99%, 4.97% and 4.97%, respectively.Muni high-yield bonds did especially well in the first part of last year. But they behaved in a rather unusual fashion following the U.S. presidential election in November, underperforming corporate high yield.""Despite the end-of-year performance downturn, municipal high yield is currently offering both outstanding relative value and attractive yields,"" noted Jim Colby, portfolio manager for municipal bonds at VanEck in a recent report. ""I believe it's time to hit the ""reset"" button and reconsider municipal high yield.""RELATED:Next ETF Leaders For Rising Interst Rates

54,CA,"ServiceNow (NOW) announced Chief Executive Frank Slootman will step down as of April 3, to be replaced by John Donahoe, chairman of PayPal (PYPL) and a former CEO of eBay (EBAY).Slootman will continue to serve as the chairman of ServiceNow's board.ServiceNow stock fell 4.4% to 87.75 in the stock market today, still up more than 15% in 2017 but down 7% from its all-time high of 93.97 set on Feb. 15.Donahoe was president and CEO of eBay from 2008 to 2015. EBay spun off PayPal in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Western Alliance Bancorp and Primerica are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Analysts were surprised by Slootman stepping down amid intensified competition with Salesforce.com (CRM).""We are not thrilled to see Mr. Slootman moving to the chairman role,"" said Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a research report. ""In our view, Slootman has been the key architect, or at least a key architect, in ServiceNow's strategy of moving into new good growth opportunities beyond ITSM.""Founded in 2004, ServiceNow developed software for information technology service management (ITSM), basically IT help desk tools for tracking internal company issues. ServiceNow has expanded into new markets such as human resources, customer service management and security.Slootman has been ServiceNow's CEO since 2011. He earlier headed Data Domain, which was sold to data storage networking giant EMC in 2009.ServiceNow's 2016 sales boomed 38% to $1.4 billion. ServiceNow has forecast 2017 revenue growth of 32% to $1.835 billion at the midpoint of its guidance.""While we expected Slootman would not remain CEO forever, we expected more signs of succession process before an announcement like this,"" said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, in a report. ""We believe the company had looked at bringing in an apprentice like successor, they opted to go with an exec (Donahoe) that has managed a $20 billion business.""Santa Clara, Calif.-based ServiceNow has set a goal of $4 billion in revenue by 2020.""Software CEOs have a history of handing off the job at 'the top,'"" added Pritchard. ""We expect near-term investor sentiment will reflect concern around this, even though there are no obvious signs of peaking momentum.""ServiceNow has prospered by taking away the customers of BMC Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), CA Technologies (CA) and others.""As with any new leadership, we believe that there could be some turnover within the senior management layer as Mr. Donahoe looks to build out his team,"" said Mizuho Securities in a report.RELATED:Meet The 'Fastest-Growing' $1 Billion Enterprise Software FirmWill Microsoft Stymie Salesforce.com's Stock Turnaround?
"
55,CA,"Technology investors looking for high revenue growth often find their answer in software-as-a-service companies.ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the fastest-growing companies that fits that bill. ServiceNow's 2016 sales exploded 38% to $1.4 billion, and it has laid claim to being the ""fastest-growing enterprise software company with more than $1 billion in revenue.""It has set big goals, too. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company plans to nearly triple its revenue to $4 billion by 2020.""There's not another company that produces growth at our scale like we do,"" Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's chief executive, said in an interview. ""It's a trifecta — scale, growth and free cash flow.""ServiceNow faces fierce competition, though, most notably from Salesforce.com (CRM), currently the market leader in the industry known as SaaS. Salesforce.com's 2016 sales boomed 24% to $6.7 billion, and the San Francisco-based company is on track to hit $10 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year. It's aiming to hit $20 billion after that.Salesforce.com has the higher profile, being oft-mentioned in industry merger activity, whether it involves Microsoft (MSFT), LinkedIn, Twitter (TWTR) or another company. It specializes in software that helps businesses organize and handle sales operations.But ServiceNow stock has shot up 25% in 2017, while Salesforce.com is up 18% after lagging last year.SaaS companies sell online subscriptions to software, rather than one-time licenses. SaaS providers have high customer renewal rates and book recurring revenue over the long term. Most sell into the so-called ""enterprise market"" — large companies, government agencies and other big customers.ServiceNow has prospered by taking away the customers of BMC Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), CA Technologies (CA) and other ""on-premise"" software providers that shifted slowly to cloud-based SaaS business models.Founded in 2004, ServiceNow developed software for information technology service management, basically IT help-desk tools for tracking internal company issues. As Salesforce.com has expanded into marketing, customer service and e-commerce, ServiceNow has made a similar push into customer-service tools, heightening the rivalry between the two.Salesforce.com has been an acquisition machine, spending more than $4.6 billion in 2016 alone to buy companies.In ServiceNow's case, though, it can hit its $4 billion target by growing ""organically,"" meaning without big acquisitions, says Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst.""There may be opportunities for them to enhance the breadth of their offerings with (small) tuck-in acquisitions,"" Zukin added.ServiceNow expects to reach its $4 billion revenue goal by expanding into new markets — human resources, customer service management and security, to name a few — and by landing bigger contracts while targeting the top 2,000 global companies.ServiceNow has bought small companies like Neebula Systems, iTapp and most recently DxContinuum to acquire ""talent and technology,"" said Slootman, who has been ServiceNow's CEO since 2011. He earlier headed Data Domain, which was sold to data storage networking giant EMC in 2009.""Technology is not as useful without the talent,"" Slootman said. ""We have the ability to sell, so I don't need to acquire revenue or customers. We can do that ourselves. We try to acquire small companies with promising technology before they go vertical and their revenue explodes, because then it's way more expensive (to acquire them).""ServiceNow still garners most revenue from service management, but the 2014 Neebula acquisition provided key technology for mapping a customers' IT infrastructure in case outages or other problems occur. That's a different market, called IT operations management. ServiceNow's 2016 purchase of ITApp provided cloud management tools.ServiceNow's operations management tools account for about 9% of subscription revenue, with that expected to grow to at least 15% by 2020.Slootman says the same software tools that automate information-technology workflows and record keeping can be applied for finance, legal, procurement and other corporate departments. Like Salesforce.com, ServiceNow is building a library of business apps that customers can download via the internet.The name of the game for many SaaS companies is building a cloud ""platform"" so they can sell multiple software tools to different industries.IBD'S TAKE: After a series of flat bases over the last 10 months, ServiceNow broke out last month and is staking out higher ground above the 90 level. ServiceNow is the eighth-ranked company in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise Group. Tops on the list is Paycom Software (PAYC), which has a Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99.""In software everyone claims to be a platform play, but in reality there are only a few that can make that claim, and ServiceNow is one of them,"" said Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital analyst in a report.Much of ServiceNow's revenue growth has come from ""cross-selling."" Its sales staff aims to sell more products to existing service management customers. IBM has emerged as a key partner of ServiceNow, reselling its service management and other tools. Accenture has been a marketing partner in the government market.Alex Zukin, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, says IBM looms as a ""logical acquirer (of ServiceNow) over the longer term.""""ServiceNow's platform would be a logical extension of IBM's cloud infrastructure,"" Zukin said.In mid-2016, ServiceNow was among companies listed in a score card of possible Salesforce.com acquisitions that leaked from a board of directors meeting. Pegasystems (PEGA) and Tableau Software (DATA) also were on Salesforce's wish list, but ServiceNow's market cap is much bigger at more than $15 billion.ServiceNow generates hefty free cash flow, a feat that's not common among SaaS companies, and a plus for any potential acquirers. Free cash flow rose 40% to $322 million in 2016.The company reported unadjusted earnings of 71 cents in 2016 but it's still not profitable on an adjusted basis, which includes stock-based compensation. Shares of ServiceNow ended trading Friday up 1% to 92.74, and were up another 0.5% Tuesday to close at 93.18.ServiceNow has forecast 2017 revenue growth of 32% to $1.835 billion, at the midpoint of its guidance. Billing growth has stabilized after slowing in 2015, when the company reorganized sales. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling 54% earnings growth to $1.08 a share in 2017.A roadmap to ServiceNow's $4 billion revenue goal was revealed in May 2016. A month earlier, it settled patent infringement cases with BMC and HPE. Analysts expect ServiceNow to continue taking share in the service management market from BMC and others, though privately held Cherwell Software is a strong rival.As ServiceNow expands into new markets, analysts say it could run into more competition from the likes of Atlassian (TEAM), Zendesk (ZEN) and Splunk (SPLK).Zukin says that in many cases ServiceNow's management software can work alongside other tools. He says human resources, where Workday (WDAY) is a leading provider, is one example.The Salesforce rivalry, though, seems to be growing.""Historically, ServiceNow's messaging has been that ServiceNow and Salesforce.com can coexist in accounts. The new message seems to be that customers are increasingly taking a 'CRM model' or 'service management' platform approach,"" Brian Schwartz, an Oppenheimer analyst, wrote in a recent report to clients. ""In other words, we believe the two platforms will increasingly be seen as future alternatives rather than running in parallel.""ServiceNow aims to leverage its database technology to provide more problem-solving tools in handling customer-service issues. Both Salesforce.com and ServiceNow are adding artificial intelligence to software. By embedding data analytics and ""machine learning"" into software, they aim to make it easier for customers to automate tasks.ServiceNow acquired AI startup DxContinuum in January. Slootman says he plans to utilize DxContinuum's  throughout ServiceNow's cloud platform. The tools will help customers build predictive models that make it easier to categorize incoming requests from company employees.Aside from HR, customer service and security, Slootman says SeriveNow could target other areas.""The good thing about this model is we can try things, we can be opportunistic,"" Slootman said. ""If something works, we'll do more. But we can also back out if it doesn't. There are no life-and-death bets. We can be very agile in how we move in or out of adjacent markets.""RELATED:Will Microsoft Stymie Salesforce.com's Stock Turnaround?

"
58,CA,"Cisco Systems' (CSCO) acquisition of AppDynamics for $3.7 billion sparked takeover speculation of other software companies, with shares of New Relic (NEWR) and Splunk (SPLK) both surging Wednesday.Cisco late Tuesday snapped up AppDynamics just before it was set to be the first big tech IPO — the first tech unicorn IPO — of 2017. New Relic stock rose 11% to 36.85 in the stock market today, earlier hitting 40.10, just below a record high for a company that went public in 2014 at 23.Splunk stock rose 7.6% Wednesday, hitting a nearly two-month high and rising above both its 50-day and 200-day lines for the first time since early this month.Cisco stock edged up 0.33% Wednesday.AppDynamics provides cloud-based software that measures and analyzes the performance of business critical applications.""The acquisition broadens Cisco's software portfolio as Cisco attempts to diversify its revenue base with more subscription and recurring revenue,"" said Alex Kurtz, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report. ""The traditional market for application performance management (APM) is roughly $4 billion, but analytics, the shift to cloud deployments and the consolidation of monitoring tools appears to be expanding the addressable market.""Other vendors with APM exposure include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and NetScout Systems (NTCT). We believe there is a split in the market between the next-generation players, with AppDynamics tending more toward hybrid cloud deployments and New Relic toward public cloud and digital deployments.""IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Inphi, GrubHub and NetEase are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. AppDynamics, which recently raised the target range of its IPO to $12-$14 a share from $10-$12, was expected to price Wednesday night and begin trading on Thursday. The software maker had targeted a maximum valuation of $1.7 billion.AppDynamics will operate as a unit in Cisco's IoT division.Splunk is an AppDynamics rival and some have said it's also been eyed by Cisco, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research note. He says those rumors likely will cool after Cisco's announcement.""We think Splunk and AppDynamics fight for budget in some customer projects and we expect the intensity of this would increase or decrease depending on how Cisco executes in integration and its leverage of AppDynamics offerings across broader distribution channel,"" Pritchard wrote. ""Some had viewed Cisco as a potential acquirer of Splunk and while SPLK and AppDynamics are somewhat complementary, we expect investor sentiment around a Cisco/Splunk combination to cool.""In any case, a host of software mergers could be in the offing, analysts say.""We expected 2017 to be a better year for software M&A, and we certainly got off to a strong start with this transaction,"" RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg said in a report. ""In addition to AppDynamics, other market leaders in the APM space include New Relic and privately-held Dynatrace as well as challengers including CA Technologies (CA), IBM (IBM), Hewlett Packard Enterprises, BMC Software and Riverbed.""Ittai Kidron, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said: ""We're mixed on the Cisco acquisition's impact on New Relic. Positively, it suggests meaningful valuation upside and could put NEWR into play (potentially IBM or another legacy APM vendor). It also could create some execution distraction at AppDynamics.""RELATED:Cisco Systems Nabs AppDynamics For $3.7 Billion, Just Before IPO

59,CA,"Analysts backpedaled Monday from a collective theory in February that cybersecurity spending would slump in 2016, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) garnered an upgrade on continued acquisition chatter.IBD's 25-company Computer Software-Security industry group toppled 7.4% and 7.2% in back-to-back sessions last month after Tableau Software (DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD) issued gloomy guidance. Since then, however, the group has rebounded 28%.""Based on conversations post-RSA, our security spending concerns have diminished,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury wrote in a research report Monday, referring to the annual RSA cybersecurity conference this month in San Francisco, which more than 40,000 people attended.CyberArk's bread and butter -- privileged account security -- remains a top spending priority in 2016, Nandury wrote. He upgraded CyberArk stock to a buy and boosted his price target to 50 from 30.Nandury noted his upgrade is supported ""with persistent chatter of CyberArk as a potential acquisition candidate, while limiting downside from current levels."" Last month, rumors arose that fellow Israeli firm Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) might be eyeing CyberArk.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, CyberArk stock was up a fraction, near 39. The IBD security software group was down a fraction, hurt by a 16% plunge for NQ Mobile (NQ) stock. NQ announced Monday that a subsidiary of China's Tsinghua Holdings would not be able to proceed with a planned acquisition of NQ subsidiary FL Mobile.Enterprises are shifting some spending from endpoints to privileged account spending, where CyberArk leads, Nandury wrote. Surveys show cybersecurity spending at the forefront of chief information officers' minds driven by ""state-sponsored breaches and hacker collectives.""""Chief information officers understand that once hackers penetrate the perimeter, they look to hack privileged accounts (super-user and administrative accounts) to get to the data,"" he wrote. ""Securing privileged accounts then takes on great importance.""Nandury sees CyberArk hitting its 30% sales growth target as it aggressively expands headcount. Sales and marketing spending is expected to remain in the 35%-40% range, he says.But days before Nandury's upgrade, William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho cut his 2017 estimates on CyberArk to take a conservative investment viewpoint. However, Ho still rates CyberArk stock at outperform.For 2017, Ho sees $1.12 earnings per share ex items vs. earlier views for $1.37. He cut pro forma operating margin to 21.2% from 26.3%, and projects 27.3% billings growth vs. earlier expectations for 33.6% growth.CyberArk's December-quarter results were impressive, considering their difficult comparison, Ho wrote in his report. He expects CyberArk to continue market share gains against CA Technologies (CA) and Dell.Like Nandury, he noted that CyberArk says it hasn't seen a drop-off in demand. A January CIO survey by Piper Jaffray shows internal access management, which includes CyberArk's crown-jewel-protecting core, as the fourth-most-important spending target for 2016.Endpoint, compliance and Web-access firewall led the survey in terms of spending priorities.

61,CA,"Now that most companies have reported their latest quarterly earnings, let's see which IBD Dividend Leaders show the biggest dividend growth.The top three in Monday's IBD are all tech stocks, which are known more for investing heavily in research and development than for paying out dividends. But a few older tech names have become more recent entrants to the dividend-paying universe.Cisco Systems (CSCO) tops the list with 42% long-term growth in its cash payout. The San Jose-based chipmaker, which began paying dividends in 2011, reported fiscal Q2 earnings in February that topped views. It raised its payout by 24% to 26 cents a share, or $1.04 for the full year, which works out to a 3.9% yield. That's well ahead of the S&P 500's average 2.2% payout.Cisco's annual profit gains have slowed from the company's younger years, but they remain quite steady. Its three-year Earnings Stability Factor is 1 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile). Its three-year earnings growth rate is 5%. The stock is trading between its converged 10-week and 40-week moving average lines. It's been consolidating for nearly a year in a 26% deep, undefined pattern.Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) comes in second with a 23% dividend growth rate. The San Diego-based company, which started paying dividends in 2003, offers a quarterly payout of 48 cents a share, or $1.92 annualized, for a 3.7% yield.Qualcomm shares rose the past three weeks, after having trended mostly lower since July 2014. They're now back above the 10-week moving average but still submerged 8% below the falling 40-week line.CA (CA) has been paying dividends regularly since 1990. The New York-based enterprise software maker pays 25 cents a share on a quarterly basis, for a 3.4% annualized yield. The stock has climbed back above its 10-week and 40-week lines and is 12% off its 52-week high. Shares have been consolidating for nearly 13 months.

62,CA,"Biotech Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) soared Thursday, even as the market overall crashed, after its hepatitis B vaccine beat GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) standard product in a late-stage clinical trial.Dynavax said that its vaccine, Hepislav-B, showed a 95.4% rate of peak seroprotection, in contrast with only 81.3% for Glaxo's Engerix-B. Dynavax focused especially on patients with diabetes mellitus, who don't respond well to current vaccines and treatments. In the study, the seroprotection rate for Hepislav-B was 90%, as opposed to Engerix-B's 65.1%.The study also showed that the two vaccines had similar safety profiles. A number of adverse events occurred in both arms, mostly autoimmune-related, but Dynavax said that they were not related to vaccinations.Dynavax said that it will file for U.S. approval of Hepislav-B by the end of this quarter. Dynavax had already tried and failed to win approval in 2013, but the company says that it's now addressed all the issues that the FDA raised at the time.Dynavax stock was up nearly 30% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 27.50.William Blair analyst Katherine Xu raised her price target on Dynavax stock to 45 from 42 while maintaining her outperform rating.""We maintain our estimate for a Heplisav launch in the United States in third quarter 2016 in the full adult population, with $600 million in peak sales eight years into launch,"" Xu wrote in her research note. ""We expect potential approval in Europe to occur in 2019 after post-marketing studies to expand the safety database.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis was also positive on approval prospects but expressed slight concern about safety.""(The) autoimmune debate/overhang (was) not completely put to rest,"" Simeonidis wrote in his research note. ""There was an imbalance of new-onset autoimmune events in the trial: 8 in Heplisav arm vs. 1 in Engerix arm. Management mentioned that in the overall safety dataset, this imbalance is not there.""Dynavax still isn't expected to turn a profit until 2018, as it does not have any other products out yet.

But Toronto-based ToolBox Solutions should provide SPS with enough analytics tools to grow revenue from grocery stores and pharmacies for years to come.Minneapolis-based SPS Commerce disclosed the $22.9 million purchase of ToolBox on Wednesday, before the market open, in the midst of the stock market tumble. It had closed 2015 last Thursday near 70, 10% off an Oct. 12 high. On the first trading day of 2016, it fell 3.4%, then 1.5% Tuesday. It closed down 3.2% Wednesday after its morning announcement.SPS Commerce stock was trading down nearly 2% as of early afternoon in the stock market today, although it had fallen more than 1% Thursday morning.Needham analyst Scott Berg said Thursday in a research note that the purchase price at 3.8 times ToolBox's estimated 2016 revenue is ""in line for pure Software-as-a-Service-based software vendors that are marginally profitable.""SPS said ToolBox may improve earnings by the first quarter of 2017. It said ToolBox should add about $1.45 million in sales in the current Q1 2016 but may take $300,000 off of adjusted earnings. For all of 2016, SPS said ToolBox should add $6 million in revenue and negatively impact adjusted EBITDA by about $800,000, as SPS absorbs $1.4 million in amortization expenses related to the purchase.SPS software serves about 60,000 customers in more than 60 countries throughout retailers' supply chains, including manufacturers, suppliers and distributors. Needham's Berg said: ""The ToolBox analytics solutions are similar to SPSC's current Collaboration Analytics offering but add specific subvertical strength in grocery, convenience stores and pharmacy stores.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect SPS to report earnings per share up 17% to 21 cents for Q4 when it releases 2015 performance Feb. 3, on revenue up 19% to $42.2 million. For the year, they expect EPS up 20% to 78 cents, on revenue up 24% to $158.4 million.A member of IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group, SPS carries a $1.06 billion market cap, 5-1/2 years after going public, and an 81 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

66,CA," In most Presidential election years, the most important vote is the vote for President of the United States. This year, the most important vote looks like the vote for control of the Senate. Regardless of who wins the White House, the freedom that Americans have taken for granted -- taken too much for granted, for far too long -- can be destroyed by whomever the next President puts on the Supreme Court.Since the Senate has the power to approve or disapprove whatever nominee any President wants to put on the High Court, that makes the Senate this country's last line of defense against any headstrong President who puts his or her own power ahead of the freedom of more than 300 million Americans and of future generations.The Senate is also the last line of defense against any President who exceeds his or her own authority, and thereby destroys the Constitution's balance of power among the three branches of government that has kept this country free for more than two centuries.If either party -- whether Democrats or Republicans -- unites behind a President with no regard for the Constitution, that party can change the fundamental nature of American government, leaving not only the incumbent President, but future Presidents as well, able to rule virtually by decree.When the Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress, as well as the White House, we came dangerously close to that, with President Obama virtually repealing the immigration laws passed by Congress and issuing executive orders on this and other issues that simply took over the legislative power from Congress.Fortunately, there was still a third branch of government -- the federal judiciary -- which put a stop to some of these illegal actions. But, if that third branch of government is also taken over by one party, there is nothing left as a barrier against unbridled power.The Democrats are united behind Hillary Clinton in a way that the Republicans are by no means united behind Donald Trump. Mrs. Clinton also has overwhelming support by the media in a way that Mr. Trump never has and never will have.If either of these headstrong and self-centered individuals were to overstep the Constitutional boundaries as President of the United States, and endanger the freedom of Americans, only Donald Trump faces any real danger of being impeached by the House of Representatives and then being removed from office by the Senate.This is not to predict that either of them will in fact be impeached by the House and removed by the Senate. But penalties exist in the law not just to punish people, but to deter them from doing things that the penalties are there to prevent.Trump would be on a shorter leash, even if the Republicans controlled the Senate. And there is no way that he doesn't know that fact, with some Republicans already refusing to endorse his candidacy and some even announcing that they plan to vote for Hillary Clinton.But, with the Democrats controlling the Senate, Mrs. Clinton would know that she had a blank check, instead of a Constitutional check on her powers. With the Senate and the media on her side, there would be virtually nothing she could not get away with.Control of the Senate matters hugely, no matter who gets into the White House. It matters for the future of the Supreme Court, on which the rule of law depends, and it matters for keeping any President from running this country like a banana republic.The politically divided government, which the media so often and so loudly lament, may be all that can keep the next four years from being the last four years for Constitutional government and the freedom that depends on it.Republican control of the Senate is a necessary, but by no means sufficient, precondition for keeping a headstrong President within bounds. There are still painful memories of the preemptive surrender when Senator Lindsey Graham announced that he was going to vote to confirm Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, even before she had been examined by the Senate.Regardless of who wins the White House or the Senate, the voters are going to have to keep their feet to the fire, to make sure that Senators do not simply take the path of least resistance. That path usually leads downhill, sometimes very far downhill.Thomas Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CA

67,CA,"CyberArk Software's (CYBR) focus on ""privileged access management"" (PAM) puts the security provider in a good position amid trends in cyberattacks, says Pacific Crest Securities, which initiated coverage of the Israel-based firm with a sector weight rating based on valuation.Guggenheim Securities, meanwhile, initiated coverage on security software maker Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) with a neutral rating.Hackers often aim to compromise networks by targeting employees or management with administrative access to company computer systems.""CyberArk's technology protects, monitors and manages privileged accounts, which are the cornerstones of exploitation in today's megahacks,"" said Rob Owen, a Pacific Crest analyst, in a research report.Yet, he said that ""with lofty expectations reflected in its valuation, we would look to get more constructive on a valuation reset or further evidence of an inflection in TAM (total addressable market. ... with CyberArk trading on par with companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) that exhibit higher revenue growth expectations, greater revenue visibility and similar margins, it appears the market is optimistically contemplating both the significant PAM opportunity that lies beyond the forecast horizon and CyberArk's potential to drive significant operating leverage through its growth arc.""IBD'S TAKE: Valuations of many software security firms are down from a year ago, leading some analysts to speculation that M&A may pick up.

70,CA,"If investors got everything they wanted from Citrix Systems' (CTXS) decision to spin off the GoTo family of businesses, why did Citrix stock fall like a dead weight Wednesday morning?Perhaps because analysts can see more clearly now the work and time still required to achieve their goals.Shares tumbled 8% after the morning bell in the stock market today, after the CEO late Tuesday announced that Citrix would spin off its GoTo family of businesses into its own publicly traded corporation, designed as a tax-free deal for investors, unlike an outright sale might have been.Citrix is a leading enabler of the migration to cloud computing by selling software as a service.Citrix is ""on the right track, but the path is still uphill,"" wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Rob Owens in a research note issued after the disclosures.""Overall, we view management's operational announcements as necessary for the future of the business, but see increased near-term execution risk and continued lackluster growth. We remain on the sidelines.""Owens reiterated a ""sector weight"" rating without a price target.Shares were trading down 9% at 71.32 by early afternoon, about 14% off a three-year high near 84 set Oct. 28.With a healthy Composite Rating of 91, Citrix is a member of IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group, third in market capitalization behind VMware (VM) and CA (CA). VMware market value is about $24 billion with CA at about half that size. Citrix's market value stands at $10.9 billion.The uphill path will require the layoff of about 1,000 employees and contractors outside the GoTo family separation — that is happening this month and in January, Citrix said — and the reduction of other Citrix operating expenses by $200 million in the next 18 months, most of which will occur in 2016.Also, ""to achieve this focus (on Citrix's core software virtualization businesses), the company will end investment in certain other products and programs, in some cases moving technologies into strategic products, in other cases providing an orderly end-of-life to noncore products,"" the company said.""The evaluation of all products, technologies, offerings and programs is ongoing, and will focus on enterprise readiness, ability to drive customer value, and growth and profitability prospects.""The surviving Citrix, with roughly $2.6 billion in sales, will include the application virtualization, network management and performance management software businesses handling XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile and NetScaler products.The spinoff will be composed of GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper and OpenVoice, products with combined sales of about $600 million for the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the company said.The company plans to fold underlying Bytemobile technologies into the NetScaler platform, while winding down Bytemobile, Podio and WorkspacePod.Currently, Citrix is ""too broad and complex,"" Bob Calderoni, the interim CEO of Citrix, told analysts after Tuesday's announcement. Calderoni succeeded 14-year CEO Mark Templeton in July. He'd been under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.Immediately following the separation, Citrix shareholders will own shares in two publicly traded companies.Citrix has been studying the reorganization since midyear and has retained Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners as financial advisers.""Upon review, it is clear to us that the GoTo family of products is best suited to grow and operate as a stand-alone business,"" said Calderoni in the announcement. ""This separation will create a leading, pure-play SaaS (software-as-a-service) company that will have a targeted focus with the flexibility to invest in its portfolio of products.""It will also allow Citrix to refocus and amplify investment in our core mission to enable secure and reliable delivery of apps and data for the modern enterprise. We look forward to a seamless transition for our employees, customers, partners and other key stakeholders.""Chris Hylen, senior vice president and general manager of the Citrix Mobility Apps business unit, will serve as CEO of the spinoff company. Calderoni said that a CEO for Citrix will be announced ""in the not too distant future."" Candidates are being vetted currently.After the announcement, responding to a securities analyst who wondered if the new CEO would be hamstrung by being required to spin off the GoTo family, Calderoni said his successor's job would be easier.""The worst CEO job to have is to be the head of a company that is spread too wide and too thin,"" said Calderoni. ""We're setting up the company very well. It will be focused, and it'll be profitable . .. . Investment dollars are hard to find when you're trying to feed too many things.""Bhavan Suri, a William Blair analyst, anticipated the spinoff in a research note last week.""We estimate the GoTo assets to contribute approximately 57 cents EPS in 2016 (assuming 6.5% sales growth and 18% operating margin on a stand-alone basis),"" Suri wrote. ""This would result in an implied stock price of $14.26 and is based on a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times, which we believe is reasonable, given that we suspect the company could not find a buyer for the segment (excluding ShareFile) at 4.5 times 2016 revenue.""The software maker said in July that it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3.65 to $3.75 a share, where analysts had modeled $3.56.Acknowledging the ""disruption"" that spinning off GoTo products will cause, Citrix is now guiding net revenue growth of 1% to 2%, an adjusted operating margin ""of at least 28%,"" and adjusted earnings of $4.40 to $4.50 per share for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2016.For the current fiscal 2015, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate adjusted EPS of $3.88 on revenue of $3.25 billion, with revenue increasing to $3.4 billion in 2016. The company says that 2017 revenue likely will grow 4% to 5%; the company is targeting an adjusted operating margin of ""at least"" 30% by then.""Citrix is still a very relevant IT player,"" said FBR analyst Daniel Ives in a research note, ""and now it all comes down to leveraging that position into tangential growth opportunities within the data center and cloud computing shift, with all eyes on rekindling growth on its core desktop/cloud franchise. We maintain our outperform rating.""Citrix peer VMWare's stock was down 2.6% in early afternoon trade Wednesday. CA Technologies was up 3.9% on a dividend increase and increased share buyback program.

And I said this yesterday morning.....stocks had become a bit oversold and were due for a small bounce...and that is what we got - BUT this morning US futures are pointing significantly lower - currently down 14 pts as we prepare for a slew of US macro data reports..........Overnight global mkts didn't perform much better......as none of them at the moment seem to be able to find their Chi either. Bargain hunting may have been the theme yesterday.....but as the countdown to next Wednesday continues - the tone is decidedly bearish......Emerging mkt countries getting whacked, European stocks at 2 month lows, and oil - down 14% since December  1st - is headed for its worst week since the summer.Yesterday's  bounce, though welcomed, was only a diversion from the range of concerns that we have been talking about for months now.... - But the overriding theme continues to be the oil story and the FED story....and  until we see oil stabilize, stocks will continue to struggle.  I mean what we really need to see is for stocks to decouple from oil and from every single word that the FED speaks........but that does not look like it's going to happen just yet......After all that is said - guess what - we are still range bound (2030/2100) ......the S&P has to find support at 2030 today (100 dma) for that to remain true... a break here will open the flood gates....the mkt will test 2000 on the S&P quickly - but that is only a psychological level....there is no real support there at all.....keep your eyes focused on the 1950/1975 range as the next real stop in terms of where we might find support if we break. I mean look - the mkt is trying to move past both the oil story and the FED story.....but the nervousness over what the future looks like is clear...in the past week the VIX (Fear Index) has shot up 30%  - suggesting that investors/traders remain anxious over FED policy and the real state of the economy.  As much as we think the mkt has discounted the coming rate hike (and I think it has as well) investors/traders remain skeptical about FUTURE rate hikes and FED policy.  So - All eyes are laser focused the Fed’s FOMC meeting next week.... 95% of business and academic economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal agree that the Fed will raise the benchmark rate on Wednesday and on average participants estimated that the probability now stands at 87%, up from 71% last month.   In fact 82% of economists surveyed said they thought the Fed’s credibility would be damaged if it didn’t raise rates next week.  And why?  Because they have painted themselves into a corner... insisting, banging on the table that the time was right......Look - THEY have created this monster....with their wishy washy stance all year long....Today we get a slew of US eco data - data that will provide one last peek at the state of the economy and the consumer before the final bell tolls...........and this morning the mkt is suggesting that we may be disappointed......At 8:30 we will get Retail Sales - exp of +0.3%, ex autos and gas of +0.4%.....PPI - Producer Price Index - is exp to show 0% move.....ex food and energy is expected to be +0.1%, while PPI final demand year over year is expected to be negative 1.4%.   But on the brighter side - the U of Mich Sentiment Index is expected to rise to 92.  (Of course it will...) because the consumer is feeling so good about the current state of affairs....I will be speaking at the Investor's Business Daily -  Level 4 - Master's Program  on Saturday, December 12th at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel in Santa Monica, CA.  ""Evolution of the US Capital Markets - 1980 - 2015""   It is a overview of what was, what is and how we got here.

73,CA,"Investing in fixed-income mutual funds rewarded investors with annual returns of 5% to 10% over the past 10 years in an environment of low interest rates. Which bond funds got the winning ticket and how did they get there?The IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards include U.S. taxable bond, municipal bond and foreign bond funds that have at least $100 million in assets and beat their benchmark index for all four performance periods studied: one year, three years, five years and 10 years.In the U.S. taxable bond universe, top-performing funds are Pimco Fixed Income Shares C (FXICX), TCW Total Return Bond I (TGLMX) and American Century Zero Coupon 2025 Inv (BTTRX) with average 10-year performance of 10.20%, 6.82% and 6.62%, respectively.Click Here To View The Top Performing Funds By CategoryPimco's $1.5 billion fund invests at least 80% of its net assets into U.S. government and corporate debt, but also holds small allocations in non-U.S. debt. In addition, it has about 9% in securitized bonds, such as agency and nonagency residential as well as commercial mortgages. Management was not available for comment.TCW's $9.5 billion fund has benefited from a strong recovery in mortgages since the credit crisis. Over 70% of the fund is in securitized debt, including 35% in agency and 12% in nonagency residential mortgage-backed securities, as well as a 9% allocation in commercial MBS and 14% in asset-backed securities.TCW fund manager Bryan Whalen points to three main drivers behind the mutual fund's solid relative performance last year. First, there was ""almost no exposure to the corporate credit market."" The performance of that market relative to similar-duration Treasuries was -161 basis points, or 1.61%, whereas almost 50% of the fund was in agency mortgages and the excess returns in that sector relative to Treasuries was only -5 basis points or -0.05%, explained Whalen, who's been on board the fund since 2009.""So the exceptional outperformance of mortgages relative to investment-grade corporate bonds was one driver,"" Whalen said. ""The second one was: where we were taking on more credit risk, we were doing it in what in hindsight turned out to be the best place to place your credit chips last year, which was nonagency mortgage-backed securities. . . That sector was up over 3% last year. . . and it was roughly 25% of the fund in 2015.""The third contributor to the fund’s outperformance was its slight underweight in duration vs. the index. ""Interest rates last year rose by about 25 bps and this fund had about a year less duration than the index and so that was a benefit as well,"" said Whalen.In the nontaxable universe, the top-performing municipal bond fund was Ivy Municipal High Income I (WYMHX) with an average 10-year return of 5.6%. Over shorter periods of time, several California muni funds did well, including Franklin CA High Yield Municipal A (FCAMX), Nuveen CA Municipal Bond I (NCSPX) and Northern CA Tax-Exempt (NCATX) scoring five-year average returns of 8.59%, 8.06% and 7.50%, respectively.Ivy Funds fund manager Michael Walls explained that in addition to providing high levels of tax-exempt income to investors, the fund also strives to limit volatility. To do so, managers try to focus on the credit cycles: ""If you look back to '06, '07 and the beginning of '08, we didn’t feel like we were getting adequately compensated for risk."" So they deployed some money into one-off trades but kept liquidity high to exploit a potential credit-widening event. As a result, the fund underperformed in '06 and '07, but was able to take advantage of market opportunities in the second half of '08.""We were defensive. I had the duration of the product at just over five years, which was about 50% short the benchmark and we were higher quality,"" said Walls. ""So we ended up having extremely good performance . . . when other funds had considerable outflows, we had liquidity to reinvest in projects, for example health care.""The $1.4 billion fund currently has an underweight in health care and an overweight in transportation and education revenue bonds. It yields 4.3% and charges a 0.68% fee.In the foreign bond category, only two funds made the cut of having at least $100 million in assets and beating their benchmarks in each of the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years: Pimco Foreign Bond (USD Hedged) I (PFORX) and Consulting Group International Fund I (TIFUX). They each returned 6.14% and 4.90% over the past 10 years, respectively.Pimco's $7.7 billion fund invests the bulk of its assets in government debt of the eurozone and Japan. London-based CIO global fixed income Andrew Balls took over the fund in 2014, bringing global fixed-income market expertise with him.""Management shifts the regional weight quite a lot, including over short periods,"" said senior manager research analyst Mara Dobrescu of Morningstar. For example, last year, the manager increased the fund's stake in Japan from 20% in 2014 to 37% in 2015, ""because he basically found that the longer-dated Japanese government and agency debt was really more attractive than the similar European issues.""The fund also doesn't shy away from investing in emerging market bonds. ""In early 2015, the team significantly reduced the fund's stake in Brazil due to a lack of clarity following the election. They have generally stayed out of Russia as risks were deemed too high in the context of pressure on commodity prices. However, the manager kept a position on Mexico, where he sees still-solid growth and benefits from the country's trade ties with the U.S., with a preference for local Mexican debt over external debt,"" she said.Major contributors to performance last year were its overweight in Spanish and Italian government bonds. It also had a small foreign currency overlay, including some short positions on the euro, Japanese yen and some Asian currencies, she explained. In addition, the fund’s 0.50% fee is below its peers.

76,CA,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) garnered another buyout prediction Wednesday, as Summit Redstone relaunched coverage with a buy rating on CyberArk stock, saying its double-digit growth trajectory makes it a ""compelling"" acquisition candidate.Summit analyst Srini Nandury expects the information security company to continue to gain from the high-profile breaches of Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT), and the whistleblower cases involving Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning) and Edward Snowden, because of the niche that CyberArk fills in privileged account security.""Unlike other parts of the security landscape, privileged account security (PAS) still remains a greenfield opportunity given that businesses have under-invested for a long time, leaving their critical infrastructure vulnerable,"" Nandury wrote in a research report.CyberArk has near-term and first-mover advantages, but could see rivalry from Exceedium (acquired last year by CA (CA)), Lieberman Software, Centrify and BalaBit.Total addressable market estimates range from $2 billion to $10 billion, Nandury wrote.CyberArk is ""profitable and prolifically cash-generating,"" making it a rarity among rivals, he wrote. Over the past six quarters, CyberArk beats sales views by 20% and EPS views by even more, he said.""We expect the beats and raises to continue, driven by elevated spending and increased sales capacity,"" Nandury wrote.He has a 55 price target on CyberArk stock, which rose 2.3% to 46.54 on the stock market today.

87,CA,"Gene-sequencing giant Illumina (ILMN) pre-announced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed estimates Monday, sending its stock tumbling after hours.Illumina said Q3 revenue totaled $550 million, up 14% from the year-earlier quarter but $19 million short of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. The company also said it expects Q4 revenue of $570 million, up 11% from last year but $32 million shy of Wall Street's estimate.That adds up to 18% sales growth for the year, vs. analysts' expectations of 21% growth. The company will report final Q3 results on Oct. 20.""Demand for sequencing consumables and the HiSeq family of instruments remained strong during the quarter, while instrument sales in the desktop family underperformed our expectations,"" Illumina CEO Jay Flatley said in a statement. ""Geographically, we were disappointed with instrument sales in Europe and continued weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite this 3% shortfall to expectations, our competitive position and product development pipeline are as strong as ever.""The announcement continued a recent stretch of bad news for Illumina, starting with its surprise Q2 revenue miss after a long record of beating estimates. Last week, the stock also suffered after Leerink analyst Dan Leonard downgraded it, writing that he saw the current product cycle as being lighter on upgrades and replacements than previous cycles. The unexpectedly early launch of a competing gene-sequencing product from Pacific Biosciences (PACB) also has weighed on shares.""We had been cautioning for some time that 3Q/4Q estimates looked aggressive and thus today's negative pre-announcement does not come as a massive surprise,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken in an email to clients. ""The key question for us remains what helps to re-accelerate instrument growth (key driver of multiple) and what will the company offer at JPM (the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference) in a few months of time to swing sentiment. With modest competition also entering the market we expect the uncertainty to keep shares range bound at depressed levels and we await further clarity prior to revisiting our thesis.""Illumina's stock was thus already down 32% from its July 20 high when it closed down a fraction at 163.50 in regular trade Monday. An hour after the close, it was down 13% to about 142. Pacific Biosciences was down about 5% after hours, perhaps on the assumption of overall weakness in the sequencing market.Illumina still holds an excellent EPS Rank of 98, but a Relative Strength Rating of only 35.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

107,CA,"Former federal prosecutor Joseph DiGenova stirred the Hillary Clinton hornets' nest Tuesday when he said on talk radio that he is convinced ""she's not going to be able to complete her campaign"" because ""she's going to have to be charged with a crime.""""Her biggest problem right now is the FBI. They're not going away,"" DiGenova said on the ""Laura Ingraham Show."" ""They have reached a critical mass in their investigation of the secretary and all of her senior staff. And it's going to come to a head, I would suggest, in the next 60 days. And I predict Hillary will not make it to the finish line.""DiGenova said that investigators have found more than 1,200 classified emails from the private Clinton account, and he indicated that they are likely to recover more from her hard drive. The evidence that the FBI is finding against her is so compelling that Attorney General Loretta Lynch will have no choice but to charge Clinton, he believes. If Lynch resists, ""there will be a massive revolt inside the FBI, which she will not be able to survive as an attorney general. It will be like Watergate.""So overwhelming is the evidence, explains DiGenova, that if there's no indictment, the FBI ""will never be able to charge another federal employee with the negligent handling of classified information. The intelligence community will not stand for that. They will fight for indictment.""The only way to know if DiGenova's comments are grounded on strong inside sources, or if he's speculating based on his experience and observations, is to wait. But he does add an interesting component to the campaign: What if Clinton is indeed indicted in two months? What happens to her campaign? Does she stay on the trail? Or does she suspend the campaign while justice plays out?We can safely say she won't plead guilty. She's a Clinton. They don't do that. Accepting blame and admitting guilt isn't in their political handbook.The possibility that Clinton is nominated by the Democrats and then elected by the voters in November, all the while awaiting a court date, is troubling. Would her party still nominate her, and would a simple majority of voters pull the lever for her, after she had been charged? It's frightening to know that in today's America we cannot categorically rule out these scenarios. The electorate, as the past two presidential elections and the rabid support for Donald Trump have shown, has lost its mind.For his part, DiGenova believes that Clinton is ""not going to be able to complete her campaign."" If she's charged, dropping out is the most agreeable outcome. There are a lot of us who don't want to see the White House operating out of the female federal corrections institution in Dublin, Ca., for eight years.Follow Kerry Jackson on Twitter @IBD_KJackson.

121,CA,"Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt and on Facebook.Better-than-expected results couldn't help Red Hat (RHT) stock Tuesday, with shares of the enterprise software company succumbing to concerns over billing as well as a sharp market downturn.Red Hat shares were trading down almost 2% to near 72 in the stock market today, virtually wiping out gains from the prior day. Investors had bid up shares Monday ahead of the after-hours earnings report.Some analysts attributed the losses to the market's general downturn. The Nasdaq was down about 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell more than 1.5% as they approached midday trading.But it wasn't just that, some said, as Red Hat also disappointed with its billing numbers. Oppenheimer's Brian Schwartz noted that although currency changes affected valuations by 8%, billing growth of 9% still fell short of expectations.""Billings (at) 9% is not enough to excite investors and it is the slowest growth for them in eight quarters with tougher year-to-year billings comparisons lying ahead,"" Schwartz said.On Monday, Red Hat reported second-quarter earnings of 47 cents a share, up 15% from a year ago and 3 cents ahead of forecasts from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 13% to $504 million, ahead of views for $494.7 million.The maker of open-source Linux operating systems also predicted full-year earnings and revenue that were ahead of estimates. Red Hat expects fiscal 2016 earnings of $1.85 to $1.87 a share, up from the $1.83 forecast and 12% ahead of 2015 at the midpoint.

122,CA,"Accounting benefits for phone companies have made some telecom investors scratch their heads, and upcoming revenue-recognition changes for software companies could be the next conundrum.The good news for technology stock investors is that the accounting changes for software companies have been ""effectively delayed until 2018,"" says a Citigroup report. The bad news is that there's a long list of companies that would be impacted.They include: Adobe Systems (ADBE), security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK).Industry ""deliberations"" over the new software revenue accounting standards will heat up in Fall, 2015, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a report. ""Proposed changes are significant and make revenue treatment less conservative,"" he said.Accounting standards bodies FASB and IASB proposed the changes in international revenue accounting in 2014.Pritchard notes that the accounting changes come just as the industry is shifting toward cloud computing's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model and subscription-based revenue, rather than one-time licensing fees.""We see the non-SaaS subscription contracts such as those employed by Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK), CA, Guidewire Software (GWRE), Jive Software (JIVE), Microsoft and Splunk to be most at risk to change, with revenue timing accelerated.""The new accounting rules ""could provide more of an incentive for companies to change contract terms in order to accelerate revenue and achieve quarterly targets, something that current rules make more difficult. Beyond subscription revenue treatment, we also see other proposed changes that could drive more inconsistent allocation of revenue between product (license-appliances) and ratable sources (maintenance support) as well as separation of hosting arrangements from software in certain SaaS arrangements,"" Pritchard said.The accounting changes, Pritchard speculates, could ""make it difficult to compare reported revenue between native SaaS companies (like Salesforce) and flexible SaaS companies (like Oracle and SAP).""In a separate report, Morgan Stanley on Thursday said more than 50 ""pension heavy"" companies have recently changed their GAAP accounting, thereby redefining pension costs, and sometimes eliminating pension costs from adjusted earnings. They include Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), Honeywell (HON) and AT&T (T).Telecom companies have roiled earnings by introducing wireless financing plans for mobile phones. The EIP (equipment installment plans) pull forward earnings by booking equipment revenue on the date of sale. T-Mobile's (TMUS) aggressive Uncarrier promotions started the EIP trend, and AT&T followed. Sprint (S) more recently has introduced leasing plans that boost EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter: @IBD_RKrause.

137,CA,"Stocks spiked sharply higher yesterday morning but then lost some ground as investors/traders digested another mixed batch of economic news (ADP) and earnings (Walt Disney (DIS) - the standout disappointment). This then caused 'renewed' speculation about WWTFDN (What will the Fed do NOW?) - causing so many to suggest that they won't do anything in September......So the indexes wallowed back and forth falling from their highs of the day - but not collapsing at all.
"
138,CA,"Given all the chatter from the Fed and their 'representatives' about raising interest rates, yesterday's ADP private payroll report - stunned them.....(So much for that improving labor market) - Job growth was a big disappointment at 185K vs. expectations of 215K, and last month - revised lower, So traders immediately took this as a sign that this weak jobs report might cause the Fed to hesitate.
"
139,CA,"Then we got the Disney earnings - and guess what - not so good.....they reported another big miss on their TV networks and amusement park revenues - the stock plunged 9% taking the DOW index with it. Talk of a slowing economy once again takes the spotlight (Yawn)....... Now - it may not be a good sign that the Disney theme parks underperformed - but I have to ask - Have YOU been to one lately?
"
140,CA,"For a family of 4 you have to fly to FL (or CA), - and at today's airfares that will run you $3000, pay $940 just for the 3-day pass (or upgrade for another $40 each to get what exactly?), or you could get the VIP guided tour for a mere $500/hour if you so choose, get a hotel room for $500/night or $1500 plus tax, buy breakfast, lunch and dinner at ridiculous prices - $15 eggs, $8 cokes and $10 frozen meat patties (I refuse to call them burgers) - and then be subjected to standing in long lines waiting to get on a 3 minute ride while the kids are screaming, crying, fighting, ....so after it's all said and done - this family has spent a minimum of $7k or $8k - but probably closer to $10k or $12k after you buy all the Disney 'stuff' for 3 days and have they really had a good time? (I mean be honest here).
"
141,CA,"How many times can you take a picture with Minnie Mouse , Cinderella or Jasmine? So it may not be a good sign for Disney but I am not sure that it means the economy is slowing or worsening - I think it means that people don't want that kind of vacation. I think the mindset is changing a bit.....I think families want a different experience - and with a stronger dollar - taking your family to Europe is more of a option............So I think the vacation dollars are just being spent more wisely. Again - maybe not so good for Disney - but it is good for families.

Yesterday - it managed to trade back above short-term supports at 2094 to close higher at 2099. This morning - Futures are flat as the market awaits tomorrows NFP report. I suspect that the market will find support right in here at the 2085/2090 range.....- volumes to remain muted as we await tomorrow's report.

168,CA,"ServiceNow's (NOW) growth story is expected to continue beyond its Q4 earnings report after the close Wednesday, as the company moves beyond its core software for information technology departments.One of fastest-growing tech companies, ServiceNow provides software that manages information requests among departments and users of various devices. The company's cloud software has taken share from bigger rivals including Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), CA Technologies (CA) and BMC Software.ServiceNow, which rose 21% in 2014, was down more than 1% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 67.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect ServiceNow to report Q4 earnings per share minus items of 2 cents, swinging from a 2-cent loss in the year-earlier period.Revenue is expected to jump 55% to $193.7 million.The company's Q4 numbers could contain even more upside as its software gets used beyond IT departments, moving into other departments such as human resources, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for the Evercore Group.""There is a fair amount of conservatism in those numbers on the Street,"" he told IBD. ""You see this company beat and raise fairly consistently since it's gone public. At the end of the day, there is probably some room for upside in the year-to-year growth rate.""There are no signs of any slowness for Q4, Richard Davis, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity, said in a research note Monday. He rates ServiceNow stock a buy.""The firm continues to execute quite well. Our checks with deployment partners indicate very high levels of activity and optimism,"" he wrote. ""For the past four quarters this management team has beaten our revenue forecasts by 2-3%, which translates into $4-$6 million in dollar terms. This management team knows how to play the 'guidance game,' so it would not surprise us to see a similar magnitude upside this quarter.""For the current quarter, analysts expect break-even EPS vs. a loss of 8 cents a share in the year-earlier period.Revenue is expected to rise 46% to $202.9 million.The company appears ready to crack new markets, including human resources and financial management, Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group, said in a research report last week. He has a positive rating on the stock.""We think 2015 is the year ServiceNow materially breaks out of IT into other domains,"" he wrote. ""As ServiceNow grows into more of a platform company that can serve multiple business units with both packed apps and custom-built capabilities, engagements should start to happen more at the C-level outside of IT.""
"
169,CA,"ServiceNow (NOW) may have found the ticket to becoming a multibillion-dollar revenue company, but it will put the company in competition with a new and bigger rival.
"
170,CA,"The enterprise software company is expanding its core IT service-management (ITSM) software into new areas, including human resources, sales and marketing departments.
"
171,CA,"Already known as one of the fastest growing companies in the technology space, ServiceNow gave its followers a taste of its new capabilities on April 23 when it reported that 34% of its revenue in Q1 came from outside of its core IT service-management business.
"
172,CA,"Revenues in Q1 grew 62% vs. the year-ago period. The company also expects annual revenue to grow to as much as $657 million this year. That's up 55% from a year ago.
"
173,CA,"But ServiceNow's product expansion could set the company on a much larger growth path in the next few years, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners.
"
174,CA,"""They can keep growing at those levels just in their core market for the foreseeable future, but it's more important when you look at three to five years down the road in terms of the company developing into a multibillion-dollar revenue company,"" he said.
"
175,CA,"Though the company's core IT service-management market is still growing at a strong pace, it's probably not enough to satisfy the company's desire for additional revenue growth, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.
"
176,CA,"""I'm sure they look and say, 'We want to be a $5 billion (a year) revenue company,' and you are probably not going to do that just by being in ITSM,"" he said. ""They have aspirations to be a lot bigger company, and they have built a much broader portfolio to go after new opportunities.""
"
177,CA,"ServiceNow has been growing at the expense of rivals CA (CA), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and others through its core software service, which allows companies with multiple offices to manage information requests among several departments and devices. The company's Internet-based cloud software has become a preferred alternative and replacement for bigger vendors that sell older products through a license model.
"
178,CA,"But ServiceNow appears positioned to grow beyond its core business of providing software to power service desks for IT departments, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co.
"
179,CA,"""Management is taking that concept outside of IT and into the HR department, the sales department and the marketing department,"" he said. ""This is the first time where their product has been purchased at a very high level within the organization with the intent of using it more broadly.""
"
180,CA,"Bumping Into Salesforce.com
"
181,CA,"ServiceNow's expansion is earning the company a new rivalry with Salesforce.com (CRM), the leading maker of cloud-based customer-relationship management software.
"
182,CA,"The company's stepped-up effort is running up against Salesforce's service cloud, which helps companies better manage their work with customers, says Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's chief executive.
"
183,CA,"""We see them regularly when we get closer to what they direct their service cloud at, which is these customer-facing type of applications,"" he told IBD. ""That is typically where it's possible for us to come in contention with Salesforce.""
"
184,CA,"Some analysts believe that ServiceNow's expansion effort will also bring the company into competition with Workday (WDAY).
"
185,CA,"But Slootman says that the leading provider of cloud-based human-resource management software services is a business partner and not a rival because each serves different needs.
"
186,CA,"""(When) people have requests, they have to manage knowledge and they have problems with benefits or pay, that happens in our system; and when the records themselves have to be changed about employees or policies, that happens in Workday,"" he said. ""They are a system of record, and we are a system of engagement.""
"
187,CA,"ServiceNow is expanding beyond IT service desks in response to customers who want better ways to manage information requests in other departments and across entire companies, Slootman says.
"
188,CA,"""Any department that has to respond to service requests from other people or other departments or other organizations, and it becomes a repeatable high volume of activity, a service-management system becomes incredibly important, because the amount of resources that gets consumed with these activities is insane,"" he said.
"
189,CA,"Fueling the demand are companies using older, licensed-based systems produced by companies including CA, HP, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT). Some companies even manage their data exchanges through reams of spreadsheets and e-mail, Slootman says.
"
190,CA,"""Those are the people that we replace,"" he said. ""Those are legacy vendors; they are typically not involved in new projects.""ServiceNow (NOW) may have found the ticket to becoming a multibillion-dollar revenue company, but it will put the company in competition with a new and bigger rival.The enterprise software company is expanding its core IT service-management (ITSM) software into new areas, including human resources, sales and marketing departments.Already known as one of the fastest growing companies in the technology space, ServiceNow gave its followers a taste of its new capabilities on April 23 when it reported that 34% of its revenue in Q1 came from outside of its core IT service-management business.Revenues in Q1 grew 62% vs. the year-ago period.

201,CA,"In a banquet hall in north Toronto, a condominium sales event is generating the kind of frenzy more often seen on a trading-room floor.Michael Wekerle, a former trader on Bay Street trader, technology investor, business reality-show judge and now real-estate mogul, steps up to a podium in front of about 1,600 people to make his pitch. Waterloo, an Ontario town that revolves around two universities and a burgeoning technology sector that's attracted companies such as Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and dozens of startups, is booming, he says.""It's a land grab,"" Wekerle, 52, dressed in a light gray three-piece suit and trademark sunglasses, tells the rapt crowd on a recent weekend. ""There were zero cranes when I first showed up there, and there are 15 cranes in the sky now.""He finishes his speech. Then all hell breaks loose. Prospective real-estate investors surge to the back of the room, submitting paperwork for offers on one or more units as agents in suits shout and gesture to clients, who anxiously pace the aisles. Three hours later, the 250-unit District Condos project, which cost 85 million Canadian dollars ($60 million) to build, is sold out and 170 people are added to a waiting list.The fervent demand for property in Waterloo, about 68 miles west of Toronto, highlights the city's coming-of-age as an investment destination: first by technology companies and now real estate firms looking to gain from the city's metamorphosis. Real estate investors at the event, including families, seasoned individuals and couples, were looking for higher returns than in Toronto, where homes are sold for almost double what they are in Waterloo.""It's what that fellow was talking about,"" said Bill Ring, head of operations for a property management company, referring to Wekerle. ""Students are coming in and need a place to live, tech companies are opening. It'll all drive the value up."" Ring drove two hours to attend the event and buy a one-bedroom unit. It's his first condo investment, which he intends to flip to another buyer before it's completed, taking advantage of the advertised 40% return. ""I don't want to invest in stocks because they're crazy, and real estate is a solid, safe investment.""With a population of about 140,000 people, a third of them students and 20% working in the technology industry, Waterloo has been billed as Canada's Silicon Valley. Home to BlackBerry (BBRY), Open Text (OTEX), and dozens of startups, Waterloo and its twin city Kitchener are so in demand that condo development is surging.Wekerle, who made millions trading Canadian oil and mining stocks before turning to tech, recently bought six buildings there formerly owned by smartphone-maker BlackBerry. He's currently negotiating the purchase of another three buildings in the region.""It's like lightning in a bottle -- you could try this in a hundred different places and never achieve the same type of community as what has been created"" in Kitchener-Waterloo, Sam Sebastian, country manager for Google Canada, said in statement Jan. 14 after opening a new building that will be home to more than 350 engineers as the company expands in the country.NKL Properties, the closely held developer of District Condos, guarantees the investor as much as CA$1,930 per month on units for the first two years. Units in the building range in price from CA$270,000 one-bedroom suites to two-bedroom units for about CA$340,000. Toronto-based FirstService (FSV), whose shares have risen 90% over the past 12 months, will manage the property.Nora Gharib, who recently graduated from the University of Waterloo's pharmacy program and now lives in Toronto, is considering buying a unit in the District building. ""I regret not investing in a condo there when I was in school,"" said the 28-year-old, who remembers driving 10 minutes to get a coffee at one of the only Starbucks cafes in town. Today, there are a dozen in the area.""You couldn't walk there at night before -- not even because it was dangerous, but because it was just dark and there wasn't anything there,"" she said, while looking at a unit layout at the event. ""Then buildings went up and more young people moved in. It was like watching an area blossom. It's the new Waterloo.""The vacancy rate on a bachelor unit in the Kitchener-Waterloo region was 1.5% in October 2015, a 13-year low, according to data from Canada Mortgage & Housing. That compares with 1.9% for the same type of unit in Toronto. District is one of 14 condo towers under construction or planned in the region over the next few years, according to real estate-data tracker BuzzBuzzHome.General housing market activity has also been buoyant, with average prices rising 23% to CA$346,150 in the last five years to August, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. That's behind the 42% growth in Toronto, where the average home price is CA$573,500.The rise in prices and condo development, against a record ratio of Canadian household debt to disposable income, has raised concerns that a real estate bust is brewing across the country.Deep Sachdev, a mortgage agent in Toronto, decided against buying a unit in the District project at the event. He and his wife, who already own seven units across Kitchener-Waterloo and a handful in other cities, said prices for pre-construction units are rising at about 10% each year, making the returns less compelling.""The time to get in was two years ago,"" Sachdev said. ""There's the potential for oversupply if they keep building at this pace, which won't help rents or prices.""Construction on the District tower, a few minutes walk from Wilfrid Laurier University as well as the University of Waterloo, and which will include a yoga studio and coffee bar, starts later this year and is slated for occupancy at the start of the 2018 school year.Related:Where Are The Next Tech-Fueled Real Estate Markets?Food Feeds Real-Estate Development in Edgy Areas

We are now significantly below S&P 2000 - we tested 1976 in early pre-mkt a level where I have been saying the mkt needed to go to.....but there may be a bit more to go....in fact I still think a test lower (1950) is not out of the question.  ECO data today includes Mortgage Apps  DOWN by 11.6%  and the ADP Employment Change - expected to show +195k jobs.  In addition to the other eco data points due out - the FED is due to release their DEC mins at 2 pm....I do not suspect we will learn anything new at all....it's just the usual confessional  to make them all feel better.....  Expect mkts to break lower at the opening - but do not necessarily get sucked in just yet.....a break below 1950 will surely cause the mkts to test the August lows of 1870......Take good care.

276,CA,"Focus on Tactical Allocation and Relative Value 
"
277,CA,"""Investors should consider a moderate risk-on posture in multi-asset portfolios given continued global growth and a low probability of recession in 2015. As the global economy creeps further into a slow and extended business cycle, we expect greater divergence in returns within asset classes and sectors — which means an emphasis on tactical asset allocation, careful 'bottom-up' security selection and prudent relative value decisions are going to be critical in 2015."" 
"
278,CA,"— Mihir Worah | CIO Asset Allocation and Real Return 
"
279,CA,"INTRODUCTION 
"
280,CA,"Investors already weary of a persistent low yield environment complicated by uncertainties — geopolitical tensions, plummeting oil prices, volatile currencies, to name a few — may need to prepare for another challenging year in 2015. From an asset allocation perspective, achieving target returns may be difficult. Not only do we anticipate a tug-of-war escalating between divergent monetary policies and uneven global economic growth, we also observe that 2015 begins with fuller asset valuations than in the recent past amid a persisting low yield environment. 
"
281,CA,"Yet, the picture is not entirely bleak: We anticipate a more extended business cycle through the combination of a slow-moving Fed willing to chase inflation rather than impede robust U.S. growth and increased policy stimulus from the European Central Bank (ECB) along with a continuation of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) asset purchases. As long as the odds of a recession remain low, we expect various risk assets will deliver attractive returns. In particular, we observe the equity risk premium in the U.S. relative to real rates remains close to its long-run average, reducing the probability of a sharp correction. Nevertheless, there remains significant risk of increased market volatility as we approach the start of the Fed tightening cycle. 
"
282,CA,"Our Forum conclusions 
"
283,CA,"At PIMCO's Cyclical Forum in December 2014, our investment professionals from around the world gathered to discuss how the global macro economy is likely to evolve over the coming year. Following the Forum, our portfolio management leadership team considered how the interplay between macroeconomic fundamentals, valuations, risks and market technicals is likely to impact risk and return potential across global asset classes. 
"
284,CA,"Bottom line: We believe an overweight to equity risk is still warranted and see pockets of opportunity across credit sectors. In contrast, we are modestly negative interest rate risk, and we have a neutral stance on commodities. In 2015, an emphasis on robust portfolio construction and on exploiting relative value opportunities across asset classes will be more important than the bold ""beta bets"" that have been sufficient over the past few years. 
"
285,CA,"MACROECONMIC OVERVIEW 
"
286,CA,"PIMCO's top-down macroeconomic forecasts form the backdrop for the asset allocation views that are expressed in our multi-asset portfolios. These macro views originate from our Secular and Cyclical Economic Forums, during which investment professionals from all our global offices gather in Newport Beach to discuss the outlook for economies and markets. 
"
287,CA,"Outlook for major global economies 
"
288,CA,"PIMCO expects global growth to accelerate from around 2.50% (year-over-year) in 2014 to 2.75% in 2015. We believe the majority of this improvement will come from supply-driven declines in oil prices. Acceleration in the velocity of money, driven by the transfer of incremental petrodollar cash flows from producers to consumers, is also supportive of higher global growth this year. 
"
289,CA,"Across key global economies, we expect growth in 2015 to be highly divergent, though overall somewhat stronger than in 2014. In particular, we expect U.S. and Japanese growth to pick up, reaching levels of around 3.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Dr. Ben Bernanke, the guest speaker at the December Cyclical Forum, affirmed PIMCO's view that the outlook for the U.S. economy in 2015 is incrementally positive, reflecting improving household finances and confidence as well as increasing evidence that the economic recovery is becoming self-sustaining and broad-based. 
"
290,CA,"In Japan, we expect growth to rebound due to bold action by policymakers as well as declining oil prices and a depreciating yen. However, the private sector still must confront major secular and structural headwinds. 
"
291,CA,"Among other regions, we expect to see growth in Europe of around 1.0% in 2015, higher than in 2014 but still weak. In China, we expect growth of around 6.5%, moderating downward as China continues its attempts to transition to a growth model (and growth rate) that is less reliant on credit expansion and investment. 
"
292,CA,"Cyclical inflation outlook 
"
293,CA,"Declining oil prices are likely to have a clear downside impact on global inflation data this year. In most developed economies, headline inflation will likely become negative in the early part of 2015, only to bounce back into positive territory as we go into late 2015 and early 2016. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) will likely remain around current levels of 1.6% on a year-over-year basis. 
"
294,CA,"""Our discussion of global rates and risk assets was anchored by our secular New Neutral thesis. However, we concluded that this longer-term outlook for lower neutral policy rates is now largely priced into the markets."" 
"
295,CA,"— Daniel J. Ivascyn | Group Chief Investment Officer 
"
296,CA,"ASSET ALLOCATION THEMES FOR MULTI-ASSET PORTFOLIOS
"
297,CA,"Investors should consider a moderate risk-on posture in multi-asset portfolios given continued global growth and a low probability of recession in 2015. As the global economy creeps further into a slow and extended business cycle, we expect greater divergence in returns within asset classes and sectors — which means an emphasis on tactical asset allocation, careful ""bottom-up"" security selection and prudent relative value decisions are going to be critical in 2015. 
"
298,CA,"Several broad themes will be reflected in PIMCO's multi-asset portfolios in 2015. A moderate risk-on posture means we expect to maintain an overweight to global equities. Within global equity market regions, we favor non-U.S. equities, in particular European and Japanese equities (both on a hedged basis) and select emerging Asia equities. 
"
299,CA,"On interest rates, we continue to believe in PIMCO's secular New Neutral hypothesis, in which average policy rates are set well below the levels that prevailed before the global financial crisis. However, this longer-term outlook for lower neutral policy rates is now largely priced into the markets. What is probably not yet fully reflected by the rate markets is the view that the U.S. economy is likely to grow at a robust 3.0% rate in 2015, the output gap will continue to shrink and the Fed is likely to start hiking. This means we expect to have an underweight to global rates over the cyclical horizon relative to what a well-diversified portfolio would normally have. 
"
300,CA,"On spread sectors, we believe investors should consider selective overweights, carefully surveying individual credits in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, investment grade, high yield and emerging markets where attractive spreads can offer diversified sources of portfolio carry, with careful credit analysis helping to identify strong credits and avoid defaults. 
"
301,CA,"Turning to real assets, we maintain a neutral stance on commodities: The drop in commodity prices and the resulting curtailment of production means supply and demand will move back into balance over the course of 2015. Within commodities we are neutral oil, favor industrial versus precious metals and have a negative view on the agricultural commodities. Given current valuations and with our expectations that oil prices are near bottom, inflation-linked bonds in the U.S. and Europe may offer attractive opportunities. 
"
302,CA,"Finally, on currencies, we expect to maintain our overweight to the U.S. dollar. The rare coincidence of attractive valuations, increasing growth differentials and divergent monetary policies should lead to further appreciation of the USD. 
"
303,CA,"GLOBAL EQUITIES
"
304,CA,"EXTENDED BUSINESS CYCLE SUPPORTIVE OF EQUITIES
"
305,CA,"While there will be bouts of volatility in global equity markets as the Fed first approaches and then proceeds to hike rates, we believe volatility is likely to be lower than its long-term history would suggest given the likelihood that the Fed will move very slowly — one could say unusually slowly. This, in addition to the degree of slack remaining in the economy, means the business cycle probably still has a few more years left to run, which we believe is supportive of equity valuations. 
"
306,CA,"Equities versus bonds 
"
307,CA,"Some investors may be concerned equities are overvalued, but with real interest rates low and likely to stay lower for longer, somewhat higher than average equity valuations, we believe, are justified. A robust measure of the relative attractiveness of equities versus bonds is the equity risk premium (ERP), as measured by the cyclically adjusted earnings yield (inverse of the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or Shiller P/E) adjusted for the level of real yields. The current value of this metric for U.S. equities compared with its long-term history since the 1950s is right around its median. This means that relative to the level of bond yields, equities offer long-term incremental return potential that is in line with historically fair levels. Moreover, one typically finds the ERP compressing in the mid to late stages of a business cycle. Hence there could be further multiple expansion despite the fact that corporate profits as a share of GDP are at an all-time high and potentially at risk of receding. 
"
308,CA,"Regional views 
"
309,CA,"Within the overall equity overweight, we are focusing on several major themes in 2015. In developed market equities, although we see U.S. equities as fairly valued, we expect Europe and Japan to outperform the U.S. (on a currency-hedged basis) for three key reasons: Their valuations are more attractive, their central banks are easing and there is potential for upside surprises in earnings growth. However, the effectiveness of BOJ policy and the ability of the ECB to deliver versus what are now high market expectations are key risks to this view. 
"
310,CA,"Some believe that further U.S. economic strength coupled with a stronger U.S. dollar should support outperformance of more domestically focused stocks, such as small caps, over large caps. We, however, believe small cap valuations are still too rich, and as such do not warrant a systematic overweight. Moreover, to the extent that the U.S. stock and bond markets are supported by overseas investors, the more liquid large cap stocks are likely to be the beneficiaries. 
"
311,CA,"Moving beyond developed markets, although emerging market (EM) equity valuations appear attractive relative to their own history, we are being very selective at this stage. In general, we expect EM equities to struggle given headwinds through continued U.S. dollar strength, lower growth differentials and weakening earnings in many emerging markets. However, we find equities of large Asian countries such as China and India attractive as lower oil prices and inflation allow further monetary stimulus along with policy reforms that could boost equity valuations further.

313,CA,"POCKETS OF OPPORTUNITY ACROSS GLOBAL CREDIT SECTORS
"
314,CA,"Bonds play a vital and special role in a multi-asset portfolio. They can be viewed as a potential return generator as they have for most of the last 20 years, and also as a hedge against downside economic surprises that result in equity market drawdowns. 
"
315,CA,"While current valuations mean there is not much term premium in the bond market, we believe the stock-bond correlation will continue to be negative. High quality bonds therefore remain useful as portfolio hedges in the context of a multi-asset portfolio. 
"
316,CA,"Given our secular New Neutral hypothesis of lower neutral policy rates relative to history, we don't see a bear market for bonds in 2015, but rather a year of muted and differentiated returns. In particular, we see limited upside for interest rate duration. For example, we expect the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to end the year in the high 2% range, modestly higher than implied by the forward markets. As such, our preference is to position multi-asset portfolios flat to modestly underweight U.S. Treasuries, U.K. Gilts and German Bunds. As discussed earlier, high quality bonds play a special role in a multi-asset portfolio — not just generating income and returns, but also serving as a hedge during economic downturns. Our core duration underweight is sized with this point firmly in mind. 
"
317,CA,"Notable opportunities in bonds 
"
318,CA,"Within bond markets we see several areas likely to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
"
319,CA,"Within U.S. credit sectors, recent widening in credit spreads has created select opportunities in both investment grade and high yield corporate issues. We continue to favor non-agency mortgages given the outlook for above-trend economic growth and continued stabilization in the housing and job markets. However, rigorous analysis of individual securities and diversification across multiple credits is important to optimize liquidity and to manage servicer and policy risks such as principal and interest modifications. 
"
320,CA,"In non-U.S. credit sectors, we favor European peripheral bonds given the likelihood of an ECB QE program, which we believe will be announced at either the January or March 2015 meeting and is likely to range in size from €500 billion to €1 trillion. A program of this magnitude likely would be centered on government bonds; however, non-financial corporate bonds are also likely to feature in the mix and therefore stand to benefit. 
"
321,CA,"Also in Europe, we favor select subordinated bank debt. Many European banks are raising capital, moving toward higher capital ratio requirements in a new regulatory regime, and the ECB is expected to provide liquidity to help ensure banks can stay solvent. 
"
322,CA,"Finally, emerging market bonds have generally reset to more attractive valuations, but several countries are buffeted by macroeconomic or policy headwinds. Also, considering our views of continued strength in the U.S. dollar and neutral stance on commodities, we suggest investors be selective when investing in EM debt.

"
327,CA,"U.S. TIPS and European inflation-linked bonds are attractively priced inflation hedges. We maintain a neutral stance on commodities but are bearish on gold. We believe oil prices are hovering near bottom, though bouts of volatility may produce extreme outcomes. 
"
328,CA,"Given our view on global GDP growth reaching a rate of around 2.75%, oil demand should increase by over 1 million barrels per day in 2015, necessitating more U.S. production. However, we believe current oil prices will not support the amount of supply growth required to balance the markets. As such, we expect oil prices to be in the mid to high $60s per barrel by the end of 2015 / early 2016. 
"
329,CA,"We also have a negative outlook for gold prices in 2015 as real interest rates are likely to move higher. Gold prices could see a sharp correction given the market's new understanding of the relationship between central bank balance sheets, the velocity of money and inflation. If the likelihood of hyperinflation is negligible, it is difficult to justify gold trading so far above its marginal cost of production. 
"
330,CA,"Among the most attractive inflation hedges available are U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and we find them extremely attractive at current valuations. Although headline inflation in 2015 is likely to turn negative on a year-over-year basis due to the sharp decline in oil prices, we believe the market is too pessimistic: It is underpricing the closing of the output gap and continued monetary accommodation by the Fed (even as it gets off the zero bound). We believe investors generally are not taking into account how core inflation and in particular the services component of inflation remains steady, and they are too focused on the goods portion of inflation, which is likely to have reached a bottom. In particular, it is quite likely that inflation over the next 10 years will average above the 1.5% that is currently reflected in the TIPS market. Therefore TIPS, along with inflation-linked bonds in Europe, offer attractive opportunities today.

"
336,CA,"We expect both the euro and the yen to decline versus the U.S. dollar over the cyclical horizon despite significant weakening already. This decline in their currencies is a primary tool by which these regions can boost economic growth and also solidify inflation expectations. 
"
337,CA,"In emerging market space, just as we are very selective in our exposure to equities, we are very selective in currencies. USD strength will pose a headwind to non-dollar currencies, including those of emerging market countries. Nevertheless, two EM currencies we currently favor are the Indian rupee and the Mexican peso. The case for the rupee is strong, given attractive carry, a credible central bank, declining inflation and net benefits from lower oil prices. With the peso, we believe the market is overreacting to the oil price decline. Most of Mexico's oil production is hedged and, in fact, it is a very small net importer of energy. The recent decline in the peso offers an attractive entry point as Mexico is the EM country likely to benefit the most from the upturn in the U.S. economy.

354,CA,"All investments contain risk and may lose value. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Commodities contain heightened risk, including market, political, regulatory and natural conditions, and may not be suitable for all investors. Investing in foreign-denominated and/or -domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may reduce the returns of a portfolio. Sovereign securities are generally backed by the issuing government. Obligations of U.S. government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees, but are generally not backed by the full faith of the U.S. government. Portfolios that invest in such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) issued by a government are fixed income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation; ILBs decline in value when real interest rates rise. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are ILBs issued by the U.S. government. REITs are subject to risk, such as poor performance by the manager, adverse changes to tax laws or failure to qualify for tax-free pass-through of income. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and while generally supported by a government, government-agency or private guarantor, there is no assurance that the guarantor will meet its obligations. High yield, lower-rated securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are suitable for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest long-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. Investors should consult their investment professional prior to making an investment decision.

Focus on Tactical Allocation and Relative Value ""Investors should consider a moderate risk-on posture in multi-asset portfolios given continued global growth and a low probability of recession in 2015. As the global economy creeps further into a slow and extended business cycle, we expect greater divergence in returns within asset classes and sectors — which means an emphasis on tactical asset allocation, careful 'bottom-up' security selection and prudent relative value decisions are going to be critical in 2015."" — Mihir Worah | CIO Asset Allocation and Real Return INTRODUCTION Investors already weary of a persistent low yield environment complicated by uncertainties — geopolitical tensions, plummeting oil prices, volatile currencies, to name a few — may need to prepare for another challenging year in 2015. From an asset allocation perspective, achieving target returns may be difficult. Not only do we anticipate a tug-of-war escalating between divergent monetary policies and uneven global economic growth, we also observe that 2015 begins with fuller asset valuations than in the recent past amid a persisting low yield environment. Yet, the picture is not entirely bleak: We anticipate a more extended business cycle through the combination of a slow-moving Fed willing to chase inflation rather than impede robust U.S. growth and increased policy stimulus from the European Central Bank (ECB) along with a continuation of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) asset purchases. As long as the odds of a recession remain low, we expect various risk assets will deliver attractive returns. In particular, we observe the equity risk premium in the U.S. relative to real rates remains close to its long-run average, reducing the probability of a sharp correction. Nevertheless, there remains significant risk of increased market volatility as we approach the start of the Fed tightening cycle. Our Forum conclusions At PIMCO's Cyclical Forum in December 2014, our investment professionals from around the world gathered to discuss how the global macro economy is likely to evolve over the coming year. Following the Forum, our portfolio management leadership team considered how the interplay between macroeconomic fundamentals, valuations, risks and market technicals is likely to impact risk and return potential across global asset classes. Bottom line: We believe an overweight to equity risk is still warranted and see pockets of opportunity across credit sectors. In contrast, we are modestly negative interest rate risk, and we have a neutral stance on commodities. In 2015, an emphasis on robust portfolio construction and on exploiting relative value opportunities across asset classes will be more important than the bold ""beta bets"" that have been sufficient over the past few years.  MACROECONMIC OVERVIEW PIMCO's top-down macroeconomic forecasts form the backdrop for the asset allocation views that are expressed in our multi-asset portfolios. These macro views originate from our Secular and Cyclical Economic Forums, during which investment professionals from all our global offices gather in Newport Beach to discuss the outlook for economies and markets. Outlook for major global economies PIMCO expects global growth to accelerate from around 2.50% (year-over-year) in 2014 to 2.75% in 2015. We believe the majority of this improvement will come from supply-driven declines in oil prices. Acceleration in the velocity of money, driven by the transfer of incremental petrodollar cash flows from producers to consumers, is also supportive of higher global growth this year. Across key global economies, we expect growth in 2015 to be highly divergent, though overall somewhat stronger than in 2014. In particular, we expect U.S. and Japanese growth to pick up, reaching levels of around 3.0% and 1.5%, respectively. Dr. Ben Bernanke, the guest speaker at the December Cyclical Forum, affirmed PIMCO's view that the outlook for the U.S. economy in 2015 is incrementally positive, reflecting improving household finances and confidence as well as increasing evidence that the economic recovery is becoming self-sustaining and broad-based. In Japan, we expect growth to rebound due to bold action by policymakers as well as declining oil prices and a depreciating yen. However, the private sector still must confront major secular and structural headwinds. Among other regions, we expect to see growth in Europe of around 1.0% in 2015, higher than in 2014 but still weak. In China, we expect growth of around 6.5%, moderating downward as China continues its attempts to transition to a growth model (and growth rate) that is less reliant on credit expansion and investment. Cyclical inflation outlook Declining oil prices are likely to have a clear downside impact on global inflation data this year. In most developed economies, headline inflation will likely become negative in the early part of 2015, only to bounce back into positive territory as we go into late 2015 and early 2016. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) will likely remain around current levels of 1.6% on a year-over-year basis. ""Our discussion of global rates and risk assets was anchored by our secular New Neutral thesis. However, we concluded that this longer-term outlook for lower neutral policy rates is now largely priced into the markets."" — Daniel J. Ivascyn | Group Chief Investment Officer  ASSET ALLOCATION THEMES FOR MULTI-ASSET PORTFOLIOSInvestors should consider a moderate risk-on posture in multi-asset portfolios given continued global growth and a low probability of recession in 2015. As the global economy creeps further into a slow and extended business cycle, we expect greater divergence in returns within asset classes and sectors — which means an emphasis on tactical asset allocation, careful ""bottom-up"" security selection and prudent relative value decisions are going to be critical in 2015. Several broad themes will be reflected in PIMCO's multi-asset portfolios in 2015. A moderate risk-on posture means we expect to maintain an overweight to global equities. Within global equity market regions, we favor non-U.S. equities, in particular European and Japanese equities (both on a hedged basis) and select emerging Asia equities. On interest rates, we continue to believe in PIMCO's secular New Neutral hypothesis, in which average policy rates are set well below the levels that prevailed before the global financial crisis. However, this longer-term outlook for lower neutral policy rates is now largely priced into the markets. What is probably not yet fully reflected by the rate markets is the view that the U.S. economy is likely to grow at a robust 3.0% rate in 2015, the output gap will continue to shrink and the Fed is likely to start hiking. This means we expect to have an underweight to global rates over the cyclical horizon relative to what a well-diversified portfolio would normally have. On spread sectors, we believe investors should consider selective overweights, carefully surveying individual credits in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, investment grade, high yield and emerging markets where attractive spreads can offer diversified sources of portfolio carry, with careful credit analysis helping to identify strong credits and avoid defaults. Turning to real assets, we maintain a neutral stance on commodities: The drop in commodity prices and the resulting curtailment of production means supply and demand will move back into balance over the course of 2015. Within commodities we are neutral oil, favor industrial versus precious metals and have a negative view on the agricultural commodities. Given current valuations and with our expectations that oil prices are near bottom, inflation-linked bonds in the U.S. and Europe may offer attractive opportunities. Finally, on currencies, we expect to maintain our overweight to the U.S. dollar. The rare coincidence of attractive valuations, increasing growth differentials and divergent monetary policies should lead to further appreciation of the USD.   GLOBAL EQUITIESEXTENDED BUSINESS CYCLE SUPPORTIVE OF EQUITIESWhile there will be bouts of volatility in global equity markets as the Fed first approaches and then proceeds to hike rates, we believe volatility is likely to be lower than its long-term history would suggest given the likelihood that the Fed will move very slowly — one could say unusually slowly. This, in addition to the degree of slack remaining in the economy, means the business cycle probably still has a few more years left to run, which we believe is supportive of equity valuations. Equities versus bonds Some investors may be concerned equities are overvalued, but with real interest rates low and likely to stay lower for longer, somewhat higher than average equity valuations, we believe, are justified. A robust measure of the relative attractiveness of equities versus bonds is the equity risk premium (ERP), as measured by the cyclically adjusted earnings yield (inverse of the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or Shiller P/E) adjusted for the level of real yields. The current value of this metric for U.S. equities compared with its long-term history since the 1950s is right around its median. This means that relative to the level of bond yields, equities offer long-term incremental return potential that is in line with historically fair levels. Moreover, one typically finds the ERP compressing in the mid to late stages of a business cycle. Hence there could be further multiple expansion despite the fact that corporate profits as a share of GDP are at an all-time high and potentially at risk of receding.  Regional views Within the overall equity overweight, we are focusing on several major themes in 2015. In developed market equities, although we see U.S. equities as fairly valued, we expect Europe and Japan to outperform the U.S. (on a currency-hedged basis) for three key reasons: Their valuations are more attractive, their central banks are easing and there is potential for upside surprises in earnings growth. However, the effectiveness of BOJ policy and the ability of the ECB to deliver versus what are now high market expectations are key risks to this view. Some believe that further U.S. economic strength coupled with a stronger U.S. dollar should support outperformance of more domestically focused stocks, such as small caps, over large caps. We, however, believe small cap valuations are still too rich, and as such do not warrant a systematic overweight. Moreover, to the extent that the U.S. stock and bond markets are supported by overseas investors, the more liquid large cap stocks are likely to be the beneficiaries. Moving beyond developed markets, although emerging market (EM) equity valuations appear attractive relative to their own history, we are being very selective at this stage. In general, we expect EM equities to struggle given headwinds through continued U.S. dollar strength, lower growth differentials and weakening earnings in many emerging markets. However, we find equities of large Asian countries such as China and India attractive as lower oil prices and inflation allow further monetary stimulus along with policy reforms that could boost equity valuations further.  GLOBAL FIXED INCOMEPOCKETS OF OPPORTUNITY ACROSS GLOBAL CREDIT SECTORSBonds play a vital and special role in a multi-asset portfolio. They can be viewed as a potential return generator as they have for most of the last 20 years, and also as a hedge against downside economic surprises that result in equity market drawdowns. While current valuations mean there is not much term premium in the bond market, we believe the stock-bond correlation will continue to be negative. High quality bonds therefore remain useful as portfolio hedges in the context of a multi-asset portfolio. Given our secular New Neutral hypothesis of lower neutral policy rates relative to history, we don't see a bear market for bonds in 2015, but rather a year of muted and differentiated returns. In particular, we see limited upside for interest rate duration. For example, we expect the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to end the year in the high 2% range, modestly higher than implied by the forward markets. As such, our preference is to position multi-asset portfolios flat to modestly underweight U.S. Treasuries, U.K. Gilts and German Bunds. As discussed earlier, high quality bonds play a special role in a multi-asset portfolio — not just generating income and returns, but also serving as a hedge during economic downturns. Our core duration underweight is sized with this point firmly in mind. Notable opportunities in bonds Within bond markets we see several areas likely to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Within U.S. credit sectors, recent widening in credit spreads has created select opportunities in both investment grade and high yield corporate issues. We continue to favor non-agency mortgages given the outlook for above-trend economic growth and continued stabilization in the housing and job markets. However, rigorous analysis of individual securities and diversification across multiple credits is important to optimize liquidity and to manage servicer and policy risks such as principal and interest modifications. In non-U.S. credit sectors, we favor European peripheral bonds given the likelihood of an ECB QE program, which we believe will be announced at either the January or March 2015 meeting and is likely to range in size from €500 billion to €1 trillion. A program of this magnitude likely would be centered on government bonds; however, non-financial corporate bonds are also likely to feature in the mix and therefore stand to benefit. Also in Europe, we favor select subordinated bank debt. Many European banks are raising capital, moving toward higher capital ratio requirements in a new regulatory regime, and the ECB is expected to provide liquidity to help ensure banks can stay solvent. Finally, emerging market bonds have generally reset to more attractive valuations, but several countries are buffeted by macroeconomic or policy headwinds. Also, considering our views of continued strength in the U.S. dollar and neutral stance on commodities, we suggest investors be selective when investing in EM debt. History of the stock-bond correlation (1927-2014): PIMCO sees a continued negative correlation in 2015  CCC rated non-agency MBS: estimated hold to maturity loss-adjusted yields  REAL ASSETSU.S. TIPS AND EUROPEAN ILBS OFFER ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIESU.S. TIPS and European inflation-linked bonds are attractively priced inflation hedges. We maintain a neutral stance on commodities but are bearish on gold. We believe oil prices are hovering near bottom, though bouts of volatility may produce extreme outcomes. Given our view on global GDP growth reaching a rate of around 2.75%, oil demand should increase by over 1 million barrels per day in 2015, necessitating more U.S. production. However, we believe current oil prices will not support the amount of supply growth required to balance the markets. As such, we expect oil prices to be in the mid to high $60s per barrel by the end of 2015 / early 2016. We also have a negative outlook for gold prices in 2015 as real interest rates are likely to move higher. Gold prices could see a sharp correction given the market's new understanding of the relationship between central bank balance sheets, the velocity of money and inflation. If the likelihood of hyperinflation is negligible, it is difficult to justify gold trading so far above its marginal cost of production. Among the most attractive inflation hedges available are U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and we find them extremely attractive at current valuations. Although headline inflation in 2015 is likely to turn negative on a year-over-year basis due to the sharp decline in oil prices, we believe the market is too pessimistic: It is underpricing the closing of the output gap and continued monetary accommodation by the Fed (even as it gets off the zero bound). We believe investors generally are not taking into account how core inflation and in particular the services component of inflation remains steady, and they are too focused on the goods portion of inflation, which is likely to have reached a bottom. In particular, it is quite likely that inflation over the next 10 years will average above the 1.5% that is currently reflected in the TIPS market. Therefore TIPS, along with inflation-linked bonds in Europe, offer attractive opportunities today. We are neutral in our exposure to REITs as the 2014 outperformance has moved valuations from cheap to fair, in our view. U.S. real yields are likely to be lower in The New Neutral  CURRENCIESCONTINUING STRENGTH IN U.S. DOLLAROn currencies, our dominant cyclical view in multi-asset portfolios remains the U.S. dollar overweight versus other G-10 currencies as a result of diverging economic growth and — importantly ­— diverging central bank actions. We expect both the euro and the yen to decline versus the U.S. dollar over the cyclical horizon despite significant weakening already. This decline in their currencies is a primary tool by which these regions can boost economic growth and also solidify inflation expectations. In emerging market space, just as we are very selective in our exposure to equities, we are very selective in currencies. USD strength will pose a headwind to non-dollar currencies, including those of emerging market countries. Nevertheless, two EM currencies we currently favor are the Indian rupee and the Mexican peso. The case for the rupee is strong, given attractive carry, a credible central bank, declining inflation and net benefits from lower oil prices. With the peso, we believe the market is overreacting to the oil price decline. Most of Mexico's oil production is hedged and, in fact, it is a very small net importer of energy. The recent decline in the peso offers an attractive entry point as Mexico is the EM country likely to benefit the most from the upturn in the U.S. economy. Continuing strength in U.S. dollar  Investors may need to brace for a challenging year from an asset allocation perspective: Recent macroeconomic and market developments are likely to have a profound impact on risk and return potential across global asset classes. Persistently low yields, divergent monetary policies in major economies, extremely low oil prices, volatile currencies and geopolitical concerns all confront investors this year. In asset allocation portfolios, this means reaching beyond beta and looking for relative value opportunities across regions and sectors in an effort to achieve risk and return objectives. Here are highlights of our macro views and the major themes we intend to express in multi-asset portfolios in 2015.

Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Commodities contain heightened risk, including market, political, regulatory and natural conditions, and may not be suitable for all investors. Investing in foreign-denominated and/or -domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may reduce the returns of a portfolio. Sovereign securities are generally backed by the issuing government. Obligations of U.S. government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees, but are generally not backed by the full faith of the U.S. government. Portfolios that invest in such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) issued by a government are fixed income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation; ILBs decline in value when real interest rates rise. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are ILBs issued by the U.S. government. REITs are subject to risk, such as poor performance by the manager, adverse changes to tax laws or failure to qualify for tax-free pass-through of income. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and while generally supported by a government, government-agency or private guarantor, there is no assurance that the guarantor will meet its obligations. High yield, lower-rated securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are suitable for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest long-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. Investors should consult their investment professional prior to making an investment decision.

358,CA,"ServiceNow's Q3 beat stemmed largely from successfully expanding beyond its core market, analysts said, and its stock jumped Thursday. ServiceNow (NOW) also won high marks for avoiding uncertain economic conditions and other pitfalls plaguing many enterprise tech companies this earnings season. Analysts say that the company is on track to expand its market opportunity outside of its core IT service…
"
359,CA,"ServiceNow continues to epitomize high growth in a technology company.The enterprise software firm late Wednesday reported third-quarter sales and earnings that beat analyst estimates as it expands beyond its core IT service management software into such areas as human resources, financial management, and sales and marketing departments.ServiceNow's (NOW) Q3 billings number far exceeded views, and its revenue forecast for the current quarter was ahead of estimates.ServiceNow stock rose nearly 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday after ending the regular session at 58.07, down 4%.ServiceNow is one of fastest-growing enterprise software vendors, with software that manages information requests among multiple departments and users of various devices.A growing number of customers are choosing the company's software, delivered through the Internet cloud, as an alternative to older licensed software products sold by BMC Software, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and CA Technologies (CA).The company's ability to move beyond its IT management core is a key factor, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird.""It's absolutely critical to the story, and we expect it to continue to be,"" Ashley told IBD. ""We have talked with a number of their larger customers during this quarter, and all of them see opportunities to use the product outside of the IT department.""ServiceNow is clearly meeting demands that its larger rivals are not, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.""There is a very large so-called white space in enterprise where ServiceNow can be used to solve this broad array of workflow problems that haven't had a single solution before,"" Turits said. ""And enterprises we talk to are really happy to solve those problems with ServiceNow.""For Q3, ServiceNow reported earnings per share minus items of 3 cents vs. 1 cent in the year-earlier period.Revenue climbed 61% to $178.7 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected EPS ex items of a penny on sales of $174.4 million.ServiceNow also reported billings of $200 million, up 58%. Analysts expected about $192 million.For the current quarter, ServiceNow expects revenue of $192 million to $194 million, up 54% to 55%.Analysts had been looking for sales of $191 million, up 53%, and EPS of 4 cents, swinging from a per-share loss of 2 cents.ServiceNow doesn't provide an EPS forecast.The company also expects billings of $245 million to $250 million, up 47% to 50%.On a conference call with analysts, ServiceNow CEO Frank Slootman said that the company booked a record 11 deals, with annual contract values of more than $1 million each.ServiceNow is making progress in moving beyond the IT service management market, with 24 signed deals in Q3 for human resource service automation and 13 deals for facilities automation, he said.The company now counts 107 customers, with an annual contract value in excess of $1 million.""The quarter was marked by strong demand from our existing customer base, with renewals at 98%,"" he said. ""Many of these contracts extend beyond the IT organization.""In Q3, subscription revenue grew 62% to $150.3 million. Revenue from professional services rose 55% to $28.3 million.

360,CA,"ServiceNow (NOW) will likely beat analyst Q3 estimates when it reports after the close Wednesday, some analysts say, as the company continues to expand beyond its core service-desk software market.

363,CA,"CA Technologies will gain over the long term by selling its storage-software business.That's the conclusion from Gregg Moskowitz, an analyst for Cowen, in a research report Tuesday, a day after the IT software and services company said that it had sold its Arcserve storage-software unit to Marlin Equity Partners, a private equity firm, for an undisclosed sum.Still, CA Technologies (CA) stock was down nearly 2.5% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 28.70. CA stock is down 15% in 2014 as its revenue has fallen, even before the sale.But Moskowitz says that the move isn't a negative for CA, though he maintained his underperform rating on CA stock.""We believe Arcserve has been a generally stable but growth-challenged business unit for CA, and this divestiture will help the company to focus on its core competencies of IT management,"" he wrote.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of CA's fiscal 2015, ending on or near March 31.CA also slightly reduced its outlook for fiscal 2015. The company now expects earnings per share minus items of $2.42 to $2.49, down from its prior forecast of $2.45 to $2.52.Analysts expect $2.49, down 19% from the year-earlier period.The company expects revenue of $4.34 billion to $4.4 billion, where it had forecast $4.43 billion to $4.49 billion. Analysts expect $4.42 billion, down 1.9%.CA is slated to report earnings for its Q1 fiscal 2015, ended June 30, after the market close on July 23.The reduced outlook comes more from removing Arcserve than any other factors, Moskowitz said.CA, though, is also facing competition from smaller, high-growth IT software firmshttp://news.investors.com/technology/052213-657207-servicenow-finds-niche-as-data-traffic-manager.htm such as ServiceNow (NOW).

365,CA,"ServiceNow's (NOW) trajectory as one of the fastest-growing companies among the young gun high-growth software names will likely continue when the company reports its second-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday.The maker of software-as-a-service used to manage service desk functions is growing at the expense of larger rivals BMC Software, CA Technologies (CA) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).ServiceNow stock was up more than 1% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 59. But ServiceNow stock is down 18% since touching an all-time high of 71.80 on Feb. 27. ServiceNow made its IPO in June 2012, pricing its initial shares at 18.The company is expanding into new areas, including software to help manage human resources and sales and marketing departments.Growth won't be an issue with the Q2 results, Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James, said in a report Tuesday.""U.S. checks with systems integrators, (value added resellers and large account resellers) this quarter indicated continued strong business momentum with ServiceNow's product suite,"" he wrote. ""Increasingly, we heard resellers and integrators say customers are standardizing on ServiceNow instead of deploying in mixed environments with legacy vendors, and are viewing ServiceNow as a more strategic vendor.""For Q2, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a loss per-share minus items of 7 cents vs. a 6-cent loss in the year-earlier period.Revenue is expected to climb 58% to $161.5 million.For the current quarter, analysts expect a per-share loss of 3 cents, up from a penny a share loss, with revenue rising 52% to $169.5 million.Turits rates ServiceNow stock a strong buy, for a number of reasons.""ServiceNow is our analyst current favorite and we continue to be positive on the stock given the company's role as a pioneer and leader in SaaS-based ITSM, ability to displace legacy on-premise ITSM vendors including BMC and HP, expansion of both ITSM and new packaged operations management applications within customers and ability to drive usage of its business workflow development platform,"" he wrote.RELATED:CA Seen Gaining By Selling Storage-Software Business.
"
366,CA,"Investors had an unpleasant surprise for ServiceNow after the fast-growing enterprise software company released Q1 earnings late on April 23 that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The company also provided a stronger-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.Yet ServiceNow stock fell more than 6% on April 24, and fell the following two days as well.The investor reaction perplexed ServiceNow (NOW) CEO Frank Slootman, whose company is taking share from larger rivals including CA Technologies (CA) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) in IT service management software.""I don't think in all my years of doing this kind of thing that have I ever seen anything remotely close to it,"" Slootman told IBD . ""It all goes under the motto of 'no good deed goes unpunished.' Investor sentiment is in turmoil right now and it really has nothing to do with our business or our company.""ServiceNow's results, with sales up 62% from the year-earlier quarter, were exceptional, says Matthew Hedberg, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets.""They couldn't have done much more in the quarter,"" he said.But ServiceNow wasn't alone.Highflying software companies such as Tableau Software (DATA), Splunk (SPLK), Workday (WDAY) and Salesforce.com (CRM) have seen their stocks dive this year despite strong quarterly earnings and outlooks.Shares of ServiceNow were down 9% this year through Tuesday before rallying 16% the rest of the week. Salesforce's stock has declined 6%. Tableau, a fast grower in the data analytics market, is down 12% this year. Workday, a leader in the human capital management market, is down 3%. The Nasdaq composite index is up 3.5%.High ValuationsInvestors generally appear to be nervous about the high valuations in the sector — all of the above companies are in the red except Salesforce — rather than any specific fundamental issues, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners. Also, the young software stocks tend to move up and down more greatly than older legacy software stocks, he points out.""It's more of a general nervousness around some of the higher beta stocks and tech in general,"" he said.Older tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and HP are up this year despite recent quarters with decelerating or declining sales and EPS.Investors are placing a higher premium on size and stability rather than fast growth — for now, says Karl Keirstead, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.""You are seeing a growth-to-value rotation,"" he said. ""What is hurting Workday is the flipside of what is helping Oracle.""Splunk might the biggest victim among the highflier group.Splunk stock is down 37% this year, after falling 16% the day after its recent Q1 earnings soundly beat views.The magnitude of Splunk's sell-off is out of the company's hands, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""It's the cycle of the stock, the stock is in a bad mood,"" White said. ""There was really nothing in the (Q1) report that wasn't good. It was a very solid report.""Splunk raised its revenue forecast for the year from $400 million to $402 million-$410 million. Analysts had modeled for $406.9 million, slightly above Splunk's midpoint.The company's forecast could be construed as light, but there likely are bigger forces at work, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""The shorts are winning over the longs right now,"" he said. ""The issue there is a re-evaluation for these high-growth assets. Where that value should fall is what the market is trying to figure out.""Prior to the sell-off, on Feb. 26 Tableau's stock reached an all-time high of 101.86 a share, or 13 times above the $476.2 million that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project for 2015.Workday's peak price of 116.47 on Feb. 27 was roughly 19 times its expected revenue of $1.09 billion for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Splunk's all-time high of 106.15, set on Feb. 28, was 29 times the $547.5 million revenue that analysts had projected for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Those valuations have come down to earth. After Friday's close, Splunk's stock was trading near nine times revenue for its next fiscal year, with Workday at 13.5 times revenue and Tableau at eight times revenue.Over the past 15 years, ""growth company"" stocks have seen a mean average of eight times projected revenue, with anything near 20 among the highest, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.Those high valuations can make investors nervous, Ives says.""Once they start to sell off, it starts to be like yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater,"" he said.Where Is The Sweet Spot?As Deutsche Bank's Keirstead puts it, investors in cloud software companies are still struggling to find prices they are comfortable with.""You are seeing a re-evaluation of the growth software sector and that is why these stocks are struggling,"" Keirstead said.Legacy vendors, meanwhile, are up despite their own struggles.Oracle, Cisco and Microsoft are each up 11% this year, while HP is up 21%.All four companies are in various stages of some sort of reorganization or reprioritization, looking to recharge growth.Investors are attracted to these companies for varying reasons, Keirstead says.""In the case of Oracle, their total revenue growth rate in the most recent reported quarter was actually the highest in three years,"" he said. ""With HP, some people are enthusiastic about the pace at which they are cutting costs.""

On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 4% year over year.The year-over-year revenue growth was mainly attributable to Mainframe new sales, driven by the company’s ongoing innovations and robust Mainframe hardware cycle. Management was positive about the impressive performance of the company’s Mainframe Operational Intelligence and Dynamic Capacity Intelligence solutions.With security being one of the key areas in recent times, the company witnessed a surge in demand for its recently launched Trusted Access Manager for Z, a Mainframe solution.

Software fees and other revenues (15% of total revenues) surged 32%.Moreover, on a segment basis, revenues from CA’s Mainframe Solutions increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to $549 million.

During the quarter, the company generated $548 million of cash flow from operational activities.During the quarter, the company distributed dividend worth $107 million to its shareholders. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company has approximately $487 million remaining under its current stock repurchase program.Fiscal 2018 SnapshotCA reported revenues of $4.235 billion, up 5% from the previous fiscal.

376,CA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, CA has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, CA’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 29.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that CA has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for CA stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, CA has a P/S ratio of about 3.5. This is a bit higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is a bit below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, CA is roughly in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, CA currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CA a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though CA might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C. This gives CA a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the next year estimate has seen three up and no down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 0.4% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has inched upper by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:CA Inc. Price and Consensus  CA Inc. Price and Consensus | CA Inc. QuoteThe stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCA is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 25% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large, as you can see below:However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

They were also happy about the Application Performance Monitoring (APM) business gaining recognition.The positive contributions from entities acquired last year, namely Veracode and Automic have also been beneficial for the company’s financials. Veracode’s large transactions and bookings recorded impressive growth. Additionally, the company is also increasing the adoption of the digital go-to-market strategies employed by Veracode across CA.Management expects to keep up the performance as CA keeps on delivering its offerings across hybrid cloud environments. Additionally, management stated that they would be going for site consolidations and lay-off of around 800 employees in fiscal 2019. They are looking to focus on investments in development of new products and customer success.However, as the company is shifting toward a higher mix of “Enterprise Solutions as SaaS or subscription-based licenses”, revenues are expected to remain under pressure.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology, Inc.

381,CA,"Bond yields are scaling record highs on expectations of a hike in interest rate. A two-year budget deal declared by top senators should strengthen the economy giving the Federal Reserve enough reason to raise rates. A pick-up in wages sparked fears of inflation, bolstering expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates.Lest we forget, a soft Treasury auction on Feb 7 dragged bond prices down and helped yields move up. This rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a lot of gyrations. And why not? When bond yield rises, it increases the opportunity cost of investing in other asset classes such as equities, thus, making them less attractive.Given such uncertain times, investors should select the safest of stocks, particularly those that are sound enough to withstand the intensifying volatility in the market.US Stocks Finish Lower, Bond Yields SpikeThe stock market is on a roller-coaster this week. Major bourses largely finished in the red on Feb 7 and at current levels, they stand nearly 5% below last month’s record high. The Dow shed 19.42 points to 24,893.35, while the broader S&P 500 slid 13.48 points to 2,681.66. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, in the meantime, remained at 27.73. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market. This is in sharp contrast to the fear gauge’s reading in 2017. Last year, VIX fell as low as 9.14.While stocks struggled for direction, marked by the comeback of once-dormant volatility, treasury yields continued to scale record highs. The 10-year Treasury note yield was up 7.8 basis points to 2.843% following a decline of 2.648% earlier in the week. The two-year Treasury notes rose 4.3 basis points to 2.134%, registering its largest one-day gain since Oct 16. Similarly, the 30-year rate jumped 7.5 basis points to 3.118%, its highest level since March.  What’s Driving Treasurys?Treasury yields moved north after Congressional leaders struck a two-year bipartisan budget deal, boosting expectations of a stronger economy. This in turn bolstered possibility of an imminent rate hike eventually leading to higher bond yields. In fact, record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated.Bipartisan Budget DealU.S. Senate leaders reached a deal to raise federal spending by almost $300 billion to address all kinds of fiscal issues that have been plaguing Washington for years. They have agreed to lift caps on defense funding and some domestic government outlays. Defense budget will be raised by $160 billion, while funding for domestic programs will be hiked by $128 billion.Congress has time and again voted to raise the budget caps. Earlier, there have been two bipartisan deals to uplift caps by billions of dollars. The first was in 2013, forged between PaulRyan and Patty Murray, while the second was signed in 2015. However, both the deals that have extended through fiscal 2017 have expired.Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Needless to say, several states have raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.Why Spike in Bond Yield Halted a Market Rally?Major selling point for equities since the financial crisis has been rise in bond yields. Investors always compare yield of equities with that of fixed income. In case of equities, earnings are largely considered the yield of a share of stock. Thus, the current rise in bond yields have made these more alluring, compelling investors to pull money out of stocks.Moreover, value of future earnings goes down as interest rates go up. Higher interest rate affects almost everything from mortgages to auto loans. Purchasing a house becomes expensive and credit card bite becomes harder. All these in turn could lead to recession, ending the nine-year-old bull market.Best Screening Parameters Amid Widespread UncertaintyAs the equity market frets over rising yields, make sure you pick safe investments. In general, you should look for companies that are unperturbed by wavering market conditions. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks also have a good position in the market and pay out part of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. After all, dividend payers boast solid financial structure and are immune to market vagaries. Further, they are positioned to grow in the near term and are economically priced.5 Top Safe Stocks to BuyWe have, thus, selected five stocks flaunting the aforesaid virtues along with a solid Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 52 cents per share for CA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents per share.

383,CA,"CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR  -  Free Report) recently announced preliminary results for second-quarter 2017.The company projects second-quarter 2017 revenues in the range of $57–$57.5 million, down from the previous guidance of $61–$62 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $61.87 million. License revenue is anticipated in the range of $30–$30.5 million. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $8.5–$8.9 million, down from the earlier guidance of $10.9–$11.7 million.CyberArk  provided not-so-encouraging guidance for the second quarter, due to lower-than-expected business in Europe and the Middle East (EMEA). Udi Mokady, CEO of CyberArk, said, ""The primary reason for our revenue shortfall was our performance in EMEA, where certain deals that we anticipated would close did not close by the end of the quarter.""The company also predicted cash flow from operations to be around $29 million for the first six months of 2017. As of Jun 30,, cash, marketable securities and short term deposits are expected to amount $283 million approximately.Notably, the company is scheduled to report its full financial results on Aug 8, 2017.Price PerformanceThe stock has underperformed the Zacks categorized Security industry in the year-to-date period. While the industry has gained 23.2%, CyberArk has returned just 12.1%.Last WordsCyberArk is an Israeli company that specializes in protecting accounts from cyber-attacks. The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in the security system and secure cloud-based assets.While maintaining its earnings streak for the 11th consecutive quarter, CyberArk reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2017 results. However, in the last two quarters, the company reported the slowest revenue growth rate of around 25% since it was enlisted in Sep 2014. Prior to this, CyberArk witnessed more than 35% revenue growth every quarter.Moreover, intense competition from peers such as CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes.Given a healthy security market, we are optimistic about the company’s product lineup, deal wins and investment plans, which will boost results in the long run. Furthermore, CyberArk’s expansion strategy through acquisitions is encouraging. Investments in product suite and go-to market are the other positives for the company.Currently, CyberArk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.

Previously, it had expected the figure to be flat to down 2%. This was driven by a change in the non-GAAP effective tax rate. According to the company, “At December 31, 2017 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.54 to $2.60.” The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is pegged at $2.46 per share.The company continues to anticipate total revenues to increase 4% in constant currency and 5% on a reported basis.

386,CA,"The Q4 earnings cycle is in full swing, with a number of tech companies, including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), slated to report the quarterly numbers over the next few days.Per the Earnings Preview dated Jan 26, Technology is one of the five sectors anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth. The other five are Oil/Energy, Basic Materials, Industrial Products and Construction. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 16.8% on 9.3% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies are Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company might perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How CA, DOX & CDK are PlacedIT management software company, CA Inc.

387,CA,"CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 30. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT management software company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and posted in-line results in the other occasion. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.6%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 60 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.08 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe expect CA’s go-to-market sales strategy and acquisitions to drive the fiscal third-quarter top-line performance.Let’s discuss the aforementioned factors one by one.CA has adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions, including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.Furthermore, acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio. The company, last year, completed the acquisition of Automic Holding GmbH and Veracode. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. These are some of the broad-based acquisition strategies adopted by the company in the recent past. We believe the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.Apart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company has been leveraging cloud computing in a bid to enable organizations to source the best components — internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more — to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.Further, the company is focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.On the other hand, heightening competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as exposure to Europe remain near-term headwinds.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 60 cents. The combination of CA's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CA Inc. QuoteStocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Apple Inc.

388,CA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, CA, Inc. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.7. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts CA, Inc.’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 12.2) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 29.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that CA, Inc. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for CA, Inc.’s stock in the near term too. P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, CA, Inc. has a P/S ratio of about 3.3. This is marginally lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, CA, Inc. currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CA a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.6, which is way better than the industry average of 23.2. Clearly, CA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though CA, Inc. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of C. This gives CA a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past thirty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 3.2% in the past one month, while the full year estimate has inched up 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:CA Inc. Price and Consensus  CA Inc. Price and Consensus | CA Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCA, Inc. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 33% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

390,CA,"The technology sector is poised to hog the spotlight as we head into the busiest week of the Q3 earnings cycle.According to the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members or 24.7% of the index’s total membership have reported quarterly results as of Oct 20. Of these, approximately 71.3% of the companies posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 9.4% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 7.3%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally see back-to-back five quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 2.6% from the year-ago period, while total revenues will be up 5%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology is one of the four sectors which are expected to report strong earnings growth in the third quarter. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction.Various technology giants, including Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report quarterly numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues for the third quarter.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies Poised to ShineThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s See How CA, CTXS and FFIV are PlacedCA Inc.’s (CA  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results seem to benefit from its acquisition and sales strategies. Acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio.  Acquisitions have fortified its position in virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. We believe the diversity of the company’s products and increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will entice customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Furthermore, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy helps generate sales while simultaneously slashing costs. However, heightening competition from Oracle, International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as adverse currency translations continue to be hurdles, and are expected to dent margins and sales in fiscal 2018. (Read: Buyout & Sale Strategies to Drive CA Inc's Q2 Earnings)Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.6% in the trailing four quarters.

The Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, up 3.2% from second-quarter fiscal 2017.Let’s take a sneak peek at Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25. Things do not look bright for the company in the quarter under review. Citrix has an Earnings ESP of -0.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 for the third quarter remained unchanged in a month’s time.Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Revenues from products and licenses are expected to be soft in the quarter under review, in turn, hurting the top line. However, revenues from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are likely to be strong in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s total revenues is pegged at $691.2 million for the third quarter, down 17.8% from the prior-year quarter.Furthermore, we expect escalating costs to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter. With the company making significant investments to expand its product portfolio, costs are likely to flare up. Personnel expenses are expected to shoot up as well, hurting the bottom line. In addition to this, Citrix System’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.

(FFIV  -  Free Report), a developer and provider of software defined application services, is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results this Wednesday. The company has a mixed surprise history, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters, missing in one occasion and matching in the other. Nevertheless, it has an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.It seems that in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company’s earnings will miss the Consensus Estimate as it has an ESP of -0.93% and Zacks Rank #4. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $536.8 million and $2.20, respectivelyF5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | F5 Networks, Inc. QuoteThe company’s top- and bottom-line performances are expected to be adversely affected by volatile spending atmosphere and competitive threats. Cisco Systems poses the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market. Additionally, Citrix Inc., Juniper Networks, Checkpoint Systems, and Barracuda Networks also have strong technology platforms that could pose significant competitive threat on improved execution.

But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

391,CA,"CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 25. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this IT management software company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in to-be-reported quarter. Notably, CA has delivered positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 7.6%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 62 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.05 billion, up slightly 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe expect CA’s acquisition and go-to-market sales strategies to drive the fiscal second-quarter top-line performance.Let’s discuss the aforementioned factors one by one.Acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio. The company in 2017 so far has completed the acquisition of Automic Holding GmbH and Veracode. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. These are some of the broad-based acquisition strategies adopted by the company in the recent past. We believe the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.Furthermore, CA has adopted a “go to market” sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        CA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CA Inc. QuoteApart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing in a bid to enable organizations to source the best components — internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more — to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.Further, the company is focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.On the other hand, heightening competition from Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as exposure to Europe remain near-term headwinds.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 62 cents. The combination of CA's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Avnet, Inc. (AVT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.

394,CA,"If you are still holding on to shares of CyberArk Software Ltd. (CYBR  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Dropping CyberArk can maximize investor’s portfolio returns as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past one year, and has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.CyberArk has lost 26.8% of its value year over year versus the 11.3% growth of its industry. The stock carries a VGM Score of D.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking this company down.Why CyberArk Should be AvoidedCyberArk is an Israeli company that specializes in protecting accounts from cyber-attacks. The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in the security system, and secure cloud-based assets.For the full year 2017, we have seen eight estimates moving south in the past 30 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend downward, going from $1.09 per share a month ago to its current level of $1.05.Additionally, for the current quarter, CyberArk has seen 11 downward estimate revisions against no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 19 cents per share from 25 cents in the past 30 days.The company’s non-GAAP earnings per share for second-quarter 2017 came in at 21 cents, which declined 27.6% on a year-over-year basis. On an adjusted basis too, earnings per share (excluding amortization of intangible assets and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) on a proportionate tax basis came in at 11 cents per share, registering a plunge of 47.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 21 cents.The year-over-year plunged in earnings on both fronts, i.e. non-GAAP and adjusted, was mainly due to the lower-than-expected sales growth and elevated operating expenses.Though, CyberArk’s revenues increased just 14.1% year over year to $57.5 million, it was the slowest since it got listed in 2014. The company’s revenues also fell short of management’s guided range of $61-$62 million (mid-point $61.5 million), as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $58 million, mainly due to weak performance in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region resulting from some sales execution problem.The company also provided sluggish revenue guidance for the third quarter and full-year 2017.For the third quarter, CyberArk expects revenues in the range of $62-$63 million (mid-point $62.5 million), representing 13-15% year-over-year growth. The mid-point of the guided range, however, is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.26 million.For the year, the company lowered outlook. CyberArk now anticipates revenues in the band of $253-$256 million (mid-point $254.5 million), representing 17-18% year-over-year growth, down from the previous range of $268.5–$271.5 million (mid-point $270 million).

However, it registered a plunge of 47.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 21 cents.The year-over-year plunged in earnings on both fronts, i.e. non-GAAP and adjusted, was mainly due to the lower-than-expected sales growth and elevated operating expenses.CyberArk Software Ltd.

QuoteQuarter in DetailCyberArk’s revenues increased just 14.1% year over year to $57.5 million, slowest since it got listed in 2014. The company’s revenues also fell short of management’s guided range of $61–$62 million (mid-point $61.5 million), as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $58 million, mainly due to weak performance in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region resulting from some sales execution problem.Segment wise, License revenues which accounted for 53% of total revenue, increased 1.2% year over year to $30.3 million.

However, EMEA witnessed a 5% decline and accounted for 24% of total revenue.CyberArk’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 85.2% in the second quarter from 87.6% in the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to slight change in the revenue mix, and investments cloud infrastructure and professional services.The company’s non-GAAP operating margin declined to 15.3% from 26.9%, primarily due to lower gross margin and elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Escalated operating expenses were mainly stemmed by increased investment toward enhancing product offerings and expanding sales capabilities.CyberArk exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and marketable securities of approximately $239 million, down from $267.7 million at the end of first-quarter 2017. Receivables were $30.3 million at the end of the reported quarter.CyberArk’s balance sheet does not have any long-term debt.

However, over the years, the company expanded capabilities beyond hardware sales and patent licensing to online subscription services.The merger has brought together two leading players in the media entertainment industry, with complementary products and services as well as a number of patented technologies.

It is streamed live, four times per week, and features breaking news and analysis from Zacks strategists. Free Lunch is available on YouTube, Facebook Live, Twitter, Ustream, and more.Up first, Ryan discusses Broadcom’s rough morning of trading after the chip behemoth announced it is purchasing CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion in cash. CA is a giant in the mainframe software industry, but that business is falling out of favor as customers continue to shift toward cloud computing.So why would Broadcom shell out so much cash for a dated brand? Some have said desperation after its Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) merger fell through, while others have suggested it might be another moment of brilliance from CEO Hock Tan.Ryan digs into these reactions and gives his own perspective on the story. Next, the host analyst notes related to Netflix and Amazon which have hogged headlines this morning.Netflix shares dipped in early trading after analysts from UBS lowered their rating to neutral from buy, citing the video streaming giant’s stretched valuation. Eric Sheridan, the leading analyst on UBS’ note, credited Netflix’s work in content and technology, but ultimately described the goods news as “priced in” to the stock.On the opposite end of the spectrum was Canaccord Genuity’s note on Amazon, which included a new $2,000 price target for the e-commerce stock. Ryan discusses both notes and shares his thoughts on Netflix, Amazon, and other “FAANG” stocks on the first half of today’s show.On the second half of the episode, Ryan is joined by Zacks Strategist Dave Bartosiak to preview Friday morning’s top bank earnings reports from the likes of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Rising rates should be a catalyst for these big financials, but a flattening yield curve has led to apathy from analysts—a feeling that both Dave and Ryan mirror. Nevertheless, make sure to check out the episode to hear exactly what they have to say about the big banks!The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

405,CA,"Shares of Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) tumbled about 17% in early morning trading Thursday after the chip manufacturer announced the surprise acquisition of CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) in a deal valued at $18.9 billion.Broadcom will pay that sum in cash for CA, a designer of mainframe software based in New York City. The purchase comes just months after President Trump blocked the chip giant’s proposed $117 million merger with Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report).Initial reactions to the Broadcom-CA deal are rife with confusion, as analysts and investors alike appear to be struggling to find a rationale for the semiconductor company’s sudden interest in the software space.“We think investors will likely be disappointed at this deal, which seems more financial engineering/PE driven than due to any strategic rationale,” wrote analyst from Evercore in a note Thursday morning.CA’s primary business is selling software for massive, mainframe computers, and admittedly, Broadcom will now be a major competitor in that industry. Its new acquisition is second only to IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) in the mainframe software business, and the firm generates a healthy $10 billion in annual cash flow from its operations.Still, some analysts have already pointed out that such a major bet on mainframe computing makes little sense in a world where customers are choosing cloud services over old-school hardware.“While CA is a departure from Broadcom's core semiconductor business, it is consistent with its track record of acquiring out-of-favor, market leaders with high cost structures,” said Jefferies analysts. “Importantly, AVGO has consistently demonstrated its ability to drive costs down and margins of its acquisitions up, often measured in 1,000s of basis points.”This sentiment from Jefferies is in harsh contrast to what some optimistic investors might point to right now: the ambition of Broadcom chief Hock Tan.Tan has helped grow the company from a relatively minor chipmaker to a worldwide titan through a number of hopeful deals, and the executive as earned the respect of many on Wall Street. Still, today’s move has brought out the most skeptical of voices.Investors have other reasons to be skeptical too, with Broadcom shares effectively flat lining over the past year despite sizeable gains for others in the semiconductor industry.What’s more, analyst sentiment was already mixed heading into today’s announcement. The firm’s current fiscal year ends in October, and looking ahead, analysts appear uncertain as to what fiscal 2019 holds for Broadcom.Over the past 60 days, AVGO has witnessed nine positive revisions to its fiscal 2019 earnings estimates, but five negative revisions have also come in during this stretch. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has gained in the trailing two months but is down from where it started the current quarter at.This mixed revision activity has kept Broadcom at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for now.Want more market analysis from this author?

406,CA,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CA, Inc (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion in cash. The chipmaker intends to enhance its long-term margins with the buyout of CA, a leading IT management software provider. The buyout is subject to CA shareholder nod and other customary regulatory approvals from Japan, European Union and the United States.Broadcom’s move of shifting headquarters to San Jose, CA from Singapore, will aid it to pursue the acquisition of Islandia, NY-based CA. The base-shift is anticipated to make the regulatory environment less complicated for Broadcom. Moreover, the company can reap the benefits of cost reduction as well as lessened competition. However, the Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) deal still hasn’t materialized despite re-domiciliation. The issue remains a concern even for the ongoing CA agreement.Nevertheless, after fulfilling the regulatory approvals, Broadcom expects the deal to close in fourth quarter of 2018. Following the buyout, chipmaker anticipates the buyout to boost long-term adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 55%. The company envisionsthe acquisition to be immediately accretive, enabling it to continue earnings in double digit CAGR.Moreover, on a combined basis, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be roughly $23.9 billion in the last 12 months and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $11.6 billionFollowing the news, Broadcom’s shares were down almost 9% in pre-market trade, while that of CA went up approximately 18%. Shares of Broadcom were down owing to high debt level which the company will incur in regard to the acquisition. Moreover, its shares have returned just 0.9% in the past year underperforming the industry’s rally of 1.8%.How Will Broadcom Pay $18.9 Billion in Cash?Broadcom will incur a new committed debt to finance $18 billion while the remaining will be paid from cash on hand. Consequently, CA shareholders will obtain $44.50 per share in cash, approximately 19.6% premium over the $37.21 price on Jul 11, 2018 after market close.Notably, as on May 6, 2018, cash & cash equivalents of Broadcom were $8.2 billion compared with $7.1 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $17.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, which was flat compared with the preceding quarter level.What Prompted The Chipmaker to Bid For a Software Company?The increasing demand of IT management software solutions persuaded Broadcom to pick CA. This out-of-the-box move from the chipmaker took the shareholders, investors and analysts by surprise. Broadcom’s CEO and president Hock Tan said, “This transaction represents an important building block as we create one of the world’s leading infrastructure technology companies.”CA has been benefiting from higher Mainframe new sales as well as solid demand for its recently launched Trusted Access Manager for Z, a Mainframe solution. The previous buyouts have enhanced the software providers’ IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, the depth of its product portfolio and the increased efficiency offered by it has witnessed solid adoption, strengthening its business model.CA’s substantial customer base will enable Broadcom to explore the infrastructure software market and expand its TAM. The company attempts to expand mission critical technology solutions portfolio on the heels of CA’s mainframe and enterprise software businesses.Our TakeConsidering its business line, we are of the opinion that Broadcom is foraying into unfamiliar territory with this buyout. We remain inquisitive as to how it will integrate CA’s software business with the chipmaker’s methodologies. The move is in contrast with Broadcom’s previous acquisitions and it will be interesting to observe its strategy to capitalize on the potential of growing software business.However, diversification of end market and customer base bodes well for the long haul. This is anticipated to add resilience to Broadcom’s current business model.Zacks Rank & Key PickBroadcom carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You may consider Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), from the same industry. The company has a long-term EPS growth rate of 15%.

407,CA,"Semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) has decided to buy mainframe and infrastructure software provider CA Inc (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion or $44.50 per share in cash, representing a 20% premium to the company’s closing price on Wednesday. Government approvals are pending.Rationale for CACA hasn’t done so well in the last few years. Revenues have declined consistently between 2013 and 2016, more or less flat-lining last year and picking up in its fiscal 2018 due to the contribution from acquisitions. Gross profit shows a similar pattern. While the EBIT has picked up this year, the consistently rising interest and taxes have depressed its earnings performance.The company intended to modernize its solutions by incorporating automation, data, analytics and security into its products through organic product development or acquisitions with a customer focus. It also recently announced a headcount reduction of 800 to align with its changing strategy. Since Broadcom is a master at integrations, it makes sense for the company to turn the reins over to somebody with more experience. So there’s good reason for CA shareholders to cheer, which they did, sending shares soaring yesterday, after the news broke.What’s In It For BroadcomBroadcom on the other hand is a semiconductor company that has mainly grown by acquiring companies in the same industry and then trimming them down to maximize efficiencies. There isn’t much in its past to suggest that it would head into software next. So investors are understandably concerned about how this integration will go and also, whether the company will succeed in its diversification-beyond-semis strategy. No wonder then that the shares plummeted following the announcement.But there are some positives as well.First, CA is in trimming mode, which works nicely with Broadcom CEO Hock Tan’s line of thinking. So some of the work that he would need to do is already being done.Second, semiconductor deals of the kind Broadcom pursues are getting harder and harder to come by because of the significant amount of consolidation the industry has already seen. The current deals on the stage are very high-profile, intended to capture product roadmaps and including a higher element of risk. The payback period is also relatively more uncertain.Third, software is the future. Even hardware companies generally have software integration units, but the way technology is advancing, software opportunities are opening up in every sphere of life as individuals, companies and other entities are all increasingly turning to the cloud with always-connected devices to store, process and retrieve their information that is then used in everyday decision making. For an acquisitive technology company to completely pass up this opportunity may not be such a good idea.Fourth, CA’s mainframe business is likely to generate a steady flow of revenues with better visibility. The infrastructure market is big and expanding, so there’s room for multiple players to grow. Augmenting with other deals in the space could help Broadcom become an important player.  ConclusionIt’s a daring move for Broadcom, especially considering its unproven software capabilities and the price tag (roughly 4.5X its 2018 revenue). But the good thing is, it will be immediately accretive.Another concern is whether Broadcom will be able to balance its cost-cutting itch with the need to invest resources in R&D because that is a software company’s life blood.Whether it will succeed in this effort is anybody’s guess, but it’s a good time to try.   RecommendationsBoth CA and Broadcom carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So better buys would be buy-ranked companies like Autohome (ATHM  -  Free Report), TTM Technologies (TTMI  -  Free Report), Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Cyberark Software (CYBR  -  Free Report).
