Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all climbed above their 50-day moving averages in Tuesday's session. That technical line had presented a possible barrier to the market's week-old uptrend. The test through the remainder of the week is whether the benchmark indexes are able to maintain that new level of support.Among the top tech stocks in early motion, Intuitive Surgical bolted 5.4% higher. The maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system reported a 25% EPS gain and an 18% rise in revenue for its first quarter late Tuesday.

The legacy tech brand posted stronger-than-expected Q1 results, and reported a second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in more than four years.

The stock has had little success in attempts to climb out of a 13-month consolidation.IBD 50 issue Interactive Brokers (IBKR) edged up 1.5% in premarket trade. The Greenwich, Conn.-based online broker reported larger-than-forecasts sales and earnings gains after Tuesday's close.  The stock closed Tuesday in a buy range, above a 74.21 buy point in a flat base.Morgan Stanley (MS), ASML Holding (ASML) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are among the names reporting results early Wednesday.Wednesday's session also offers a simple calendar of economic releases.

27,CSX,"The death of CSX (CSX) Chief Executive Officer E. Hunter Harrison just two days after the railroad announced his medical leave resurrects questions about just how much companies should disclose about the health of their leaders.X Harrison, 73, died Saturday of ""unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness,"" CSX said without elaborating. Harrison had been turning around CSX since being hired in March, as he had previously done at three other railroads. News of his declining health had pushed the company's shares down the most in more than six years on Friday.Like former Apple (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs, who battled pancreatic cancer before his death in 2011, Harrison had both health problems and a reputation that buoyed shares in his company. Harrison had bypass heart surgery in 1998 and missed work in 2015 because of pneumonia and the implant of stents in his legs. Before CSX hired him, he declined the company's request for an independent doctor to review his medical records.In May, the Wall Street Journal reported Harrison's use of supplemental oxygen. In response, he said: ""Don't judge me by my medical record, judge me by my performance.""CSX investors cheered Harrison's performance, sending shares up about 60% in this year through Dec. 14, hours before his medical leave was disclosed. Shareholders had approved paying him $84 million he relinquished under a contract at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., and Harrison said he planned to guide CSX for the course of his four-year contract.The stock fell 3.3% to $51.16 at 7:19 a.m. in premarket trading Monday in New York, following a 7.6% decline Friday, the biggest drop since September 2011, after the medical leave was announced.""We are confident that our disclosures are adequate and appropriate,"" Bryan Tucker, a CSX spokesman, said via email on Sunday.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules don't require companies to disclose serious health problems in the executive suite, said Allan Horwich, a partner at Schiff Hardin LLP and Northwestern University law professor. That said, a company couldn't issue half-truths or lie about an executive.""The most important thing is whether there were statements made by the company since he was hired that were inconsistent with the true state of his health at the time, and whether the company knew that,"" Horwich said. ""Did they knowingly or recklessly omit facts in what they said about the management team that would expose them to liability?""Disclosures are judged by what the company knew in assessing the future, he said.""If things didn't turn out as they expected, that doesn't mean that the company lied or that the disclosure was defective,"" he said.Disclosure rules for a key executive also must weigh that individual's right to privacy, said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.""This is the classic example of when an individual's health is tied dramatically to the success of a company, it becomes a matter of disclosure,"" Elson said. His pay ""would suggest that his presence at the company was considered incredibly important to shareholders and therefore his health would be relevant.""Such situations always raise the risk of litigation, Elson said. ""Any time that people are disappointed and feel the company wasn't as forthright as they should have been, you'll see litigation,"" Elson said. ""But how does anybody know when their time is up?""

That suggests a move above a 231.87 buy point from a flat base.But the relative strength line, with tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the end of November, actually hitting a consolidation low on Thursday.Ideally, a stock's RS line (the blue line in the charts below) should lead or confirm a breakout.A strong breakout could push the RS line to at least a short-term high over its pseudo-handle.  Flat bases do not have handles, and this brief pause was not long enough to qualify as a handle in any other pattern, but it's still something for the RS line to try to top.UnitedHealth also is the first managed-care company to report for the latest quarter, with several in or near buy zones. Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI) moved into a buy zone Friday, joining Humana (HUM), though none of the breakouts came on impressive volume and their RS lines continue to lag. Aetna (AET) and WellCare Helath Plans (WCG) are near buy points but with lagging RS lines.Citigroup reports early Tuesday as well. EPS should edge up 4.4% to $1.19, with revenue edging up 0.5% to $17.09 billion.Citigroup has a flat base that's a half-step above a prior flat base, which was just above yet another flat base. The buy point is 78.02. Shares rose to 76.84 on Friday.But Citigroup, which outperformed the RS line from early June to early October and generally outperformed rival banks over that span, has had a declining RS line since then.Citigroup follows bank earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) on Friday. Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report later this week.Comerica also reports Q4 earnings early Tuesday, with analysts forecasting a 31.5% EPS jump to $1.21 billion with revenue climbing 13% to $819 million.Comerica shares have risen 7.2% in January and are well extended from any buy point. The stock's RS line has been rising for the past four months.Rail giant CSX delivers Q4 results after Tuesday's close. Analysts expect a 14% advance to 56 cents even as revenue slides 5% to $2.88 billion. This is the first report after CSX named James Foote CEO in December following the death of veteran railroad exec Hunter Harrison.CSX's stock is modestly extended from a 55.09 buy point. Shares briefly tumbled on news that Harrison was taking a leave of absence followed quickly by his death, but shares didn't fall quite enough to invalidate the buy point. Also, shares found support at their 200-day line and never closed below their 50-day.CSX's RS line initially confirmed the Nov. 30 breakout. But the RS line hasn't made headway since then, and has generally been lagging for more than six months.Later this week, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) will report quarterly results. Canadian Pacific is in a buy zone while Kansas City is near a flat base buy point, but both have lagging RS lines.Interactive Brokers reports will issue results late Tuesday. Revenue should more than double to $399 billion with earnings sprinting to 39 cents  a share vs. 7 cents a year ago.Shares cleared a short consolidation last week, hitting new all-time highs.

CSX said late Thursday that Harrison, a widely revered industry veteran, was taking medical leave.X ""It is with great sadness that we announce that E. Hunter Harrison, President and Chief Executive Officer of CSX, died today in Wellington, Fla., due to unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness,"" CSX said in a statement.

Hunter was a larger-than-life figure who brought his remarkable passion, experience and energy in railroading to CSX.""Hunter, 73, was named CEO in March at the urging of activist investors. CSX shares plunged 7.6% to 52.93 on Friday's stock market trading on word of his leave of absence, making it the biggest loser on the S&P 500 index that day.

32,CSX,"CSX (CSX) shares tanked Friday, with the railroad operator losing billions in market value after reporting late Thursday that CEO Hunter Harrison — installed by activist investors at the start of this year — would take an unexpected medical leave of absence.X Jim Foote, chief operating officer since October, will temporarily assume the CEO position. He told investors in a Friday morning call that Harrison became ill last week after one of the chief executive's regular multiday pep-talks with management, and that the illness ""led to medical complications,"" The Wall Street Journal reported.Foote declined to discuss Harrison's medical condition and didn't divulge when the chief executive, who has been using an oxygen tank in recent months and largely working from his Florida home, might return, the Journal added.CSX plunged 7.6% to 52.93 on the stock market today. The sharp move lower saw the Florida railroader's stock undercut the 55.09 flat-base buy point it cleared in heavy volume just three weeks ago. Shares were right around their 50-day moving average after an intraday tumble to their 200-day line.Harrison's medical leave introduces incremental risk and uncertainty to CSX's  trajectory, Baird senior research analyst Benjamin Hartford wrote Friday. But with the stock near 50 and with  accelerating EBIT growth expected in upcoming quarters, Hartford sees a path to further outperformance.""We would be buyers on this morning's pullback,"" said Hartford. ""In our view, $48-50 offers near-term support.""Hartford has an outperform rating on CSX stock and a price target of 58.Among other railroad stocks, Union Pacific (UNP) added 1.1% to 130.57 while Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC) reversed higher for a 0.2% gain to 141.11.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.According to the Journal, the CSX board was aware it was hiring a 73-year-old railroad veteran with ""known health risks,"" initially resisting pressure to do so from activist investor Mantle Ridge but finally agreeing to hire him.Harrison won a four-year contract, including an $84 million payment, with investor approval. Foote signaled CSX would continue with Harrison's ""disruptive"" turnaround strategy, featuring new train schedules, cost-cutting and terminal closures, but faced spiraling problems and customer complaints, the report said.CSX stock spiked massively at the start of 2017 when Harrison left Canadian Pacific (CP) to take over at CSX, raising hopes for a shake-up at the Florida company. But shares leveled off and moved sideways for several subsequent months before breaking out in late November.CSX matched earnings views in its last quarterly report, in mid October, but revenues slightly missed. Harrison said at the time the results reflected the resiliency of  the turnaround strategy he calls ""precision railroading"" and described the company's transition as ""largely behind us.""RELATED:Dow Stocks Lead Early Surge; Costco Gains, Top Railroad Sells OffOne Of The Hottest Dow Stocks Has A New Buy Point: Investing Action Plan

"
41,CSX,"At least 10 of the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2 points or more to help power the blue chip index to a 1.4% gain and a leading position within Thursday's broad market rebound.XThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.8% in November, raising its year-to-date advance to 22.8%.Meanwhile, innovative new discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) rushed more than 3% higher in extended hours trading after announcing sparkling fiscal third-quarter results with earnings up 80% to 18 cents a share, crushing the 13-cent consensus view. Net margin shot 110 basis points higher to 3.8%.Revenue jumped 29% to $257.2 million, also beating views. In the prior four quarters, Five Below's revenue rose 18%, 19%, 21% and 29% vs. year- ago levels.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped as much as 1.6% and notched an all-time high of 24,327, breaking past 24,000 for the first time. At 24,272, the 30-stock Dow is now up almost 23% year to date.The Nasdaq composite recouped much of Wednesday's 1.3% drop, rising 0.7%. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies in the all-electronic exchange, rebounded nearly 0.8%. The S&P 500 also rallied 0.8%. Volume zoomed higher on the NYSE on a blast of turnover in the final minutes and was virtually even on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq composite rose 2.2% in November and is up 23.1% since Jan. 1, vs. a 2.8% monthly lift and a 18.3% year-to-date gain for the 500.Five Below, the Sector Leader and highly rated member of IBD's discount and variety retail group had already become extended from a pair of proper buy points. At Thursday's close of 61.77, Five Below was up nearly 14% from a five-month cup base with a 54.23 buy point. The small cap firm is also up nearly 7% past a narrow flat base with a 57.75 entry.Five Below's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group ranks 68th among 197 industry groups and subgroups rated each day for relative six-month price performance by IBD. In general, the biggest stock market winners hail from the top 20 to 40 industry groups. However, Five Below's group has jumped to its current spot from No. 102 four weeks ago, a good sign.IBD's TAKE: Track the industry groups moving fast up the rankings by going to Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, then click on Industry Sub-Group Rankings. IBD research has found that up to 50% of a leading stock's move can be attributed to the strength of its industry group and broad industry sector.Five Below is a relatively new public company, debuting in July 2012 at 17 a share. It has a very reasonable float of 54 million shares, easily meeting the criteria of S in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The S stands for supply vs. demand. Goldman Sachs (GS) led the way among Dow 30 stocks in terms of point gain, rising more than 6 points, or nearly 3%, to 247.64. At one point, shares moved past a 247.84 buy point in  a nearly nine month saucer with handle.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, stretched its gains from an Oct. 27 breakout from a good cup with handle and a 160.97 buy point by rebounding 2.37, or 1.4%, to 171.85 in fast turnover. More than 40.1 million shares traded hands, 48% higher than usual.The gain for Apple from latest correct buy point is now back to 6.7%. The iPhone giant has also risen 45% since marking a breakout from a bottoming base on Jan. 6-9. At that time, Apple also cleared a cup with handle, shoving past a 118.12 entry.Back to Five Below, the Philadelphia-based company now operates more than 600 stores in 32 states. It has zero long-term debt and expanded its shareholders equity to $381 million vs. $288 million in the year-ago period.Five Below also forecast sales of $491 million to $503 million for the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter, well above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $484.1 million. Executives also see earnings of $1.09 to $1.16 a share, or up 21% to 29%.Five Below and peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) are the only two stocks in IBD's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group to earn a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup.Railroad giant CSX (CSX) gained more than 2%, rolling past a 55.09 entry in a 19-week flat base and is up nearly 9% for the week. Volume is heavy, running more than 60% above its usual pace. The RS line, drawn in blue on IBD's daily and weekly charts, is not at all-time highs but is rising sharply in recent weeks.Norfolk Southern (NSC) joined the breakout train, rising nearly 2% in spirited volume and moving past a 134.62 buy point.Both Norfolk and CSX have shown improved fundamentals, at least on a quarterly basis. The former has grown profit 9%, 15%, 26% and 13% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters, while the latter has seen EPS gains of 21%, 38%, 36% and 6%. CSX's profit, however, is seen dipping 2% to 57 cents a share, due in part to a tough year over year comparison.The Dow Jones transports, up 3.3% and posting a closing high on Wednesday, ramped another 2.1% higher to all-time highs.Back to Apple, the company has shown improving fundamentals over the past 12 months, and the Street appears confident that the turnaround will continue. Over the next two quarters, analysts on consensus see earnings growing 12% and 39%. That would extend Apple's streak of double-digit EPS growth to five straight quarters.Revenue increases are helping drive those positive expectations.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, Apple's sales slumped 9%. After that, revenue turned around, rising 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% in the next four quarters. Apple is now seen growing the top line 10% in the current first quarter (ending in December) to $86.18 billion, then another 30% to $68.77 billion in Q2 of fiscal 2018.Strong orders for the ultra-luxury iPhone X, a major iPhone replacement cycle, strength in digital services, increasing popularity of the cellular-enabled Apple Watch, and other products are helping continue Apple's dominance in consumer electronics.Apple's stock price strength also is improving. According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Relative Price Strength Rating is a respectable 80 on a scale of 1 (weak) to 99 (strong), up sharply since scoring a 59 on Jan. 1.Meanwhile, Apple's EPS Rating has improved to a solid 90 (also on a scale of 1 to 99), up from 45 on Jan. 1. The SMR Rating, which analyzes sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity, is at a top-shelf A on a scale of A to E.In the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, Apple's aftertax margin rose 120 basis points to 20.4%, indicating strong pricing power of its products as well as likely hinting at improved operating leverage or cost efficiencies.Semiconductor stocks are trying to rebound. Nvidia (NVDA), a leader in chips for artificial intelligence, data center, self-driving and virtual currency markets, is trying to stem its decline after briefly sliding through the 50-day moving average on Wednesday.Shares gained 2%. The long-term uptrend is intact, and Nvidia still holds a 14% gain since clearing a narrow flat base with a a 174.66 buy point on Sept. 15.Nvidia, an IBD 50 play at No. 10 and recently highlighted in IBD Sector Leaders, is facing tough year-over-year comparisons after posting large double-digit to triple-digit earnings gains since the second half of fiscal 2017, ended in January. Yet Wall Street still anticipates solid growth in the quarters ahead. Analysts on consensus forecast a 16% rise in January-ending Q4 profit to $1.15 a share on a 22% jump in sales to $2.66 billion, which would be a quarterly best.Growth is expected to reaccelerate in Q1 of fiscal 2019, with earnings rising 24% to 98 cents a share on a 27% pickup in sales to $2.46 billion.Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), however, failed to hold on to early gains and fell mildly. Both are members of IBD Big Cap 20. Watch to see if they can recover their respective 50-day moving averages. Failure to do so would trigger a sell signal.In other financial markets, investors trimmed more of their long-term government bond holdings ahead of a widely expected Federal Reserve hike in interest rates. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.41%, the highest since late October.Despite elevated crude oil prices in recent months, transport stocks continued to thrive. This may come as no surprise given the acceleration of the U.S. economy, which rose at a revised 3.3% annualized rate in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturing output data came in stronger than expected.In addition to the Senate's vote on a major tax reform bill that could sharply reduce corporate taxes, Wall Street will focus on the ISM manufacturing survey for November, due Friday at 10 a.m. ET.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Bitcoin Reverses; 3 Reasons Why The Tech Rally Isn't OverFinding Great New IPO Stocks: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Intel and Cisco?These 7 IBD Stock Lists Are Crushing The Major Indexes This YearThe Big Picture: Why Square May Need To Take A BreakStocks Near A Buy ZoneWant To Find The Next Nvidia?

43,CSX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose solidly early Monday morning as Wall Street continues momentum with Congress likely to approve tax cuts before Christmas. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" topped most opening weekend estimates with Walt Disney (DIS) already entering buy range Friday following its deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast (CMCSA) are near buy points while Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) are in buy ranges.X Meanwhile, CSX (CSX) could come under further pressure after CEO Hunter Harrison died Saturday. Oracle (ORCL) on Sunday agreed to buy Aconex, an Australian cloud-based software maker for construction projects, for $1.2 billion, a 47% premium.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.4% above fair value. Dow futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures rallied 0.6% vs. fair value.  The major averages hit record highs Friday as Republicans unveiled their final tax bill with apparently enough support to pass. Congress is expected to vote on the legislation this week.Bitcoin futures were at $19,230 on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), near session lows but up from Friday. CME Group (CME) Bitcoin futures opened above $20,000 in their debut but then pulled back $19,390.Walt Disney is one of three Dow stocks to claim buy points on Friday.Disney climbed 0.6% to 111.27 on Friday, closing above a 110.93 double-bottom entry after a few intraday moves above that level this month. Disney jumped 6.75% for the week as it agreed to buy key Fox entertainment assets and more for $66 billion, including assumed debt.""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" will reap an estimated $220 million this weekend in the U.S. on top of $45 million in its Thursday's night openings. That's above Disney's estimate for $205 million.Disney is gearing up to launch a stand-alone subscription streaming service in 2019, with Star Wars films and a new live-action Star Wars series among the key content.Disney's upcoming streaming service, and its planned removal of Marvel and Star Wars content from Netflix, will make Netflix more reliant than ever on its own original content. But Netflix is increasingly becoming a must-have for households, even if they subscribe to other streaming or traditional pay-TV services. Netflix is a major reason why many traditional media players are scrambling.Netflix shares rose 0.3% to 190.12 in Friday's stock market trading. Netflix is in a flat base with a 204.48 buy point, but is currently trading below its 50-day moving average. A strong retaking of that support level in high volume could offer a buying opportunity.Comcast held out better than most media and entertainment stocks, but finally broke down in September before finding a bottom in early November. Comcast has formed a handle in a six-month consolidation, creating a 40.83 buy point.Comcast's Relative Strength line has been weak for months, as the stock has retreated while the S&P 500 index continued to march higher.Comcast is the leading U.S. cable and internet provider. It also owns NBCUniversal, making it a major content creator.Verizon is the No. 1 wireless operator. Telecom giants are often seen as distinct from cable and media stocks, but there is growing overlap. Americans, especially teens and young adults, increasingly use their smartphone as their screen for content. Also,Verizon offers pay-TV and internet service via Fios. Verizon also plans to launch 5G wireless broadband in select U.S. markets, competing with Comcast's landline broadband.Verizon bought Yahoo earlier this year following its purchase of AOL. Verizon owns Huffington Post and Tech Crunch.Verizon cleared a 51.28 bottoming-base buy point on Dec. 4, but then fell back down. But the Dow industrials component retook that entry on Dec. 11, closing Friday at 52.67.AT&T has an even better claim as a media claim than Verizon. In addition to being a wireless giant, AT&T owns the DirecTV satellite service, along with the streaming DirecTV Now. AT&T also is trying to buy Time Warner (TWX), which would make a major content player, with CNN, TNT, HBO and more.The Justice Department is fighting to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, saying it would be anti-competitive.AT&T has cleared a 37.64 cup-with-handle buy point last week, ending Friday at 38.24. But there are definitely reasons to be cautious. AT&T fell to a two-year low on Nov. 6. It's rallied since then but the stock has no prior uptrend before the current consolidation. Shares have closed above their 200-day moving average for the first time in eight months.CSX CEO Hunter Harrison died Saturday from complications from an undisclosed illness.

44,CSX,"The Nasdaq ran ahead of the major market averages Friday, up 1.2% as rising optimism regarding a GOP tax reform effort helped drive blue chip tech names including Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and United Technologies (UTX) to the head of the Nasdaq 100.X Electronics makers and staffing companies, metals and drug distributors were among the many industries to post gains of better than 3% during the session.The advance was sufficient to lift the Nasdaq past its Nov. 28 peak to its first new high in three weeks. The S&P 500 gained  0.9%, also scratching off a new high as Under Armour (UA) took the index's largest gain, surging 9% after Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the stock to buy, from hold.That put Under Armour shares back above their 10-week moving average and up 32% from a November low, although still deep in a 20-month correction.Railroad CSX (CSX), Barbie-maker Mattel (MAT) and chipmaker Oracle (ORCL) turned in the S&P 500's worst losses, down 8%, 5% and 4%, respectively.The Dow ran not quite as hot as its peer indexes, up 0.6%, but plenty strong enough to once again make news highs. Intel was the leader, up 3% on what appeared to be primarily a tax plan-related move.Small caps also did well with the Russell 2000 up 1.5%.Intel's gain put shares in a buy range on a rebound from support at the stock's 10-week moving average. The rebound occurred in only modest volume, and the chart pattern is also a flat base, so investors have the option of waiting to see whether shares climb past the 47.40 buy point.Microsoft took out its 86.30 buy point, rising nearly 3%  in powerful trade, moving to a new high but remaining well within buy range.Bitcoin drew heavy attention, with the cryptocurrency jumping 10% — back above $17,800.

Amazon (AMZN) rose 0.1%, as expectations rose for the e-commerce giant to emerge as the undisputed leader of holiday spending. Amazon is just 3% off its all-time high and still nearly 10% from a 1083.41 entry.Finally, Netflix (NFLX) reversed from nice gains to trade around its break-even mark, as the IBD SwingTrader member is shaping a new, flat base with a 204.48 buy point. The video-streaming giant broke out to a brief rally past a 190.05 cup base buy point in October, before surrendering those gains.Among companies reporting earnings, Adobe Systems' (ADBE) beat-and-raise Q4 results sparked a 1% gain early Friday.

46,CSX,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages to record highs helped by Trump tax cut momentum. Bitcoin futures had a successful launch on the Cboe Global Markets (CBOE).

The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers. Some analysts are expecting around $200 million from the film domestically. The film opened to the public on Thursday evening, with an estimated $45 million in ticket salesThe Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal utilitylike oversight on internet service providers, delivering regulatory reversal sought by Comcast, AT&T, Verizon Communications and other ISPs. FCC chairman Ajit Pai  said the new rules will ""return regulatory parity to the internet economy."" He said some giant internet companies engage in anti-consumer behavior, while ISPs have been unfairly targeted by regulators.

Snap has since rallied to 16.50, but still has not developed a sound base with a proper buy point.Roku is best known for its small set-top boxes for streaming TV used by many to access Netflix, Hulu and other streaming channels. Those Roku devices compete against the Amazon Fire TV stick, Apple (AAPL) TV and the Google Chromecast from Alphabet (GOOGL).

Stock futures had slumped overnight and remained weak before earnings reports begin to hit the wire early Tuesday.There was also weak economic news out of the real estate sector, with the National Association of Home Builders reporting its builder confidence survey slumped to 64 in July, down from June's reading of 69 and the lowest tally since November.Netflix scored a gap-up breakout, despite reporting mixed second-quarter results late Monday. The company reported adding 5.2 million new subscribers during the quarter, far above consensus views for 3.2 million. When the stock opened, it was extended above a standard flat-base buy point of 166.97. But the wide gap-up move enabled a technical buy range beginning roughly at the stock's 176.12 opening price. That left shares near the top of their buy range at the end of the session.PayPal rose more than 2% in quiet trade after a price hike, to 64 from 60, from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

73,CSX,"The stock market was at session highs in afternoon trading Wednesday as the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 made new all-time highs.XAs it has all week, the Nasdaq led the main indexes, adding 0.8% to a record high. Alphabet (GOOGL), the second-largest Nasdaq component after Apple (AAPL), is forming a flat base. But the stock topped an alternative entry at 994.09, using a middle peak in the W-like shape of the base. Its Google business is making new efforts to boost its social network offerings.The S&P 500 added 0.4% to an all-time high. The Russell 2000 rose 0.7% and also made a new high. The small-cap benchmark has had difficulty maintaining new highs, so its move in today's trading is one to watch for some follow through.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed only 0.1% as IBM (IBM) dragged the industrials. Big Blue gapped down in big volume to the lowest level since June of 2016. IBM reported Q2 revenue of $19.3 billion, down 5% and below the consensus estimate of $19.46 billion. It was the 21st straight quarter of declining quarterly sales. On the bright side, cloud sales rose 15% to $3.9 billion.Volume was running lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq compared with the same time yesterday. Breadth was better on the NYSE, where winners led losers by 13-to-5. Nasdaq gainers led by 9-to-5.The Dow transports were noticeably weaker, off 0.8%, as railroad operators (down on CSX's (CSX) post-earnings slide), airline and trucking stocks lagged. Oil, solar, fiber optic and some retail industry groups performed best. The computer-security industry group drew interest, as four stocks in the industry group topped buy points.Check Point Software (CHKP) broke out past the 115.97 buy point of a flat base. Volume was well above its normal pace, which bodes well for the breakout. FireEye (FEYE) — recovering from a severe correction that at one point wiped out almost 90% of its peak valuation — rose past the 16.35 buy point of a flat base. Volume was running double its normal pace.Fortinet (FTNT) surged 2.5% and climbed above the 41.43 buy point in a cup-without-handle base.

Fortinet will announce Q2 results next Wednesday after the close.Imperva (IMPV), another stock recovering from a long slump, is edging above a 51.85 buy point.  Volume was flat.In consumer products, Nutrisystem (NTRI) cleared a base, but the diet-products company had already topped a buy point at 55.10 from its double-bottom formation.

75,CSX,"Janus Henderson Forty Fund (JACAX) is about as hot as Kevin Durant was in the NBA Finals. That is, very!Thirty-two of the fund's 40 stocks had double-digit percentage gains so far this year going into June 14, according to Morningstar Inc. Three of those — electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and railroad CSX (CSX) — were up more than 50% for the year. As a result, going into Wednesday the fund's 19.38% year-to-date gain topped 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged 14.77%, and the S&P 500's 10.03% gain.The $751 million fund got more good news on Friday. Its No. 8 holding Amazon (AMZN) was up nearly 3% in the afternoon while the broad market measured by the S&P 500 was down roughly 1%. The Amazon boost reflected the market's thumbs-up vote in favor of the internet giant's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), which was announced in the morning. That put Amazon up 32% for the year. Investors appeared to believe that Amazon will be able to sweeten up Whole Foods' revenues and earnings.Thomson Reuters ranked the deal as Amazon's biggest of all time and the 11th biggest global retail deal ever.Already, the fund was outperforming 81% and 99% of its direct rivals over the past one and three years respectively. Lead manager Douglas Rao has been at the helm since June 1, 2013. Nick Schommer has been a manager since Jan. 12, 2016.The fund is growth oriented. And it is concentrated. True to its name, the fund limits its portfolio to its 40 best ideas. And, yes, that concentration can make the fund more volatile than its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.For example, in the fourth quarter the fund lost 1.47% vs. a 0.27% loss for the Russell bogey and a 3.82% gain by the S&P 500. The fund was hurt in part by the market's rotation away from the secular growth stocks it likes, toward companies with potential for improving cyclical prospects, the managers explain in their recent semiannual report. Cyclicals in energy, materials and industrials, for instance, benefited from the Trump Bump — a surge in bets on companies that could gain from increased spending on U.S. infrastructure.The fund's top performers have trended higher through the market's indecisive seesaw between cyclical and secular growth stocks in recent months.Look again at the fund's top performers. As IBD's Gillian Rich reported Tuesday, Tesla was upgraded to a buy at Berenberg and had its price target raised to 464 from 193. Despite efforts by BMW, Kia and General Motors (GM), analyst Alexander Haissl said no other automakers are currently building electric vehicles for the mass market that can compete with Tesla's offerings. The Model 3 is expected to go into production this year. Haissl also said the company's free-cash-flow potential is superior.Tesla is in IBD's Automobile Manufacturers industry group, which ranks No. 2 among 197 groups. Tesla closed at record highs in six of the eight trading sessions through Wednesday. Trading around 380, the stock is extended, outside its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.Also, some yellow caution flags are flapping around the stock's earnings. After posting a third-quarter profit, the company resumed losses the next two quarters, and the narrowing of the losses from year-earlier periods has slowed. And recent earnings-estimate revisions have been downward.Activision is also extended, trading in the high 50s. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Last month, Activision's first-quarter sales and earnings topped estimates. The company's Q2 revenue forecast topped expectations, but its EPS outlook was below analysts' views.CSX runs rail systems in 23 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. Its services include intermodal and rail-to-truck transload processes. Unlike those of Tesla and Activision, shares of CSX have slipped back into a buy range above their 50.41 entry.EPS grew 21% and 38% the past two quarters after four quarters of declines. Energy shipments and a stronger economy have boosted the rail firm's revenue.IBD'S TAKE: CSX ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail industry group. It has a 25.8% annual pretax margin. See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' data at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is another member of the IBD 50. Trading around 468, it has slipped back within a buy range from a 453.06 entry on a long cup base.EPS grew between 22% and 36% in each of the past four quarters. The drugmaker's Eylea macular degeneration treatment has been driving its growth. But that's not the only piston in Regeneron's engine. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges recently wrote to clients that Dupixent, an eczema treatment marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY), could easily outperform Wall Street models for the second quarter and for 2017 overall, IBD's Allison Gatlin has reported.Aerospace and defense stock General Dynamics (GD) is trading around 200, so it is still within buy range of a 194.10 buy point. EPS grew 7%, 9%, 9% and 19% the past four quarters.The company is positioned to benefit from President Trump's budget proposal, which would boost defense spending by 9.5% in fiscal 2018. And the company was one of several defense contractors — the others were Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) — that signed memorandums of understanding with Saudi Arabia as part of last month's U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal.A merger between Janus Capital Group and U.K.-based Henderson Group closed May 30, creating Janus Henderson Group (JHG). Shareholders in what had been Janus funds should watch to see if the combined entity creates economies of scale that it can pass along in the form of lower mutual fund fees.Shareholders should also keep their eyes peeled for any manager departures from their funds. In some cases at other companies, veteran managers with ownership stakes cash out or leave. Some don't want to deal with culture clashes or fallout from corporate integration. Others are pushed out due to performance or cost cutting.The Janus-Henderson merger makes sense from a distribution viewpoint, since each asset manager has larger footprints in different geographic areas, according to Morningstar Inc.Both firms pared their fund lineups in the run-up to the merger. Janus merged two of its funds into other funds it ran (including Janus Twenty into Janus Henderson Forty) and one into a Henderson portfolio. It also closed one fund. Henderson made comparable moves. In addition, Janus Henderson is in the process of merging what had been two other Janus funds.RELATED:Janus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated RisksHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

His early exit from Canadian Pacific immediately raised speculation that he would take a leadership position at CSX. CSX has been the least efficient rail operator by some metrics.Michael Ward is stepping down as CEO and chairman, CSX said in a statement.

96,CSX,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO).

Canadian Pacific climbed 3.5%.Creel will become Canadian Pacific's president and CEO effective Jan. 31, following Harrison's decision to retire.The company said Wednesday that ""Harrison had approached the board to discuss his retirement from CP and potential related modifications to his employment arrangements that would allow him to pursue opportunities involving other Class 1 Railroads.""In return for the limited non-compete waiver, Harrison agreed to end all roles with Canadian Pacific, forfeit benefits and stock awards totaling 118 million Canadian dollars, and no longer carry out a previously agreed-upon consulting role.Last summer, the company said Creel would take over July 1, 2017. He had already had stints serving as interim CEO during periods when Harrison had health issues.In April, the company abandoned its effort to buy Norfolk Southern for $30 billion amid broad opposition from industry and lawmakers. At the time, Harrison doubted that Canadian Pacific would pursue other rail rivals.The accelerated CEO handoff comes days before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, is sworn in.

Revenue is expected to be essentially flat at $9.034 billion.Results: EPS of $1.78 on revenue of $9.05 billion. Unit revenue down 1.6%, worse than the midpoint of its projection for a 1.25%-1.75% drop.Outlook: Q1 unit revenue down 1% to up 1%. Q1 capacity to grow 1%-2%. Adjusted pre-tax margin 0.5%-2.5%.

As with prior quarters, investors will be zeroing in on whether United can improve Q1 unit revenue, a key metric that has fallen for the past two years as airlines competed for market share.

110,CSX,"Delta Air Lines' (DAL) passenger unit revenue for January fell 2.5%, the carrier said Thursday, while a slight uptick in carrying capacity outpaced an even slighter uptick in passenger traffic.Delta said the slide in unit revenue, or revenue in relation to an airline's supply of seats and the scope of its flight coverage, was in line with its prior expectations, attributing it to calendar shifts and comparisons from a year ago, when Winter Storm Jonas kept planes on the ground.Last month, Delta said that February and March would likely produce better unit revenue than in January and predicted overall Q1 unit revenue would be would be flat to up 2%, up from Q4's 2.7% decline.Passenger traffic for January rose 0.4%. Capacity rose 0.6%. Load factor dipped to 81.2% from 81.3%.Shares of Delta edged up 0.25% to 47.38 on the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) dipped 0.1%, and United Airlines (UAL) added 0.9%. Southwest (LUV) ticked 0.25% higher, while JetBlue (JBLU) fell 1 cent.IBD'S TAKE: Even as airline shares reeled this week on concerns about the travel ban and more capacity, Cowen analysts said the sector's stocks were likely to take a breather regardless.At the end of last year, airlines were enjoying some much more positive investor sentiment after easing two-year-long concerns that they were adding too many flights and cutting fares as cheap oil made it less expensive, and more tempting, to grab market share.Investors were also hopeful that President Trump would offer a lighter hand on regulations and be more aggressive about infrastructure improvement — both of which would benefit airlines.However, last Friday, fresh concerns surfaced that airlines' capacity could creep up again. Then, concerns that Trump's travel ban could hurt demand roiled airline stocks on Monday and Tuesday.RELATED:United Q4 Beats, But Q1 Costs To Surge; CSX Q4 Mixed

112,CSX,"Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) fell Monday, in what appeared to be the latest fallout from President Trump's executive order temporarily closing off the nation to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim nations.Even as protesters flooded airports across the country over the weekend, some analysts began questioning the ways the ban could inconvenience the many international travelers who regularly fly to the U.S., potentially discouraging travel.""President Trump's Executive Order on Jan. 27 may hurt travel demand by making the visa application process more cumbersome, although the magnitude of the actual impact is unclear,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note.The order places an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a roughly four-month ban on all refugees. It also bars for around three months anyone from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's immigration orders triggered airline turbulence. Here's why Trump's moves may derail the stock market rally, and his tax and infrastructure plans.The move also, Syth noted, suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows some travelers from outside the U.S. to renew a visa without holding an in-person interview with a U.S. Consular officer.""Not only does this make it more cumbersome to obtain a U.S. visa, it sets up the possibility of retaliatory actions on U.S. travelers from these countries,"" Syth said. ""However, it is unclear how many current applicants are able to take advantage of the interview waiver and how many may be discouraged from traveling to the U.S. as a result.""Delta shares fell 4.1% in the stock market today, while American lost 4.4% and United 3.6%. All three global carriers tumbled below their 50-day moving averages.Southwest (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU), which have fewer international flights, fell 0.7% and 1.5%, respectively.Trump on Saturday defended the executive order, saying it was ""not a Muslim ban"" and was ""working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.""But protests, and confusion over the order itself, escalated through Sunday. Trump defended the order again on Monday over Twitter, saying over two tweets:Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning.

Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017Delta was not immediately available for comment.The carrier said flights were canceled after its ""essential IT systems"" went down at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday. Those systems were ""restored a few hours later"" and all systems resumed normal operations shortly after midnight on Monday, Delta said.Later Monday morning, the carrier said the outage caused takeoff delays and about 170 flight cancellations on Sunday and roughly 110 on Monday, with more possible.Syth said Delta was the least exposed to any fallout from the interview waiver program's suspension. American was the most exposed, she said, followed by United.The stock slide comes after airline shares fell Friday as American Air hinted that it could start expanding capacity again after appearing show to more restraint in recent months.Investors spent much of 2015 and last year hoping airlines would try to align their overall carrying capacity with passenger demand. Delta, American and United also face more competition from low-cost, long-haul carriers flying over the Atlantic.RELATED:Delta Air Lines Sees Market Share Pressure Over AtlanticUnited Q4 Beats, But Q1 Costs To Surge; CSX Q4 Mixed

Here are 14 stocks, including Morgan Stanley, set to report 50% earnings growth or more for the latest quarter.The British pound rallied as of early Tuesday morning to above $1.21 after falling below $1.20 intraday Monday amid early reports of May's intentions. The FTSE 100 dipped 0.15% on Monday, ending a 14-day win streak, including 10 straight sessions hitting record highs.

115,CSX,"Loading the player... Here's your weekly Investing Action Plan: what you need to know as an investor for the coming week.

116,CSX,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

But more recently, questions have surfaced about the sustainability of the so-called Trump rally. Here's the case for a Trump bull market.The railroad sector has been hurt by the commodity oversupply over the past two years; lower demand for those products has meant lower demand for the companies that ship them.CSX's volumes were down 3% so far during the current quarter, with many markets showing ""more moderate declines than in previous quarters,"" the company said.Coal, an industry that has been decimated in part by cheaper alternatives like natural gas, was showing ""sequential volume stabilization and is essentially flat in the fourth quarter to date.""RELATED:Steel Stocks Soar As Trump Seen Fueling 20% Annual Demand GrowthShipping Stocks Ride Tidal Wave On Trump's Infrastructure Plans

(CSX).Munoz was appointed CEO in September, but suffered a heart attack in October and took a five-month leave of absence.""We are eager to see the new board turn its attention to creating stockholder value, improving labor relations and enhancing customer satisfaction,"" said Paul Reeder, CEO of PAR Capital, in a press release.Late Wednesday, United said Q1 EPS fell 19% to $1.23, beating views by 5 cents. Revenue fell 4.8% to $8.2 billion, in line with views. Revenue per available seat mile fell by 7.4% and United said it would slow growth plans as supply outpaces demand.United shares were down 2.7% in late trading after closing up 1% in the stock market today.Southwest Airlines, Alaska Air and Hawaiian all closed down fractionally Wednesday.Image provided by Shutterstock.

140,CSX,"Peabody Energy (BTU), the largest U.S. coal company, on Wednesday became the latest coal company to file for bankruptcy protection as cheaper, cleaner natural gas continues to crush coal sales.Peabody said in mid-March that it might file for bankruptcy in the U.S. within a month. Under the voluntary Chapter 11 filing, Peabody will continue global operations. The company said that its Australian business units are not included in the filing.""Through today's action, we will seek an in-court solution to Peabody's substantial debt burden amid a historically challenged industry backdrop,"" Peabody President and CEO Glenn Kellow said in a written statement.Peabody shares never traded on the stock market today, though they had crashed some 70% from Tuesday's 2.07 close in pre-market trade. Its stock traded as high as 179.31 in mid-November 2014 before it began a long slide, losing 99% of its value.Peabody joins a growing list of coal companies going bankrupt. Peabody spinoff Patriot Coal in May 2015 filed for protection for the second time in three years and in December won approval from bankruptcy court to sell its mines to Blackhawk Mining and the nonprofit Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund.Others include Alpha Natural Resources, which went bankrupt in mid-2015 and sold most of its assets, Walter Energy and Arch Coal -- the country's second largest coal miner. All three sought protection and were delisted from major exchanges, trading today on pink sheets only.U.S. rail giant CSX (CSX) late Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected Q1 revenue, with falling coal shipments a key problem. But CSX shares rose 4.2% Wednesday.The hydraulic fracturing revolution that began in the U.S. and is spreading globally has smashed the price of oil and natural gas. Cheap natgas is more competitive vs. coal in North America, and its greenhouse gas emissions are far lower. That's made it easier politically and economically for the Obama administration and state regulators to crack down on coal-fired power plants.The world's No. 1 coal company by annual revenue is Yanzhou Coal Mining (YZC) in China, a country that relies more than the U.S. on the older, dirtier energy source.Yanzhou Coal Mining rose 2.4%. Among other large U.S. coal companies, Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP) climbed 0.9% and SunCoke Energy (SXC) 4.1%. SunCoke is one of the top-rated companies in the Energy-Coal industry group; its 54 IBD Composite Rating means that it's outperformed 54% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.

Goldman Sachs (GS) also helped lead the advance, rising 3%.The Dow transports outperformed as well, rising 2.6%. Top movers in the broader railroad group included Genesee & Wyoming (GWR), CSX Corp.

Shares of Genesee & Wyoming vaulted 7% after the company reported strong March and Q1 traffic data.The stock market also embraced surprisingly strong trade data from China overnight. Chinese exports rose 11.5% in March from a year earlier, the first increase since June and well above forecasts for 2.5% growth.Among the day's other movers, Ebix (EBIX) jumped 8%. After a breakout during the week ended March 4, the stock looks poised to clear resistance around 42.Drugmaker Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) gave back early gains but still rose 4% on comments from Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore following a ruling by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The move lifted shares back above their 200-day moving average and further up the right side of an eight-month consolidation.Elsewhere, small cap Gigamon (GIMO) rallied 4% as its tested support at its 10-week moving average. It recently cleared a 29.62 buy point.Inside the IBD 50, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) was off highs but still rose 2%.

143,CSX,"The stock market rallied nicely at the open Wednesday as overseas factors, earnings reports and economic data all influenced early trade.The Nasdaq led the way, rising 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.7% each.The stock market today benefited from a positive mood started in Asia. China's March exports surged 12% from a a year ago, the first rise in eight months, according to the General Administration of Customs. Imports declined less than 8%, vs. a 14% drop in February. The export improvement was partially due to a sharp drop in exports in March 2015. Strong exports were also helped by a weaker yuan.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index responded with a 3.2% gain. The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.4%. In Japan, the yen continued lower against the dollar, helping send the Nikkei 225 ahead 2.8%.The positive tone carried over into Europe, where markets pushed strong gains in afternoon trade. The CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX traded up more than 2% each. London's FTSE 100 showed a 1.4% gain.The overseas momentum helped compensate for the drag caused by oil and gold, both of which traded briskly lower. West Texas Intermediate traded down 1%, but held firmly above $41 a barrel. Gold futures were off nearly 1% to $1,250 an ounce.In U.S. economic news, inflation received a tame report card, as producer prices eased 0.1% in March, the Labor Department estimated, well below the 0.3% increase expected by consensus forecasts. Declines in cost of services apparently offset rebounding energy prices. Core prices, minus energy and food, also dipped 0.1%, vs. forecasts for a 0.2% increase.Retail sales also dropped in March, down 0.3%, Commerce Department data showed. Consensus expectations called for a 0.1% increase. Minus automobiles, sales rose 0.2% -- below the consensus estimate for a 0.4% gain.The Census Bureau offers up February business inventories data at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report at 10:30. The Federal Reserve's beige book report is due out at 2 p.m.JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) paced the Dow in the early going, rising 3% each.JPMorgan outperformed after its Q1 report showed earnings and revenue falling less than anticipated. JPMorgan's Q1 results showed consumer and community banking growing net income 12% on a 4% rise in revenue. Investment banking revenue dropped 24%.Other banks tapped into the momentum. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) -- all scheduled to report results on Thursday -- rose 2% apiece. Overseas banks were also in serious motion: Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) leapt 6%, London-based HSBC Holdings (HSBC) swung up 5%. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyd's Banking Group (LYG) and UBS Group (UBS) all climbed 3%.Among other companies reporting quarterly results, Adtran (ADTN) jumped 4% after a positive report late Tuesday. Railroad CSX (CSX) rose 1%, as revenue missed and earnings just met analyst consensus estimates, but management reported firmer pricing and rising volumes in automotive and other segments.Beyond earnings, biotech drug maker Medivation (MDVN) sparked up 8% after Bloomberg reported the company had snubbed a buyout offer from French drug giant Sanofi (SNY). Shares of Sanofi added 0.6%.China's Baidu (BIDU) and JD.Com (JD) led the Nasdaq 100, up 3% and 4% respecitively. S&P 500 name Harley Davidson (HOG) rebounded 3.5%. The stock tanked 14% last week on a string of critical analyst notes.Early IBD 50 leaders included Facebook (FB). Shares added more than 1%. The social networking heavy found quiet support at its 50-day line on Tuesday, ending 6% below a 117.09 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX) added 2% after Tuesday's gap down in heavy trade. The stock managed to find support at the converged 50- and 200-day moving averages. That is a positive, but shares have been unable to rise clear of those lines of support as they've climbed the right side of a shallow six-month consolidation.

144,CSX,"Materials helped to lead the S&P 500 sector ETFs higher Monday as Alcoa (AA) officially kicked off earnings season after the close.Alcoa stock slipped 3.5% after hours, following a mixed quarterly report. First-quarter earnings beat estimates, while revenues missed.The major U.S. indexes gave up modest early gains, finishing at session lows. However,the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average remain poised above their 200-day moving averages and are trading near 2016 highs.Besides Alcoa, 14 other S&P 500 companies are expected to report results this week, including JPMorgan (JPM), BlackRock (BLK) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Alcoa advanced 3.95% in regular trade on the stock market today.

"
148,CSX,"And the mkts have come roaring back…even the trains, planes and automobiles are joining in on the fun as the Dow Transports (Trannies) are now back in 'official' Bull mkt mode having rallied 22% off of the January lows…..Now Dow Theory tells us that the mkt is in an uptrend when ONE of its averages (the industrials or the trannies) advances above a previous important high….it should then be followed by the other Dow index…Now while the Trannies have not pierced their November highs of 8286 - they have rocketed higher over the past 8 weeks – (as noted up 22%), they have pierced the down trending 200 dma at 7856 and look like they are 'breaking out'..... and appear to be on their way to challenge the November high -Now this is important really – because the Trannies represent the transportation sector of the US economy and its companies are tied to the shipping, rail, and trucking sectors – sectors that 'move stuff around' and send signals about the health of the economy…..now recall – this index got 'clocked' in the early part of the year……after concerns about global growth and a coming US recession caused investors to shift out of this important 'barometer group' - Because slowing global growth and a US recession would negatively impact these companies. And there were some real serious concerns – as investors took some 22% out of the index since late November - but remember simple math works in strange ways....if the index (or a stock or any asset) goes down in value by 22% and then rallies back by 22% - you are still short - you have NOT gone back to 0 - in fact the index needs to rally back 30% just to stay even. So it still has work to do.......The latest move now tells us that investors have changed their minds…..Global Growth Concerns? US Recession? – Bah Humbug……Apparently investors are convinced that the worst is over and they have gone out on a buying spree – scooping up some names for a fraction of their current value. Now the Trannies are trading at about 13 times trailing earnings – or a 32% discount to their 3 yr avg of 19.2 times. So there IS value there IF the supposed improving global macro data is true. A look at some of the participants reveals where investors are placing their bets....UPS (UPS) & FedEx (FDX) - have rocketed higher, piercing their 200 dma's....while , Kansas City Southern (KSU), CSX Corp. (CSX), Kirby Corp. (KEX) are all teasing these key trend lines....Now overnight - global mkts began the week a bit mixed.....There is not a lot of macro data due out this week - so we can expect the mkts to churn and digest the latest moves in this holiday shortened week.......Japan was closed for a holiday and China surged by 2% as investors there focused on loosening margin lending requirements.....Australia came under a bit of pressure as losses in commodities weighed on that mkt.In Europe - those mkts are flat to slightly higher after a weaker opening....There was no material news out to drive the mkts either way - so they churn. FTSE -0.09%, CAC 40 -0.2%, DAX +0.4% , EUROSTOXX +0.12%, SPAIN +0.19% and ITALY +0.83%.Oil once again under pressure as the dollar stabilizes and moves a bit higher....remember - much of the oil action has been dollar driven and more unprecedented global monetary easing has created a currency war but has helped to wipe out the losses suffered since January. Now while it makes everyone feel good - the weak dynamics of the global economy still exist....and with earnings season only 2 weeks away - it will be about the fundamentals once again.....And while the central banks have all created the fire - the latest move is sure to come under some pressure if the fundamentals disappoint..... If the fundamentals do not disappoint - then the conversation returns to FED policy and interest rates. I continue to believe that June will see a small hike of 25 bps - but then nothing more.US futures are flat, the dollar is flat and oil is now down 1% as the day begins.....We only have one data point and this is Existing Home Sales - expectations are for a drop of 2.9% m/m. Atlanta FED's Dennis Lockhart is due to speak today at 12:30 pm - I would not expect him to say anything so significant - as he tends to be Dove and is on the side of the latest FED move. - So if anything - look for him to remain cautious on the outlook.....Now the S&P at 2048 is well above the 200 dma which stands at 2017. In this holiday shortened week - with little eco data to digest - it would not be surprising to see the S&P test what is now support for the mkts. After the most recent rally - the mkt is a bit ahead of itself and some back testing is in order.Take Good Care

150,CSX,"Determined to establish a transcontinental railroad, Canadian Pacific (CP) has reportedly again gone shopping for a bigger fish -- in the form of a $20 billion deal with CSX (CSX) -- and again had its offer rebuffed.News of the proposed merger comes on the heels of Canadian Pacific's third offer for Norfolk Southern (NSC), which it approached in December with a $28 billion cash-and-stock deal. Norfolk rejected it, citing regulatory concerns about the merger, which would create North America's third-largest railroad behind Union Pacific (UNP) and BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).Reports said Canadian Pacific had previously approached CSX with a deal.Canadian Pacific mainly serves the West Coast, while CSX and Norfolk Southern focus on the East Coast. Norfolk Southern has been supported by other railroads in its effort to resist Canadian Pacific's overtures.In a prepared statement Wednesday, Canadian Pacific said it's considering taking legal action ""in response to recent actions by a number of major U.S. railroads who have stated publicly they are working collectively to block CP's efforts to pursue a pro-customer, competition-enhancing combination with Norfolk Southern Corp."" The statement didn't say what specific measures are being considered.Canadian Pacific Chief Executive Hunter Harrison told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that both offers are on the table, and that the railroad wants to keep its options open.With annual revenue of $6.7 billion, Canadian Pacific would be merging with a larger railroad in either case. CSX reported sales of roughly $11.8 billion in 2015, while Norfolk Southern had $10.5 billion revenue.Railroads have been battered in recent years by lower shipments of coal, as oil and natural gas prices have plunged, and by weak commodity prices globally. The Transportation-Rail group ranks a poor 133 on IBD's list of 197 industries.CSX Chief Financial Officer Frank Lonegro said at a Barclays conference on Feb. 17 that he expects coal shipments to fall another 20% this year and lowered CSX's earnings forecast.“Based on the trends so far this year, we expect volume to decline in the mid-high single digits this quarter and to gradually moderate as we move through the year,” Lonegro said. “We expect first-quarter earnings to decline significantly.""CSX shares fell 0.4% to 24.55 on the stock market today after rising to 25.20 intraday. Its stock rose to a 37.46 close on May 1, 2015, just shy of its all-time high and has fallen about 33% since then. Its quarterly revenue growth has shrunk at an increasing rate in the last three quarters, falling 6%, 9% and 13%, respectively. It is projected to decline 11.3% this quarter.Canadian Pacific has followed a similar pattern, with revenue growth shrinking for the last four quarters. Its stock fell 2.45%. Norfolk Southern was up 1.45%, rising above its 50-day line.Among other large railroads, Union Pacific fell 0.8%, and Kansas City Southern was up 1.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

151,CSX,"Stocks started off Wednesday's session with modest losses despite stronger-than-expected private-sector hiring in February.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.1% and the Nasdaq lost less than 0.1%.The stock market's young uptrend was booted up to a new level of optimism in a strong session Tuesday. Strong volume showed institutional investors stepping in to lift banks, biotechs, technology and software industries to the day's best gains. Defensive industries, including gold miners and utilities, lost ground.A light day on the economic calendar opens with ADP's National Employment Report, which showed private sector employers adding 214,000 jobs in February. That was up from 193,000 new hires in January and well above consensus projections for a decrease to 185,000.San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams is scheduled to speak at 10 a.m. ET.  The Fed's March Beige Book is due for release at 2 p.m.Oil prices slipped, despite news reports from Moscow declaring a widening group of oil exporting countries agreed to limit production.

The Energy Information Administration reports its weekly crude oil inventories at 10:30 a.m.Dow stocks were mixed, with both gains and losses holding to less than 0.5%.On the S&P 500, railroad CSX (CSX) added just over 1%. News reports said Canadian Pacific (CP) continues to press what has been reported as a $20 billion-plus takeover offer in which CSX also reportedly continues to have no interest.IBD 50 and Leaderboard-listed stock Ross Stores (ROST) gained 2.5%.

Volume will be key to watch in Wednesday's session.  The stock hit a technically valid buy point at 1291.10 on Tuesday, but trade was weak. The move requires volume support to validate the breakout, but the volume often comes in over two or three sessions after the initial move.Several non-U.S. banks rose in the early going.

152,CSX,"The rise of anti-establishment political forces in the U.S., where Donald Trump leads the GOP field, and in Europe represents an ""uncertainty premium"" that markets have yet to price in, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on Thursday.Trump echoed his anti-free-trade rhetoric, which could hurt prospects for top U.S. exporters like aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE).""If I'm losing $505 billion with China, if I'm losing $58 billion a year with Mexico in terms of deficits, what do I want that kind of trade for anyway?"" Trump said Thursday while responding to criticism from Mitt Romney. ""Who needs that kind of trade?""Markets haven't paid attention to the Republican or Democratic races, which has seen Bernie Sanders also ride an anti-establishment surge, but that will change by the summer, El-Erian said on CNBC.When asked if markets should account for a ""Trump premium,"" he said that has been difficult to assess because while the real estate mogul is a front-runner, he lacks the backing from the party establishment.""It will make a difference as to who emerges,"" El-Erian said. ""It will make a difference as to what the plans are and how comprehensive they are.""El-Erian didn't mention specific stocks, but Trump's stance on trade comes amid a backlash against other trade-promotion efforts.Boeing and General Electric have already fought against conservative Republicans in Congress opposed to the Export-Import Bank's charter, which expired last year but was later renewed.Trump has also been vocal in saying that trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have made the U.S. weak and that he would abolish them. U.S. railroads such as CSX (CSX), which operates mainly in the U.S. and Canada, and Kansas City Southern (KSU), which runs in the U.S. and Mexico, could be affected.Meanwhile, Sanders has said that free trade has been ""a disaster for the American people."" And Hillary Clinton previously sounded favorable notes on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal but now opposes it.Boeing closed essentially flat while GE edged up 0.1%t. CSX, which is trying to fend off an offer to merge from Canadian Pacific (CP), rose 1.4%.Kansas City Southern gained 1%. It rose above its 50-day average earlier this month and was trading just below its 10-week line. Canadian Pacific added 1.7%.

153,CSX,"CSX (CSX) again warned that the railroad slump isn't going away soon, marking the latest sign of economic trouble ahead. CSX Chief Financial Officer Frank Lonegro said at a Barclays conference in Miami that falling coal shipments, the impact of the strong dollar and low global commodity prices that hurt railroads in 2015 are expected to continue to be challenges…
"
154,CSX,"If you're brand new to stock investing, sometimes you might wonder, in private or aloud: ""As for research, where should I start?""It's not an easy question. After all, there's the market itself, which is essentially an ocean of stocks. Plus, all of those 8,000-plus stocks get diced and sliced into 197 separate industry groups in IBD. (See the entire list of industries in Monday's ""Making Money"" section.)As you do more research and make a few trades, you eventually come to realize that mastering multiple fields is vital to making money in stocks. Those fields include the market trend; economic trends; psychological trends; your own self-psychology; portfolio management; and summoning the self-discipline to follow sound rules, both in buying and selling.Here's another field to master: how to get a strong feel for corporate earnings trends.Serious financial publications focus on earnings. Why?More than any other single factor, earnings -- or profits after taxes -- drive investor decisions in equity markets across the world. In IBD's CAN SLIM investment approach, both the ""C"" and ""A"" in the acronym point to a company's earnings results. When a company's earnings per share thrive, its stock also thrives. When earnings dive, or there is a perception on Wall Street that they will fall, so does the stock.How can you use IBD's features and Investors.com to be in the know about earnings? Take these three tips.1) Read the corporate stories on pages A1 and A2 in the newspaper or on the home page of Investors.com. The majority of corporations follow the typical calendar year ending in December in reporting financial results. So, expect a wave of earnings stories two to fours weeks after March 31 (the end of the first quarter), June 30 (end of Q2), Sept. 30 (Q3) and Dec. 31 (Q4).Let's take a peek at IBD's Jan. 22 edition. On Page A1, reporter James DeTar noted that railroad giants Union Pacific (UNP), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and CSX (CSX) reported ""downbeat quarter earnings"" and that analysts say ""the rail sector is clearly in recession.""How to interpret the news? First, railroad stocks have likely sold off due to profit disappointments. Secondly, these stocks may provide a valuable future opportunity in the stock market when their earnings turn higher.On the same Page A1, fellow reporter Gillian Rich covered the airlines, also in the transportation sector. While railroads have suffered from the plunge in crude oil prices and withering demand for shipping ""black gold,"" airlines have gotten a mighty EPS boost thanks to lower fuel costs. Rich's article notes that, despite the cut in fuel costs, airlines in January ""were able to raise fares by $3 for a one-way domestic ticket.""2) Check out the Company Earnings Reports tables, featured practically each day in the paper. The list bulges during the meat of earnings season. To save time in your research, note the boldfaced figures of those companies where EPS grew at least 25% on a year-over-year basis. If a company also shows an EPS Rating of 85 or higher, and it exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimate, the entire line of data for that company is boldfaced.In the Jan. 22 IBD, telecom giant Verizon (VZ) (scoring a 92 EPS Rating and beating Wall Street views by 1%), Alaska Air Group (ALK) (98 EPS, 4.3% beat) and thinly traded Insteel Industries (IIIN) (98 EPS, 3% beat) all got the boldface treatment.3) Concentrate on the content regarding earnings and earnings estimates for IBD's stories in The New America and Internet & Technology sections, as well as the various minicharts found in market features such as the IBD 50, Big Cap 20, IPO Leaders and The Income Investor.

155,CSX,"With Union Pacific, Canadian Pacific Railway and CSX reporting downbeat quarterly earnings recently, company executives and analysts say the rail sector is clearly in recession — and the industry may signal contraction in the broader economy as well. On Thursday, top U.S. railroad operator Union Pacific (UNP) said freight revenue for coal plunged 31% in Q4, and industrial products slid…
"
156,CSX,"Union Pacific (UNP) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue as the energy slump continues and economic conditions remain unstable.Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad operator, reported that operating income dropped 8% to $8.1 billion. That translates to an 18.6% drop in earnings per share to $1.31 early Thursday, missing Wall Street's target by 9 cents. It was the first miss in three quarters.Revenue fell 15.4% to $5.21 billion. Analysts projected $5.45 billion. Overall volume was 9% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The company blamed energy market woes as well as broader economic conditions. Oil prices have tumbled more than 70% since mid-2014.For freight shipments, revenue for coal plunged 31%, while industrial products slid 23%. Tellingly, intermodal — containers used by trains, trucks and ships that carry consumer goods such as electronics — slid 14%, indicating weakness beyond the energy sector.Auto revenue was the only category that rose. It was up 1%.Union Pacific sees first-quarter volume down in the mid-single digits.""Overall economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year,"" CEO Lance Fritz said in a statement.Union Pacific stock fell 3.55% to 71 on Thursday. That's well off its intraday high at 98.26 on Oct. 23. Union Pacific has a weak 45 IBD Composite Rating, meaning 55% of all stocks have performed better on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Canadian Pacific Railway, which is making a hostile bid for Norfolk Southern (NSC) in November, also reported weaker-than-expected Q4 earnings and revenue amid declining volume on weaker oil and coal shipments.Canadian Pacific shares rallied to close up 0.5% at 104.87 after tumbling to 97.09 intraday.Norfolk Southern, which is fighting Canadian Pacific's overtures, fell 1.6%. Kansas City Southern (KSU), slated to announce financial results Friday, rose 0.3%.CSX (CSX), which reported mixed results last week, rose 0.3% after losing 2% on Wednesday.
"
157,CSX,"CSX's (CSX) fourth-quarter earnings dipped, and revenue fell more than expected, as the rail giant warned of more weakness ahead. The Jacksonville, Fla.-based company earned 48 cents per share, down a penny from a year ago but 2 cents better than Wall Street's target.Revenue fell 13% to $2.78 billion ""as pricing gains were more than offset by the impact of lower fuel recovery,"" the company said in a statement. Analysts' consensus was for $2.85 billion.Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Ward warned, ""With negative global and industrial market trends projected for 2016, full-year earnings per share are expected to be down compared to 2015.""CSX shares fell 2.5% in late trading Tuesday after closing up 0.8%. Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Union Pacific (UNP) were both unchanged after hours.The CSX report comes as analyst reports point to increasing weakness in the rail sector, even suggesting that this could be a barometer for a possible economic downturn.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Hoexter said in a report Tuesday that the decline in rail car shipments lately has been the steepest since 2009, noting ""We believe rail data may be signaling a warning for the broader economy.""CSX earnings also come amid potential consolidation wave in the railroad industry.Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), backed by activist investor Bill Ackman, continues to pursue its hostile offer for Norfolk Southern. Canadian Pacific made a third offer last month, of $45 billion, but was again rejected.Connect with James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

167,CSX,"Shares of Norfolk Southern (NSC) rose Friday on a report that BNSF Railway Chairman Matt Rose said his company may enter the bidding for the struggling railroad. BNSF, which is controlled by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), might step in to provide a competitive bid to Canadian Pacific Railway's (CP) $28 billion hostile offer for Norfolk Southern, Rose told Bloomberg…
"
168,CSX,"Norfolk Southern (NSC) rejected an unsolicited $28 billion offer from smaller peer Canadian Pacific (CP), calling it ""grossly inadequate.""Norfolk Southern's board unanimously rejected the overture, saying that it would also face substantial regulatory risks and uncertainties.Canadian Pacific said late Friday that it was ""disappointed"" by the rejection but said he was ""committed"" to the Norfolk Southern offer.""CP takes exception to the claims, misdirection and mischaracterization of its offer and the benefits such a combination would provide to customers, shareholders, the industry and the public,"" the rail operator said in a statement.Canadian Pacific said it will hold a press conference on Tuesday to discuss the offer, including concerns about regulator approval.CP CEO Hunter Harrison has tried to address such concerns. On Wednesday, he said that he didn't expect opposition from Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) owns BNSF Railway, because BNSF operates in the West, while Norfolk is in the East.""I just can't image Mr. Buffett going to Washington and saying, 'Help me with these Canadians coming down in here and doing all these ugly things to us,'"" Bloomberg reported Harrison saying at a Credit Suisse conference.Norfolk Southern shares closed down 1.1% in Friday stock market trading after tumbling as low as 86.59 intraday. Share edged higher in late Friday trading on the CP response. The stock has been working on the right side of an eight-month-long cup base.Canadian Pacific slid 4.6%.

Wall Street consensus was for 4% EPS growth in 2015.Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Friday cut its rating on CSX to neutral from buy and lowered its price target to 29 from 33, citing CSX's exposure to the coal market, though it also noted that CSX is working to improve operations and offset weakness in the coal business.BofA also lowered its ratings on Union Pacific (UNP), Kansas City Southern (KSU) and Genesee & Wyoming (GWR).CSX shares fell 0.9% Friday.

169,CSX,"Rail operator Canadian Pacific (CP) on Wednesday made public the details of its bid for Norfolk Southern (NSC) — a 50/50 cash and stock deal Canadian said would create a safer, more efficient transcontinental railway — after Norfolk said late Tuesday it received the offer but reacted frostily to its terms.
"
170,CSX,"Canadian Pacific, whose interest in buying Norfolk was reported last week, said Norfolk Southern shareholders would get $46.72 in cash and 0.348 share of the new company for every share of Norfolk Southern, making the offer worth around $28 billion. The deal was worth 97.72 a share near midday Wednesday. The new company would run both rail operators.
"
171,CSX,"Canadian, which is Canada's No. 2 rail operator, said that by the time of the deal's closing, expected on Dec. 31, 2017, the new company would be worth $270.68 per share. Shareholders of Norfolk Southern, the eastern U.S.' No. 2 railway, would own 41% of the new company.

Now yes - revenue fell 7% - but some of that is by design as they shed businesses. Analysts were quick to put the positive spin on it....Steven Chubak at Nomura had this to say -
"
212,CSX,"""It's reassuring to see JP Morgan make progress in getting smaller and simpler,"" emphasizing the fact that 'shrinking' could help increase their dividend and/or share buyback program by billions of dollars
"
213,CSX,"On first blush the reported number was $1.32/sh vs. exp of $1.37....But if you add back in the tax benefit (some $2.2 bil) of shrinking their business then the reported number goes to $1.68 share. Revenues in the fixed income part of the business took a hit, but revenues from equity trading were up - given all the volatility of late. Return on equity ROSE to 12% vs. the 10% last year (this is a big positive).
"
214,CSX,"""Client activity remained subdued across the credit markets particularly due to the uncertainty around interest rates,"" wrote Daniel Pinto, head of J.P. Morgan's corporate and investment bank, ""But volatility in the equity markets led to more client activity and another strong quarter for equities.""
"
215,CSX,"And then CFO Marianne Lake chimes in that 'So far in October, markets are reasonably quiet suggesting that some analysts 4th q estimates may be too optimistic' And that was the line that sent the stock just a bit lower in post mkt trading...this morning the stock is trading at $60.75 down 0.80 cts from last night's close. All in all - this report was not bad and not unexpected....Based on the chart - I would expect to see JPM stabilize right here at the $60.50 level - but I suppose we will have to see how the others report.....
"
216,CSX,"So far this morning BLK reported $5.02/sh vs. est of $4.53, BAC just reported $0.37/sh vs $0.35/sh - it is more of an expense cut story vs. a revenue growth story....but that is a direct result of zero interest rate policy..... and the devil will be in the details....early pre-mkt trading is sending that stock up just a bit..... WFC due out at 8 am.
"
217,CSX,"DAL just reported $1.74 and they BEAT the est of $1.71...stock trading up .80 cts or 1.6%
"
218,CSX,"INTC (reported last night) they beat on both earnings and revenues....$0.65 vs. $0.59 and $14.5 bil vs $14.2 bil....but they did talk down forward guidance a bit causing that stock to fall in premkt trading....currently trading down 0.60 cents at $31.40 as it tries to hold onto support at the 200 dma.
"
219,CSX,"Now US futures had been down all morning in pre-mkt trading - but have now taken it all back and are about to turn up as these reports hit the tape. Eco data today includes RETAIL SALES and that will go right to the heart of the consumer. Exp are for +0.2%, ex autos and gas of +0.3%. PPI of -0.2% and ex food and energy of +0.1%......As long as these reports are what we expect then the mkts should not react negatively....if anything - it only supports 'looser for longer'...... I suspect that if we continue to get better earnings reports then the mkt will hold in....We may test support at 1990 and that's okay....in fact - we want to test to see if it holds.
"
220,CSX,"(Look I know it's early...but of all the companies to report so far.....70% of them have 'beaten the earnings expectation' while 50% of them have beaten on revenues. It's like a broken record.......)
"
221,CSX,"Yesterday stocks chopped around but managed to move a bit lower - as global mkts set the tone and investors/traders awaited the launch of earnings season. It is not uncommon to see the mkt rally as we go into earnings but then stumble when earnings are released, especially in a volatile, uncertain economic environment, hence will we get a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" trading environment? Will we realize that the S&P is a bit 'overvalued' given the possible deterioration in earnings that we could see?
"
222,CSX,"Look - China continues to be a pimple of the world's backside.....and last night - China did it again....reporting that 'factory - gate' prices slumped again (factory -gate prices?) .....CPI rose 'less than expected', and their PPI fell 5.9% - marking its 43rd month of decline....all this just adding to concerns that China is in trouble.......(not buying it....half the data we get from them is suspect to begin with and most of the data from years prior was inflated.)....and if it was really 'that bad' then equity mkts around the world would be acting very differently - I mean it's not like we haven't beaten this horse enough...........I'm just saying.....And if you think that China is a problem - then design your portfolio to eliminate or minimize that risk.
"
223,CSX,"Is the US on the verge of a recession? Well that assumes that we never got out of it to begin with.......we tend to have recessions every 7 years, or at least that has been the cycle since World War II. So, some will say that it is time....while others will say - WHAT? We never really got out of it - have the past 7 yrs been bountiful? Has economic activity been strong on its own or has it been manufactured by the central bank intent on keeping up the illusion of a strong US economy?
"
224,CSX,"We have competing commentary out of the FED, both Brainard and Tarullo reiterate their 'dovish stance' causing more inconsistency in 'the message'...all this while Fischer continues to tell the mkts that there is still a chance that rates 'rise' in 2015.......Can you say - 'dementia'?
"
225,CSX,"OK...so next up? GS, C, NFLX, CSX, The day is young, you can feel the energy building...... As Marvin Gaye tells us: ""Let's get it on.....""
"
226,CSX,"European mkts are a bit lower (nothing dramatic) on the back of the China data.....blah, blah, blah.......FTSE -0.60%, CAC 40 -0.40%, DAX 0.61%, EUROSTOXX -0.41%, SPAIN -0.54% AND ITALY -0.53%

"
228,CSX,"Stocks finished the week with small gains, and while volume was lighter and interest felt like it was waning - the mkt did end the week at the best closing levels in over a month.
"
229,CSX,"The strength that we saw last week is most likely attributable to traders/investors continued celebration of the latest release of the FOMC mins.....Those mins - released last week showed that Fed members remain concerned about global growth and the risk it poses to our economy...... (Never mind all the talk about how ready the US economy is for the normalization process to begin.) In the end - the bottom line is that there does not appear to be any rate hike on the calendar anytime soon. Over the weekend - Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, had this to say -
"
230,CSX,"""Admittedly, there are still two employment reports scheduled for release before the FOMC meets in December......But at this stage we think it would take a major turnaround in payroll growth, to well above 200,000 per month, to persuade officials to support a December rate hike.""
"
231,CSX,"And then on Sunday - While 'vacationing' at the IMF Policy meeting in Lima, Peru - Stanley Fischer had this to say to Reuters - who then ran with the following headline story.....
"
232,CSX,"""Fed's Fischer says 2015 US rate rise is 'an expectation, not a commitment"" (Oh BOY!)...
"
233,CSX,"In it he says that: ""US Federal Reserve policymakers are still likely to raise interest rates this year, BUT that is 'an expectation, not a commitment"" and could change if the global economy pushes the US economy further off course.....Both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent adjustments to the federal funds rate target will depend critical on future developments in the economy....""
"
234,CSX,"He went onto say that 'he felt the economy was still generating enough jobs to continue making progress towards the FED's goal of maximum employment and that inflation would eventually rise' - keeping the US central bank on track to raise rates this year.... and then he quickly protected himself by saying that ""the US is now more exposed than ever to international events and that developments in China and elsewhere had already influenced the FED to delay a widely expected rate increase in September"".
"
235,CSX,"And this morning's WSJ has many of the IMF officials urging the FED to 'get on with it'....FED FATIGUE is now taking hold....all of the talk back and forth does nothing but cause more instability and anxiety in global mkts.....and so they all got together and said -Stop the madness - suggesting that they would prefer some sense of certainty vs. the 'agony of waiting'.....
"
236,CSX,"""delaying the increase would not solve the situation....if it is a case that the emerging mkts have taken on too much debt, then there will a day of reckoning, Delaying an interest rate hike does not necessarily address that issue""
"
237,CSX,"Now fatigue with the FED is like the fatigue that we all felt during the 2009 Presidential race, when Hillary announced 20 months prior to the election.....trying to work the crowd only to find that the crowd tired of all the back and forth....and what happened? She lost credibility, people grew exhausted of the Hillary show and started to re-focus their energies etc....and the world moved on.....so - is the world now tiring of the FED playing both sides of the fence? Feels like it is....
"
238,CSX,"Now look - the rally seen over the last 9 sessions, has lifted the S&P (and all the major indexes) back above their 50 dma-, removing near term resistance. Does this mean that this rally will continue to take prices up? Sure, But not so fast.....There are daily calls for the 'coming recession'....analysts and strategists screaming about how the world is coming to an end (which could be just what we need to break out!) ......but could we be in the early stages of a bear market. - sure. Remember that part of the reality of bear markets is that they have strong 'short-covering' rallies the mkt tries to find fair value.....Take a look at the S&P......is a new and lower sideways channel building?
"
239,CSX,"Notice the 8 month sideways channel that the S&P traded in before this summer. (2040/2130).....Now notice the break in August - taking us well outside of the lower band....only to bounce back to test the down trending 50 dma in mid-September. Then in late September, the S&P fell back down to test the August lows only to once again move up and test the down trending 50 dma - but this time - it moved up and thru it - seemingly breaking out.... - Well the next resistance is at 2045 (100 dma) and then 2060 (200 dma) - but if you look at the action - you can clearly see what looks like a new sideways channel developing right below the old sideways channel. (1850/2000). Now if this is true, then just maybe the mkt is in a short term overbought condition.....which means that we could see another down leg at anytime....Is that down leg now during earnings season? We are about to find out....
"
240,CSX,"This week brings us a slew of macro data - Retail Sales - exp of 0.2%, ex autos and gas at 0.3%, PPI of -0.2%, ex food and energy of 0.1%.......In addition we get Empire state manufacturing of -8 and CPI of -0.2%,. ex food and energy of 0.1%. On the earnings front it is a BIG week.....JPM due out tomorrow after the bell, followed by BAC, WFC, C and GS later in the week. Throw in JNJ, INTC, BLK, CSX, and NFLX and it is sure to be an interesting week. Remember it is NOT so much about the actual earnings - they are history - it is about profit margins and future outlook. What role will China play in that outlook? Will China be the black swan?
"
241,CSX,"This morning US futures are flat - It is Columbus Day here in the states, banks and the bond mkts are closed.....do not expect much action today as the investors await data later in the week.
"
242,CSX,"That being said - look for more action in EMC.......This morning we did learn that all the chatter about DELL and EMC is true......Dell announces a plan to acquire EMC for $67 bil......The deal is worth about $33/sh ($24 in cash and $9 in VMWare) - which is 28% above Oct 7th closing price - when the rumors started......but clearly some people knew about this possibility at the end of September when the stock was trading at $23/share and started to break out for no reason..... Just sayin.......HELLO????

246,CSX,"CSX (CSX), Union Pacific (UNP) and other railroads say that financial momentum for U.S. railroads in the second half of the year has lost some steam.Falling prices and volumes for coal and gas, plus weakness in exports as China's economy contracts, have impacted shipments.Lower fuel costs for trains, plus the improving U.S. economic outlook, including strong housing and auto markets, have offset the impact somewhat.CSX Chief Sales and Marketing Officer Fredrik Eliasson, formerly the company's chief financial officer, said at Cowen's Global Transportation Conference in Boston that he expects the second half of the year to be challenging, given continuing headwinds in its coal market.As a result, CSX cut its full-year earnings growth outlook to the mid-single digits, down from its earlier projection of mid-to-high single-digit EPS growth for 2015, Eliasson said.""While we continue to target flat earnings per share for the third quarter, achieving that estimate will be more challenging given the weaker than expected volumes,"" Eliasson said.Overall, the volume of goods carried is down about 2% in the current quarter compared to the same period a year ago, with both coal and merchandise markets tracking slightly below the company's original third-quarter forecast.Late Tuesday, CSX CEO Michael Ward announced that Oscar Munoz had resigned as president. Clarence Gooden, previously chief sales and marketing officer, was promoted to replace him amid a management shakeup.Eliasson was named chief sales and marketing officer. Frank Lonegro, former vice president of service design, replaced Eliasson as CFO, and Cindy Sanborn was named chief operating officer of CSX Transportation, moving over from her prior position as executive vice president of operations.CSX closed down 0.7% in Wednesday trading on the stock market today.Union Pacific Chief Financial Officer Rob Knight said at the Cowen conference that crude oil shipments for the No. 1 railroad by revenue spiked a few years ago, peaking at 163,000 carloads in 2013 and falling to just 49,000 for the first half of 2015.Offsetting that somewhat are higher grain and auto shipments, which are up from the same time last year. As Knight noted, IHS Global Insights forecasts that U.S. light vehicle sales will rise to 17.1 million vehicles this year from 16.4 million in 2014.Knight added that Union Pacific is expanding in Mexico and expects a record 956,000 carloads there this year, up from 882,000 in 2014.Union Pacific fell 1%. Its stock hit an all-time intraday high at 124.5 on Feb. 13 and has fallen steadily since then. It's trading well below its 50-day and 200-day averages.Norfolk Southern (NSC) Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw acknowledged near-term headwinds associated with declining commodity prices but said that its international volume continues to grow amid rising shipments from both East Coast and West Coast ports. Norfolk Southern was up fractionally.Smaller railroad Genesee & Wyoming (GWR) said Wednesday that global volume by carload for August rose 41.6% to 253,807 carloads after it bought London-based Freightliner in March.But same-railroad traffic, minus new cars and acquisitions, in August was 155,743 carloads, a drop of 13.1% or 23,441 carloads. North American traffic in August on a same-railroad basis fell 12.6% due in part to lower coal and metals shipments. Genesee & Wyoming fell 0.3%.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

306,CSX,"Like they say at the Opera - ""It ain't over till the fat lady sings"" Well - can you hear her singing? Greece and the EU strike an 11th hour deal! The Opera is over….or is it?
"
307,CSX,"(Who is kidding who? It's never over.)
"
308,CSX,"This morning global investors are waking up to the headlines:
"
309,CSX,"""Tsipras Capitulates to Creditor's Demands to Keep Greece in the Euro""
"
310,CSX,"""Greece and Eurozone Thrash out Rescue Deal""
"
311,CSX,"""Agreekment! Overnight Talks Result in Aid-for-Reform Deal""
"
312,CSX,"This is like a sequel to the 1994 comedy - ""Dumb and Dumber"" Only this one stars Alexis Tsipras and the whole Greek Parliament...I mean have you ever seen anything so breathtakingly stupid? Alexis Tsipras was elected on the platform of ""Screw the European Union"" - Remember - he was the one that claimed that he would not accept one more ounce of austerity, or cuts, or tax increases (not that anyone in Greece pays taxes - so what difference does that make?)
"
313,CSX,"Following months of ranting and raving against Germany and the Troika (IMF, ECB and EU) - He rejected plan after plan then forced a referendum vote in his country, campaigned for his citizens to vote 'NO' - and when they 'overwhelmingly agreed' that last week's deal was a bad one - he then sold them down the river! He made such a dramatic reversal that it's almost laughable.....and to make it more ridiculous - the latest 'final offer' is far worse than ones he had turned down! We now have a new word that is sure to light up the Twitter sphere - ""Gridiot"".
"
314,CSX,"Paul Krugman - an American Economist and Professor of Economic and Int'l Affairs at Princeton University - summed it up this way:
"
315,CSX,"""This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can't accept; but even so, it's a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.""
"
316,CSX,"Global markets, now all relieved (at least for today), have moved into positive territory. Beginning in Asia - markets there sensing relief on the Greek front caused investors and traders to review recent market action. Add in some positive economic data across the region and it was Risk On. China - which has been the focus of late - reported trade figures showing that exports rose 2.8%, substantially beating the expectation of +0.2%.....on a side note - Gov't officials tried to temper the mood saying that 'exports are likely to face relatively big pressure in the coming months'. (Because - How long can they keep up this façade?)
"
317,CSX,"China ended the day up 2.4% extending Friday's gain of better than 6%. Clearly the market has been boosted by the recent 'reforms' instituted by Beijing….Brokerages were told in 'no uncertain terms' on Sunday to use real names and national identification numbers on all trades - Imagine that - no more imaginary brokerage accounts! Who would have thought of using real names? Over the weekend - Xinhua - the state owned news outlet - reported that some brokerage houses were 'suspected of manipulating futures prices and other malicious practices. Like I said last week - China is not a free market and while the measures recently imposed have caused the markets to rally - what happens once they are removed? Are foreign investors really feeling any better? Not so much….
"
318,CSX,"In Japan - money poured into the Yen - as the safe haven trade. Equities also moved higher as investors got the 'all clear' sign on a Greek deal while the GPIF (Gov't Pension Investment Fund) released performance figures showing a 12% return in the 12 months ended March 31st. Shoji Hirakawa, Chief equity strategist at Oksan Securities, did say that the fund looks like they still have another 4 or 5 trillion Yen left to put to work in the Japanese stock market - Ah…Hello??? 5 Trillion more Yen going into stocks....Anyone want to stand in front of that train?
"
319,CSX,"In Europe this morning - as you can imagine - markets there are on a tear….FTSE + 0.61%, CAC 40 + 1.78%, DAX +1.32%, EUROSTOXX +1.64%, SPAIN +1.25% and ITALY +1.26%. Good for today - but if Tsipras can't deliver - then expect it to all fall apart mid-week. Even if he does deliver - and that is a big ""IF"" - will he be able to hold onto his position as PM? Relief- sure.....Greece now has 72 hours to vote in the reforms. There is already trouble brewing in Parliament - you can imagine the rage among those that supported Tsipras in his efforts and now feel like he turned his back on them.
"
320,CSX,"German Chancellor Merkel had this to say: ""Trust has to be rebuilt, the Greek authorities have to take on responsibility for what they agreed to, It now hinges on step-by-step implementation of what we agreed.""
"
321,CSX,"And that agreement is for more spending cuts, pension cuts, and tax increases - everything that the country voted against.....Are you beginning to see the Dumb and Dumber reference?
"
322,CSX,"U.S. futures are soaring - currently up 14 points - at this rate we will be banging our heads on S&P 500 2100 before lunch.

Greece and the EU strike an 11th hour deal! The Opera is over….or is it?(Who is kidding who? It's never over.)This morning global investors are waking up to the headlines:""Tsipras Capitulates to Creditor's Demands to Keep Greece in the Euro""""Greece and Eurozone Thrash out Rescue Deal""""Agreekment! Overnight Talks Result in Aid-for-Reform Deal""This is like a sequel to the 1994 comedy - ""Dumb and Dumber"" Only this one stars Alexis Tsipras and the whole Greek Parliament...I mean have you ever seen anything so breathtakingly stupid? Alexis Tsipras was elected on the platform of ""Screw the European Union"" - Remember - he was the one that claimed that he would not accept one more ounce of austerity, or cuts, or tax increases (not that anyone in Greece pays taxes - so what difference does that make?)Following months of ranting and raving against Germany and the Troika (IMF, ECB and EU) - He rejected plan after plan then forced a referendum vote in his country, campaigned for his citizens to vote 'NO' - and when they 'overwhelmingly agreed' that last week's deal was a bad one - he then sold them down the river! He made such a dramatic reversal that it's almost laughable.....and to make it more ridiculous - the latest 'final offer' is far worse than ones he had turned down! We now have a new word that is sure to light up the Twitter sphere - ""Gridiot"".Paul Krugman - an American Economist and Professor of Economic and Int'l Affairs at Princeton University - summed it up this way:""This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can't accept; but even so, it's a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.""Global markets, now all relieved (at least for today), have moved into positive territory. Beginning in Asia - markets there sensing relief on the Greek front caused investors and traders to review recent market action. Add in some positive economic data across the region and it was Risk On. China - which has been the focus of late - reported trade figures showing that exports rose 2.8%, substantially beating the expectation of +0.2%.....on a side note - Gov't officials tried to temper the mood saying that 'exports are likely to face relatively big pressure in the coming months'. (Because - How long can they keep up this façade?)China ended the day up 2.4% extending Friday's gain of better than 6%. Clearly the market has been boosted by the recent 'reforms' instituted by Beijing….Brokerages were told in 'no uncertain terms' on Sunday to use real names and national identification numbers on all trades - Imagine that - no more imaginary brokerage accounts! Who would have thought of using real names? Over the weekend - Xinhua - the state owned news outlet - reported that some brokerage houses were 'suspected of manipulating futures prices and other malicious practices. Like I said last week - China is not a free market and while the measures recently imposed have caused the markets to rally - what happens once they are removed? Are foreign investors really feeling any better? Not so much….In Japan - money poured into the Yen - as the safe haven trade. Equities also moved higher as investors got the 'all clear' sign on a Greek deal while the GPIF (Gov't Pension Investment Fund) released performance figures showing a 12% return in the 12 months ended March 31st. Shoji Hirakawa, Chief equity strategist at Oksan Securities, did say that the fund looks like they still have another 4 or 5 trillion Yen left to put to work in the Japanese stock market - Ah…Hello??? 5 Trillion more Yen going into stocks....Anyone want to stand in front of that train?In Europe this morning - as you can imagine - markets there are on a tear….FTSE + 0.61%, CAC 40 + 1.78%, DAX +1.32%, EUROSTOXX +1.64%, SPAIN +1.25% and ITALY +1.26%. Good for today - but if Tsipras can't deliver - then expect it to all fall apart mid-week. Even if he does deliver - and that is a big ""IF"" - will he be able to hold onto his position as PM? Relief- sure.....Greece now has 72 hours to vote in the reforms. There is already trouble brewing in Parliament - you can imagine the rage among those that supported Tsipras in his efforts and now feel like he turned his back on them.German Chancellor Merkel had this to say: ""Trust has to be rebuilt, the Greek authorities have to take on responsibility for what they agreed to, It now hinges on step-by-step implementation of what we agreed.""And that agreement is for more spending cuts, pension cuts, and tax increases - everything that the country voted against.....Are you beginning to see the Dumb and Dumber reference?U.S. futures are soaring - currently up 14 points - at this rate we will be banging our heads on S&P 500 2100 before lunch. There are no economic reports for today but later in the week we get a slew of data points - Retail Sales, PPI, Empire State Manufacturing, Industrial Prod, and Capacity Utilization......We are now well into earnings season...Tomorrow starts the beauty pageant....JPMorgan (JPM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wells Fargo (WFC) - later in the week - we get US Bancorp (USB), Bank of America (BAC), CSX (CSX), Yum Brands (YUM) to name just a few.....The focus now will turn to the earnings and future guidance.....The Greek-think is a bit exhausting....but will remain simmering on the back burner.Look for the S&P 500 to test both the 100 and 50 DMA's (2095 & 2099).

416,CSX,"These days, Canadian Pacific Railway is encountering the same sort of dilemma that all public companies must face, whether they have proven to be successes, failures or middle-of-the-road entities.Since merger-mania began sweeping through U.S. corporations back in the 1980s, CEOs have reached a profound conclusion: When it comes to achieving their goal of locking in growth year after year, buying is cheaper and easier than building. This is why so many companies pursue mergers and acquisitions within their industries.Canadian Pacific is no exception: The company steered by CEO E. Hunter Harrison had been mulling a merger with rail rival CSX (CSX) until talks broke off last week. The deal could still be back on the front burner at any moment in what might be described as a classic game of chicken between two CEOs, or other players could come to the table.Whatever happens, analysts say investors need to look a bit skeptically on the prospect of a favored company pursuing a merger. Is the entity doing so out of a sense of inherent weakness at the moment? Or, should an investor conclude that a CEO has begun to question whether his or her company can continue to hit home runs on its own and must now seek a partner?On the other hand, a company may be sending quite the opposite signal when it looks for a merger partner. Perhaps it is signaling that its health and likely near-term performance seem to be so robust that it now has the luxury of investing meaningfully in its future by securing an acquisition.Canadian Pacific controls roughly 14,000 miles of track all throughout Canada and in the U.S. Its reach extends from Montreal to Vancouver, and as far north as Edmonton. Its rail radius also encompasses such big U.S. cities as New York, Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis and Milwaukee.Anton Bayer, the chief executive of Up Capital Management in Granite Bay, Calif., told IBD that investors should ""pay attention when executives take actions they know will put them in the public spotlight. Executives weigh the pros and cons of every decision and move forward if they believe the pros outweigh the cons. We are paying attention to the potential of Canadian Pacific joining CSX for insight into the railroad industry that has performed very well these past two years.""As a veteran railroad industry observer, Bayer is looking carefully at how Canadian Pacific can reach its growth projections most smoothly.""We do not have a position in either company,"" he said, referring to Canadian Pacific and CSX, ""but do in Union Pacific — and one factor we need to determine is if the merger is an indication the combined companies can expand their market share faster to the detriment of other companies.""Investors should evaluate if the motivation for companies to merge is due to an industry that is growing or shrinking,"" Bayer said.Unequal Merger?An acquisition of CSX could help Calgary-based Canadian Pacific in its quest to extend its railroad network to U.S. East Coast refineries and ports. Neither company has commented on media speculation that CSX is inclined to reject such a blockbuster combination. The two companies have similar market values of about $34 billion each. One key to the likelihood of a merger is that CSX's annual sales total $12 billion (in U.S. dollar terms) and its employee roll of 31,000 is about double those of Canadian Pacific.Canadian Pacific might be wise to close or walk away from the deal in a timely manner. The longer the speculation persists in the media, the greater the odds that productivity at the company will start to suffer.When a CEO feels the urge to merge, a whole new set of strategic concerns surfaces.""People can become like the proverbial deer in the headlights,"" Paul Carroll told IBD. He's a CEO consultant and co-author of ""Billion Dollar Lessons: What You Can Learn from the Most Inexcusable Business Failures of the Last 25 Years."" ""Business issues may be pressing, but there's nothing more pressing than the future of your job. Work may stop while people worry about their futures.""There are other dangers. ""Competitors will pounce,"" Carroll added. ""Their salesmen are surely already saying, 'Why would you go with them, given all the uncertainty? Why not work with us instead?'""There are also numerous precedents. ""Even in the high-tech world, where customers tend to be locked in because switching to new computer systems is so painful, mergers such as the one between Alcatel and Lucent have created opportunities for competitors to poach. So, the longer the uncertainty drags on, the more (Canadian Pacific) and CSX will lose to competitors,"" Carroll noted.Against this backdrop, companies have to decide whether the best strategy for ensuring steady growth, which Wall Street invariably demands, is to keep going it alone or join forces with a big industry rival.Regulatory AngleAnother factor is that when it comes to CEO distractions, few twists can be as thorny as interference from the U.S. government. When two behemoths from the same industry start to talk merger, regulators inevitably get involved. The media also begin to speculate about the government hurdles that await an acquiring company as it tries to gobble up another.""When people start talking about a monopoly, Washington scrutinizes the situation,"" Michael Holland, founder and head of Holland & Co. in New York City told IBD.""Given the current regulatory environment in Washington, any industry that features two large participants might have had a very tough time getting approval from regulators. Especially given the history of the railroad industry, you can expect some heavy scrutiny,"" Holland said.Before the deal goes under the magnifying glass, companies like Canadian Pacific must also gauge how well they can lobby regulators to get the deal through. ""The influence-over-regulator portion of the situation is crucial,"" Holland said. ""It is one of the big keys to a high profile transaction like this one.""New problems also appear out of the blue as old ones recede. Perhaps the best rule is to view each likely acquisition on its individual merits and to remain skeptical, despite any euphoria that surrounds the news.

After all, some of these businesses precede the Civil War (1861-1865).For the income investor, however, there's plenty to consider.This column's mission is to help readers discover and profit from stocks that show a sound business model, reliable earnings, good cash flows, a rising cash dividend, and high potential for capital gains.Jacksonville, Fla.-based CSX (CSX), founded in 1827, appears to meet these criteria.The stock is up 39% since Jan. 1, beating a 26% gain for the large-cap S&P 500. Despite a few mild pullbacks, CSX is also up from a 10-week cup-with-handle breakout at 25.89.The major head wind for CSX today is the deteriorating coal sector. Energy markets continue increasingly to favor natural gas. To combat the decline, CSX sees the merchandise and intermodal businesses as a counterbalance for continued growth.At the Baird Industrials Conference in Chicago last month, CFO Fredrik Eliasson noted that these two businesses now make up more than 80% of CSX's total volume. He said customers see the ""attractive economic value of converting freight from highway to rail.""IBD's Transportation-Rail group, however, is lagging Transport-Truck in terms of 12-month performance; the two are up 35% and 53% respectively.CSX's 2.2% annual dividend yield is one of the lowest within IBD's Dividend Leaders screen results. However, CSX is growing its dividend sharply, up an estimated 19% on a trailing 12-month basis over the past three to five years.Revenue growth picked up in Q3, rising 4% vs. a 2% increase in Q2. CSX gets an A in SMR Rating. It also earns an excellent 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 5. Strong annual operating cash flows weather the relatively high long-term debt to equity ratio of 101%.

643,CSX,"Union Pacific (UNP) said early Thursday that third-quarter profit surged on pricing and productivity gains despite lower shipments of coal and grains. The nation's largest railroad by market capitalization said earnings per share rose 13% to $2.48, topping analyst consensus by a penny and in line with guidance Union Pacific gave earlier this month.

678,CSX,"It is a well documented fact that that high oil prices have prevented airline stocks from flying high this year. In fact, oil prices have increased more than 20% year to date. Notably, high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.Like all other airlines, high fuel costs are hurting Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) too. We remind investors that even though this Atlanta, GA-based company marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the first quarter, the metric declined 3.9% year over year. The bottom-line contraction can be mainly attributed to high fuel costs. Moreover, the first-quarter earnings beat failed to translate into any strength for its stock, as evident from its year-to-date plunge of over 11%. Year- to- Date Price Performance With oil prices continuing to move northward, the stock might disappoint after the company releases second-quarter results on Jul 12. In fact, the stock could lose further value on dismal results.However, an earnings beat doesn't look very difficult for Delta in the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pretty conservative at $1.75, after a number of downward revisions over the last couple of months.Our quantitative model too points at an earnings beat in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Here's why:Delta has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Delta has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.77 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged 2 cents lower. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3. Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Delta’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlaySimilar to the last reported quarter, high fuel costs are likely to act as the key dampener to Delta’s earnings in the second quarter. We note that oil prices increased 14% in the April-June period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter average fuel price (mainline: net of hedging gains) stands at $2.14 per gallon, much higher than the $2.01 reported by the carrier in the first quarter of 2018.In fact, Delta anticipates fuel costs to be even higher and lie in the $2.20- $2.25 range in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are expected to limit bottom-line growth. The carrier envisions non-fuel unit costs to rise approximately 3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter non-fuel unit costs stands at 10.25 cents, more than 10.24 cents reported a year ago.However, the company is expected to perform well on the unit revenue front. The airline behemoth expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase between 4% and 5% year over year in the second quarter. The bullish forecast is based on the strong demand for air travel across all entities in the leisure and the business segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 15.27 cents, above 14.74 cents reported in the first quarter of 2018.Stocks That Warrants a LookInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may check out CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report), awaiting earnings releases this time around:CSX has an Earnings ESP of +2.17% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is scheduled to announce second-quarter results on Jul 17.SkyWest has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release second-quarter results on Jul 26.J.B. Hunt has an Earnings ESP of +0.95% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

679,CSX,"Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY  -  Free Report) reported impressive traffic figures for June owing to low air fares. Notably, traffic increased 7% year over year to 12.6 million in the month. In fact, the passenger count in June was the highest so far (April, May and June) at Ryanair in fiscal 2019. Passenger count in April and May were 12.3 million and 12.5 million, respectively. We note that Ryanair’s fiscal year ends on Mar 31.Coming back to the June traffic report, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) came in at an impressive 96% buoyed by strong demand for air travel. The metric improved from the May 2018 reading of 95%. However, load factor was flat on a year-over-year basis.The impressive June traffic report provides some relief to this European low-cost carrier, which has been struggling with labor-related issues for quite some time. Ryanair’s pilots, based in Ireland, are scheduled to go on a 24-hour strike on Jul 12 in protest against management’s approach toward transfers between the carrier’s European and African bases. The strike, if it materializes, might hamper travel plans of many passengers as Jul 12 marks the beginning of the traditional holiday fortnight in Northern Ireland.Adding to its woes, Ryanair ‘s cabin staff in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain will go on strike on Jul 25 and 26 against management inaction as far as their demands pertaining to higher pay and better working conditions are concerned. What is worse is that more strikes may follow if the labor unrest is not resolved.The ongoing labor problems have been responsible for the 8.4% decline in the Ryanair stock over the last three months.Three-Month Price Performance  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderRyanair has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the in the broader Transportation sector are GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

680,CSX,"With around 10 days left, the United States is eagerly looking forward to the Fourth of July holiday, when a record 47 million American travelers are expected to hit the road. This news is certainly encouraging at a time when gasoline prices are increasing.With unemployment at an 18-year low and job additions continuing to be strong, there has been a steady rise in disposable income. Confident consumers are expected to contribute to this astonishing figure. In this context, we have highlighted some of the stocks that will gain from the surge in travel.Independence Day to be Busiest EverAccording to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the United States’ biggest automotive advocacy group, millions of Americans will hit the roads, fly or travel by train in the Jul 3 to Jul 8 holiday period. AAA estimates that about 46.9 million American travelers will be traveling 80 km or more on this Fourth of July holiday. Travel volume will register an increase for the fifth straight year and touch a new all-time high since AAA started tracking these number 18 years back.In fact, travel volume is anticipated to be so high that global transportation analytics company, INRIX, projected that July Fourth road travel in some of the most crowded cities in the U.S. will be twice that of normal time. Additionally, senior vice president of AAA Travel and Publishing, Bill Sutherland, said that the 2018 Independence Day will be busiest as “Americans take to the nation's roads, skies, rails and waterways than ever before.""Road Travel Bustle Making the Most NoiseAccording to AAA’s 2018 holiday travel projection, 39.7 million travelers will take to the roads this Fourth of July, which will be 5.1% higher than last year’s figure. Additionally, air travel volume is expected to register a surge of 7.9% from last year’s number to 3.8 million and post a surge in volume for nine consecutive years.Moreover, other modes of transport, including buses, trains and cruise ships, will register travel volume of 3.5 million, advancing 5.8% from 2017’s figure. One of the major factors contributing to record-high travel volume expectation is the timing of the Independence Day this year. The July Fourth holiday falls on a Wednesday this time, which will offer travelers the flexibility to plan their trips both in the preceding and subsequent weekends to the holiday.Encouraging Economic Data Also a Tailwind Along with the timing of the Fourth of July holiday, confident consumers with additional disposable income are also a boon to this already busy holiday season. Additionally, increase in job additions and a record-low jobless rate in May is definitely good news.Domestic non-farm payrolls advanced by 223,000 in May, significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 190,000, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This was the largest number of job additions in three months.Additionally, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.8% in May, its lowest since April 2000. Moreover, the total number of unemployed is down by 772,000 or 0.5%, over the year. Also, disposable personal income increased by 0.2% in April.  5 Solid PicksA busy holiday season, strong jobs growth, record low jobless rate and increasing disposable income are encouraging more number of people to plan a holiday this Independence Day. In this context, we have selected five stocks that are expected to gain following these developments.

681,CSX,"U.S. President Trump has threatened to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods, while Beijing warned it would retaliate. This has heightened the trade spat between the two of the world’s largest economies. Investors, naturally, have turned nervous as earnings of companies could be at risk in the event of a global trade war.But there are some companies that might benefit. Among these are domestic producers of goods that do limited business in China, and companies with solid growth narratives as their promising outlook remains unfazed by the change in tariffs. Thus, investing in such winners at times of a trade war will not be a bad proposition.Trump Ups the Stake in Trade WarThe chances of a trade clash between Washington and Beijing intensified after Trump instructed the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to figure out $200 billion in imports from China for additional tariffs of 10%. He added that the United States may impose tariffs on another $200 billion provided the Asian nation retaliates.Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion Chinese imports. The tariffs will be passed in two phases. More than 800 Chinese exports, worth $34 billion, will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later.Trump said that “the United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world” and that the U.S. “will continue using all available tools to create a better and fairer trading system for all Americans.”The tariffs are intended to force China change its unfair practices with respect to technology and innovation. But regrettably China is hell-bent on increasing its tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. exports (read more: Trade War Fears Grip Wall Street: Buy 5 Ultra-Safe Stocks).Global Fund Managers Turn to AlibabaTrade wars are headwinds for companies as these erode profit margins and affect the overall economy. Thus, this rising tension has compelled top fund managers to look for companies that can emerge as winners. These companies have a strong domestic business and are unperturbed by import tariffs or in other words have a dominant market position.George Maris, a portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Select fund has identified one such company. That is none other than Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report), primarily, because of its domestic exposure.The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.7% compared with the Internet - Commerce industry’s estimated rally of 12.3%. The company has also outperformed the industry in the last year (+50.7% compared with +49.1%).Google, Facebook & Axon Enterprise Undeterred by a Trade WarCompanies that have long-term growth narrative will also not be affected by a trade war. Notable, among them are Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report). Google’s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising, since the search engine controls more than 40% of the U.S. digital ad market. Google’s focus on smart home technology, cloud data centers and automated driving drives the company’s earnings. All these areas are unlikely to be affected by a trade war.       Similarly, Facebook’s growth is mostly in digital advertising. Facebook controls 20% of the U.S. digital ad market, while Instagram controls another 5%. Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs.Axon Enterprise sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world. Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover, which gives the stock a solid growth narrative.In fact, shares of Alphabet, Facebook and Axon Enterprise rose 2.1%, 1.3% and 2.7% on Jun 18, respectively despite Trump’s threat to escalate the trade fight with China.Why Thinking Small is Not the Only Thing to Do Now?In the wake of Trump’s tariff announcement, investors seem to be shifting into small-cap stocks. And why so? This is because such stocks tend to have higher proportion of domestic sales compared to large-caps. But, in reality, the difference isn’t much. Per data from FactSet Research, small-caps stocks in the Russell 2000 index derive 20.6% of their revenues from outside the United States, while stocks from the broader S&P 500 derive 30.3%.Satellite player Harris, electrical equipment maker Hubbell, seller of lighting equipment Acuity Brands, aerospace and defense players KLX and L3 Technologies, Inc.

682,CSX,"Shares of CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $65.93 on May 30, before retracing a bit to close the session at $65.64. The day’s closing price reflected an improvement of 2.6% over May 29’s close.We note that this S&P 500 member’s impressive performance was not limited to May 30. Notably, the company has performed impressively in a year, gaining 20.3% compared with the S&P 500 Index’s 11.9% rally. Let's delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the impressive price performance.CSX is benefiting from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, which was implemented by the company’s former CEO — E. Hunter Harrison — who expired in December 2017. The system, designed to improve its operational efficiency, is being backed by CSX’s current CEO Jim Foote. The implementation of the above system resulted in CSX generating efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017. Strong performance of its intermodal segment is also a positive for the stock.Furthermore, improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) was in tune with the company’s cost control efforts. To this end, the company’s adjusted operating ratio improved 570 basis points in the first quarter. CSX expects to achieve an operating ratio of 60% by 2020.In fact, the lesser the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available with the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks. In February 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced a 10% dividend hike to 22 cents per share.CSX, which bought back shares worth more than $2 billion in 2017, increased the existing share repurchase program to $5 billion. The $5-billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We believe the new tax law is a blessing for Transportation companies like CSX. This is because the huge savings induced by the new law might result in an uptick in these shareholder-friendly activities. Other transportation stocks like Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) also raised dividend payouts recently owing to the new tax law.Other Favorable MeasuresCSX’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Not only has the company’s ROE of 18% gradually increased in a year’s time, it also compares favorably with the ROE of 16.6% for the S&P 500 Index.The company’s Momentum Score of A further highlights its short-term attractiveness. Moreover, CSX’s expected earnings per share growth rate (three to five years) of 13.3% compares favorably with its industry’s 10.6% reading.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

684,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) has rallied 15.4% so far this year, significantly outperforming the industry’s increase of 6.2%. Reasons Behind the Price IncreaseThe new tax law has been aiding the company immensely since its implementation in December 2017. In first-quarter 2018, the bottom line was up 52.9% owing to the reduced tax rate as well as lower costs. Moreover, CSX’s effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.8%, much less than 37.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. The momentum is expected to continue in the current year as well.Apart from bottom-line growth, huge savings from the tax cut will lead to an increase in free cash flow. As a result, the company will have more cash in hand to fund share repurchases and dividends among other things.Furthermore, it has an impressive track record of dividends and share buybacks. In February 2018, CSX announced a 10% dividend hike. Simultaneously, the company increased the existing share repurchase program to $5 billion.The company’s Precision Scheduled Railroading model, adopted last year also seems to be paying off. The model, which reduces costs, enhances services and optimally uses assets of the company, generated efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017.At the 2018 investor conference held in March, the company stated that the new model will lead to top-line growth backed by volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and the intermodal segments. Moreover, scheduled railroading is anticipated to provide greater agility to coal markets, which in turn, will drive growth.In fact, by 2020, CSX expects to achieve an operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) of 60% and outpace the industry. Traces of the company’s progress are evident from its first-quarter performance, wherein it reported an operating ratio of 63.7% compared with 73.2% in the prior-year quarter.These tailwinds place the company on a solid path for long-term growth. It has a long-term growth rate of 13.3%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCSX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and GATX Corp. (GATX  -  Free Report).

687,CSX,"A higher number of Americans are gearing up for a busy summer travel season. Be it by road or air, Americans this time are encouraged to travel thanks to a booming economy and growing consumer confidence.This is especially true as the frenzy for trips during the Memorial Day Weekend is far more than the past decade despite the highest gasoline prices in four years. Orlando, FL is expected to be the top destination, followed by Seattle, WA and Honolulu, HI.According to travel service provider American Automobile Association (AAA), Memorial Day weekend travel is expected to rise for the fourth straight year. More than 41.5 million Americans will travel 50 miles (80 km) over the Memorial Day weekend (May 24-28), up nearly 5% from the last year and the most in more than a dozen years. Of them, 36.6 million will go on a road trip, 3.1 million will fly, and 1.8 million will travel by train and other modes (including buses and cruises).Though road trip is expected to rise 4.7% over last year, motorists are expected to pay the highest gas price since 2014. Gas averaged $2.72 per gallon in April, up 33 cents from last year. However, travelers’ wallets will find some relief when paying for airfare, car rentals, and most mid-range hotels.This is because airfares are 7% lower than the last Memorial Day for an average $168 round-trip on the top 40 domestic routes while the average daily cost of a car rental is 11% cheaper and the lowest in the past four years, per AAA’s Leisure Travel Index. Meanwhile, AAA Three Diamond hotels are 14% cheaper than last year at an average rate of $186 per night.Huge travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for transporters, including airlines and railroads, thereby leading to higher share prices.

688,CSX,"The Q1 earnings season has so far unfolded a promising picture. According to the latest Earnings Preview, this positive scenario is expected to continue in the remainder of the current reporting cycle. The above report also projects S&P 500 companies’ bottom-line growth of 18.3% year over year. Additionally, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are anticipated to end the period with the top line expanding 7.7%.The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the ongoing earnings season with a year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.    One of those sectors is the Zacks Transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 19%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing companies, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with the new tax law bodes well for the sector participants.Already, key sector participants from Transportation namely, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the current reporting cycle.However, high fuel costs have emerged as a major headwind for transports in Q1. Evidently, the same has induced bottom-line contraction of the likes of Delta and the trend is likely to continue for the remainder of the season.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Transportation space will keenly await Q1 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report) , Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service, Inc.

691,CSX,"The diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers, among others, got off to an impressive start in first-quarter 2018 earnings season. As the U.S. economy continues to grow, demand for carriage is also increasing and this momentum is anticipated to sustain in 2018.Transportation sector is the lifeblood of the economy as it moves freights across the country and offshore. Favorable economic condition along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the Trump administration bode well for the sector.Performance to DateSo far, two major airline operators Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) as well as freight railroad behemoth CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) delivered highly impressive results. Each of these three companies handily surpassed both the top and bottom line with respect to the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Additionally, transport logistic company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line missed the same marginally.  All four stocks mentioned above carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax Overhaul: A Major BoostThe two pro-growth agendas of President Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Transportation sector. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%., its historic low in 78 years. A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland. Consequently, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate borne by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow.Capital-Intensive Nature of Transportation SectorTransportation companies, mainly railroads and airlines, invest significantly in capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. Under the old law, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they were incurred. Consequently, U.S. corporates needed to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure.However, following the U.S. tax overhaul, the companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately. In fact, going forward if the companies increase their capital expenditures, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.This in fact will leave more cash in the hands of transporters to fund project expansions, acquisitions and share repurchases among others. Apart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space are also likely to be huge beneficiaries of the new tax law.Robust Demand for FreightA thriving and improving economy supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects, sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent.Economic growth and demand for freight are positively correlated. Healthy growth in manufacturing, construction, mining and automobile production will increase demand for more freight.Moreover, the government has taken a decision to spend a whopping $1.5 trillion on several infrastructure projects like constructing new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across the country over a period of 10 years. This project will generate significant demand for manufacturing sector, which in turn will raise demand for freight, benefiting the transportation sector.  Price PerformanceThe chart below shows year to date price performance of four stocks mentioned above.Bottom LineThe U.S. economy is gathering steam. With the overall economy back on track, things are looking up for the transportation sector as well. A robust U.S. economy, healthy consumer and business confidence, massive tax haul and business friendly policies of the government are anticipated to fuel transportation sector’s growth.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

692,CSX,"The Q1 earnings season is off to a solid start with big names like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup reporting better-than-expected results. Per the latest Earnings Preview , the impressive performance is likely to continue. On a year-over-year basis, both the top and bottom line (for S&P 500 companies) are projected to improve 16.6% and 7.5%, respectively, in this reporting cycle.The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with a year-over-year increase in the bottom line. Of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.     One of those sectors is the transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 15.4%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing companies, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with the new tax law bodes well for the sector participants.Already, key sector participants from the transportation sector namely, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report), posted better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the current reporting cycle.However, rise in fuel costs does not augur well for transportation stocks. This is because expenses pertaining to fuel represent one of the major input costs for any transportation company. Of late, oil prices have been on an uptrend and were up approximately 8% in the Q1 (January-March period).Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q1 reports from key players like Werner Enterprises, Inc. (WERN  -  Free Report), GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) and Marten Transport, Ltd. (MRTN  -  Free Report) on Apr 19.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Werner Enterprises is one of the country’s leading carriers and logistics operators, headquartered in Omaha, NE. Although the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, it is unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings in the quarter. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.64% (the Most Accurate estimate of 36 cents per share comes in a penny lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate).

694,CSX,"After the closing bell Tuesday, a fresh wave of Q1 earnings reports have come out, across a wide swath of sectors. Among the big names posting actuals this afternoon, all came out with exclusively better-than-expected results.IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), at first glance, appeared to accomplish what analyst had set out for it: a 5-cent earnings beat to $2.45 per share on $19.1 billion in sales, which surpassed the $18.7 analysts were looking for. These figures represent year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in 5 years, but after-market trading is selling off IBM shares roughly 5%, virtually wiping out the company's gains for all of 2018 so far.This sell-off may also provide a drag to the Dow index tomorrow morning, which had just finally dug itself out of its hole over the past month. IBM's guidance for full-year 2018 was reaffirmed at $13.80 per share; apparently investors were looking for something a little stronger on this line.United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by a penny to 50 cents a share, with revenues for the quarter also edging out expectations to $9.03 billion. This marks a 23% upswing in earnings from the year-ago quarter on PRASM metrics up 2.7% in Q1. Full-year guidance have tightened to between $7-8 per share, and the company has beaten estimates on the bottom line for 5 straight quarters.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) also outperformed estimates, though not by as impressive of margins as some of these companies this afternoon. Headline numbers of $4.79 per share on $2.89 billion in sales also mark the fifth-straight earnings beat, and revenue growth year over year was roughly 33%. Yet late trading is selling the news following a strong regular session, down 2.6% since results were posted. For more on LRCX's earnings, click here.CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) easily bettered expectations on the bottom line in its Q1 -- 78 cents per share vs. 66 cents expected, on $2.88 billion in revenues, better than the $2.83 billion expected. This company has also outperformed in the past 5 straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of over 10%. Late trading is pushing up CSX shares 3.78%.Finally, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) posted arguably the most impressive Q1 report of the bunch, with $2.44 per share far outpacing the $1.99 expected, and revenues of $848 million solidly passing the $767 million in the Zacks consensus. Shares in late trading are up 5.6%, putting the MedTech company up near record-high trading territory.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

695,CSX,"The Q1 earnings season is in the nascent stage with a handful of S&P 500 participants having reported results so far. In fact, this reporting cycle has started on a strong note courtesy of earnings beats from big names in the banking space like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report). The current week is also going to be a busy one with several companies reporting their quarterly results. This week alone will see 156 companies, including 53 S&P 500 participants, revealing their Q1 numbers.In fact, the projection for Q1 earnings season is very encouraging. Per the latest earnings preview, the bottom line for S&P 500 companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%. The report further predicts that 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year. Out of which, 11 are anticipated to exhibit double-digit earnings growth.One of those sectors is the transportation sector, wherein earnings are anticipated to increase 15.4%. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes airlines and railroads, among others. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration bode well for the sector.Already, the transportation sector has seen one of its key members — Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) — reporting better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in Q1. However, high fuel costs contributed to a year-over-year decline in earnings. The trend is likely to continue through the current reporting cycle as fuel costs are on the rise and expenses pertaining to fuel represent one of the major input costs for any transportation company.Of late, oil prices have been on an uptrend and were up approximately 8% in the Q1 (January-March) period. In fact, the first quarter of 2018 witnessed U.S. oil benchmark reach its highest settlement since December 2014.Given this backdrop, investors should keenly await earnings reports of key transportation companies —  the Jacksonville, FL- based railroad operator, CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and the Chicago-based airline heavyweight, United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) —  on Apr 17.UAL vs. CSXWe have assessed these transportation companies on the following parameters.Price PerformanceIn the first quarter of 2018, United Continental clearly outpaced CSX in terms of price performance. United Continental rallied 3% compared with CSX’s 1.2% rally. ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Continentalis likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #3. Previously too, our model conclusively showed an earnings beat as the Earnings ESP was +7.00% with a same Zacks Rank (Read more: United Continental's  Q1 Earnings: A Beat in the Cards?)However, the picture is opposite for CSX as it has an Earnings ESP of -1.71% and a Zacks Rank of 3. (Read more: CSX to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Even with respect to earnings surprise history United Continental holds the edge over CSX. This is because the airline has managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.6%. On the other hand, CSX outpaced the consensus mark in three of the past four quarters by an average of 10.3%.Projected Earnings GrowthWe expect year-over-year earnings growth for the soon-to-be-reported quarter to be 29.4% for CSX, higher than 22.5% for United Continental.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that United Continental is poised for a better first quarter, as the company clearly scores higher than CSX with respect to most of the considered parameters.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

696,CSX,"As we saw during yesterday’s closed market futures activity, the Dow looks to gain over 200 points out of the gate this morning. This follows a 200+ gain — and new record high — on Friday as Q4 earnings from some of Wall Street’s biggest banks kicked off a new season of earnings reports.Ahead of Tuesday’s opening bell — starting a new holiday-shortened week as Q4 earnings season heats up — we look toward a small amount of earnings results, but from key companies. After today’s close, we look toward CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Finance PNFT earnings. Already this morning, we see two Q4 results from the banking world.Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) posted a beat on both top and bottom lines in its Q4 report, with earnings of $1.28 per share topping the $1.19 expected and the $1.14 from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the final calendar quarter of 2018 brought in $17.3 billion, slightly ahead of the $17.1 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate.The banking major took a one-time charge of $22 billion ($8.43 per share, non-cash) to account for adjusted deferred taxes based on the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Higher revenues and slightly lower expenses helped the bank beat quarterly estimates. For more on Citi’s earnings results, click here.Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) is another finance company reporting Q4 earnings this morning, and also surpassed expectations: $1.28 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 7 cents, and revenues in the quarter were way out in front of estimates, $830 million versus the expected $819.6 million.

698,CSX,"Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 19, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.3%. The company’s earnings (on an adjusted basis) of $1.35 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The bottom line also expanded 20.5% on a year-over-year basis.The company’s revenues of $656.6 million also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $647.9 million. The top line improved 9% on a year-over-year basis. Results were boosted by a 3% rise in overall carload volumes.We expect this Kansas City, MO-based railroad operator to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter too. In fact, the positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has inched up almost 1% over the last 30 days.Lets delve deep to unearth the factors likely to influence its Q4 results:We believe that volume growth will aid Kansas City Southern’s results in the final quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter carload volumes is pegged at 1.7%, higher than the figure reported in the previous quarter.The company's Industrial & Consumer Products segment and the Chemical & Petroleum unit are anticipated to maintain its strong performance in the fourth quarter. The improving scenario pertaining to coal is also a positive. The company’s efforts to control costs are expected to boost fourth-quarter earnings as well.Apart from Kansas City Southern, other railroad companies like CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) are focusing on cost control to drive earnings.Furthermore, we expect Kansas City Southern to report an improved operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the to-be-reported quarter. The lower the value of operating ratio the better as it implies that more cash is available to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.However, high operating expenses might hurt this railroad operator’s bottom line in the fourth quarter. In fact, the new tax law might push up operating expenses due to one-time bonus payments.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too indicates that chances of Kansas City Southern beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Kansas City Southern has an Earnings ESP of +0.21%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3.

701,CSX,"Several large banking institutions, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), released their latest quarterly results on Friday, marking the unofficial start of busy fourth-quarter earnings report cycle.In the coming weeks, we will see reports from the world’s biggest and most relevant companies, meaning that investors need to be prepared for the ensuing movement that is likely to occur throughout the market.According to the latest report from Sheraz Mian, the head of the Zacks Equity Research department and an acknowledged earnings expert, earnings growth is expected to be positive for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors—and growth rates are projected to hit the double digits for our Energy, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, and Automotive groups.Meanwhile, the revisions trend for Q4 earnings estimates has been favorable compared to recent quarters. Total earnings growth is now expected to touch 8.8%, up from a projected 8.4% just two months ago.Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of January 15.1.       CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report)Rail transportation giant CSX Corporation is scheduled to release its latest earnings report after the market closes on January 16. Shares of CSX have been on a strong run over that past year, gaining roughly 53%. The company has met or surpassed earnings estimates in 15 consecutive quarters, and the stock is carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) into its report date.Our latest consensus estimates are calling for CSX to post earnings of 56 cents per share and revenues of $2.88 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of +14.29% and -5.23%, respectively. CSX’s focus has been efficiency, so investors should keep their eyes on margins and free cash flow. Service disruptions could have an effect on the firm’s top line, but earnings growth should still be present. 2.       Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report)Investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs is slated to announce its latest quarterly results before the market opens on January 17. Goldman shares have gained just 5% over the past year, but the stock has moved nearly 7% higher within the past 12 weeks. The firm has met or surpassed earnings estimates in two straight quarters and is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect Goldman to report earnings of $4.90 per share and revenues of $7.63 billion. These results would represent growth rates of -3.54% and -6.60%, respectively. Goldman has struggled with a lack of volatility throughout global markets, and a one-time charge related to the new tax bill’s consideration of overseas profits will impact this quarter. Still, cost control efforts have been commendable and could support the bottom line. 3.       IBM Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report)Information technology player IBM is set to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on January 18. The stock has dipped more than 2% over the past year, although shares have rebounded nearly 7% within the past four weeks. IBM has met or surpassed earnings estimates in 12 consecutive quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) into its report date.Our current consensus estimates are calling for IBM to report earnings of $5.17 per share and revenues of $21.96 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of +3.19% and +0.87%, respectively. IBM has been dealing with slumping revenues for years now, so seeing an uptick in quarterly sales would be encouraging. If it comes, it will likely be due to continued strength in the company’s cloud and IoT projects. Want more analysis from this author?

702,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Jan 16 after the market closes.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 51 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line came in at 6.3% higher than the year-ago figure. Revenues of $2,743 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,769.4 million. However, the top line inched up 1.2% year over year owing to core pricing gains.Let’s see, how things shape up this earnings season.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that CSX is likely to beat on earnings this quarter on the back of a perfect combination of the two following key ingredients:Zacks ESP: CSX has an Earnings ESP of +0.14%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A positive Zacks ESP serves as an indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?The company’s cost-cutting efforts to drive the bottom-line growth are expected to aid results in the fourth quarter.Additionally, the improved coal and intermodal scenario is anticipated to boost results in the quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter coal revenues is pegged at $534 million, higher than $514 million reported in the previous quarter. While the consensus mark for intermodal revenues stands at $488 million, above the reported base of $446 million in the third quarter.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks are also impressive. In October, the company’s board authorized $1.5 billion in share repurchases, an addition to the $1.5-billion program recently completed.However, a sluggish automotive production may hamper results in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s high-debt levels are also worrisome.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), Allegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) stocks with the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in their next releases.American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +2.18% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 26.Allegiant has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 31.JetBlue has an Earnings ESP of +3.46% and the stock is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.

703,CSX,"Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 11, before the market opens.The carrier’s earnings as well as revenues surpassed expectations in the third quarter despite the natural calamities. However, the bottom line declined 7.6% on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs. While the top line increased 5.5% from the year-ago figure.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings.Factors Likely at PlayLike the previous quarter, high costs are anticipated to hurt Delta’s bottom line in the fourth quarter too. Additionally, the recent power outage at the Atlanta airport has led to approximately 1,400 flight cancellations and is estimated to have affected the carrier’s pre-tax income to the tune of $25-50 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company has increased guidance for fourth-quarter costs due to the power crisis as well as some other factors.The Atlanta, GA-based company now anticipates fourth-quarter non-fuel unit costs including profit sharing to be up approximately 5.5% (previous view was in the range of 5-5.5%). The carrier expects fuel price per gallon for the concluding quarter of 2017 between $1.92 and $1.97 including taxes and refinery impact.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Average fuel price per gallon, net of hedging (mainline) stands at $1.89, substantially higher than the year-ago reported value of $1.60. Moreover, due to high fuel costs, the company expects operating margin for the fourth quarter to be approximately 11%, the lowest point in its initially guided range of 11-13%. Additionally, system capacity for the period is projected to expand 2.3%.However, the airline has been seeing rising revenue trends in the final quarter. The carrier forecasts the metric to rise approximately 4% in the final quarter of 2017, higher than the 1.9% growth witnessed in the third quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) stands at 14.04 cents, higher than the year-ago reported value of 13.58 cents.The carrier is anticipated to take a one-time charge of $150-$200 million in the to-be-reported quarter on account of the newly initiated tax law.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show conclusively that Delta is likely to beat estimates in fourth-quarter 2017. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Delta has an Earnings ESP of -0.71% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 89 cents per share, marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a possible earnings surprise. Hence, a negative ESP leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the stock is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Delta Air Lines, Inc.

705,CSX,"Market futures are up big again to start the week before Christmas, following 4 straight weeks in the green amidst a bona fide Santa Claus rally and indexes that continue to price in the likelihood of the massive tax cut passage through Congress this week. All three major indexes are up at this hour, none higher than the +157 points on the Dow.The House of Representatives looks to hold their vote as early as today or tomorrow, with the Senate following shortly thereafter. This would bring President Trump his first major piece of legislation passed through Congress since becoming president in January, and it would do so on his own self-imposed timeline: prior to Christmas break.Complete with rolling back existing regulations, especially concerning the finance industry, this tax cut creates a real win-win for market participants: if, as Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin claim, that the corporate tax breaks generate trillions of dollars in new business, then we can expect to see the market bid up even further than the historic highs we currently enjoy; but if the $1-1.7 trillion this bill would load onto the U.S. deficit causes a new financial crisis down the road, the government could always put another bailout program in place like the one taxpayers funded 9 years ago.Markets across Europe and Asia also climbed into positive territory overnight, helping bolster domestic markets going forward today. Volume is down on seasonality, and will remain so through the beginning of 2018. But with little by way of economic data expected this week, we expect investors to keep a close eye on steps taken on Capitol Hill as the voting begins. Any delays may trigger some near-term worry, but signs of passage appear very strong at this time.CEO of CSX DiesHunter Harrison, the recently installed chief executive of CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) who managed to turn fortunes around for the railroad major in very short order, has died from severe complications after a sudden illness. He was 73.Upon rumors that Harrison would take the helm at CSX — from Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report), based on an insistent campaign from Mantle Ridge’s activist investor Paul Hilal — early last year brought an immediate spike in share price. In Harrison’s first earnings call as CEO of his new company resulted in an 18.6% positive earnings surprise. As a result, and along with the major bull market rally we’ve seen over the past year, CSX zoomed to all-time highs under Harrison’s short tenure.Those shares are now down in the pre-market roughly 2.5%. Time will tell if Harrison’s quick work managed to right the wrongs for the rail company longer term, or if the activist investors will remain satisfied with CSX’s prospects, but for today we extend condolences to the surviving members of Harrison’s family.

707,CSX,"FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Dec 19.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 20.8%. Earnings (excluding 32 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.51 per share significantly fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.17. Furthermore, the bottom line declined 13.5% on a year-over-year basis due to higher costs.Quarterly revenues increased 4.3% year over year to $15,297 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,368.7 million. The top line was hurt primarily due to the TNT Express cyberattack.Things do not look up for the FedEx stock this quarter either. Let’s look into the factors responsible for such a bleak outlook.Factors Likely at PlayFedEx's operations have been hurt by the TNT Express cyberattack in June. The effects of the attack are expected to hamper results in the second quarter too. Additionally, rising costs might affect the company’s bottom line growth. Moreover, expenses related to the integration process of TNT Express and the increased investments at its Ground unit are also likely to negatively impact the bottom line in the quarter to be reported.The company’s efforts to meet the surging demand in the peak holiday season are increasing delivery costs with potential to further hit the quarterly earnings performance.The company’s high-debt levels further add to its woes.However, strong growth of e-commerce is anticipated to boost the top line in the quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at the FedEx Express (including TNT Express) division stands at $8,911 million, higher than $6,743 million a year ago. For Ground and Freight revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4,793 million and $1,685 million, respectively, greater than the year-ago figures of $4,419 and $1,597 million, respectively.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FedEx is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: FedEx has an Earnings ESP of -0.59%.

709,CSX,"Last week, Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) — one of leading players in the railroad space — announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share (annualized $2.66 per share). The first installment of the hiked dividend will be paid on Dec 28, 2017, to shareholders as of Nov 30.The raised dividend highlights Union Pacific’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward. Moreover, a look at past records reveals Union Pacific’s stable dividend payment history.Shareholder-Friendly Measures Highlight Strong Balance SheetsUnion Pacific is not the only railroad operator to have increased its dividend payout. Fellow railroad operators like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividend payouts this year. Additionally, the board of directors at Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) cleared a new share buyback program in October 2017. The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31, 2022.These investor-friendly measures adopted by railroads clearly highlight the financial prosperity of stocks in the space. Additionally, the strengthened balance sheets of sector participants have made them invest substantially for promoting safety and enhancing productivity.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Railroads Prosper Due to Multiple TailwindsThe robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in the sector, after being battered by the coal-related headwinds for the last few years.In fact, the main reason behind the turnaround in fortunes of this key sector can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is regarded as a key revenue generating commodity at railroads.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of Donald Trump’s pro-coal stance, whereby he has promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also boosted demand for this key commodity. As fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. In fact, according to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate in the third quarter of 2017. Volume growth, pertaining to intermodal, was impressive in the earlier two quarters of 2017 as well.Furthermore, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in the stocks from this space. Improvement in a key metric — operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) — also augur well for railroad operators.  Evidently, this key metric improved at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern and Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report) in the third quarter.Price PerformanceDriven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Rail industry has outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.7%, the industry rallied 19.2%.Union Pacific’s Dividend Hike Augurs WellBased on optimism surrounding railroads, we applaud Union Pacific’s decision to raise its quarterly dividend as it indicates brighter days ahead.As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend paying one is much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments. Consequently, we believe that they should consider stocks in the space as lucrative investment options.The Zacks Industry Rank of 100 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 39% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half surpassed the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

710,CSX,"It has been a month since the last earnings report for CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Third Quarter EarningsCSX reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 51 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Quarterly earnings came in 6.3% higher than the year-ago figure.Revenues of $2,743 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,769.4 million.

Overall volumes also inched up 1% year over year.Also, third-quarter operating income (on a reported basis) improved 4% year over year to $876 million. While the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) reportedly improved 90 basis points to 68.1%, operating expenses remained flat year over year to $1,867 million.Adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $877 million. On an adjusted basis, the operating ratio for the reported quarter was 68%.Driven by improved efficiencies, CSX expects the bottom line to expand between 20% and 25% in 2017 on a reported basis over 2016 levels. Operating ratio in the high end of mid-60s is expected in 2017. The company expects free cash flow before dividends (excluding restructuring costs) of around $1.5 billion in 2017.Segmental PerformanceMerchandise revenues slipped 3% year over year to $1,688 million in the quarter.Coal revenues rose 10% year over year to $514 million owing to 5% expansion in volumes.Intermodal revenues improved 5% year over year to $446 million.

"
711,CSX,"The Q3 earnings season saw upbeat bottom-line performances by most railroad operators despite the recent hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria). In fact, railroads seem to be recovering this year after a prolonged struggle due to coal-related issues.The string of encouraging releases in Q3 (on the top- and bottom-lines) from key segmental players like Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) reflects the improved scenario regarding railroads.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereFactors Driving the Turnaround Stocks in the railroad space have performed well so far this year on the back of multiple tailwinds. In fact, the improvement in the coal industry has immensely benefited stocks in the space as coal is a key revenue generator.The commodity is likely to see even better days given President Trump’s pro-coal stance. Apart from coal, other key divisions of railroads like intermodal are also performing well. The strong performance of key sectors at railroads is leading to an uptick in overall volumes.Another factor working in favor of railroads is the improvement in the U.S. economy. In the third quarter of 2017, intermodal volumes increased 6.3% on a year-over-year basis. This was the highest growth rate recorded in more than three years.A buoyant domestic economy has also contributed to the turnaround at railroads. A vibrant economy implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.In fact, the likes of Kansas City Southern, CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year, which further highlights the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Operating Ratio Improvement - A Positive CatalystIn the third quarter, Kansas City Southern’s operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) came in at 64.4% compared with 66.9% reported a year ago. At Norfolk Southern, this key metric improved to 65.9% from 67.5% in the third quarter of 2016.Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. At CSX, operating ratio operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 68.1% in the third quarter. In 2017, CSX expects operating ratio in the high end of mid-60s. The metric also improved at Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report). Additionally, the prudent cost management of railroad operators raise optimism in the stocks.Solid Price PerformanceDriven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Rail industry has outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 15.7%, the industry rallied 19.2%.Also, a 19.3% improvement in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index on a year-to-date basis, bears testimony to bullishness surrounding railroads.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 118 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 46% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankWhat to Expect in Q4?We expect railroads to continue performing well in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by volume growth as was the case in Q3. Key units such as intermodal and coal are also expected to aid in delivering encouraging results,.The cost discipline of railroads might also drive the bottom line. For example, CSX expects its bottom line to expand between 20% and 25% in 2017 (on a reported basis) over 2016 levels, driven by improved efficiencies.Currently, the valuation picture for railroads is favorable and certainly points at some degree of upside. When valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the Zacks Rail Transportation industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 19.8x P/E multiple. In fact, the reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than its high end of 20.1x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (20.5x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Despite the positives, there are a few factors which might hurt results in the fourth quarter. Evidently, weakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the third quarter, consequently production declined in the Unites States.  The scenario is expected to remain gloomy in the final quarter of 2017 as well. In fact, sales of U.S. light vehicle sales for 2017 are projected at 17 million units, down approximately 3% on a year-over-year basis. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes might hurt railroads.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

712,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 17, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. The company’s impressive earnings history shows that it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.4%.Let’s see, how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayBack-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) havedisrupted railroad operations and CSX is not spared the catastrophe either. Also, freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, CSX’s bottom line is likely to be hurt in the third quarter.Sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause for worry in CSX’s case. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of revenues, softness in automotive volumes is but likely to limit the company’s bottom-line growth in this soon-to-be-reported quarter.Recently encountered service disruptions by the company also do not bode well for its future and might hamper results in the quarter.Further adding to its woes, CSX surfaces as a highly leveraged company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being revised 11.9% downward over the last 90 days and this in turn reflects the stock’s surrounding negative sentiment.Due to these headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has declined 2.7% against the industry’s 0.6% gain.  However, improvement in coal volumes holds promise for CSX in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter coal revenues stands at $530 million.  The intermodal segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $451 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

713,CSX,"Things have looked up for the railroad space so far this year  after not-so-favorable past few years (particularly 2015 and 2016) owing to weakness in domestic coal shipments. The improvement in the coal scenario has turned out to be a huge blessing for railroads as it is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The election of Donald Trump as the President of United States last year also worked wonders for the coal industry.  The President is in favor of reviving the industry by relaxing regulations detrimental to its prospects. He has started to act on his promises made during the campaigning phase. For example, he has taken measures to repeal the Climate Power Plan.The rise in natural gas prices is also helping to revive the demand for coal. Moreover, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), coal production in the United States will improve in 2017 and 2018. Given the importance of coal to railroads, any positive development for the commodity implies good news for the sector. Improvement in the freight scenario is also a positive for railroads.The revival of coal is evident  from the impressive performances of key sector participants like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) that registered double-digit growth with respect to coal revenues in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, an improving economy has also proved to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail.The shareholder-friendly activities of the likes of Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) in 2017 also highlight the financial prosperity of the sector participants.Rail Traffic Data Highlights ImprovementThe latest U.S. rail traffic report (for the week ended Sep 30, 2017) of the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) reveals 1.9% year-over-year growth in rail traffic (sum of total carloads and intermodal units). While total carloads for the week declined 1.6%, intermodal volume increased 5.5% year over year. The favorable intermodal scenario is also a positive development for railroads.The year-to-date data unveiled by AAR is also encouraging with a 3.8% improvement in total carloads. The favorable coal scenario is underscored by the fact that coal volumes have registered double-digit (12.3%) percentage gains so far this year. Overall rail traffic is up 3.6% year to date, with intermodal traffic rising 3.5%.Headwinds That May Mar Q3 Earnings PictureIn view of the coal-related improvement, the bullish scenario related to the intermodal unit and the thriving domestic economy, results of companies in the railroads space are expected to impress in the third quarter of 2017. However, there are a few factors, which might dampen their third-quarter performance.The back-to-back hurricanes (Harvey and Irma) have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines. Freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, the bottom line of these companies are likely to be hurt in the third quarter due to higher costs as a result of the hurricanes.Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter.The sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause of worry for railroads.  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes is also likely to hurt railroads in the third quarter.  What Awaits These 6 Railroads in Q3?Given this backdrop, let’s take a look at how key railroad operators might fare in the third quarter of 2017. According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), based in Kansas City, MO, is unlikely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter despite its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -1.18% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its results are likely to be hurt by Harvey. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, last month, Kansas City Southern provided a detailed account of its operations being hurt by Harvey.

In fact, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when it is witnessing negative estimate revisions.

714,CSX,"It is a well-documented fact that railroads have performed well so far in 2017, driven by multiple tailwinds. In fact, the revival in the coal-related scenario has aided stocks in this space immensely. This is because coal is a key revenue generating commodity for railroads. Notably, coal accounts for more than 15% of revenues for railroads in the United States. Also, President Trump’s support for fossil fuels compared with the renewable energy is an added positive for the commodity.In addition, a thriving and improving economy proves to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail. Given the importance of this commodity for railroads, any positive coal-related development is expected to bode well for the sector. Markedly, the revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively. The improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. Moreover, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), which is a key player in the same space, raised its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share (annualized $1.44 per share) representing an increase of 9.1% over the previous payout. The likes of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) have raised their quarterly dividend payout this year as well, thus highlighting the financial prosperity of railroads.Roadblocks to Watch Out for in Q3Given this backdrop, the scenario looks bright for railroads in the third quarter of 2017. Despite the positives, the recent disruptions particularly those caused by Harvey might limit growth. In this regard, Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share.Furthermore, sluggishness pertaining to automotive volumes is an added concern for railroads in the to-be-reported quarter. With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues, softness in automotive volumes are likely to hurt railroads significantly.What’s in Store in Q3?Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, we expect railroads to perform impressively in the third quarter on the bottom-line front. To counter the top-line woes, many railroads are looking to cut costs to drive their respective bottom lines. To this end, Union Pacific announced its decision to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees in August 2017, in a bid to increase efficiencies.Also, Norfolk Southern is looking to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line. The company anticipates improving coal volumes to boost its third-quarter results. While it is impossible to be sure about the exact nature of performance by railroads in the to-be-reported quarter, we expect stocks in this sector to perform impressively driven by the above-mentioned tailwinds despite the prevailing challenges. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

715,CSX,"The U.S. equity market has been jittery of late as it has been engulfed by domestic as well as international issues. On the domestic front, investors seem to be getting increasingly anxious about President Trump’s capability to push through his pro-business agenda.Moreover, the havoc wreaked by tropical storm Harvey has also hit certain sectors severely like the airlines. In fact, increased volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) indicate bearish market prospects.Apart from domestic events, issues like the escalating North Korea-Japan tension and the terror attacks in Spain also resulted in markets being subdued, of late.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investments. Such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Railroads Riding High on Coal RevivalA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having railroad stocks. Notably, railroads are witnessing good times currently after having struggled in the past few years. The most important catalyst behind the upsurge is the revival pertaining to coal, which is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants.The revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25%, while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Meanwhile, the bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 12.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date. Furthermore, Trump’s pro-coal stance is also a boon for the sector.Rebound in Intermodal Volumes – Another Positive Apart from the improvement on the coal front, intermodal volumes have also improved this year after a disappointing 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017.The scenario improved further in the second quarter with intermodal volumes rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years. The positive readings certainly support the air of optimism surrounding railroads.Solid Price PerformanceThe improved scenario regarding railroads can be out from the fact that Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11.7%, the industry added 14%.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 18 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads. The favorable rank places the companies in the top 7% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankAttractive ValuationWhen valued according to the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current financial year (F1), the industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 18.7x P/E multiple. The reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple (trading lower than the median of 18.9x) in the last 12 months as well as the S&P 500 (19.4x). The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside.Railroads+ Dividends = Winning StrategyIn view of the tailwinds mentioned above, we believe that stocks from the railroad space should be present in one’s portfolio. Moreover, dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario as highlighted above. Markedly, the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns.Consequently, we have zeroed in on four stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history.

716,CSX,"Stocks in the railroad space have performed impressively so far this year buoyed by the improvement in the coal-related scenario. Since coal is a key revenue generating commodity for stocks in this space, any positive coal-related update is bound to lift their spirits.In fact, improvement on the coal front is highly significant for railroads as stocks in the space had struggled over the last few years due to dwindling coal shipments. The bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 11.3% increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U.S. Railroads Index, year to date.Coal Revival - The Primary Catalyst Behind the SurgeThe revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017. For example, at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 25% while the same at CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) improved 27% and 32%, respectively.Currently, all these three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, the election of President Trump last year has been a boon for this industry. Notably, Trump’s pro-coal stance is a huge positive for the commodity which lost much of its relevance during President Obama’s tenure as a source of fuel.Trump has been advocating the case for fossil fuels instead of renewable energy, and has raised questions regarding climate change and its expected widespread impact. Already, he has started to act on his pre-election promises and has also taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan. He walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement as well.A thriving and improving economy also supports the bullish case for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States on the rails. This improvement under the new regime is evident from the fact that the Zacks Rail industry outperformed the broader market so far this year. While the S&P 500 Index gained 11%, the industry added 12.8%.Based on this healthy picture, we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime. Additionally, coal volumes will be positively impacted in the event of higher industrial production.Intermodal Shows PromiseApart from the bullish coal-related scenario and industrial growth, improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are also expected to boost stocks in the railroad space. In fact, things  have turned around for the better in the current year, which is a positive for the sector as intermodal continues to generate significant revenues for major U.S. railroad companies.According to the Intermodal Association of North America, intermodal volumes improved 2% year over year in the first quarter of 2017. The scenario improved further in the second quarter with the measure rising 4.5%. In fact, this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years.Financial StrengthWe note that the strong balance sheets of major railroads have enabled them to engage in shareholder-friendly activities. In keeping with this trend, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) recently announced a 9.1% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 36 cents per share. Moreover, the company announced fresh buyback plans.Additionally, the likes of Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp. have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year. In another shareholder friendly move, Norfolk Southern recently increased its full-year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from $800 million to $1 billion.In fact, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety also raise optimism and indicate toward their financial well being.Going forward, railroads are also looking to drive bottom-line growth through various cost cutting measures. To improve efficiencies, Union Pacific recently announced that it intends to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees.Zacks Industry Rank Supports Bullish ScenarioThe Zacks Industry Rank of 17 (out of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads as an investing option on the back of the tailwinds mentioned above. Markedly, the favorable rank places the companies in the top 7% of the Zacks industries.We put our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankRailroads Should Grace Your PortfolioGiven the bullish sentiment surrounding railroads, we believe that it will be prudent for investors to add stocks from the space to their respective portfolios to generate handsome returns.However, given the vastness of the railroad space, it is by no means an easy task to identify the few bright spots.

721,CSX,"After today's market close, we see another group of prominent S&P 500 companies reporting Q2 earnings. Results from IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) were among the headline-takers.Transformation struggles for IBM continue. Shares of the tech major beat estimates on the bottom-line from $2.73 per share expected to $2.97 reported today. But revenues of $19.3 billion missed the $19.46 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. This marks the 21st straight quarter of declining revenues for Big Blue. That said, the company affirmed fiscal year guidance of $13.80 per share. This would require a strong second-half of 2017 for IBM.Locomotive, shipping and logistics firm CSX posted impressive results for its Q2: earnings of 64 cents per share easily topped the 59 cents expected, which itself demonstrated nearly 25% year over year growth. Revenues of $2.93 billion also topped estimates. Further, the company announced a new $500 million share buyback program. The lauding of Hunter Harrison as a railroad wunderkind continues.United Continental, enduring a quarter with plenty of negative press regarding an on-plane incident (or three) this past spring, managed to post a positive surprise on both top and bottom lines: $2.75 per share beat the Zacks consensus by a dime, and revenues of $10.0 billion beat the $9.96 billion expected. PRASM (which had been reported prior to today's earnings report) was in-line for the quarter, as were margins overall, but United shares are selling on the news. The stock had been up 9% year to date.

723,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.60%. It also has an impressive earnings history. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.02%.Let’s see how things shape up this earnings season.Factors at PlayOf late, CSX Corp. has been facing challenges from a strong U.S. dollar which might hurt results in the second quarter. The company’s top line might be affected by low commodity prices and dwindling volumes.The fact that CSX Corp. is a highly leveraged company further adds to its woes and may hurt its second-quarter earnings.However, the company’s cost control measures are impressive. The company witnessed growth in volumes across most key segments in the first quarter. In this regard, we expect CSX Corp. to perform well in the second quarter as well.The company also projected an increase (albeit modest) in volumes in the second quarter at the 2017 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Conference. It said that second-quarter coal volumes have inched up 1% on a year-over-year basis (period considered Apr 1-May 12).CSX Corp.’s move to hike its quarterly dividend payout as well as approving of a new buyback plan also raises optimism. In Apr 2017, the company had announced an 11% hike in its quarterly dividend payout. Following the completion of the previous buyback plan, the company’s board has cleared a new $1 billion share buyback program. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CSX Corp. is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CSX Corp. is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 59 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX Corp. carries a Zacks Rank #2 which increases the predictive power of ESP.

730,CSX,"We continue to be optimistic, as railroads are witnessing a gradual recovery in Coal shipments. Further, the upsurge in petrochemical shipments has bolstered this industry, thereby leading to earnings improvement.Earnings Trend of the Sector
"
731,CSX,"The broader Transportation sector, of which railroads are a part, reflects a sustainable growth trend. All the sector participants have reported second-quarter results, which have been stable in terms of both beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive earnings surprises) and growth.
"
732,CSX,"The earnings and revenues ""beat ratio” for the quarter was 81.8% for the transportation sector. Total earnings for the companies in this sector rose 11.5%, while revenue growth was 0.5%, both on a year-over-year basis. The sector is expected to register full-year earnings growth of 13.2% in 2014. In terms of revenue expectation, the sector is expected to record 5.3%.
"
733,CSX,"For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our weekly Earnings Trends reports.Second-Quarter 2014 Financial Results
"
734,CSX,"The major companies that have so far reported include CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report). All these companies’ earnings were higher than the year-ago quarter figure and above market expectations as well. Significant growth across all commodity groups and a substantial improvement in operating ratio drove gains across most of the companies, supporting strong earnings this season.Major Contributors in 2014
"
735,CSX,"Intermodal
"
736,CSX,"While most of the other commodities including Automotive and General Merchandize have shown uncertainty in growth for 2014, intermodal volumes are strong. As a result, we expect railroads to significantly focus on intermodal expansion and tap underserved markets with highway-to-rail conversions.
"
737,CSX,"Railroads are now looking to the Mexican market, which is witnessing regulatory reforms, including rail reforms, initiated by President Enrique Peña Nieto to lure foreign direct investments to boost economy. Union Pacific, which serves all six gateways between the U.S. and Mexico, is likely to seek this opportunity to increase its penetration into the Mexican market.
"
738,CSX,"Moreover, there are major investments to look forward to this year involving intermodal growth. These include BNSF Railway Company’s $900 million spending on terminal, line and intermodal expansion and CSX Corp.’s investments in nine projects, Montreal terminal, capacity expansion of its northwest Ohio intermodal hub, and terminal expansion in New Orleans and Savannah.
"
739,CSX,"Norfolk Southern has an investment plan of $487 million on developing intermodal facilities that include six projects. Further, Kansas City Southern is looking forward to its Monterrey to Nuevo Laredo track upgrade and developing its double-track corridor between Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo. It is also expanding its Sanchez Yard and focusing on developments in Interpuerto San Luis Potosi.Crude Shipment
"
740,CSX,"According to Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) reports, crude oil growth may go up to 10 million barrels per day from 2020 to 2040. Further, AAR reported that railroads transported 407,642 carloads of crude oil in 2013, up from 234,000 carloads in 2012. Further information suggests that crude oil accounted for around 1.4% of total Class carloads in 2013, compared with 0.03% in 2008 when the concept of crude by rail started gaining importance.
"
741,CSX,"According to AAR, U.S. crude oil production will increase approximately 60% from 2008 through 2014, representing estimated production of 8.5 million barrels per day by 2014 end. This surge represents an opportunity for revenue accretion, which the railroads are trying to achieve with infrastructural development.
"
742,CSX,"Despite the fact that rail-based crude transportation costs more ($10–$15 per barrel as against $5 a barrel through pipeline), crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail-based transport. This is due to the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale and Permian Basin in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields in Canada.
"
743,CSX,"As a result, inadequate pipeline developments have given rise to higher penetration of railroad transportation for crude oil shipping in these areas. According to AAR’s article ‘Moving Crude Oil by Rail,’ railroads transported over 60% of North Dakota’s crude oil production, which contains the vast majority of new rail crude oil originations.
"
744,CSX,"Further, in terms of safety, railroads offer a better transportation avenue compared to pipeline due to its better spill rate profile. According to U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), spill rate for pipelines are three times higher than rail, based on crude shipments between 2002 and 2012. Additionally, railroad companies are working toward tightening rail safety measures by appealing to federal regulators to phase out old tank cars if these are not upgraded. They are also seeking improved standards for new tank cars.
"
745,CSX,"Major railroad companies like Norfolk are looking for expansion strategies mainly due to development of the energy sector, including the gas exploration projects in Marcellus and Utica shale plays as well as ventures associated with coal and power generation. Over the coming years, the company plans to introduce 32 energy-related projects in 14 states under its service areas.
"
746,CSX,"Canadian Pacific projects crude shipment to reach 140,000 by the end of 2015. In the coming months, we expect railroad companies to increase investment in order to create adequate service capacity for the oil and gas markets. This would lead to exponential growth in crude oil shipments across the rail industry. Consequently, we expect petroleum shipments to remain favorable and emerge as a significant revenue contributor in the long term.Automotive
"
747,CSX,"Mexico is currently a growing market for automotive production and assembly, given the lower cost of production in the region.  We believe that the plants established by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report), Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report), Mazda and Audi would boost auto production in Mexico. The facilities also bode well for automotive shipments. Based on these expansions, finished vehicle production in the Mexican market is expected to reach 3.5 million units in 2015, up about 35% from the 2012 production level.
"
748,CSX,"The growth will provide carriers like Kansas City Southern, which operates across the Gulf of Mexico, ample opportunities to ship raw material to Mexico and return the finished products to the domestic market as well as to the U.S. and Canada. The company projects Automotives shipment to register high double-digit growth in 2014. Increased export activities at the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas will support future growth and enable the opening of auto plants in Mexico this year. In addition, the company expects North American full-year auto sales growth in the range of 4–4.5%.Grain Shipments
"
749,CSX,"Notably, 2014 is expected to be a good year for rail in terms of grain shipment. According to the USDA, agricultural exports in 2014 are forecasted to be $135 billion, down from an estimated $140 billion for 2013. The decline will result from an expected fall in oilseeds and products, grain and feed exports as well as cotton exports. However, since imports are anticipated to rise with gains in horticultural products, sugar and tropical products, we expect agricultural products to have a neutral impact on railroad carloads in the coming year.Coal
"
750,CSX,"Reduced electricity generation from coal turned into a major foe for rail freight carriers. Class I railroads originated 6.2 million coal carloads in 2012, the lowest annual total output since 1993. Coal carloads fell below 6 million in 2013, approximately 4.4% down from 2012 levels according to AAR reports. The decline in coal carloads offset the positive impact of gains from crude oil for the U.S. railroads.
"
751,CSX,"Fraught with issues raised by the regulatory environmental agency, decreasing demand from power plants for electricity generation and the shutdown of coal-fired power plants, there are slim chances for railroads to benefit from this commodity segment, which continues to contribute a large part of railroad tonnage.
"
752,CSX,"However, according to EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, U.S. coal production will increase 4.1% to 1,024 million short tons (MMst), given the higher consumption due to a severe winter that affected early 2014. Coal consumption in 2014 is expected to grow 4.2% to 964 MMst in 2014 due to higher natural gas prices than 2012 levels.
"
753,CSX,"EIA projects coal exports to total 101 MMst in 2014, which is lower than the previous projection of 107 MMst. In 2015, exports can go down even further to 96 MMs owing to weak global economic conditions, slow demand growth rate in the Asian markets, rising coal production in other countries and lower international coal prices.Rail Investments
"
754,CSX,"Investments in development and expansion plans remain crucial when analyzing the prospects for the railroad industry. These capital investments are a union of binaries. While the investments put significant stress on margin performance, forgoing these would dampen growth prospects.
"
755,CSX,"Railway investments are significant, given the evolving supply chain management and the growing importance of airfreight carriers in offering freight transportation services. These investments help railways in getting the required infrastructure to compete effectively in the railroad industry and with other modes of transport like truck, barges and cargo airlines.
"
756,CSX,"Hence, investments in infrastructural projects have been an integral part of the development of railroads. However, this sector, characterized by huge capital influx, has been drawing funds primarily through private financing.
"
757,CSX,"As a result, investment plans when undertaken, can have a considerable impact on the company’s liquidity position and could lead to a highly leveraged balance sheet. According to AAR reports, railroads invest approximately 17% of their annual revenue, which compares with only 3% of average U.S. manufactures’ revenues on capital expenditures.
"
758,CSX,"According to DOT, the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88% by 2035. As a result, Class I carriers would have to increase their investments to meet this growing demand.
"
759,CSX,"It is estimated that railroads would require $149 billion to improve rail network infrastructure within this stipulated period.
"
760,CSX,"Given the growing demand and need to upgrade railroad infrastructure to meet new regulations, deployment of fuel-efficient locomotives, upcoming rules on track sharing, railroad safety and high-speed rail services are demanding that railroad companies infuse more capital in development projects. According to DOT, almost 90% of the railway capacity needs to be upgraded to meet the expected rise in demand level by 2035.  Hence, it is important for railroad companies to balance profitability levels while investing in infrastructural development projects.
"
761,CSX,"Currently, the U.S. railroad industry dominates less than 50% of total freight in America, indicating a huge opportunity for increasing market share. This opportunity can only be exploited by building railroad infrastructure that caters to the varied requirements of shippers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
762,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of opportunities that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function in a seller’s market and have enjoyed pricing power since 1980, when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike prices on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry. As a result of the Staggers Rail Act, railroad companies are hiking their freight rates by nearly 5% per annum on average, while maintaining a double-digit profit margin.Duopolistic Market Structures: Railroad companies have, by and large, gained by practicing discretionary pricing in the freight market. In the prevailing duopolistic rail industry, railroad operators will be able to reap maximum benefits from rising prices when the overall demand grows.
"
763,CSX,"This remains evident from the geographic distribution of markets between major railroads. Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe control the western part of the U.S., while CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern control the eastern part. On the other hand, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National control inter country rail shipment between the U.S. and Canada.CHALLENGES
"
764,CSX,"Despite the above-mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, faces certain external and internal challenges. These are as follows:Capital Intensive Nature: The railroad industry is highly capital intensive that requires continued infrastructural improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Moreover, industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Positive Train Control Mandate: The Rail Safety Improvement Act 2008 (RSIA) has mandated the installation of PTC (Positive Train Control) by Dec 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that involve passenger operations. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued its final rule in Jan 2010, on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs for the rail industry at large.Price Regulations: The pricing practices of U.S. freight railroads comprise the major reason of friction with captive shippers, who move their products through rail and do not have effective alternatives. According to the latest studies by the STB, approximately 35% of the annual freight rail is captive to a single railroad, allowing it monopoly pricing practices.
"
765,CSX,"The unfair pricing power exhibited by the U.S. railroads has prompted intervention of the Congress. The latter intends to implement stringent federal regulations on railroads. So far, the Congress has discussed railroad price regulation but has not passed any new rule yet.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Railroad companies remain concerned about the proposed regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for power plants across 27 states. The proposed guideline –– Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants –– aims at restricting emission of carbon dioxide by new power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The standard proposes new power plants to limit their carbon-dioxide emission to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour.
"
766,CSX,"Power plants fueled by natural gas have already met these standards but the majority of the units using conventional resources like coal are exceeding the set limit, as they emit an average of 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. Railroads, which transport nearly two-thirds of the coal shipment, are most likely to be affected by implementation of the new regulation that could pose a significant threat to utility coal tonnage.

"
768,CSX,"The 2014 Q2 earnings season has gotten off to a relatively positive start, though the small sample of reports at this stage is heavily weighted towards the Finance sector. We will know more in the coming days as companies from outside of Finance post numbers, but it wouldn’t be wrong to say that we have made a reassuring start.
"
769,CSX,"As is the case every reporting cycle, the big banks and brokers dominate the initial Finance sector reports. The handful of big money-center banks carry a lot of weight in the sector as a whole, bringing in roughly 40% of the Finance sector’s total earnings, and set the stage for what to expect from the other sub-industries.
"
770,CSX,"Estimates for the big bank earnings had fallen ahead of the start of the earnings season as it became clear that weakness in the capital markets business will compound the existing mortgage banking woes. There is not much growth as earnings essentially remain flat from the year-earlier level, but results have been coming in marginally better relative to subdued expectations.
"
771,CSX,"The outperformance is coming from a combination of absence of major negatives and modest improvements in core businesses. On the commercial banking side, we are seeing loan growth starting to pick up on the back of improving commercial and industrial loans and momentum in auto loans even as mortgage portfolios continue to decline and the net interest margin backdrop remains difficult. The improvement on the investment banking side is more notable – we saw that with Citi (C  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) as well as Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report). The trading side of the business is still struggling, likely reflecting a secular decline given the changed regulatory environment.
"
772,CSX,"Litigation charges have been, and remain, a recurring part of the big banks’ business model, with the issue particularly acute in the Bank of America case which came out with a surprisingly big charge in Q2 after an even bigger one last quarter. Unlike Citi and J.P. Morgan, they still haven’t come to terms with the Justice Department on what investors hope will be the last piece on the litigation front.
"
773,CSX,"Looking at the Finance sector results thus far, total earnings for the 12 companies that have reported results (out of 80 total in the index or 15% of the sector’s total) are down -1.6% on -2.4% lower revenues, with 83.3% beating earnings and 50% beating revenue estimates.
"
774,CSX,"The table below shows the Q2 earnings scorecard for the component (medium level) industries in the Finance sector. As you can see, the earnings season is almost over for the Major Banks industry, with almost 85% of the industry’s total market capitalization already reported Q2 results. 
"
775,CSX,"The table below compares the results thus far for Finance sector industries with what we saw from the same industries in the preceding quarter and the 4-quarter average. 
"
776,CSX,"The sector’s Q2 results have been better relative to expectations as well as what we saw in the preceding quarter. But overall earnings are essentially flat from the year-earlier level, with the absence of growth sticking out. The net interest margin and capital markets backdrop is unlikely to improve in the current period, but investors will be hoping that the improving signs on the investment banking and loans fronts will pick further and drive earnings growth.Q2 Scorecard (as of July 16th, 2014)
"
777,CSX,"Including this morning’s earnings announcements, we now have Q2 results from 44 S&P 500 members that combined account for 14% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 45 companies are up +5.2% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 68.9% beating EPS estimates and 57.8% coming out with positive revenue surprises.
"
778,CSX,"The two sets of charts below compare the earnings and revenue growth rates for these 45 companies with what these same companies reported in 2014 Q1 and the 4-quarter average and the second chart compares the beat ratios for these companies.Better Growth And More Positive Surprises 
"
779,CSX,"Not to make too big of a deal from the results thus far, but it is nevertheless a good start to the earnings season, particularly relative to the last reporting season. Critics could justifiably argue against the value of comparing anything to Q1, given how weak that period was. We will have to wait and see how the rest of the reporting season unfolds, but some of the commentary from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report) in recent days represents an improvement over what we have been hearing in past.Key Points
"
780,CSX,"The 2014 Q2 earnings season has gotten underway, with results from 45 S&P 500 members already. Total earnings for these companies are up +5.2% on +2.8% higher revenues, with 68.9% beating EPS estimates and 57.8% coming ahead of revenue estimates. This is better performance than we have saw from the same group of companies in Q1.  
"
781,CSX,"The Finance sector is heavily represented in the results thus far. With results from 38.1% of the sector’s total market capitalization already, earnings are down -1.6% on -2.4% lower revenues. Excluding Bank of America, the sector’s total earnings would be flat from the same period last year.
"
782,CSX,"Results from the Technology sector are off to a good start as well, with total earnings for 14.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization that have reported up +23.7% on +7.4% higher revenues. Strong gains at Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) are driving all of the year-over-year growth for the sector. Excluding these two companies, total Tech sector growth at this stage drops -2.2%.  
"
783,CSX,"The composite Q2 picture for the S&P 500, combining the actual results from the 45 companies with estimates for the 455 still to come, is for earnings to down +4.4% from the same period last year, on +1.8% higher revenues and 28 basis points in lower margins. Sequentially, total earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to be up +5.3%, with the overall level of total earnings for the index expected to reach a new all-time quarterly record.
"
784,CSX,"Three sectors – Utilities, Construction and Business Services – are expected to show double-digit growth rates in Q2. The Finance sector was earlier expected to see total earnings decline in Q2, but the picture has improved following the big bank results, with the sector now expected to show growth of +2.3% after the -7.1% decline in Q1.
"
785,CSX,"Total earnings for the Utilities sector, the strongest price performer in the S&P 500 year to date, are expected to be up +10.3% after the +18.0% gain in Q1. The sector was a beneficiary of the frigid weather in Q1, the Q2 growth pace is a bit misleading as it primarily reflects easy comparisons for Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), which we place in the sector.
"
786,CSX,"Total earnings for the Technology sector are expected to be up +6.8% from the period last year on +5.0% higher revenues. This would follow +3.3% earnings growth for the sector on +2.7% higher revenues in Q1.
"
787,CSX,"Beyond Q2, earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to accelerate to +5.6% in Q3 and +9.1% in Q4, with growth in the second half of the year ramping up to +7.4% from the first half’s +2.7% pace. Total earnings are expected to be up +7.1% in 2014 and +11.7% in 2015.

811,CSX,"Consistent with the macro trends, railroads delivered mixed results in the second quarter of the year. According to the rail traffic report for the first six months of 2013, growth in automotive and petroleum products’ shipments was steady, while coal and grain shipments continued to cast a shadow over the rail freight industry.
"
812,CSX,"According to the Association of American Railroads’ (AAR) rail traffic report, cumulative performance by the North American railroads (U.S. , Canadian and Mexico) rose 1.4% year over year at quarter end.

814,CSX,"We rank all the 260-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
815,CSX,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
816,CSX,"The Zacks Industry Rank for the railroad industry is currently #186, implying that the outlook remains Negative on this sector. This highlights a subdued outlook for the industry with a number of near-term headwinds likely to offset the long-term growth opportunities for the industry.Earnings Trend of the Sector
"
817,CSX,"The broader Transportation sector, of which railroads are part, reflects a stable growth trend. So far, 100% of the sector participants have reported second-quarter results, which have been fairly good in terms of both beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and growth.
"
818,CSX,"The earnings ""beat ratio"" was 60%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was 20.0% in the second quarter. Total earnings for the companies in this sector grew 3.5% year over year on 2.7% revenue growth. Although earnings showed modest improvement from 3.3% year-over-year growth in first quarter 2013, revenue growth in the second quarter was lower in comparison to 3.1% year-over-year growth achieved in the first quarter.
"
819,CSX,"The Consensus earnings expectation, pegged at 10.4% for the third quarter 2013 and 12.2% in the subsequent quarter. Overall, the sector is expected to register full-year growth of 10.1%. In terms of revenue expectation, the sector is expected to register 4.5% and 4.8% year-over-year growth in the third and fourth quarters of the year, resulting in an annual growth rate of 4%.Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results
"
820,CSX,"Going by the quarterly performance of the class 1 railroad, we see volume growth from most of these carriers. Most of the carriers including Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) showed modest volume growth.  One of the largest class 1 railroads in North America -- Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) -- registered a decline in volume due to agricultural shipments.
"
821,CSX,"Volume growth aided year-year-year top-line improvement the in all but Norfolk Southern. Despite a modest volume growth, Norfolk Southern was down year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While most of the class 1 railroads generated higher bottom line results beating earnings estimates, Norfolk Southern lagged year over year and failed to meet our expectation.
"
822,CSX,"The primary catalyst to this bottom-line performance for most of the carriers was operational efficiency even in times of low market demand. Rising employee productivity, deployment of fuel-efficient locomotives and undertaking railroad safety measures were some of the key drivers of profitability even in adverse market conditions.
"
823,CSX,"Rail carriers like Canadian Pacific recorded operating ratio improvement of 1,060 basis points year over year. Continued focus on maintaining asset efficiencies, safety measures and increased productivity have been the prime contributors to Canadian Pacific’s success in the second quarter. There are several other near-term growth catalysts in the railroad industry.Rising Contribution of Petroleum Product Shipment
"
824,CSX,"According to the AAR report, rail traffic from petroleum products has seen a whopping 38% growth in the first six months. According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) reports, U.S. crude oil reached 7.5 million barrels per day production in Jul 2013, representing record growth since the last two decades.
"
825,CSX,"On average, EIA expects crude oil growth at around 7.4 million to 8.2 million barrels per day, suggesting a stable market condition.  This growth may go up to 10 million barrels per day over a period of 2020 to 2040, according to EIA reports.
"
826,CSX,"As a result, this surge represents an opportunity for revenue accretion, which the railroads are trying to achieve with infrastructural development. According to industry sources, the role of crude oil as a revenue contributor has grown by leaps and bounds in a four-year span from a mere 3% to 30% of the oil and petroleum products shipment by railroads.
"
827,CSX,"Despite the fact that rail-based crude transportation costs five times more ($10–$15 per barrel), crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail-based transport. This is due to the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale and Permian basin in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields in Canada.
"
828,CSX,"As a result, inadequate pipeline developments have given rise to higher penetration of railroads transportation for crude oil shipping in these areas. According to reports, rail-loading capacity is expected to grow to 200,000 b/d by 2013 for crude oil shipments from Western Canada.
"
829,CSX,"Major railroad companies like Norfolk are seeking expansion strategies fueled mostly by the development of the energy sector, including the gas exploration projects in Marcellus and Utica shale plays as well as ventures associated with coal and power generation. Over the coming years, the company plans to introduce 32 energy-related projects in 14 states under its service areas.
"
830,CSX,"Another railroad company, Canadian Pacific projects crude shipment to reach up to 70,000 oil-tank cars by the year end and move to 140,000 by the end of 2015. In the coming days, we expect railroads to accelerate their investments in order to create adequate service capacity for the oil and gas markets resulting in exponential growth in crude oil shipments across the rail industry. Consequently, we expect petroleum shipments to remain favorable and emerge as a significant revenue contributor in the long term.Automotive
"
831,CSX,"Currently, Mexico is a growing market for automotive production and assembly given the lower cost of production in the region. In the first six months of 2013, auto shipments by rail in Mexico increased 2.7 while in the U.S., auto shipment via rail rose about 3.7%. This growth was largely offset by 5.9% drop in rail auto shipments in the Canadian market.
"
832,CSX,"However, despite a modest first half of the year, industry sources project that auto production are slateed to pick up in the second half, resulting in a record level of 16 million, representing the highest sales figure since the economic downturn in 2008.
"
833,CSX,"We believe upcoming plants by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY), Mazda and Audi would further boost auto production in Mexico. The facilities also bode well for automotive shipments. Based on these proposed expansion plans, finished vehicle production in the Mexican market is expected to reach 3.5 million units in 2015, up about 35% from the 2012 production level. The growth will provide carriers like Kansas City Southern, which operates across the Gulf of Mexico, ample opportunities to ship raw material into Mexico and return the finished products to the domestic market as well as to the U.S. and Canada.Intermodal
"
834,CSX,"The railroad industry is gaining largely from the ongoing conversion of traffic from truckload to rail intermodal. Intermodal is gaining popularity among shippers given its cost effectiveness over truck. On average, railroads are considered 300% more fuel-efficient than trucks, resulting in growing importance of rail intermodal. According to AAR’s rail traffic report, intermodal volume was up 3.7% on container traffic in Canada, which rose 4.4%.
"
835,CSX,"Currently, rail intermodal accounts for over 20% of the railroads’ revenue, second in line after coal. In the coming years, we expect this contribution to only rise given the growing dependence of shippers on intermodal services.Coal
"
836,CSX,"Coal is an important commodity and accounts for over 40% of railroad tonnage. According to AAR traffic reports, coal volumes in North America decreased 4% year over year. According to EIA reports, coal production was 21 million short tons (MMst) in first half 2013, representing a 4% decline from the year-ago corresponding period.
"
837,CSX,"However, with rising natural gas prices and consumption in the electric power plants the second half of the year will see growth in total coal production to 1,016 MMst in 2013. EIA also projects coal production to reach 1,050 MMst in 2014, representing 3.3% growth from the 2013 level.Grain Shipments
"
838,CSX,"Since 2012, the grain market has been experiencing lows due the drought in the Mid-West markets. According the rail traffic report of AAR, North American grain shipment registered a decline of almost 10% in the first six months of 2013, which was largely offset by 64% growth in Mexican grain shipment.
"
839,CSX,"In Aug 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, which states that global corn supplies will be 2.7 million tons lower due to lesser corn production in the U.S., Mexico, Europe, Russia and Serbia. This projection lends an unfavorable trend for railroad grain shipments in the upcoming months.
"
840,CSX,"Further, U.S. corn export outlook also remain subdued on lower production forecast. We believe that the impact of lowered estimates would be felt on railroad shipment as rail freight serves the majority of export shipment in the crop market.Rail Investments
"
841,CSX,"Investment in development and expansion plans remain critical when analyzing railroads prospects. These capital investments are a double-edged sword. While the investments put significant stress on margin performance, forgoing these would result in a loss of growth prospects.
"
842,CSX,"Railway investments are paramount given the evolving supply chain management and increasing role of airfreight carriers in offering freight transportation services. These investments build the required infrastructure needed for railways to stay afloat in a competitive environment not only within the railroad industry but also with other modes like truck, barges and cargo airlines.
"
843,CSX,"As a result, investments in infrastructural projects have been an integral part of railroads development. However, this sector, characterized by huge capital influx has been drawing funds primarily through private financing.
"
844,CSX,"As a result, investment plans when undertaken can have a considerable impact on the liquidity position of the company and may lead to a highly leverage balance sheet. According to AAR reports, railroads invest approximately 17% of their annualized revenue, which compares with only 3% of average U.S. manufactures’ revenue on capital expenditures.
"
845,CSX,"According to the Department of Transportation (DOT), the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88% by 2035. As a result, Class I carriers would have to expedite their investments to meet this growing demand.
"
846,CSX,"It is estimated that railroads would require $149 billion to improve rail network infrastructure within this stipulated period. In respect of current investment requirements, railroads would invest about $24.5 billion in 2013 according to AAR. This figures project an escalating trend when compared with recorded investment of $23 billion in 2012 and $12 billion in 2011 as per AAR.
"
847,CSX,"Given the growing demand and need to upgrade railroad infrastructure to meet new regulations, deployment of fuel-efficient locomotives, upcoming rules on track sharing, railroad safety and high-speed rail services make it mandatory for railroads to infuse more capital on development projects.
"
848,CSX,"According to DOT, almost 90% of the railway capacity needs to be upgraded to meet the expected rise in demand level by 2035. Hence, for railroads it is important to balance profitability levels while investing in infrastructural development projects.
"
849,CSX,"Currently, the U.S. railroad industry dominates less than 50% of total freight in America, indicating a huge opportunity for increasing market share. This opportunity can only be exploited by building railroad infrastructure that caters to the varied requirements of shippers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
850,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of opportunities that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function in a seller’s market and have enjoyed pricing power since 1980, when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike prices on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry.
"
851,CSX,"As a result, of the Staggers Rail Act, railroads are hiking their freight rates by nearly 5% per annum on average, while maintaining a double-digit profit margin.Duopolistic Market Structures: Railroads have by and large gained by practicing discretionary pricing in the freight market. In the prevailing duopolistic rail industry, railroad operators will be able to reap maximum benefits from rising prices when the overall demand grows.
"
852,CSX,"This remains evident from the geographic distribution of markets between major railroads. Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe control the western part of the U.S., while CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern control the eastern part. On the other hand, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National control inter country rail shipment between the U.S. and Canada.CHALLENGES
"
853,CSX,"Despite the above mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, faces certain external and internal challenges. These are as follows:Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructural improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Moreover, industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Positive Train Control Mandate: The Rail Safety Improvement Act 2008 (RSIA) has mandated the installation of PTC (Positive Train Control) by Dec 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that involve passenger operations. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued its final rule in Jan 2010, on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs for the rail industry at large.Price Regulations: The pricing practices of U.S. freight railroads are the major reasons of friction with captive shippers, who move their products through rail and do not have effective alternatives. According to the latest studies by the STB, approximately 35% of the annual freight rail is captive to a single railroad, allowing it monopoly pricing practices.
"
854,CSX,"The unfair pricing power exhibited by the U.S. railroads has attracted congressional intervention for exercising stringent federal regulations on railroads. Congress has discussed railroad price regulation but has not passed any new rule so far.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Railroads remain concerned about the proposed regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for power plants across 27 states. The proposed guideline –– Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants –– aims at restricting emission of carbon dioxide by new power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The standard proposes new power plants to limit their carbon-dioxide emission to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour.
"
855,CSX,"Power plants fueled by natural gas have already met these standards but the majority of the units using conventional resources like coal are exceeding the set limit, as they emit an average of 1,800 pounds of carbon-dioxide per megawatt-hour. Railroads, which transport nearly two-thirds of the coal shipment, are most likely to be impacted by the implementation of the new regulation that could pose a significant threat to utility coal tonnage.
"
856,CSX,"Consistent with the current macroeconomic trends, railroads started the year on a mixed note. Going by the rail traffic report for the first quarter 2013, growth in automotive and petroleum products’ shipments was steady while coal and grain shipments continued to cast a shadow over the rail freight industry.
"
857,CSX,"According to the Association of American Railroads’ (AAR) rail traffic report, cumulative performance of the North American railroads (including U.S., Canadian and Mexican railroads) have fallen 1.5% year over year in the first quarter of the year. The biggest contributor to this decline was grain, which dropped 11%. Coal volumes followed closely, falling around 7%.
"
858,CSX,"Going by the quarterly performance of the class 1 railroad, we see continued lower volumes from most of these carriers. One of the largest class 1 railroads in North America -- Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) -- registered first quarter volume decline of 2% year over year. Another major railroad CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) also reported a similar level of decline in its volumes. Going forward, Canadian counterpart, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) also experienced lackluster growth trend with flat volume growth on a year-over-year basis.
"
859,CSX,"However, railroad operators like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) have shown modest volume growth, mainly driven by the emerging automotive business and rising petrochemical shipments.
"
860,CSX,"Notably, despite mixed carload results, these carriers have mostly generated positive earnings in the reported quarter. The primary catalyst to this bottom-line performance was operational efficiency even in times of low market demand. Rising employee productivity, deploying fuel-efficient locomotives and undertaking railroad safety measures are some of the key drivers of profitability even in adverse market conditions.
"
861,CSX,"Rail carriers like Canadian Pacific recorded operating ratio improvement of 430 basis points year over year. Continued focus on maintaining asset efficiencies, safety measures and increased productivity have been the prime contributors to Canadian Pacific’s success in the first quarter. There are several other near-term growth catalysts in the railroad industry.Rising Contribution of Petroleum Product Shipment
"
862,CSX,"According to the AAR report, rail traffic from petroleum products has seen a whopping 46% growth in the three-month period ended Mar 30. According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) reports, U.S. crude oil exceeded 7 million barrels per day production, representing record growth since the last two decades. Further, in 2013, long-term projections of EIA suggest that this growth may also go up to 10 million barrels per day over a period of 2020 to 2040.
"
863,CSX,"As a result, this surge represents a potential opportunity for revenue accretion, which the railroads are trying to tap with infrastructural development. According to industry sources, the role of crude oil as a revenue contributor has grown by leaps and bounds in a four-year span from a mere 3% to 30% of the oil and petroleum products shipment by railroads.
"
864,CSX,"Despite the fact that rail-based crude transportation costs five times more ($10–$15 per barrel), crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail-based transport. This is due to the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale and Permian basin in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields in Canada.
"
865,CSX,"In 2012, Canadian National Railway, which operates along the Western Canada (Alberta region) to the Gulf Coast, has shipped approximately 30,000 tank cars of volumes of crude oil, while its counterpart Canadian Pacific shipped 53,000 tank cars of crude during the same period. Another giant railroader, BNSF Railroad of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B), which serves the North Dakota region reportedly earned $272 million from crude shipments last year by shipping approximately 100 million barrels of oil.
"
866,CSX,"In the coming days, we expect railroads to accelerate their investment in order to create adequate service capacity for the oil and gas markets. Canadian Pacific projects crude shipment to reach up to 70,000 oil-tank cars by the year-end and move to 140,000 by the end of 2015. This kind of exponential growth in crude oil shipments is taking place across the rail industry. Consequently, we expect petroleum shipments to remain favorable and emerge as a significant revenue contributor in the long term.Automotive
"
867,CSX,"Currently, Mexico is a growing market for automotive production and assembly given the lower cost of production there. As a result, markets sources predict that in the coming years, auto manufacturers are expected add capacity to accelerate manufacturing by 600,000 additional vehicles per annum. In the first three months of 2013, auto shipments by rail in Mexico increased 4.6% while in the U.S., auto shipment via rail rose about 2%. This counterbalanced the 1% drop in rail auto shipments in the Canadian market.
"
868,CSX,"We believe upcoming plants by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY), Mazda and Audi would further boost auto production in Mexico. The facilities would also bode well for automotive shipments. Based on these proposed expansion plans, finished vehicle production in the Mexican market is expected to reach 3.5 million units in 2015, up about 35% from the 2012 production level.
"
869,CSX,"The growth will provide carriers like Kansas City Southern, which operates across the Gulf of Mexico, ample opportunities to ship raw material into Mexico and return the finished products to the domestic market as well as to the U.S. and Canada. The increase in automotive production is also giving rise to new steel plants and processing centers across the company’s service networks. These steel plants are likely to bring opportunities for steel shipments and other related products.
"
870,CSX,"However, in the coming year, the growth can be slightly muted by the onslaught of the fiscal cliff. According to market reports, auto sales may see single-digit growth due to a change in consumer behavior owing to the U.S. tax policy changes. If the situation improves on the macro front, there should not be a cyclical downturn in the way of automotives.Intermodal
"
871,CSX,"The railroad industry is gaining largely from the ongoing conversion of traffic from truckload to rail intermodal. Intermodal is gaining popularity among shippers given its cost effectiveness over truck. On average, railroads are considered 300% more fuel-efficient than trucks, and we believe that intermodal will play an important role in driving the rail industry based on the growing awareness among shippers about its benefits.
"
872,CSX,"Currently, rail intermodal accounts for over 20% of the railroads’ revenue, second in line after coal. In the coming years, we expect this contribution to only rise given the growing dependence of shippers on intermodal services.
"
873,CSX,"Apart from these positives, other factors likely to have a material impact on Railroads’ near-term, top and bottom line growth include:Coal
"
874,CSX,"Coal represents important commodities and accounts for over 40% of railroad tonnage. According to EIA reports, coal production hit lows of 9.9 million short tons (MMst) in first quarter 2013, representing a steep decline from 22.7 MMst in the year-ago quarter. As per AAR reports, coal shipments by rail also continued to decline 8% in the U.S. market. The decline was partially offset by 11% and 9% growth in rail shipments in the Mexican and Canadian markets, respectively.
"
875,CSX,"Domestic coal demand, of which utility coal accounts for approximately 93%, is witnessing persistent declines. Lower natural gas prices imply that gas is largely substituting the demand for utility coal. Additionally, higher stockpile levels have resulted in lower utility coal demand.  Besides, natural gas prices, another important factor that resulted in the decline of coal-powered plants are the environmental issues associated with coal burning.
"
876,CSX,"However, in 2013, coal consumption in the domestic market is expected to grow 7% year over year to 948 MMst and reach up to 957 MMst in 2014 on the back of rising natural gas prices.
"
877,CSX,"On the export front, the scenario remains entirely different. After reaching highs of coal export in 2012 (126MMst), EIA projects U.S. coal exports to decline 15% year over year to 107 MMst in 2013. However, 2014 may show modest improvement with exports of 109 MMst. Factors like an economic overhang in European markets, lower U.S. coal pricing, higher stockpile levels and increased exports from Indonesia as well as a recovery in the Australian mines are the primary reasons for the expected decline.Grain Shipments
"
878,CSX,"Since 2012, the Grain market has been experiencing lows due the drought in the Mid-West markets. The outlook for 2013 is also not encouraging enough to elevate rail freight shipment from its current lull.
"
879,CSX,"According the rail traffic report of AAR, North American grain shipment registered a decline of almost 11% in the first three months of 2013, which was partially offset by 24.6% growth in Mexican grain shipment. In April, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, which states that total U.S. corn demand, will go down by 11.1% from the year-ago level.
"
880,CSX," U.S. corn exports will hit a low of 48.2% from last year with use of ethanol decreasing 9.2%. We believe that the impact of lowered estimates would be felt on railroad shipment as rail freight serves the majority of export shipment in the crop market.Rail Investments

894,CSX,"The fourth quarter earnings season is in full swing and the overall tone of earnings reports thus far has been quite reassuring – we have yet to see the ugly numbers many of us had started fearing in the run up to this reporting season.
"
895,CSX,"The focus today is on Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) report after the close, but in many respects the iPhone maker is not a ‘normal’ company and its results don’t represent the broader corporate world in general or the Technology sector in particular. The strong results from Google (GOOG), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), DuPont (DD) and CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report) on Tuesday are better representations of what’s happening on the earnings front.

897,CSX,"Google’s results are important because of what they tell us about the impact of the secular shift from the desktop to the mobile interface, which besides Google has been concern with other Technology players like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Zynga (Z).
"
898,CSX,"The key takeaway from the company’s report is that the persistent downtrend in its average cost per click, the cost that advertisers pay Google each time a user clicks on an ad, over the last many quarters may have started to stabilize. The company’s cost per click dropped 6% in the fourth quarter from the same period last year, a much lower drop than the 15% year over year drop in the third quarter. Sequentially, it was up 2%. This was the reassuring part of the Google report even as it missed revenue expectations.
"
899,CSX,"The scorecard as of this morning shows fourth quarter earnings reports from 98 S&P 500 companies or 19.6% of the index’s total membership that account for 28.7% of the index’s total market cap. Total earnings for these 98 companies are up 1.7% from the same period last year, with 65.3% beating earnings expectations and a median surprise of +2.7%. Revenues are up 5.2%, with 54.1% of the companies coming ahead of top-line expectations with a median revenue surprise of +0.6%.
"
900,CSX,"This is a better performance than what this same group of 98 companies reported in the third quarter. The composite growth rate for the fourth quarter, where we combine the results of the 98 companies that are out with the 402 still to come, is for a drop of -0.4% in total earnings and an equivalent drop on the revenue side.
"
901,CSX,"Perhaps expectations had fallen enough before the season got underway that coming ahead of them didn’t require much effort. But while that would account for the ratio and magnitude of surprises we are seeing at present, the overall tone of company guidance has not been that bad either.
"
902,CSX,"That said, earnings growth has come down to a crawl and margins remain under pressure. We will have to wait and see how the rest of the earnings season unfolds. What we have seen thus far may not be ugly, but it isn’t necessarily pretty either.RELATED ARTICLESIs Google the New Apple?Apple Preview: Likely to BeatRoundtable Top Picks for the Week of Jan. 21st (VIDEO)
"
903,CSX,"Railroads continue to benefit from the ongoing highway conversion due to their cost effectiveness over truckloads. Currently, rail intermodal services are considered as one of the most fuel-efficient modes of freight transportation, and therefore remain the backbone of the railroad freight business.
"
904,CSX,"Year 2012 was a mixed bag for the U.S. Freight Railroad Industry, though results of the final quarter are just getting underway. Railroads started the year with stellar first quarter results and continued the growth trajectory with a fair second quarter performance in an otherwise subdued economy.
"
905,CSX,"During this period, the industry leveraged its operating capabilities, improving service metrics and improving cost management to compensate the lack of market demand, which resulted in poor freight carloads. Post mid-2012, railroads experienced a setback in their performances despite the growing demand for intermodal services. This was due to the much-anticipated slowdown in coal shipments that hampered growth in other commodities and core pricing.
"
906,CSX,"The current market dynamics of the rail industry remains challenged by a slowing volume trend, mostly of coal. However, the bright spot continues to remain the unparalleled pricing power of this industry over shippers. Based on these factors, earnings growth for railroads operators in the third quarter ranged from negative 22% to positive 18%. Revenues also registered a similar level of fluctuation and ranged between negative 7% and positive 8%.
"
907,CSX,"Operational efficiency of the railroads, as indicated by operating ratio (OR), also plunged. Most the companies reported OR in the low 70s range in the third quarter of 2012 as against their past performances this year that mainly hovered around mid-to-high 60s.
"
908,CSX,"The statistics stated above are based on the quarterly performance of class I railroads. The principal behind considering these railroads as the benchmark is explained below.Railroad Network of Operations
"
909,CSX,"The vast expanse of the U.S. is covered by over 600 freight railroads comprising Class I, regional railroads and local line haul operators. These railroads operate across 150,000 miles of railroad tracks and generate over $50 billion in annual freight revenues.
"
910,CSX,"Based on their operating revenues, freight railroads are categorized into three segments: Class I with annual operating revenues above $346 million, Class II with revenues in the range of approximately $27.8 million to $346 million, and Class III for the rest. Operating revenue based classification standards are provided by the Surface Transportation Board (STB). However, in the light of inflation and the changing macroeconomic environment, revenue benchmarks are subject to alteration.
"
911,CSX,"Currently, there are 9 major railroads in America that are classified under Class I freight railroads. These include Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP  -  Free Report), BNSF Railway, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Ferromex and Kansas City Southern de México (wholly owned subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Railway).
"
912,CSX,"These carriers can be further categorized on the basis of their network of operations. BNSF Railway, Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern have their presence in the U.S. as well as the Canadian Market. Union Pacific operates only in the U.S. with no footprint in Canada or Mexico. It represents the largest freight railroad and operates predominantly in the western part of the U.S. Kansas City Southern Railway operates between U.S. and Mexico, Kansas City Southern de México and Ferromex cater only to the Mexican market.
"
913,CSX,"Although these Class I carriers represent only 1% of the total freight railroads in America, these control more than 90% of freight revenues and employment generated in the industry. Consequently, Class I carriers are good indicators of the performance of the rail industry and are crucial when analyzing railroad trends.The Track Ahead
"
914,CSX,"The year 2013 depicts a mixed picture for the railroads. The U.S. GDP forecast for 2013 is also not very encouraging due to the macroeconomic environment. Going by the latest reports, the growth rate for 2013 is expected to hover around 1.5% to 2%. Uncertainties over the fiscal cliff and perpetuating impacts of the impending tax increases would likely weigh over the country’s economic growth, pulling it down from the 2012 level. Thus, the impacts on railroads will not be any different from the other sectors.
"
915,CSX,"However, railroads do have certain windows of opportunity, which can be banked upon. The key among these is the rise in intermodal alongside petroleum and automotive shipments.Intermodal Runs the Show
"
916,CSX,"The railroad industry is gaining largely from the ongoing conversion of traffic from truckload to rail intermodal. Intermodal is gaining popularity among shippers given its cost effectiveness over truck. On average, railroads are considered 300% more fuel-efficient than trucks, and we believe that intermodal will play an important role in driving the rail industry based on the growing awareness among shippers about its benefits.
"
917,CSX,"Currently, rail intermodal accounts for over 20% of the railroads’ revenue, second in line after coal. In the coming years, we expect this contribution to only rise given the growing dependence of shippers on intermodal services.Petroleum Fuels Growth
"
918,CSX,"Surge in shale oil and natural gas sales catapulted growth in petroleum product shipments. Despite the fact that rail-based crude transportation costs five times more ($10–$15 per barrel), crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail-based transport. This is because of the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like North Dakota's Bakken region.
"
919,CSX,"According to industry sources, the role of crude oil as a revenue contributor has grown by leaps and bounds in a four-year span from a mere 3% to 30% of the oil and petroleum products shipment by railroads. According to the EIA, production for U.S. crude oil is estimated at approximately 6.8 million barrels per day for 2013, representing record growth in two decades.
"
920,CSX,"Natural gas production would, however, experience a slowdown on a pricing uptick. Consumption would register modest growth on a rise in residential, commercial and industrial consumption compensating for the decline in its usage for electricity generation.Automotive a Good Ride
"
921,CSX,"Automotive shipments also form a significant part of rail shipments, as automotive sales are set to recover from their downturn in 2009 when U.S. sales hit their lowest in three decades. In 2012, automotives maintained their growth trajectory with U.S. light vehicle sales ranging between 14 million and 15 million. However, in the coming year, the growth can be slightly muted by the onslaught of the expected fiscal cliff.
"
922,CSX,"According to market reports, auto sales may see single-digit growth due to a change in consumer behavior owing to the U.S. tax policy changes. If the situation improves on the macro front, there should not be a cyclical downturn in the way of Automotives.
"
923,CSX,"Besides all these positive catalysts leading the way into 2013, railroads still have to face a challenging market scenario in Coal.Coal Worries Continue to Linger
"
924,CSX,"Coal represents one of the single-most important commodities and accounts for over 40% of railroad tonnage.
"
925,CSX,"Domestic coal demand, of which utility coal accounts for approximately 93%, is witnessing persistent declines. Lower natural gas prices imply that gas is largely substituting the demand for utility coal. Additionally, higher stockpile levels have resulted in lower utility coal demand.
"
926,CSX,"Over 90% of the total coal production in the U.S. is dedicated to electricity generation. Going by market reports, in 2012, only one-third of the U.S. power plants used coal for electricity generation, a steep decline from approximately 50% in 2008. Natural gas prices, another important factor that resulted in the decline of coal-powered plants are the environmental issues associated with coal burning.
"
927,CSX,"However, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects coal consumption by power plants to grow 6% in 2013 on an anticipated rise in natural gas prices. Over the long term, projections are not very encouraging for the domestic coal business.
"
928,CSX,"According to Annual Energy Outlook 2012, coal-fired power grids in the U.S. would lose 49 gigawatts of capacity through 2020. This represents approximately one-sixth of the existing coal capacity in the U.S. and approximately 5% of total electricity generation nationwide.
"
929,CSX,"On the export front, U.S. coal, mostly metallurgical coal gained significant market traction with the U.S. emerging as a global coal export hub. According to EIA projections, U.S. coal exports experienced its prime time in 2011 with 10% of total coal production, representing the highest point in the past 20 years. EIA remains positive on the U.S. coal export outlook, which is expected to get stronger in the coming days.
"
930,CSX,"However, in 2013, there is a foreseeable decline in coal exports according to EIA. Factors like an economic overhang in European markets, higher stockpile levels and increased exports from Indonesia and a recovery in the Australian mines are the primary reasons for the expected decline. Overall, the expected uptick in the domestic market will likely balance the declines in the export market for coal, representing a flat picture in 2013 in terms of year-over-year growth.OPPORTUNITIES
"
931,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of opportunities that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function in a seller’s market and have enjoyed pricing power since 1980, when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike prices on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry. As a result of the Staggers Rail Act, railroads are hiking their freight rates by nearly 5% per annum on average, while maintaining a double-digit profit margin.Duopolistic Market Structures: Railroads have by and large gained by practicing discretionary pricing in the freight market. In the prevailing duopolistic rail industry, railroad operators will be able to reap maximum benefits from rising prices when the overall demand grows.
"
932,CSX,"This remains evident from the geographic distribution of markets between major railroads. The western part of the U.S. is controlled by Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, while the eastern part is controlled by CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern. On the other hand, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National control inter country rail shipment between the U.S. and Canada.WEAKNESSES
"
933,CSX,"Despite the above mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, faces certain external and internal challenges. These are as follows:Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructural improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Moreover, industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Positive Train Control Mandate: The Rail Safety Improvement Act 2008 (RSIA) has mandated the installation of PTC (Positive Train Control) by December 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that involve passenger operations. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued its final rule in January 2010, on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs for the rail industry at large.Price Regulations: The pricing practices of U.S. freight railroads are the major reasons of friction with captive shippers, who move their products through rail and do not have effective alternatives. According to the latest studies by the STB, approximately 35% of the annual freight rail is captive to a single railroad, allowing it monopoly pricing practices. The unfair pricing power exhibited by the U.S. railroads has attracted congressional intervention for exercising stringent federal regulations on railroads. Congress has discussed railroad price regulation but has not passed any new rule so far.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Railroads remain concerned about the proposed regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for power plants across 27 states. The proposed guideline –– Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants –– aims at restricting emission of carbon dioxide by new power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The standard proposes new power plants to limit their carbon-dioxide emission to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour.
"
934,CSX,"Power plants fueled by natural gas have already met these standards but the majority of the units using conventional resources like coal are exceeding the set limit, as they emit an average of 1,800 pounds of carbon-dioxide per megawatt-hour. Railroads, which transport nearly two-thirds of the coal shipment, are most likely to be impacted by the implementation of the new regulation that could pose a significant threat to utility coal tonnage.Investment Possibilities
"
935,CSX,"Investment by railroad operators for product and service improvement is far ahead of other transportation industries. Very few U.S. industries can match railroad operators with respect to their high capital investment rate. Investments in capacity, innovations and use of several state-of-the-art technologies have led to service improvements and enhanced reliability.
"
936,CSX,"Currently, the U.S. railroad industry dominates less than 50% of total freight in America, indicating a huge opportunity for increasing market share. This opportunity can only be exploited by building railroad infrastructure that caters to the varied requirements of shippers.
"
937,CSX,"According to the Department of Transportation, the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88% by 2035. As a result, Class I carriers would have to expedite their investments to meet this growing demand. It is estimated that railroads would require over $140 billion to improve rail network infrastructure within this stipulated period.
"
938,CSX,"We have a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a Hold rating over the short term (1–3 months) on Union Pacific Corporation, Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific Railway and Kansas City Southern. For Canadian National Railway and CSX Corporation, we have a Zacks #4 Rank, implying a short-term Sell rating.
"
939,CSX,"With inflation not much of a concern for investors or the Fed, this morning’s CPI reading is essentially a non-event. Favorable Industrial Production and homebuilder sentiment index readings coming out a little later may give some traction to today’s trading action. But the real backdrop for today’s market is the real start of the third quarter earnings season, with 35 companies reporting results today including 16 S&P 500 members.
"
940,CSX,"We will have a better feel for the Tech space outlook after results from Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) after the close today, but the overall tone of earnings reports this morning is on the positive side.
"
941,CSX,"We got solid earnings and revenue beats from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), with Goldman also raising its dividend. Coke (KO  -  Free Report) came in-line with expectations, with case volume weakness in the Asia-Pacific region (particularly China) and negative currency effects offsetting volume gains elsewhere. UnitedHealth (UNH  -  Free Report) beat on improved margins, offsetting top-line weakness, in a potentially positive sign for the healthcare group as a whole.
"
942,CSX,"Zacks ESP or ‘Earnings Surprise Prediction,’ our proprietary leading indicator of positive earnings surprise, had correctly predicted the positive earnings surprises from Goldman this morning and Gannett (GCI) on Monday. For the Intel and CSX (CSX  -  Free Report) reports coming out after the close today, the Zacks ESP is indicating negative surprises.
"
943,CSX,"We will know more about this morning’s reports after managements' discussion of the business outlook on the earnings calls. And if managements' guidance is as reassuring as these results, then the earnings picture may not be that dire.
"
944,CSX,"But it’s too early to draw any firm conclusions about this earnings season from the admittedly small sample of results we have seen thus far. At stake are estimates for the fourth quarter and beyond, which seem to be unusually high at this stage. We will soon find out one way or the other.RELATED ARTICLESMore Mixed Economic News (VIDEO)What Ails the Chinese Economy?Retail Sales, China Provide Good Backdrop
"
945,CSX,"Despite the uncertainties surrounding the demand for U.S. coal, railroads delivered stellar first quarter results. Contrary to market expectations, freight railroads emerged unscathed by coal's woes, with most of the big players surpassing their earnings estimates.
"
946,CSX,"According to market reports, North American Class I railroads registered growth of approximately 29% in their first quarter earnings. Strong pricing coupled with commodities volume, effective cost management and improved rail efficiency helped U.S. railroads to continue their strong performances.
"

Consequently, they represent the performance indicators of the rail industry and are therefore crucial for analyzing railroad trends.First Quarter Flashback
"
953,CSX,"As mentioned earlier, railroads’ performance in the first quarter of the year was well above market expectation. The Class I carriers made a positive head start that rose above the negative sentiments hovering around them.
"
954,CSX,"Beginning with Union Pacific, the company delivered adjusted earnings of $1.79 per share, up 38.8% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue climbed 16% year over year to a record $5.1 billion.
"
955,CSX,"CSX Corporation reported earnings of 43 cents, up 23% year over year. Revenues registered an uptrend with almost 6% growth year over year. Norfolk Southern’s earnings grew 25.6% to $1.13 per share. Revenue also grew substantial from $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Kansas City Southern delivered 29.3% earnings growth to 75 cents per share and total revenue of $547.5 million, up 12.1% year over year.
"
956,CSX,"The same story goes for the top Canadian railroads, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific. Canadian National’s adjusted earnings in the first quarter shot up 31% to C$1.18 backed by revenue gains of 13% year over year to C$2,346 million. Canadian Pacific reported a robust quarter with a whopping 310% increase to 82 Canadian cents per share from 20 Canadian cents earned a year ago.Primary Catalysts
"
957,CSX,"According to Association of American Railroads (AAR) reports, North American railroad traffic (including U.S. and Canada) dropped 1%, primarily due to an 8.6% decline in coal volumes. However, Intermodal volumes were up 3.3%.
"
958,CSX,"Apart from coal, agricultural & food products (down 3.7% in the first quarter) and chemicals (down 4.5%), most of the product lines aided the first quarter results.
"
959,CSX,"Railroads benefited the most from petroleum products and automotive shipments that grew 24% and 16.6%, respectively, in the reported quarter. Trailing behind were metals (comprising iron and steel products, ores and scrap) and nonmetallic minerals (includes frac sand, gravels, stone glass products) shipments that grew 9.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Forest products -- constituting wood, lumber, pulp and paper -- also went up 3.1% year over year.
"
960,CSX,"Despite the modest growth in carloads, railroads managed to showcase an outperforming quarter due to the current momentum in freight pricing and fuel surcharges. The upsurge in the rail Intermodal services driven by a demand shift from the truckload market is allowing railroads to gain through higher freight pricing.
"
961,CSX,"Additionally, fuel surcharges allow railroads to pass on higher fuel expenses to shippers and continue to aid revenue. As a result, railroads are witnessing solid yield improvements despite the lacking strength in volumes.Coal – Concern or Opportunity
"
962,CSX,"As speculations continue to surround coal, it becomes even more difficult to estimate the exact implications of this product on the U.S. railroads. Although current market reports provide a murky road ahead for coal shipments, we believe there are some windows of opportunity that can, to some extent, pull back declining coal carloads.
"
963,CSX,"Coal, representing one of the single-most important commodities, accounts for over 40% of railroad tonnage. Coal gained significant market traction given the emerging position of the U.S. as the global coal export hub. Global supply constraints for export coal due to disruptions in Australia and the growing demand for coal in Asian countries for steel manufacturing elevated the market position of the U.S. coal exports.
"
964,CSX,"However, coal volumes registered a setback from the second half of 2011, given lower coal production by the U.S. producers. Following this, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected a lower coal production outlook for 2012.
"
965,CSX,"According to the EIA report, U.S. coal exports are expected to decline to an estimated 100 million short tons (MMst) in 2012 from 107 MMst in 2011. The decline is primary related to the recoveries in Australian mining activities. Further, in the domestic market, utility coal which accounts for approximately 93% of the domestic coal demand is witnessing persistent falls.
"
966,CSX,"Lower natural gas prices are largely substituting the demand for utilities. Additionally, higher stockpile levels and warmer winter weather also resulted in lower utility coal demand.
"
967,CSX,"However, in 2013, the EIA projects that electricity generation from coal will increase 7%, as coal prices would moderate while natural gas prices would gain some upward momentum. The EIA also projects coal’s share in the U.S. electricity generation to increase 40.9% in FY13 from 39.3% in FY12.
"
968,CSX,"Railroads along with shippers are making efforts to reduce transportation cost to make U.S. coal more economical for the domestic market. As a result, declines in domestic volumes are expected to moderate. Further, the post summer period this year may mark some improvements in the utilities volume given the expected rise in electricity generation and replenishment of stock piles.
"
969,CSX,"Going forward, utility coal exports are gaining momentum with demand mostly from Asian and European markets. Many developing countries are in the process of building electricity grids that are expected to bode well for U.S. utility coal.Other Freight Commodities
"
970,CSX,"Apart from coal, grain shipments are also expected to pose near-term headwinds for the railroads. U.S. grain exports are trending downward mostly due to higher supplies from the emerging markets and corn supplies mainly through truck to ethanol facilities.
"
971,CSX,"Additionally, higher prices of U.S. grain also limit exports to the global market. The strength in U.S. dollar and the economic slowdown due to European debt crisis are also important factors adversely affecting the U.S. agriculture and commodities markets.
"
972,CSX,"However, petroleum products are one of the major growth areas that railroads can benefit from over the near term.  According to AAR reports, petroleum product volumes soared 43% year over year in April 2012 given higher crude oil shipments.
"
973,CSX,"Further, North American auto production is estimated to be over 14 million vehicles this year, up by almost 13% from 2011. The projection implies greater profits for the railroads. According to AAR, railroads registered 17.5% higher carloads in Automotives in April compared to the year-ago month.
"
974,CSX,"Additionally, low natural gas prices would generate new ethane-based production units, resulting in more chemicals and plastics shipments. The chemicals business retains competitive pricing by the U.S. chemical producers, which have in turn benefited from the boom in shale drilling activities and lower natural gas prices.OPPORTUNITIES

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued its final rule in January 2010, on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs for the rail industry at large.
"
978,CSX,"According to the FRA, PTC installation would require over $5 billion in investment by the freight rail industry through 2015. Financial benefits from PTC can only be seen over a period of 20 years, as savings of up to $440–$674 million. As of January 2012, Congress was trying to extend the PTC deadline beyond 2015 in order to bring some respite to U.S. railroads.Price Regulations: The pricing practice of the U.S. freight railroads is a major cause of friction with captive shippers which move their products through rail and do not have effective alternatives. Per the latest studies by STB, approximately 35% of the annual freight rail is captive to a single railroad, allowing it monopoly pricing practices. The unfair pricing power exhibited by the U.S. railroads has summoned congressional intervention for exercising stringent federal regulations on the railroads. Congress has discussed railroad price regulation but has not passed any new rule so far.
"
979,CSX,"In February 2012, shippers forwarded a joint letter to the Congress appealing to support Amendment 1591 to the Surface Transportation bill to abolish freight rail industry exemptions from the U.S. antitrust laws. The amendment, proposed by Senator Herb Kohl, would create healthier competition among freight rail shippers and stop unfair pricing polices. We believe that any amendment by the Congress or STB on regulating pricing policies calls for a serious threat to railroads, especially when the economic uncertainty is hurting volume growth and pricing has become a dominant factor for generating revenues.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Railroads remain concerned about the proposed regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for power plants across 27 states. The proposed guideline –– Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants –– aims at restricting emission of carbon dioxide by new power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The standard proposes new power plants to limit their carbon-dioxide emission to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour. Power plants fueled by natural gas have already met these standards but the majority of the units using conventional resources like coal are exceeding the set limit, as they emit an average of 1,800 pounds of carbon-dioxide per megawatt-hour. Railroads, which transport nearly two-third of the coal shipment, are most likely to be impacted by the implementation of the new regulation that could pose a significant threat to utility coal tonnage.Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Moreover, industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Unionized Labor: Most of the railroad operator’s employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers’ Conference Committee. In the railroad industry, negotiations generally take place over a number of years. Failure to negotiate amicably could result in strikes by the workers, resulting in loss of business.Investment Possibilities
"
980,CSX,"Investment by railroad operators for product and service improvement is far ahead than other transportation industries. Very few U.S. industries can match the railroad operators with respect to high capital investment rate. Investments in capacity, innovations and use of several state-of-the-art technologies led to service improvements and enhanced reliability.
"
981,CSX,"Currently, the U.S. railroad industry dominates less than 50% of total freight in America, indicating a huge opportunity to increase market share. This opportunity can only be capitalized through building railroad infrastructure that caters to the diversified requirements of the shippers.
"
982,CSX,"According to the Department of Transportation, the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88% by 2035. As a result, Class I carriers would have to expedite their investments to meet this growing demand. It is estimated that railroads would require $39 billion or approximately $1.4 billion per year of investments to bring infrastructure improvements with the rail network.
"
983,CSX,"AAR claims that freight rail transporters together invested a significant amount of $44 billion in the previous two years for railroad track expansion and maintenance. In recent years, railroads have been investing roughly 17% of their annual revenue on capital expenditures. Major freight railroads are expected to invest approximately $13 billion in capital expenditures in 2012. Additionally, these railroads also expect to add headcount over 15,000 this year to meet operational requirements.
"
984,CSX,"Currently, we maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation on Union Pacific Corporation, Norfolk Southern, CSX Corp., Canadian National, Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern. For the short term (1–3 months), these stocks hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) except for Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report), which retains a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).
"
985,CSX,"The market appears to be least concerned about Greece’s inability to reach a restructuring deal with its private creditors. The Greek government assured that it did not see its talks collapsing. This, coupled with a successful German bond auction today, should help stocks sustain the positive momentum of the last couple of weeks. We have a relatively quiet day today on the economic and earnings fronts, but the rest of this week brings a host of material reports.
"
986,CSX,"On the economic front this week, we have the Fed meeting and the fourth quarter 2011 GDP report on deck. The Fed is not expected to change its near-zero interest rate policy, but this first meeting of 2012 will usher in a new phase of transparency for the Central Bank. In addition to the customary Fed statement after the meeting and the quarterly Bernanke news conference, this time will bring Fed Funds rate forecasts by the individual Fed districts through 2015.
"
987,CSX,"We will also get when the individual Fed districts see the FOMC starting to raise interest rates again. This is a significant development as it likely will show that the central bank districts expect near-zero interests for longer than the current FOMC policy of through 2013 only.
"
988,CSX,"It will be interesting to see how treasury yields will respond to this expected disclosure. Will this result in greater flattening of the yield curve, particularly given growing expectations of another round of quantitative easing despite the recent favorable run of economic reports?
"
989,CSX,"The Fed aside, this week also brings the first read on the fourth quarter GDP numbers, with the expectation for the growth rate to be in the 3% range. Short of a significant higher or lower number relative to that expectation, the market will likely not take much note of the release.
"
990,CSX,"Inventory building will be a positive contributor to growth this time around after shaving off more than a percentage point in the third quarter, while personal consumption expenditures likely accelerated from the previous quarter’s 1.7% pace. It will be interesting to see how businesses spent their money in the quarter as all indicators are pointing to a deceleration on that front. The fourth quarter increase notwithstanding, the consensus expectation is for growth  to moderate in the first quarter of 2012 to the 2% level.
"
991,CSX,"In other economic news, we will get the December Durable Goods and New Home Sales numbers on Thursday. We will also get the weekly Jobless Claims data this Thursday, which experienced a sharp drop last week, reversing the preceding week’s rise. Notwithstanding the complications with seasonal adjustments at this time of the year that most likely lay behind the sharp volatility in this series over the last two weeks, there is no denying the favorable momentum on the labor market front.
"
992,CSX,"Not to forget that we are in the midst of the fourth quarter reporting season. With less than a fifth of the reports already in, the growth numbers are a lot weaker than we have become accustomed to in recent quarters. But there is little surprise in that as expectations had already come down ahead of the reporting season. In fact, the earnings reports thus far, particularly in the financial sector which forms the bulk of the early reports have been better than expected.
"
993,CSX,"In today’s relatively quite earnings releases, we got roughly in-line earnings from Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) on strong top-line gains. In other news, Apache Corp (APA  -  Free Report), a major oil and natural gas E&P player, is buying privately held Cordillera Energy for $2.85 billion. The deal gives Apache acreage position in the Granite Wash region that straddles the Texas-Oklahoma border. Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report) report after the close today.RELATED ARTICLESWeak Start to Earnings SeasonTime for Stocks to Press Pause?Is the Housing Market Returning to ""Normal""?

"
995,CSX,"Earnings season will be in full swing this week. 422 firms are scheduled to report, and 117 of those will be members of the S&P 500. By the end of the week we should have a very good handle on just how weak or strong this earnings season will be.
"
996,CSX,"The firms reporting next week read like a who’s who of American industry.  They.include: Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing (ADP), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Boeing  (BA  -  Free Report), Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), CSX (CSX  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), Colgate Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report), Conoco Phillips (COP - Analyst Report) and DuPont (DD) – and that is just in the first four letters of the alphabet!
"
997,CSX,"It will also be a moderate week for economic data.  Things will be slow early in the week, with no major news until Wednesday, when we get the Pending Home Sales data and the Fed releases the policy statement following their meeting. Thursday will be the busiest day of the week with New Orders for Druable Goods and New Home Sales, along with the regular weekly Initial Jobless Claims data. The biggest report of the week, however, is on Friday, when we get the first look at GDP growth in the fourth quarter.Monday

"
1000,CSX,"Pending home sales are expected to have declined 3.0% after a 7.3% surge in November. However, given the high number of contract cancellations recently due to people unable to get mortgages, and due to appraisals coming in lower than expected, this number has been less accurate than in the past in predicting existing home sales.
"
1001,CSX,"The Fed is expected to keep the Fed Funds rate in the 0-0.25% range it has been locked in since December 2008. There is a chance that they will announce another round of quantitative easing, but the probability is less than 50% they will do so. The post-meeting statement will be closely examined for any clues as to the direction the Fed will be taking.Thursday
"
1002,CSX,"Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance plunged by 52,000 to 352,000. However, that shocking drop came after a surprisingly large rise the week before. My sense is that they were both flukes, but in offsetting directions. The consensus seems to agree and is looking for claims to rise to 375,000 which would be just a little bit below the average of the last two weeks. These past two weeks illustrate just how volatile week-to-week numbers can be, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on (at 379,000 last week). Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.
"
1003,CSX,"Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 215,000 to 3.432 million. That is down 518,000, or 13.1% from a year ago. The consensus is looking for a rise to 3.550 million. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims rose by 105,000 to 3.460 million last week but are down 1.192 million, or 24.5%, over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 7.887 million. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.762 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end at the start of March. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
1004,CSX,"New Orders for Durable Goods are expected to rise 2.0% for December, on top of a 3.8% surge in November. While those are simply fantastic numbers, they are also a bit deceptive. Most of the strength is from the extremely volatile and lumpy Transportation Equipment segment, specifically from orders for jetliners. Since they are such big-ticket items, a few orders here and there can swamp the rest of the numbers. If Transportation Equipment is excluded, orders are expected to be up 0.7% on top of a 0.3% rise in November. That’s still a pretty healthy growth rate, but nowhere near as spectacular as the headline number would suggest.
"
1005,CSX,"New Home Sales are expected to rise to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 322,000, up 2.2% from the November rate. While it is nice to see new home sales picking up, it is still an extremely low rate. The 20 lowest months in the history of New Home Sales data (back to 1963) have all been in the last 20 months, and if the consensus is right, it will make it 21 out of the last 21 months. Recently, though, the housing data has been coming in a bit better than expected, particularly when it comes to single family homes. New home sales are what have powered every single previous post-war recovery. The extraodinarily low level of new home sales is one of the most important reasons that this recovery has been relatively slow. If housing does get into gear in 2012, U.S. economic growth is likely to be much higher than most people expect. The key word in that last sentence, though, is “if.”

"
1007,CSX,"We get the “Big Kahuna” of economic reports: GDP for the fourth quarter. This will be the first of three realeases of the data, which is subject to significant revisions in the later releases. The pattern of accelerating economic growth is expected to continue, with growth of 3.1% growth expected. That is up from 1.8% in the third quarter, 1.3% on the second and just 0.4% in the first quarter. The composition of the growth can be just as important and interesting as the overall level. Growth that simply comes from inventory accumulation is not as bullish as growth that comes from businesses investing in new plant and equipment, for example. We will provide a complete breakdown, not just of the level of growth in the the quarter, but where in the economy it came from.
"
1008,CSX,"The Univeristy of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index is expected to edge up to 74.2 from 74.0. It has been moveing up in recent months but is still at a low level. However, since what consumers say in the survey is often very different than what they actually do, I think this is one of the most overrated economic indicators around.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
1009,CSX,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.

1012,CSX,"The earnings parade continues even as the market tries to come to terms with the negative Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) surprise and waits for the expected weekend deal out of Europe. We also have economic data this morning about September CPI and Housing Starts, but they will likely have less traction in today's market given the focus on earnings and Europe.
"
1013,CSX,"The September CPI number was largely inline with expectations, both on the 'headline' as well as 'core' basis. Given the recent pullback in commodity prices and the continued slack in the broader economy, inflation will likely have less staying power than would otherwise be the case. However, persistent 'hot' CPI readings will make it difficult for Fed Chair Bernanke to rally all FOMC members behind him as we have seen in recent meetings. The Fed dissenters have been questioning the utility of new easing measures in helping the recovery, but the fear of inflation has been a big reason for their opposing views.
"
1014,CSX,"In the major earnings reports this morning, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) beat expectations with the help of the same debit valuation adjustment (DVA) that has become a recurring theme in bank earnings reports this quarter. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) also came ahead of earnings and revenue expectations and raised guidance. CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report), the railroad operator, was able to barely meet expectations, as price increases and fewer shares outstanding due to stock buybacks helped offset tepid volume growth due to soft demand.
"
1015,CSX,"The moderately positive earnings report from Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) was overshadowed by the decision to split the company into two stand-alone entities -- one focused on medical products and the other on pharmaceuticals. These corporate splits have become all the rage in recent days, with a steady stream of announcements from all across corporate America. The list is quite long, but some of the more notable companies that have gone this way in the recent past include Conoco (COP  -  Free Report), Marathon (MRO  -  Free Report), Sara Lee (SLE) and McGraw-Hill (MHP).
"
1016,CSX,"We had positive earnings and revenue surprise from Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) after the close on Tuesday, while Apple did the unthinkable, coming up short. The rare miss likely reflected delayed iPhone sales ahead of the launch of a new model, but will be a hit to investor confidence which had started to believe the company incapable of doing anything wrong. We have American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) reporting after the close today.
"
1017,CSX,"The earnings season is proceeding as expected, with no major negative surprises (Apple notwithstanding). Continuation of this trend over the coming days will help build market confidence in current estimates for the coming quarters, which will be a big positive for stocks. Now if only Europe comes through on its promises, then we may have the makings of a solid rally into the closing days of this year. RELATED ARTICLESMarket with Plenty to Chew OnMore Confident HomebuildersCritical Week for the Market
"
1018,CSX,"The U.S. Freight Railroads have been able to keep up the momentum despite facing unusual weather conditions and an extremely volatile U.S. economy. Solid commodities volumes, healthy demand for coal and improved efficiencies are helping the railroads to continue their strong performance.
"
1019,CSX,"The railroads are also benefiting from the significant rise in the cost base of the trucking industry. This combination of cyclical and secular trends is helping the railroads carry ever more cargos, which is helping them to take the current economic uncertainties in the stride.
"
1020,CSX,"Fiscal 2010 was a turnaround year for the railroad industry after the downturn in 2009 due to the Great Recession. In 2011, the railroads are benefiting from strong pricing gains reflecting yield improvements and higher fuel surcharges. Importantly, industry players remain confident that this performance momentum remain in place in the back half of the year and into next year.
"
1021,CSX,"Driving this railroad outperformance are four key factors:
"
1022,CSX,"(1) Increasing worldwide demand for coal in power generation. Utility coal volumes are expected to recover year over year, mainly due to an increase in electricity generation. This trend became more visible after the devastating earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, resulting in a serious nuclear power crisis in that country. Coal exports to Europe and other Asian countries are also likely to remain buoyant in the near future.
"
1023,CSX,"(2) The U.S. industrial production is expected to continue growing 2011, though the pace of expansion may moderate a bit given the economic uncertainty. This is helping drive the growth of intermodal traffic, which mainly consists of containers and trailers.
"
1024,CSX,"In the second-quarter 2011, core pricing of railroads improved 4.5% to 5% year over year. This strong pricing environment was primarily driven by a significant improvement of Intermodal segment pricing. We believe rail transportation companies will continue to enjoy pricing power in the near to medium term.
"
1025,CSX,"(3) The positive trend in the U.S. export performance works to the railroad industry’s advantage as it helps the industry carry more freight and gain market share. At present, the U.S. railroad industry commands less than 50% of total freight in America, which represents a key opportunity for the industry to increase market share.
"
1026,CSX,"In fact, the railroad industry is gaining market share from the trucking industry. The truck tonnage volume inched down 1.3% in July 2011, mainly attributable to driver shortage, massive rise in fuel costs, and highway congestion.
"
1027,CSX,"(4) The U.S. government has decided to scale back its ruling that makes it mandatory for freight rails to install new anti-collision technology called “Positive Train Control. This government decision will save approximately $500 million for the industry, resulting in a roughly 20%-25% free cash flow boost for most industry operators.Freight Railroad an Economic Growth Driver
"
1028,CSX,"Freight rail is a “derived demand industry -- rail services are tied to the demand for the products that railroads haul. Rail traffic, therefore, acts as a solid barometer for the overall health of the economy. Several railroad operators have expressed their confidence that growth rate of business volume in 2011 will exceed the U.S. GDP and industrial production growth rate. Similarly, core pricing gain in 2011 will also exceed inflation.
"
1029,CSX,"Several positive trends are helping the U.S. freight railroad operators to significantly increase their capital expenditures. Association of American Railroads (AAR), the main trade body of the industry, reported that the freight railroads will spend a record high of $12 billion in 2011 for manpower recruitment, installation of new rail tracks and other capital projects. The railroad industry is expected to hire 10,000 new employees in 2011.
"
1030,CSX,"Investments by railroad operators for product and service improvements are far ahead of the other transportation industries. Very few U.S. industries can match with the railroad operators with respect to high capital investment rate. Fiscal 2010 witnessed a record breaking $10.7 billion capital investment, which is now expected to grow by another 12%-13% in 2011. Investments in capacity, innovations and use of several state-of-the-art technologies led to service improvements and enhanced reliability.
"
1031,CSX,"Greater overall freight volume across the freight railroad networks, massive surge in coal and automotive shipments, significant increase in oil deliveries from the Bakken area of North Dakota to refineries on the Gulf Coast, and a sharp rebound in many end-markets are expected to fuel the future growth of the Railroad industry. Nevertheless, despite this impressive growth, some near-term concerns still persist.Carload Volume Yet to Reach the Pre-Recession Level
"
1032,CSX,"Although business volume increased in the last year, this is still below the pre-recession 2008 level. The current state of economic uncertainty in the U.S. and abroad may keep railroad’s top-line growth under pressure in the near future, with most sectors unable to fully recover from the Great Recession. 
"
1033,CSX,"Railroads are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. For the week ending August 6, 2011, the AAR reported that carloads moved by the U.S. railroads inched down 1.2% year over year.Legal Tussles
"
1034,CSX,"For a long time, the pricing practices of the U.S. freight railroads have been contested by captive shippers, who ship their products through railroads and do not have effective shipping alternatives. These companies are predominantly from the electric utilities, chemical, agricultural and mining sectors.
"
1035,CSX,"Congress has discussed railroad price regulations, but so far has not approved any new rules. In June 2011, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that regulates railroads, discussed the issue in detail. A regulatory response to the industry’s pricing practices will be a net negative for the major freight rail carriers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1036,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of attributes that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function effectively in a seller’s market enjoying pricing power since 1980, when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike price on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry. As a result of the Staggers Rail Act, the railroads have been hiking their freight rates on an average of nearly 5% per annum, which is helping them maintain strong profit margins.Competitive Advantage: From the customers’ point of view, rail transport is cheaper and fuel-efficient than truck and ship transport. As a result, railroads are gaining market share from other means of transport. Several truck operators went bankrupt during the peak recessionary period that helped railroads to become the default freight transporters for mid-to-long distances.Technical Superiority: Overall, investment by railroad operators for product and service improvement is far ahead than other transportation industries. Investments in capacity, innovations and use of several state-of-the-art technologies have led to service improvements and enhanced reliability. AAR claims that freight rail transporters together invested a significant amount of $42 billion in the previous two years for railroad track expansion and maintenance.
"
1037,CSX,"Currently, we remain Neutral on Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report). However, due to strong growth momentum of the industry, our long-term view remains positive for all these Class 1 freight railroad operators.WEAKNESSES
"
1038,CSX,"Despite the above mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, also has some structural weaknesses. These are as follows:Government Regulations: Railroads are subject to the ratification of laws by Congress that could increase regulation of the industry. A 2010 report presented by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee stated that the discretionary pricing power enjoyed by the Class I freight rail transport companies are putting excessive pressure on freight customers.
"
1039,CSX,"The Senate Commerce Committee headed by Sen. John D. Rockefeller has opined that the railroads have become financially stable and a higher transportation rate is actually impacting household budgets. It remains to be seen how the railroad industry would maintain current growth levels if any adverse changes occur related to its discretionary pricing policy.Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in the credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Unionized Labor: Most of the railroad operator’s employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers’ Conference Committee. In the railroad industry, negotiations generally take place over a number of years. Failure to negotiate amicably could result in strikes by the workers resulting in loss of business.
"
1040,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) continues to deliver exceptionally strong results as it benefits from a modestly improved economy and a relatively high degree of operating leverage.
"
1041,CSX,"Consensus estimates for both 2011 and 2012 have been moving after the company reported better than expected results for the second quarter. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
1042,CSX,"CSX has also been aggressively raising its dividend over the last several years and currently yields a solid 1.9%. Valuation looks attractive too with shares sporting a PEG ratio of 0.8.
"
1043,CSX,"Second Quarter Results
"
1044,CSX,"CSX Corporation reported strong second quarter results on July 13. Earnings per share came in at 46 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. It was a 28% increase over the same quarter in 2010.
"
1045,CSX,"Revenue rose 13% to $3.019 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.978 billion. The company saw increases across each of its major markets due to higher pricing and volumes.
"
1046,CSX,"Operating income was up 21% year-over-year to a record $926 million as the operating ratio improved 190 basis points to 69.3% thanks to operating leverage.
"
1047,CSX,"Outlook
"
1048,CSX,"The vast majority of analysts revised their earnings estimates higher for both 2011 and 2012, sending the stock to a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). Based on current consensus estimates, earnings are projected to grow 29% in 2011 and 17% in 2012.
"
1049,CSX,"Consensus estimates have been consistently climbing higher over the last several months as CSX has delivered 10 consecutive positive earnings surprises:
"
1050,CSX,"Dividend
"
1051,CSX,"CSX has been aggressively raising its dividend over the last several years, including a 38% hike in May. Since 2005, the company has raised it at an average annual clip of 39%.
"
1052,CSX,"It currently yields a solid 1.9%.
"
1053,CSX,"Valuation
"
1054,CSX,"Despite more than a 40% increase in its share price over the last year, valuation still looks very reasonable for CSX. The stock trades at just 14.2x forward earnings, a significant discount to the industry average of 19.2x.
"
1055,CSX,"Its PEG ratio is an attractive 0.8 based on a 5-year EPS growth rate of 18.1%.
"
1056,CSX,"The Bottom Line
"
1057,CSX,"With a modestly improving economy and high degree of operating leverage, CSX is well-positioned to continue delivering strong EPS growth over the next few years. As estimates continue to rise, CSX looks attractively priced at just 14.2x forward earnings. A rapidly rising dividend doesn't hurt either.

1059,CSX,"Early indications are painting a rosy picture for the U.S. Freight Railroads in 2011. In the first quarter of 2011, the U.S. rail carload volume was up nearly 5.3% compared with the prior-year quarter.
"
1060,CSX,"A recent report of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the main trade body of the U.S. Freight Railway industry, stated that the first quarter 2011 rail carload volume, excluding grain and coal, is up nearly 7.9% to 4.6 million compared with the prior-year quarter. This was the second best first quarter, after a rise of 9.3% last year.
"
1061,CSX,"Fiscal 2010 was a turnaround year for the railroad industry after a huge downturn in 2009 due to the recession. The industry has achieved this result despite a severe winter storm during this period. Importantly, industry players are now more confident that this performance will get further momentum during the rest of 2011.
"
1062,CSX,"Excluding coal and grain, rail cars generally ship all those materials that are required as inputs for industrial production. As such, the significant growth in rail car volumes is indicative of broader macro-economic improvement in the U.S. economy.
"
1063,CSX,"There are four reasons for this strong performance by the railroad operators:
"
1064,CSX,"(1) Increasing worldwide demand for coal in power generation. Utility coal volumes are expected to recover year over year mainly due to increase in electricity generation. Recently, this trend becomes more visible after the devastating earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, which resulted in serious nuclear power crisis in that country. Coal exports to Europe and other Asian countries are also likely to remain buoyant in the near future.
"
1065,CSX,"(2) Industrial production in the U.S. is expected to grow more than 3% in 2011. Intermodal traffic, mainly consisting of containers and trailers, is growing at a whopping rate. In the first quarter of 2011, intermodal shipment volume upped 8%-9% year over year.
"
1066,CSX,"(3) The U.S. government has taken several measures to boost American manufacturing and raise its exports. At present, the U.S. railroad industry commands less than 50% of total freight in America indicating a huge opportunity to increase market share.
"
1067,CSX,"In fact, the railroad industry is gaining market share from the trucking industry. The truck tonnage volume inched down 2.9% in the first quarter of 2011, mainly attributable to driver shortage, massive rise in fuel costs, and highway congestion.
"
1068,CSX,"(4) The U.S. government has decided to scale back its ruling that made it mandatory for freight rails to install new anti-collision technology called “Positive Train Control. This will save approximately $500 million for the industry and may enable every freight rail operators to increase its respective free cash flow by around 20%-25%.Freight Railroad: Economic Growth Driver
"
1069,CSX,"Freight rail is a “derived demand industry -- demand for rail services is tied to the demand for the products that railroads haul. Rail traffic, therefore, acts as a solid barometer for the overall health of the economy. With the U.S. economy on an uptrend, notwithstanding some near-term jitters, the fortunes of the railroad industry are on the mend.
"
1070,CSX,"Several railroad operators have expressed their confidence that growth rate of business volume in 2011 will exceed the U.S. GDP and industrial production growth rate. Similarly, core pricing gains in 2011 will also exceed inflation.
"
1071,CSX,"Several positive trends (both macro-economic and inter-industry) are helping the U.S. freight railroad operators to significantly increase their capital expenditures. AAR has reported that the freight railroads will spend a record high of $12 billion in 2011 for manpower recruitment, installation of new rail tracks and other capital projects. The railroad industry is expected to hire 10,000 new employees in 2011.
"
1072,CSX,"Investment by railroad operators for product and service improvement is far ahead of other transportation industries. Very few U.S. industries can match the railroad operators with respect to high capital investment rates. Fiscal 2010 witnessed a record breaking $10.7 billion capital investment, which is now expected to grow by another 12%-13% in 2011. Investments in capacity, innovations and use of several state-of-the-art technologies led to service improvements and enhanced reliability.
"
1073,CSX,"An improving U.S. economy, the rebound in automotive shipments, and improvements in many end-markets are expected to fuel the future growth of the Railroad industry. Nevertheless, despite this impressive growth, some near-term concerns still persist.Carload Yet to Reach Pre-Recession Levels
"
1074,CSX,"The January 2011 report of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the main trade body of the industry, clearly stated that although total carloads on U.S. railroads grew 7.3% year over year in 2010 and total intermodal volume increased 14.2% year over year in 2010, both figures are still way behind the pre-recession 2008 level. Volume levels of almost all the product categories are yet to reach the 2008 high.
"
1075,CSX,"Moreover, coal consisting of approximately 37% of total U.S. railway carloads in 2010 is significant. Coal carloads in 2010 have inched up 2.2% year over year but remain significantly below the 9% of the pre-recession 2008 level.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1076,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of attributes that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function in a seller’s market enjoying pricing power since 1980 when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike price on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry. As a result of the Staggers Rail Act, the railroads are hiking their freight rates on an average by nearly 5% per annum and are maintaining double digit profit margins.
"
1077,CSX,"Competitive Advantage: From the customers’ point of view, rail transport is cheaper and fuel-efficient than truck and ship transport. As a result, railroads are gaining market share from other means of transport. Several truck operators went bankrupt during the peak recessionary period that helped railroads to become default freight transporters for mid-to-long distances.Technical Superiority: Overall, investment by railroad operators for product and service improvement is far ahead than other transportation industries. Investments in capacity, innovations and use of several state-of-the-art technologies have led to service improvements and enhanced reliability. AAR claims that freight rail transporters together invested a significant amount of $42 billion in the previous two years for railroad track expansion and maintenance.
"
1078,CSX,"Currently, we remain Neutral on Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report). However, due to strong growth momentum of the industry, our long-term view remains positive for all these Class 1 freight railroad operators.WEAKNESSES
"
1079,CSX,"Despite the above-mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, also has some structural weaknesses. These are as follows:Government Regulations: Railroads are subject to the ratification of laws by Congress that could increase regulation of the industry. A 2010 report presented by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee stated that the discretionary pricing power enjoyed by the Class I freight rail transport companies are putting excessive pressure on freight customers.
"
1080,CSX,"The Senate Commerce Committee headed by Sen. John D. Rockefeller has opined that the railroads have become financially stable and a higher transportation rate is actually impacting household budgets. It remains to be seen how the railroad industry maintains growth if any adverse changes occur related to its discretionary pricing policy.Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in the credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Unionized Labor: Most of the railroad operator’s employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers’ Conference Committee. In the railroad industry, negotiations generally take place over a number of years. Failure to negotiate amicably could result in strikes by the workers resulting in loss of business.
"
1081,CSX,"CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report) just continues to impress. The railroad company recently delivered its 8th consecutive positive earnings surprise driven in large part by an improving U.S. economy.
"
1082,CSX,"Earnings estimates have been surging since the company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Valuation is attractive too, with the stock sporting a PEG ratio of 0.9.
"
1083,CSX,"Fourth Quarter Results
"
1084,CSX,"CSX reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.14, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. It was a 48% increase over the same quarter in 2009.
"
1085,CSX,"Adjusted revenue increased 14% year-over-year driven by a solid 7% increase in overall volume. This directly reflects the improvement in the U.S. economy. The automotive segment was particularly strong, with volume jumping 18%.
"
1086,CSX,"Meanwhile, operating income surged 46% as the company was able to leverage its fixed expenses.
"
1087,CSX,"Estimates Rising
"
1088,CSX,"Earnings estimates have been rising steadily over the last several months as the economy gains momentum. Take a look at the stair-step climb in 2011 consensus estimates:
"
1089,CSX,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is now $4.98, up from $4.71 before the most recent earnings surprise. This corresponds to 23% growth over 2010 EPS. The 2012 estimate is currently $5.74, up from $5.42, and equating to 15% EPS growth.
"
1090,CSX,"It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
1091,CSX,"Dividend Rising
"
1092,CSX,"CSX pays a dividend that yields 1.5%. The company cut its dividend back in 2001 and held it steady through 2005. Since 2005, however, it has raised it 8 times at an average annual rate of 32.5%.
"
1093,CSX,"Its payout ratio is still relatively low at 26%, so expect more dividend increases to come.
"
1094,CSX,"The company has also been spending its free cash flow on share buybacks. In Q4, for instance, it spent $347 million repurchasing 5.6 million shares.
"
1095,CSX,"Valuation
"
1096,CSX,"Although shares have risen nearly 50% since late August, valuation is still attractive because of rising earnings estimates.
"
1097,CSX,"Shares trade at 14.2x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 21.0x, and its PEG ratio is just 0.9.

"
1131,CSX,"Think about the last time you stayed in a hotel. How much did you pay? How much did it actually cost the hotel to have you stay there that night?
"
1132,CSX,"Sure, it cost a lot of money to build and furnish the room, but the company has already incurred those expenses. The actual incremental costs are low. You might use some additional water and electricity - and they'll have to pay someone to clean up your mess afterward - but unless you're Charlie Sheen that shouldn't take much.
"
1133,CSX,"In other words, your stay there is almost pure profit for the hotel company. The reason: operating leverage.
"
1134,CSX,"A Small Change Can Make a Big Difference
"
1135,CSX,"Companies with high operating leverage tend to be capital-intensive businesses with a lot of fixed assets, or overhead. Fixed expenses like property, plant, and equipment generally won't fluctuate with sales volume. Thus, a modest increase in sales can mean huge growth in profits, as each additional dollar of revenue falls almost straight to the bottom line.
"
1136,CSX,"Take XYZ Corp for example. The company sells widgets that require expensive machinery inside of expensive plants to manufacture. Their variable costs are relatively low. In Year 1, the company makes $2 million in sales and has $200,000 in net income. In Year 2, demand picks up a bit and there is a modest 5% increase in sales. Operating income, however, grows by a whopping 40%.
"
1137,CSX,"In contrast, companies with variable cost structures will have low operating leverage. These tend to be labor-intensive businesses or retailers that can adjust the bulk of their expenses as demand changes. These businesses can weather economic downturns easier by cutting staff or reducing inventory, but when things turn around they will have less upside potential.
"
1138,CSX,"High Volatility
"
1139,CSX,"The profits of high-leverage companies tend to be amplified as demand fluctuates with the business cycle. Hence, their share price will be highly volatile. These companies will experience low or negative profits and a falling share price when times are bad (like in 2008-early 2009), but explosive profit growth and rapidly rising share prices when things turn around (late 2009-???).
"
1140,CSX,"As the global economic recovery gains traction, these high-leverage businesses are expected to see excellent profit growth.Eaton Corp (ETN  -  Free Report) is your typical cyclical stock. The company is an industrial conglomerate operating in capital-intensive areas like electrical components, hydraulics, aerospace, and trucking/automotive.
"
1141,CSX,"In 2009, when the global economy was suffering, the company saw a 23% drop in sales. Due to its high leverage, operating income plunged 65%. Things have been turning around for Eaton, however. For the third quarter of 2010, the company saw a healthy 18% increase in sales over the same quarter in 2009 and an impressive 70% increase in operating income.
"
1142,CSX,"Analysts have been raising estimates following the strong quarter, sending the stock to a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for 115% EPS growth in 2010 and 26% growth in 2011.
"
1143,CSX,"The stock tends to fluctuate with the business cycle, as seen in its 5-year chart:
"
1144,CSX,"The stock is up over 50% year-to-date, but valuation looks attractive. Shares trade at 16.6x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 18.3x. Its price to book ratio of 2.2 is in-line with its peers. The stock also offers a 2.5% dividend yield.
"
1145,CSX,"Honda Motor (HMC  -  Free Report) is another company with high operating leverage. The Japanese company is famous for its automobiles, but also manufactures motorcycles, ATVs, generators, and lawn mowers, among other things.
"
1146,CSX,"In fiscal year 2009, sales were down 17% while operating income fell 80%. For the second quarter of 2011, sales were up 9% while operating income grew an incredible 149%.
"
1147,CSX,"Analysts have revised their estimates much higher for 2011, sending the stock to a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 calls for 311% EPS growth over 2010.
"
1148,CSX,"Shares for Honda have been slightly less volatile over the last 5 years:
"
1149,CSX,"The stock is up about 10% year-to-date, and valuation looks very attractive. Shares trade at 11.1x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 16.4x. Its PEG ratio is a mere 0.3.
"
1150,CSX,"CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report) also carries a lot of fixed assets and has relatively low variable costs. The southeastern railroad company serves as a bellwether to the overall economy.
"
1151,CSX,"The company was relatively successful in managing its costs during the downturn in 2009, but shares still plunged over 65% from May 2008 to their nadir in March 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, CSX reported a 16% increase in revenue and a stellar 39% increase in operating income. 
"
1152,CSX,"Analysts have also been raising their earnings estimates significantly higher for CSX. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for 40% EPS growth in 2010 and 17% growth in 2011. It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
1153,CSX,"Shares of CSX are near their pre-recession levels:
"
1154,CSX,"The stock is up over 20% year-to-date, but valuation is quite reasonable. The stock trades at 15.0x forward earnings, well below the peer group multiple of 19.5x. It has a PEG ratio of 1.3. The stock offers a dividend yield of 1.7%.
"
1155,CSX,"Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is another company that will tend to struggle during economic contraction and thrive during recovery and expansion. The company makes large earth-moving equipment and recently announced it will be acquiring mining equipment maker Bucryus for $8.6 billion.
"
1156,CSX,"In 2009, CAT saw a 37% decrease in revenue and an 88% drop in operating income. Things have begun to turn around though. For the third quarter of 2010, CAT saw a 53% increase in sales and a 329% jump in operating profit.
"
1157,CSX,"Analysts have been raising their estimates significantly higher off the strong quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for 83% EPS growth in 2010 and 44% growth in 2011. It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
1158,CSX,"Caterpillar's stock has also moved in tandem with the business cycle:
"
1159,CSX,"It has risen more than 40% so far this year, but valuation is still reasonable. Shares trade at 20.4x times forward earnings, a slight premium to the industry average of 18.3x. Its PEG ratio is 1.5. CAT has a dividend yield of 2.2%.
"
1160,CSX,"Proceed with Caution
"
1161,CSX,"Keep in mind that if the economic recovery stalls and we slip back into another recession, these companies will be left with high expenses and little demand for their products. That will spell trouble for their share price.

1183,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 17 after market close.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.2% with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Moreover, both the measures improved on a year-over-year basis. A substantial decrease in operating expenses also aided results.With the Precision Scheduled Railroading well underway, things look up for the company in the second quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that CSX is likely to beat on earnings this quarter on the back of a perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: CSX has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 87 cents per share, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 85 cents. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe company’s cost-cutting efforts are anticipated to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. CSX has been benefitting immensely from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, designed to improve operational efficiency, by lowering costs and optimal asset utilization. Reduced operating expenses are expected to improve operating ratio and drive bottom-line growth.Impressive performance of the intermodal and coal segments is also likely to produce better results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $476 million, higher than $448 million a year ago. The figure also compares favorably with $449 million, recorded in the preceding quarter.The consensus mark for coal revenues is pegged at $541 million. The tally compares favorably with $530 million and $503 million, reported in the prior-year quarter and the first quarter, respectively.Needless to mention, the new tax law is also expected to buoy results in the second quarter. As expected, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been aiding results since its implementation in December 2017 and the second quarter is not likely to be any different. The reduced effective tax rate arising from the slashed corporate tax rate is expected to boost the company’s bottom line in the period to be reported.However, the company’s high-debt levels remain a cause for concern.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.

1184,CSX,"On Jun 11, U.S. stocks closed in the black for the fourth successive session. Once again, optimism over the second-quarter earnings season triumphed over trade tensions.

1185,CSX,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 16.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.8%. This transportation company’s earnings of $1.07 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. However, the bottom line improved 16.3% on a year-over-year basis despite higher operating expenses. In fact, the 19.6% year-over-year increase in revenues to $1,948.2 million aided results. The top line also cruised ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,872.1 million.However, things seem to be looking up for the company in the second quarter. Shares of the company have gained 3.8% in the Apr-Jun period, outperforming the industry’s 0.6% rise. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: J.B. Hunt has an Earnings ESP of +0.95%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.28 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands marginally lower at $1.27.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $1,119 million, above $1,070 million reported in the previous quarter.The Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) and Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) are also expected to perform well in the quarter to be reported, thus boosting the top line. The consensus mark for DCS revenues is pegged at $506 million, higher than $494 million reported in the first quarter. The same for ICS is $308 million, more than $296 million in the preceding quarter.However, high costs might affect the company’s bottom line in the second quarter.

1186,CSX,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF (RGI  -  Free Report) debuted on 11/01/2006, and offers broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $301.49 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. RGI is managed by Invesco Powershares. Before fees and expenses, RGI seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials Index.This index is an unmanaged equal weighted version of the S&P 500 Industrials Index that consists of the common stocks of the following industries: aerospace & defense, building products, construction & engineering, electrical equipment, conglomerates, machinery; commercial services & supplies, air freight & logistics, airlines, marine, road & rail transportation infrastructure.Cost & Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.20%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For RGI, it has heaviest allocation in the Industrials sector --about 100% of the portfolio.Taking into account individual holdings, Transdigm Group Inc (TDG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.71% of the fund's total assets, followed by Textron Inc (TXT  -  Free Report) and Csx Corp (CSX  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 15.84% of RGI's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -1.73%, and is up roughly 13.74% in the last one year (as of 05/17/2018). RGI has traded between $103.35 and $127.83 in the past 52-week period.RGI has a beta of 1.10 and standard deviation of 14.90% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium choice in the space. With about 70 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGuggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Industrials 25/50 Index and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) tracks Industrial Select Sector Index. Vanguard Industrials ETF has $3.77 B in assets, Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund has $12.92 B. VIS has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLI charges 0.13%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1187,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 17, after the market close.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.3%. Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings history, with the metric surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 10.3%.However, the scenario pertaining to this quarter does not seem too bright. This is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings being revised 2.9% downward in the last 60 days.Factors at PlayWeakness in the automotive sector poses a major challenge to CSX. This is because the company draws a major portion of revenues from this sector. Hence, sluggish automotive revenues might hurt the top line in the first quarter.Additionally, declining coal production in the current year is likely to hamper first-quarter results. A drop in U.S. coal exports coupled with the decline in usage of coal for electricity generation in the United States are hurting production of the commodity. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for coal revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $529 million, below $541 million reported in the previous quarter.The company’s high-debt levels further add to its woes. This is indicated by its current long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio of 80.1, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s figure of 66.3%.However, the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, implemented by the company's former CEO E. Hunter Harrison is anticipated to boost results in the period to be reported. The new model is likely to drive the top line on the back of volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and intermodal segments.The new tax law should also boost profits for the company, leading to bottom-line growth in the first quarter.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks are also impressive. In February, the company announced a 10% dividend hike. In light of the new tax law, we expect an upswing in such shareholder-friendly moves, resulting from sums of huge savings owing to the reduced tax rate.Growth of the intermodal sector is also anticipated to aid the top line this earnings season. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $448 million, above $434 million, recorded a year ago.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: CSX has an Earnings ESP of -1.71%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider stocks like American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU  -  Free Report) and Alaska Air Group, Inc.

The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.JetBlue Airways is a #3 Ranked player and has an Earnings ESP of +2.00%.

The company will announce first-quarter financial figures on Apr 23.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

1188,CSX,"There is no doubt that the new tax law has been a big positive for railroads and should be instrumental in driving growth for the industry. The new tax law apart, other factors like a buoyant U.S. economy and intermodal growth act as major tailwinds for this key sector.These positives notwithstanding, there are a few factors that raise concerns for railroads. Let’s dig deep on the subject.Sluggish Automotive Production – A Key ChallengeWeakness in the automotive sector has been hurting railroads for quite some time, with domestic production declining substantially. The scenario was not vastly different in the final quarter of 2017 as well. Results of major railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) were hurt by soft automotive volumes.What’s worse is that the situation is unlikely to improve in the current year.Union Pacific on its fourth-quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full-year 2018 are projected at 16.9 million units, reflecting a 2% decline from the 2017 levels. Norfolk Southern, meanwhile, said that it expects automotive volume to lag vehicle production in the United States.These disappointing commentaries on the automotive sector do not bode well for railroads. As a significant portion of revenues is accounted for by this key sector, weakness pertaining to automotive production in the United States is a major headwind for railroads.Service IssuesCSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) was plagued by service disruptions last year, which severely dented its operations. However, the railroad took measures to combat the issue. The Precision Scheduled Railroading system, implemented by the company's former CEO, E. Hunter Harrison, seems to be paying off. The system generated efficiency-related savings to the tune of $460 million in 2017.However, service issues now seem to be hurting Canadian railroad operator, Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report). In fact, the company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion for the past few months, which have hurt its operational performance. Further, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) statement issued in February 2018 that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, underlines the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues might affect Canadian National’s customer base and adversely impact its growth prospects, unless resolved quickly.Canadian National announced a change at its helm, in March 2018, in order to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) has apologized to its customers for the service woes. He has promised an improvement on the service front. However, in the event of management change failing to yield the desired results, the stock would be hurt further.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NAFTANAFTA refers to the trade pact inked in 1994 between the United States, Canada and Mexico in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers. NAFTA has basically done away with almost all tariffs among the three nations. However, President Trump has in fact threatened to withdraw from the agreement, if the negotiations, which are currently in progress, fail to yield the desired results. He believes that it is a bad deal, not in favor of American workers.The uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) continues to hurt railroads, especially the ones like Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report). A significant portion of Kansas City Southern’s revenues come from U.S.-Mexico shipment. In fact, many railroads including Kansas City Southern are not in favor of the U.S. scrapping NAFTA. They believe that such a move might put pressure on supply chains, jobs and consumers apart from having adverse political implications.However, the President has stuck to his guns and imposed a deadline of May 1 pertaining to the NAFTA negations. Beyond that date, there will be imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada.Railroads would be hoping for a favorable resolution to the issue as an unfavorable development on this key issue might dampen their prospects severely.Other HeadwindsPresident Trump’s plans to shift focus to traditional energy businesses such as coal is aimed at benefiting the coal industry and therefore railroads. This is because the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal.However, even if the Obama-era Clean Power Plan (CPP) is repealed, as wished by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), coal revenues might not pick up. In the current year, the EIA predicts coal production to be 736 million short tons (MMst), down 5% year over year.Moreover, many are not in favor of repealing the CPP due to fears of environmental hazards among others. Furthermore, the process of repealing CPP is time-consuming. With uncertainty regarding CPP’S fate, a major overhang on railroad shares would remain until there is clarity on this key issue.Even if legislative and regulatory measures hindering the coal industry come into effect more vigorously, the commodity’s long-term competitive position has materially been weakened by the abundant and largely cheap natural gas supplies. In other words, railroads will benefit from  some incremental improvements in coal shipments, but the long-term trend is in the opposite direction.  Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.
"
1189,CSX,"After being laid low by declining coal shipments for the last few years, stocks in the railroad space performed well over the past year. The outlook for coal shipments has notably improved, given the favorable regulatory backdrop under the current administration.The improvement can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to this key revenue-generating commodity in the final quarter of 2017. For example, at Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) coal revenues (freight) increased 5.7%, while the same at CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) rose 4% year over year. At Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), revenues improved 115% at the energy segment on the back of impressive performances at Frac Sand and Crude Oil units.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Railroads are expected to perform well in the first quarter of 2018 as well with coal continuing to show improvements. In fact, under the Trump administration, the coal industry is seeing better days. In a bid to revive the industry, the President has made it clear that he intends to relax regulations that were detrimental to its prospects.Rising natural gas prices also bode well as far as demand for coal is concerned. Since revenues from coal account for a significant portion of railroads’ top line, any positive development toward the commodity augurs well for the sector.Intermodal Strength Augurs WellThe intermodal unit is another key source of revenues for railroads. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the intermodal unit performed reasonably well for the key railroads. For example at Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), freight revenues from the segment increased 4% year over year. At Norfolk Southern, intermodal revenues rose 14.5% year over year. At Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP  -  Free Report), intermodal revenues increased 7%.In fact, intermodal volumes increased significantly in 2017 after a lackluster 2016. According to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA), intermodal volumes improved 5.8% year over year in the final quarter of 2017. Growth on the international front contributed to the impressive performance of this key segment in 2017.In fact, according to many market watchers, the segment is expected to perform strongly in the current year as well driven by a significant rise in international business.New Tax Law a Huge PositiveOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed significantly. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures.As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. For example, Norfolk Southern expects the effective tax rate to come down to around 24% from 35.4% recorded in 2017.Uptick in Shareholder-Friendly Activities LikelyThe likes of Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) have already announced dividend hikes this year. A further increase in shareholder-friendly activities (dividends as well as buybacks) is likely in the wake of the massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Improvement in Operating Ratio Another PositiveOperating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is an important metric to gauge the performance of railroads. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.In fact, many key railroads witnessed improvement with respect to the metric in the final quarter of 2017. At Norfolk Southern, the metric improved 150 basis points last year on a year-over-year basis. Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65% by 2020 or even earlier. Annual productivity savings in excess of $650 million are expected by 2020.Further, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space. Moreover, the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety and enhance productivity are also encouraging.To ConcludeWe expect railroads to perform well going forward on the back of these positives. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy supports the bullish case for railroads, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country.We believe that in light of factors like better coal and intermodal volumes, Trump’s pro-coal stance and industrial growth, investors should look at stocks in the space with renewed interest.Check out our latest Railroad Industry Outlook for more news on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend looks ahead for this important sector at the moment.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1190,CSX,"Stocks in the railroad space are being aided by momentum in the U.S. economy, with more goods being transported across the country.The market is expected to continue its winning streak, banking on a rise in wages and more confident consumers. Moreover, the new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) should boost profits further and drive stock prices of the participants of this key sector higher.The robust financial health of railroads is reflective of the improved scenario for its players. The rebound has been aided by the much-improved scenario pertaining to the intermodal unit, a key revenue generating sector for railroads.The sector has bounced back after a disappointing 2016. Intermodal revenues are likely to grow this year as well. In fact, intermodal shipments are expected to expand 4.2% in 2018, strengthening the top line for railroads in turn. Improvement pertaining to another key metric — operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) — is another positive for railroads.In view of the above tailwinds, the fourth-quarter earnings season had been a good one for railroad stocks. Notwithstanding a few headwinds including some lingering impacts of devastating hurricanes, railroad companies continued the earnings momentum in the December quarter. We note that a number of companies in the space — including prominent names such as Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Genesee & Wyoming, Inc. (GWR  -  Free Report) — delivered an earnings beat in the quarter.Volume Growth Likely to Drive Railroads in Q1The stocks are likely to perform impressively in the first quarter of 2018 driven by volume growth. For example, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) railroad — Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) — expects volume growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter to increase in the low single-digit range. Strong performance at the intermodal unit is expected to aid results. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Efforts of railroads to check costs should boost their bottom lines further. For example, at the 2018 Investor Conference held in March, CSX stated that its transition to precision scheduled railroading is progressing well. The new model will lead to top-line growth on the back of volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and intermodal segments. Moreover, scheduled railroading is anticipated to provide greater agility to the coal markets. This, in turn, will drive growth.Railroads should continue to see operating ratio-related improvements in the first quarter of 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks.In fact, the transportation sector, which includes railroads, is expected to see double-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. For more details about the earnings of this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.Zacks Industry Rank Highlights HeadwindsDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, the Zacks Industry Rank # 247 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Zacks Rail Industry highlights that the industry is not bereft of headwinds. This unfavorable rank places the companies within the bottom 4% slot of the Zacks industries.We classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Using a week’s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade.Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankThe ConcernsIt is a well-documented fact that the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal, since the latter is an important revenue-generating commodity for the sector. Despite President Trump’s pro-coal attitude, the coal industry is not yet out of the woods. In fact, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), coal production is expected to be 736 million short tons (MMst), down 5% year over year.The primary reasons for this are a drop in U.S. coal exports and a decline in usage of coal in electricity generation in the United States. The struggles related to coal are likely to hurt railroads in the first quarter. For example, Norfolk Southern stated at the J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials conference that coal volumes had declined 6% as of Mar 10. Naturally, any negative development for the commodity does not bode well for railroad operators.Declining automotive volumes due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States, have been hurting railroads for the past few quarters and the story is unlikely to be different in the first quarter. Union Pacific on its fourth-quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full-year 2018 are projected at 16.9 million units, reflecting a 2% decline from the 2017 levels.Moreover, service issues represent a major headwind for the sector and may hurt its customer base unless resolved quickly. CSX was badly hurt by such issues last year. Canadian railroad operator — Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report) — is the latest victim of operational problems, which are likely to hurt its first-quarter results.Moreover, uncertainty regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) represents a major overhang on shares of railroads, particularly those like Kansas City Southern, which generate a significant portion of revenues from U.S.-Mexico shipments. Other factors, like the weather-related disruptions — like the ones last year which resulted in freight costs skyrocketing — and the dispute regarding the proposals concerning reciprocal switching, are further challenges for railroads.Valuation PictureThe Zacks Rail industry is up 17.1% over the past year, modestly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 15.5% gain in the same time period. The industry has struggled since January 9th, likely reflecting the NAFTA uncertainty.The industry’s valuation picture remains attractive, with multiples becoming a lot more reasonable following the recent sell off. The Zacks Rail industry currently trades 16.4X forward 12-month consensus EPS estimates, which is down from 19.4X back in December 2017. This compares to the current forward 12-month P/E multiple of 17X for the S&P 500 index.Over the last 5 years, the industry has traded as high as 19.4X forward 12-month consensus estimates and as low as 13.4X, with a 5-year median of 16.4X. In other words, the industry is trading at the same level as the 5-year median. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1192,CSX,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) shares received a very nice little pop when the company boosted its first quarter guidance on Mar 31. This news came on the heels of the company's very solid fourth-quarter and full-year results in which its quarterly profit was up 5% from the same period last year. Put theses two factors together and you have a recipe for a stock that is on the move. CSX shares are up close to 30% on the year.

"
1196,CSX,"This announcement comes on the heels of the company's already impressive fourth quarter results, reported on Jan 22. Revenue was up 7% to $2.58 billion.

"
1198,CSX,"Although CSX is operating in an energy intensive environment that is presenting unique challenges to its prosperity, the company said that it has benefited from increased shipping demand of high-demand products such as agricultural products, chemicals and fertilizers. 
"
1199,CSX,"This marks the third time in three quarters that the company has surprised and beaten analyst estimates, having done so by an average of 11 cents, or 16.7%. 
"
1200,CSX,"Full-year income for CSX totaled $1.23 billion, producing earnings of $2.99 per share, up from earnings of $2.82 per share last year. Full-year revenue grew to $10.03 billion from $9.57 billion last year. 
"
1201,CSX,"With all of the good news rolling in like a freight train, the company's share price has been on quite a ride lately. For the year, share are up close to 30%, an impressive gain in any environment and even more impressive in this tepid economic environment. 
"
1202,CSX,"Looking ahead, the key to the chart is the resistance level just above $58. This area is the 52-week high and all-time high, and has been tested numerous times over the last two weeks. With the up trend continuing to maintain its strength, it should only be a matter of time before this stock advances beyond this area and into uncharted territory. CSX reports its first quarter results on Apr 15. 
"
1203,CSX,"The five best performing stocks on the Zacks #1 Rank List last month were: Lindsay Corporation (LNN  -  Free Report), Kirby Corporation (KEX  -  Free Report), GameStop (GME  -  Free Report), The MasterCard, Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report). Lindsay Corporation (LNN  -  Free Report) announced that total revenues for irrigation equipment increased 62% in its fiscal second quarter, leading to a strong quarterly report overall and a spot on the Zacks #1 Rank top performers list for March.  
"
1204,CSX,"Shares of the company gained 30% for the month.  
"
1205,CSX,"Lindsay reported earnings per share of 79 cents during the quarter, which soundly surpassed the consensus by more than 132%. It also marked a solid year-over-year improvement from 21 cents. Total revenues jumped 70% to $108.4 million. Results include a pair of recent acquisitions and an increase in income tax expense.  
"
1206,CSX,"Since Lindsay specializes in making and marketing irrigation equipment, the company is in a great position to capitalize on high agricultural commodity prices. LNN expects robust demand for its irrigation products both domestically and internationally in 2008. 
"
1207,CSX,"Analysts appreciated the quarterly report and seem to agree that Lindsay has a lot of potential in the current environment. Earnings estimates for this fiscal year, which ends in August 2008, have risen 25% over the past month to $2.83 from $2.26. 
"
1208,CSX,"Furthermore, expectations for next fiscal year are at $3.60, which would mark a more than 27% rise over this fiscal year.  
"
1209,CSX,"In addition to irrigation products, Lindsay also makes and markets infrastructure and road safety products through its subsidiaries.  Kirby Corporation (KEX  -  Free Report) looks to extend its streak of 16 consecutive quarters with year-over-year improvement on Apr 24, when it reports its first-quarter results. This upcoming report was at the center of KEXs strong performance in March, which saw shares rise by 25%.  
"
1210,CSX,"On Mar 17, KEX announced that first-quarter EPS should surpass 66 cents, compared to its previous forecast between 57 cents and 62 cents. Analysts wasted little time in boosting expectations for the quarter to 67 cents, marking a 9.8% improvement of the previous consensus of 61 cents. 
"
1211,CSX,"The company attributed the raised forecast to stronger-than-expected demand for its marine transportation and diesel engine services operations. 
"
1212,CSX,"KEX also made the Zacks #1 Rank top performers list for the week ended Mar 21. 
"
1213,CSX,"For its fourth quarter, Kirby earned 64 cents per share, which inched past the consensus by about 1.6% but improved handily from the previous years 45 cents. This was its 16th straight quarter of year-over-year improvement. Meanwhile, consolidated revenues jumped 22% to $307.9 million from $251.4 million. 
"
1214,CSX,"KEX beat Wall Streets earnings expectations in each quarter last year with an average surprise of approximately 4.3%.  
"
1215,CSX,"Earnings estimates for the full year, ending December 2008, continue to move in the right direction. Analysts boosted estimates by 8.7% in the past three months and 4.2% in the past 30 days.  GameStop (GME  -  Free Report) continued to be one of the markets hottest stories in March, as a strong quarterly report, solid outlook and favorable landscape combined to send shares higher by 22% during the month. 
"
1216,CSX,"A gain of 38.4% in new video game software sales helped GameStop to another impressive performance. Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.14 surpassed the year-ago result of 82 cents and beat the consensus by 1.8%. Sales jumped 24.4% to $2.86 billion from $2.3 billion, and same-store sales increased 17.4%. 
"
1217,CSX,"As impressive as those numbers are, analysts are even more excited for GMEs future potential in a thriving video game industry. For its fiscal first quarter, the company expected earnings per share of 32 cents to 33 cents, which was better than the consensus at the time of 29 cents. 
"
1218,CSX,"Analysts, therefore, responded by raising expectations for the quarter by more than 17% to 34 cents over the past month.  
"
1219,CSX,"GME now projects earnings per share between $2.25 and $2.34 for the fiscal year, which would improve upon fiscal 2007 by 25% to 30%. The consensus was expecting approximately $2.20. 
"
1220,CSX,"As a result, estimates moved higher 7.3% over the past 30 days. Over the past three months, estimates are up by more than 13%.  
"
1221,CSX,"Furthermore, same-store sales are expected to rise 24% to 25% for the fiscal first quarter, and between 10% and 12% for the fiscal year. MasterCard, Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) was drowned out a bit in March due to rival Visas IPO, but at the end of the month it was MA that made the top performers list. Shares of the company gained 17% as it moves toward its first-quarter report later this month. 
"
1222,CSX,"MasterCard has an excellent record of beating Wall Streets quarterly earnings expectations. In the past four quarters, the company has an average surprise of approximately 23%.  
"
1223,CSX,"Earnings estimates for this year have been trending higher for a while, gaining 8.2% over the past three months and 1.8% over the past two months.  
"
1224,CSX,"MA continues to benefit from exposure to growing international markets. In the fourth quarter, earnings per share of 89 cents, excluding a gain, topped the consensus by more than 23%. Net revenues advanced 28% to $1.07 billion. The company attributed results to its global business model, which helped worldwide purchase volume rise 16.1%.  
"
1225,CSX,"MA made the Zacks #1 Rank Top Performers list for the week ended Mar 14, and was featured as both a Growth & Income and Momentum Stock of the Day at Zacks.com during the month.  CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) told the market in mid-March that expectations for its first quarter and full year were too low. The railroad operator, therefore, provided guidance above Wall Street predictions, which led to a 16% advance in shares last month.  
"
1226,CSX,"The market consensus was expecting 63 cents a month ago, but CSX announced that earnings per share between 74 cents and 77 cents was more like it. That would mark a year-over-year improvement between 42% and 48%.  
"
1227,CSX,"As a result, earnings estimates for the quarter are up 17.4% over the past 30 days.  
"
1228,CSX,"For the full year, EPS are now expected between $3.40 and $3.60, instead of analysts prediction of about $3.02. This would mark an improvement of 24% to 31% from 2007.  
"
1229,CSX,"Analysts, therefore, raised the annual consensus by 14.6% in the past month.  
"
1230,CSX,"(Both the quarterly and annual guidance includes a gain from a sale of real estate of four cents.) 
"
1231,CSX,"CSX also decided to raise its long-term guidance through 2010.  
"
1232,CSX,"In its fourth quarter, CSX earned 85 cents per share, excluding a gain, which beat the consensus by almost 33%. The result also easily surpassed the year-ago performance of 57 cents, excluding items. The company stated that the increase in operating income was due to strong revenue growth and productivity improvements, which allowed CSX to overcome the impact of higher fuel prices.  
"
1233,CSX,"The company will announce its first-quarter results later this month.  
"
1234,CSX,"February's 2.9% rise in existing home sales mask a big problem in the housing industry, considerably tighter standards for mortgages. Based on conversations with mortgage brokers, credit scores of 720 are the new 680.
"
1235,CSX,"Typically, a minimum credit score of 680 has been required to get favorable rates on mortgages. This score has been perceived as the dividing line between good credit and mediocre or bad credit. Now, lenders are asking for scores of 720 or higher - a sign of significantly tighter standards.
"
1236,CSX,"To put these numbers in perspective, Experian's National Score Index currently stands at 692. According to CreditReport.com, not a single state has an average credit score of 720 or better. (South Dakota had the highest average score at 710; Texas was the lowest at 651, followed by Nevada at 655.)
"
1237,CSX,"In other words, the average American has a credit score below the minimum currently required by mortgage lenders. At a time when many homeowners are looking to refinance adjustable rate mortgages and homebuilders need more buyers, this is not good news.
"
1238,CSX,"The revised FHA limits should provide some relief, but they are by no means the savior the housing industry needs. FHA loans require an upfront payment of 1.5% in addition to the down payment, meaning homeowners who opt for the minimum 3% down payment still need an additional 1.5% of the mortgage amount at closing. (This means, based on the median existing home price of $195,900, would be buyers need $9,000 in cash, plus additional amounts for taxes, appraisal fees, attorney fees, etc.)
"
1239,CSX,"The additional costs for FHA loans don't end there. A monthly insurance charge equivalent to 0.5% per year of the loan amount is assessed if the down payment is less than 20%. This fee continues to be charged for a period of five years, even if the borrower's equity in the house rises above 20%.
"
1240,CSX,"Plus, there are rising property taxes and homeowner's insurance to factor into the monthly cost. In other words, even if the would be buyer can get a FHA loan, it doesn't mean he can actually make the payments.
"
1241,CSX,"So why have homebuilder stocks rallied as of late? Chalk it up to unfounded optimism combined with too much focus on charts and spreadsheets and not enough common sense thinking. If buyers can't get loans and can't afford the payments even if they can get loans, the housing market is not going to recover. A $1200 rebate check from the government will not cover the monthly mortgage payment of an FHA loan, especially when property taxes and insurance premiums are factored in.
"
1242,CSX,"The trend in earnings estimate revisions provides further evidence that the recent rally in homebuilding stocks is irrational. Brokerage analysts continue to lower their profit expectations on multiple homebuilders including D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Ryland Group (RYL) and Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report). All three are Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stocks and are classified in Building-Residential/Commerical.
"
1243,CSX,"Regular readers of this column are aware that railroads have taken market share away from trucking companies. High fuel costs make it more efficient to ship long-haul freight by rail than by road.
"
1244,CSX,"Railroad companies have also benefited from higher commodity prices and the booming agricultural sector. Improved conditions for the coal industry, in particular, have helped to offset the weakness caused by the economic slump.
"
1245,CSX,"These positive factors explain why nearly half of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their first-quarter and full-year forecasts on Burlington Northern (BNI) within the past month. The first-quarter estimate for BNI of $1.22 is two cents above the average forecast of a month ago. The full-year earnings estimate of $5.92 is a penny above the average forecast of a month ago. Not big changes, granted, but given the economy, this a positive sign.
"
1246,CSX,"A bigger revision in estimates has occurred in CSX (CSX  -  Free Report). Last week, CSX guided for first-quarter profits of 74 cents to 77 cents per share and full-year profits of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Prior to the new projections, brokerage analysts had been forecasting per share earnings of 63 cents and $3.02, respectively. (The new consensus earnings estimates are at 74 cents and $3.46 per share, respectively.)
"
1247,CSX,"CSX also raised its guidance for earnings through 2010. The company expects to achieve compound annual operating growth of 13% to 15% and per share earnings growth of 18% to 21% (excluding the impact of share buybacks). Previously, the company had guided for operating income growth of 10% to 12% and EPS growth of 15% to 17%.
"
1248,CSX,"CSX did not provide much rationale for the optimistic outlook, but did credit pricing power and cost-cutting measures.
"
1249,CSX,"Both BNI and CSX are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks. The two companies are classified in Transportation-Rail.

1252,CSX,"As the Q1 earnings season is just round the corner, market experts are preparing to compare estimates with actual outcomes. Right now, investors are looking to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter. This is because an earnings beat positively impacts the stock price.In fact, the projection regarding Q1 is very encouraging. Per the latest earnings outlook, the bottom line for S&P 500 companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 16% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.4%. The report further predicts that 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year.One of those sectors is transportation sector, wherein the top and bottom line are expected to increase 7.4% and 14.5%, respectively. Notably, this highly diversified sector includes railroads and airlines among others.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to indulge in a comparative analysis of key railroads — Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) —  ahead of their respective Q1 earnings reports. Norfolk Southern is slated to report on Apr 25, while Union Pacific is scheduled to unveil its earnings numbers a day later.As both railroads are on the same footing, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we use certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned ahead of the Q1 reporting cycle. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price Performance When considering price performance in a year’s time, Union Pacific clearly scores over Norfolk Southern. Union Pacific has gained 24.1%, higher than its industry’s 14.8% rally. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern has gained 13.9% in the same time frame. Valuation Compared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is overvalued. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is commonly used for valuing railroads because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 3.8. This is a tad higher than the S&P 500 average of 3. 7. Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 2.3 Norfolk Southernis undervalued compared with the S&P 500 and the industry. However, Union Pacific scores poorly on the valuation front and is overvalued compared with the industry and the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 4.2. Consequently, this Omaha, NE-based railroad operator is pricier than its Norfolk, VA-based counterpart. Dividend Yield The new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), which reduces corporate tax rate significantly, is a huge positive for railroads. This apart, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures.The massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is favorable for shareholder-friendly activities like dividend payments and buybacks. In fact, both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have hiked the respective dividend payouts this year. Also, other railroad stocks like Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) have announced dividend hikes this year.Coming back to the two stocks under consideration, Union Pacific’s dividend yield over a year is 2.2%. With a dividend yield of 2.18%, Norfolk Southern shareholders fetch a slightly lower dividend yield than its larger rival. Earnings History and ESP Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, Norfolk Southernhas delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 7.2%. Union Pacificemerges second best in this respect, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 3.3%.However, the Earnings ESP scenario is quite a contrast, with Union Pacific’s reading at +0.22% and Norfolk Southern’s at -2.56%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Norfolk Southernholds an edge over Union Pacific, when considering a more detailed earnings history and valuation. Nevertheless, Union Pacific is superior when considering dividend yield and price performance.Additionally, Union Pacific has a positive ESP reading unlike Norfolk Southern. Although, both stocks have a the same Zacks Rank and seem to be evenly matched, Union Pacific is preferable ahead of earnings, since it holds a clear edge in the Earnings ESP stakes.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

1253,CSX,"Freight railroad is vital for domestic freight as it accounts for around 40% of the U.S. transport sector. A strong U.S. economy supports the bullishness of freight railroad operators, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country.The robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in this industry, after having been battered by coal-related headwinds over the last few years. This indicates that freight railroad stocks will provide good return in the long-term.Coal Price, Intermodal Volume Improvement Boosts RailwaysThe turnaround of this key industry can be attributed to an improvement in the coal-related scenario. This is because coal is considered as a key revenue-generating commodity for railroads.On Feb 16, U.S. Energy Information Association (“EIA”) estimated that U.S. coal production for 2017 will amount to 773 million short tons (MMst), This figure is 45 MMst higher than 2016 as well as the largest year-over-year tonnage increase since 2001. The agency also stated that the coal prices across the United States rose in 2017, especially for Central Appalachian coal.Moreover, prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of President Trump’s pro-coal stance, wherein he promised to relax emissions rules. Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also given a boost to the demand for this key commodity. As the fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal, any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads.Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads. Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth policies of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  Further, efforts of railroads to drive bottom-line growth through cost-cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space.Robust AAR DataThe Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), the industry body of the class 1 freight railroad operators, reported that U.S. rail traffic (including carloads and intermodal units) stood at 534,282 for the week ended Mar 10, 2018. This reflects an increase of 1.6% year over year. Six of the 10 carload commodity groups posted an increase compared with the same week in 2017. Total combined U.S. rail traffic (including carloads and intermodal units) for the first 10 weeks of 2018 was 5,193,970, up 2% year over year.Railroads should continue to witness an improvement pertaining to another key metric - operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2018. The lesser the value of operating ratio, the better, as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks.Over a year, the Zacks Rail Industry increased 17.5%. In comparison, stock price of five major railroad operators, Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report)  and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), rallied 29.1%, 21.5%, 19.9%, 18.4% and 17.2%, respectively. Each of these stocks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineImprovement in the prospects of key units like coal and intermodal has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of the year. These positives will further drive the stock price of freight railroad operators.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1255,CSX,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Tuesday after recent political tensions weighed on sentiment despite strong quarterly earnings results. Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings results and updated 2018 earnings projection from UnitedHealth led key U.S. indexes to reach new highs initially.However, all the three indexes fell at the close with the Dow posting its biggest reversal in a day since Feb. 10, 2016 after briefly moving above the 26,000 mark for the first time. Additionally, oil prices fell after investors decided to lock in gains, which in turn weighed on the energy sector. Markets were closed on Monday due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 7.68 points to close at 25,792.86. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to close at 2,776.42. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,224.00, losing 0.5%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 14.5% to close at 11.63. A total of around 8.30 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.48 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.04-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.18-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Weighed On the Benchmarks?Markets lost some of its early shine on Tuesday and closed in negative territory after special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed President Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon last week. A subpoena of this kind was issued by Mueller for the first time over the investigation of a possible link between Russian officials and members of Trump election campaign.Additionally, oil prices fell after investors decided to lock in recent gains. Oil prices moved more than $70 a barrel recently, which prompted investors to indulge in profit-taking on Tuesday. Decrease in oil prices led the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) to decline 1.3%, emerging as the worst performing sector of S&P 500.Some of the sectors key components, including Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) fell 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Both Chevron and Exxon Mobil hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Out of the 11 key S&P 500 sectors, eight of them managed to close in the red. However, Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) was one of the three S&P 500 sectors which increased on Tuesday. Gains in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) contributed to the sector’s rally.UnitedHealth’s shares increased 1.9% after the diversified healthcare company reported fourth quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, both the top and bottom line rose year-over-year. UnitedHealth also revised its 2018 financial outlook to reflect the effects of the U.S. corporate tax law changes.

1261,CSX,"The Q3 earnings season is in the nascent stage with 32 S&P 500 participants having reported results so far. As is the norm, the early earnings reports included those of major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report).Again, this current week is going to an extremely busy one with 178 companies, including 53 S&P 500 participants, revealing their Q3 numbers.In fact, the Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has seen third-quarter reports from a handful of players. Evidently, airline behemoth Delta Air Lines’ (DAL  -  Free Report) earnings per share and revenues surpassed expectations, despite recent natural calamities. On the flip side, J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) posted mixed results,  wherein the company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share but better-than-expected revenues.Though too early to reach a definite conclusion about the performance of this sector, it is widely expected that the recent natural calamities (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico) will dent results of the sector participants in Q3.  The latest Earnings Preview too predicts that this widely diversified sector will cut a sorry figure in the quarter under review, with its bottom line contracting 15.5% owing to high costs.Markedly, one of the key components of the transportation sector are railroads. Though things are looking up for the same following improvement in the coal-related scenario and U.S. Presidential election last year, the natural disasters are likely to hurt earnings. These, in turn, have hurt operations at railroads by damaging important rail lines. Also, freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, the bottom line of the same are likely to be hurt in Q3 due to the escalating costs induced by the hurricanes.Given this gloomy backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await earnings reports of key railroads companies like CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) on Oct 17.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CSX Corporation is not expected to report better-than-expected earnings per share in this quarter despite the improvement in coal revenues.The bullish sentiment pertaining to the commodity is reflected by the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter coal revenues is $530 million, much higher than the $501 million expected in the second quarter of 2017.  In fact, this Jacksonville, FL-based company’s intermodal segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $451 million, again higher than the $446 million expected in the second quarter of 2017. Despite the bullish top-line scenario, the bottom line is expected to be hurt by increased costs induced by the hurricanes. Also, the recent service issues encountered by the company may hurt results.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat earnings estimates in Q3, despite its Zacks Rank #3. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.88%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of -1.33% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteMeanwhile, improvement in the coal-related scenario is a positive for Canadian Pacific Railway as well. Freight revenues from the grain and potash units should also be impressive in Q3. However, high costs are likely to hurt the bottom line of the Calgary, Canada-based company. Consequently, our proven model too does not show that Canadian Pacific is likely to outperform with respect to the bottom line in Q3, despite its Zacks Rank #3. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of - 0.66%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31 per share is currently pegged at 2 cents above the Most Accurate estimate.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of –0.98% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian Pacific Railway Limited Quote5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1262,CSX,"Finance Earnings in the Spotlight
"
1263,CSX,"The 2014 Q2 reporting season is underway and we have results from 27 S&P 500 members. The reporting pace accelerates this week, with 153 companies announcing second-quarter results, including 60 S&P 500 members. While the Finance sector is heavily represented on this week’s reporting docket, we have enough bellwethers from other sectors to give us a good sense of this earnings season.  
"
1264,CSX,"The low expectations for the Finance sector were borne out by the Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) report and will most likely be reconfirmed by this week’s Finance-heavy line-up of results. One could read through from the Wells Fargo report, particularly on the core banking front, for this week’s reporters. But J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) reporting this week have sizable capital markets operations that will likely dominate their overall results even if their core banking results reflect the trends we saw with Wells.
"
1265,CSX,"That said, Wells’ performance with respect to loan and deposit growth and persistent net-interest margin pressures are relevant to the broader industry. With key drivers of core profitability for the group, like net interest income and fee revenues, not expected to show any material improvement in Q2, overall ‘core’ banking earnings will be essentially the same as we have been seeing in recent quarters.
"
1266,CSX,"On the capital markets front, improvement in investment banking (M&A announcements, IPOs, etc.) gets offset by continued weakness in trading volumes, particularly with respect to the fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) business. J.P. Morgan and Citi had already indicated more on that front and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) will likely be no different. Hard to tell whether the persistent FICC weakness of the last few years is a function of cyclical forces or a result of the new more restrictive regulatory landscape, but we are unlikely to see the bottom in Q2.
"
1267,CSX,"Beyond Finance, we have plenty of leaders from other key sectors on deck for releasing results this week as well. From Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp (CSX), this week’s reports span the full spectrum of the economy. As such, this week’s reports will give us a good sense of what to expect the rest of this reporting cycle.
"
1268,CSX,"The chart below shows the number of S&P 500 members reporting results in the coming weeks. The Scorecard Thus Far (as of Friday, July 11th)
"
1269,CSX,"Total earnings for the 27 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +9.8% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 55.6% and a median surprise of +3.2%. Total revenues are up +5%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 70.4% and a median surprise of 1.9%.
"
1270,CSX,"It’s premature to draw any conclusions from this small sample of results, but the chart below shows how the earnings and revenue growth rates for Q2 thus far compare to what these same companies reported in 2014 Q1 and the 4-quarter average. Keep in mind, however, that we have a very small sample size at this stage.
"
1271,CSX," Expectations for 2014 Q2
"
1272,CSX,"The composite (or blended) growth picture for Q2, combining the actual results for the 27 companies that have reported with estimates for the 473 still-to-come reports, shows total earnings increasing by +3.2% on +1.1% higher revenues and modestly higher net margins. This would follow earnings growth of +0.8% in Q1 on +0.7% higher revenues.
"
1273,CSX,"The table below compares what is expected for Q2 with what was actually achieved in Q1.
"
1274,CSX,"Estimates for Q2 came down over the last three months, largely in-line with the negative revisions trend that has been in place for quite some time. The current expected growth rate of +3.2% is down from +5.5% at the start of the quarter. The magnitude of negative revisions in Q2, however, was relatively on the lower side relative to other recent quarters, likely indicating the analyst community’s improving growth outlook.
"
1275,CSX,"It will be interesting to see if the lower decline in Q2 estimates over the last few months will get repeated for Q3 estimates as well, which will start evolving over the coming days as companies share their business outlook for the current and coming quarters. The economic picture has no doubt improved, particularly for the U.S. economy. Europe remains stable, but appears to have lost some of its growth momentum already. China has been a source of uncertainty for some time and will likely remain so through this earnings season.
"
1276,CSX,"The chart below shows consensus earnings growth expectations for the coming quarters. 
"
1277,CSX,"Corporate guidance, which has persistently been on the weak side in recent quarters, will determine whether those expectations will hold or will need to come down.

1292,CSX,"The year 2014 set the railroads on a choppy track. Harsh winter weather had taken its toll on most of the freight transportation companies and railroads seem to be no exception. Operational efficiencies went down, while costs went up, leading some major railroads to lower their bottom-line expectations for 2014.     Zacks Industry Rank
"
1293,CSX,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, railroads are broadly grouped within the Transportation sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors).
"
1294,CSX,"We rank all the 260-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1295,CSX,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
1296,CSX,"The Zacks Industry Rank for the railroad industry is currently #32, implying that the outlook remains positive on this sector. This highlights an encouraging earnings outlook for the industry despite being persistently prone to seasonality factors. While the outlook of some of the product lines will fluctuate with seasonally, the demand outlook for Intermodal offerings remains consistently positive.
"
1297,CSX,"Expectations of improved U.S. economic growth in the coming quarters and beyond is a net positive for this economically sensitive sector. We remain optimistic as railroads are witnessing gradual recovery in Coal shipments. Further, the upsurge in petrochemical shipments has also uplifted the markets conditions of this industry leading to earnings improvement.Earnings Trends of the Sector
"
1298,CSX,"The broader Transportation sector, of which railroads are part, reflects a sustainable growth trend. In the currently underway Q1 earnings season, 95% of the sector market capitalization have reported results, with total earnings up +7% on +3.3% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 33.3% beating revenue estimates. This is better performance than the broader S&P 500, but weaker than what we saw from the same group of companies in 2013 Q4 and the 4-quarter average.
"
1299,CSX,"Nevertheless, the sector is expected to register full-year earnings growth of 7.4% in 2014. In terms of revenue expectation, the sector is expected to register 4.4% growth.
"
1300,CSX,"For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our weekly Earnings Trends report.First Quarter 2014 Financial Results
"
1301,CSX,"The major companies that have so far reported include CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report). While Union Pacific and Kansas City reported year-over-year increases in earnings, CSX recorded a drop. However, year-over-year top-line growth has consistently been on the rise for these companies.Major Contributors in 2014Intermodal
"
1302,CSX,"While most of the other commodities including Automotive and General Merchandize have shown uncertainty in growth for 2014, Intermodal volumes are strong. As a result, we expect railroads to significantly focus on Intermodal expansion and tap underserved markets with highway-to-rail conversions. According to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), North American Rail Traffic was driven by 3.3% growth in Intermodal volumes in the first quarter. The growth was largely seen in U.S. intermodal business with volume expanding 3.8% year over year.

1303,CSX,"Railroads are now looking forward to the Mexican market, which is witnessing regulatory reforms, including rail reforms, initiated by President Enrique Peña Nieto to lure foreign direct investments to boost economy. Union Pacific, which serves all six gateways between the U.S. and Mexico, is likely to seek this opportunity to increase its penetration into the Mexican market.
"
1304,CSX,"Moreover, there are major investments to look forward to this year involving Intermodal growth. These include, BNSF Railway Company’s $900 million spending on terminal, line and intermodal expansion and CSX Corp.’s investments in nine projects, Montreal terminal, capacity expansion of its northwest Ohio intermodal hub, and terminal expansion in New Orleans and Savannah.Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) has an investment plan of $487 million on developing intermodal facilities that include six projects. Further, Kansas City Southern is looking forward to its Monterrey to Nuevo Laredo track upgrade and developing its double-track corridor between Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo. It is also expanding its Sanchez Yard and focusing on developments in Interpuerto San Luis Potosi.Crude Shipment
"
1305,CSX,"According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) reports, crude oil growth may go up to 10 million barrels per day over a period of 2020 to 2040. Further, AAR reported that railroads transported 407,642 carloads of crude oil in 2013, up from 234,000 carloads in 2012. Further information suggests that crude oil accounted for around 1.4% of total Class carloads in 2013 compared to 0.03% in 2008 when the concept of crude by rail started gaining ground.  
"
1306,CSX,"According to AAR, U.S. crude oil production will increase approximately 60% from 2008 through 2014, representing estimated production of 8.5 million barrels per day by 2014 end.  This surge represents an opportunity for revenue accretion, which the railroads are trying to achieve with infrastructural development.
"
1307,CSX,"Despite the fact that rail-based crude transportation costs more ($10–$15 per barrel as against $5 a barrel through pipeline), crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail-based transport. This is due to the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale and Permian Basin in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields in Canada.
"
1308,CSX,"As a result, inadequate pipeline developments have given rise to higher penetration of railroad transportation for crude oil shipping in these areas. According to AAR’s article – Moving Crude Oil by Rail – railroad moved over 60% of North Dakota’s crude oil production, which contains the vast majority of new rail crude oil originations.   
"
1309,CSX,"Further, in terms of safety, railroads offer a better transportation avenue compared to pipeline given its better spill rate profile. According to U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), spill rate for pipelines are three times higher than rail based on crude shipments between 2002 and 2012. Additionally, railroads are simultaneously working toward tightening rail safety measures by appealing federal regulators to phase out old tank cars if these are not upgraded. Railroads are also seeking improved standards for new tank cars.
"
1310,CSX,"Major railroad companies like Norfolk are seeking expansion strategies fueled mostly by the development of the energy sector, including the gas exploration projects in Marcellus and Utica shale plays as well as ventures associated with coal and power generation. Over the coming years, the company plans to introduce 32 energy-related projects in 14 states under its service areas.
"
1311,CSX,"Canadian Pacific projects crude shipment to reach 140,000 by the end of 2015. In the coming months, we expect railroads to accelerate their investments in order to create adequate service capacity for the oil and gas markets resulting in exponential growth in crude oil shipments across the rail industry. Consequently, we expect petroleum shipments to remain favorable and emerge as a significant revenue contributor in the long term.Automotive
"
1312,CSX,"Currently, Mexico is a growing market for automotive production and assembly given the lower cost of production in the region. Although, total North American automotive shipment by rail fell 3.5% in the first quarter, the Mexican market saw a 12.8% rise in auto shipments by rail according to AAR freight rail traffic report.
"
1313,CSX,"Despite a modest first quarter, industry sources project that auto production are slated to pick up, resulting in a record level of 16 million, representing the highest sales figure since the economic downturn in 2008.
"
1314,CSX,"We believe plants established by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report), Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report), Mazda and Audi would further boost auto production in Mexico. The facilities also bode well for automotive shipments. Based on these expansions, finished vehicle production in the Mexican market is expected to reach 3.5 million units in 2015, up about 35% from the 2012 production level.
"
1315,CSX,"The growth will provide carriers like Kansas City Southern, which operates across the Gulf of Mexico, ample opportunities to ship raw material into Mexico and return the finished products to the domestic market as well as to the U.S. and Canada. The company projects Automotives shipment to register high double-digit growth in 2014. Increased export activities at the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas will support future growth along with the opening of new auto plants in Mexico this year. In addition, the company expects North American full-year auto sales growth in the range of 4–4.5%.Grain Shipments
"
1316,CSX,"Notably, 2014 is expected to be a good year for rail in terms of grain shipment. North American grain shipment for the first quarter increased 9.5%, led by 15% growth in grain shipment by the U.S. railroad.
"
1317,CSX,"However, shipping difficulties due to winter weather debarred Canadian railroads like Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway from extraordinary gains derived from a strong Canadian harvest in 2013.   Coal
"
1318,CSX,"Reduced electricity generation from coal turned into a major foe for rail freight carriers. Class I railroads originated 6.2 million coal carloads in 2012, the lowest annual total output since 1993. Coal carloads dipped below 6 million in 2013, approximately 4.4% down from 2012 levels according to AAR reports. The decline in coal carloads offset the positive impacts of gains from crude oil for U.S. railroads.
"
1319,CSX,"Fraught with issues raised by the regulatory environmental agency, decelerating demand from power plants for electricity generation and the shutdown of coal-fired power plants, there is only a bleak chance for railroads to draw any benefit from this commodity segment, which continues to contribute a large part of railroad tonnage.
"
1320,CSX,"However, according to EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, U.S. coal production will increase 4.1% to 1,024 million short tons (MMst) given higher consumption due to severe winter that affected early 2014. Coal consumption in 2014 is expected to grow 4.2% to 964 MMst in 2014 due to higher natural gas prices than 2012 levels.
"
1321,CSX,"EIA projects coal exports to total 101 MMst in 2014, which is lower than the previous projection of 107 MMst. In 2015, exports can go down even further to 96 MMs as a result of weak global economic conditions, slow demand growth rate in Asian markets, rising coal production in other countries and lower international coal prices.Rail Investments
"
1322,CSX,"Investments in development and expansion plans remain crucial when analyzing railroads prospects. These capital investments are a double-edged sword. While the investments put significant stress on margin performance, forgoing these would result in lesser growth prospects.
"
1323,CSX,"Railway investments are paramount given the evolving supply chain management and increasing role of airfreight carriers in offering freight transportation services. These investments build the required infrastructure needed for railways to stay afloat in a competitive environment not only within the railroad industry but also with other modes like truck, barges and cargo airlines.
"
1324,CSX,"As a result, investments in infrastructural projects have been an integral part of railroads development. However, this sector, characterized by huge capital influx, has been drawing funds primarily through private financing.
"
1325,CSX,"As a result, investment plans when undertaken can have a considerable impact on the liquidity position of the company and may lead to a highly leveraged balance sheet. According to AAR reports, railroads invest approximately 17% of their annualized revenues, which compares with only 3% of average U.S. manufactures’ revenues on capital expenditures.
"
1326,CSX,"According to DOT, the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88% by 2035. As a result, Class I carriers would have to expedite their investments to meet this growing demand.
"
1327,CSX,"It is estimated that railroads would require $149 billion to improve rail network infrastructure within this stipulated period.
"
1328,CSX,"Given the growing demand and need to upgrade railroad infrastructure to meet new regulations, deployment of fuel-efficient locomotives, upcoming rules on track sharing, railroad safety and high-speed rail services make it mandatory for railroads to infuse more capital on development projects. According to DOT, almost 90% of the railway capacity needs to be upgraded to meet the expected rise in demand level by 2035.  Hence, for railroads it is important to balance profitability levels while investing in infrastructural development projects.
"
1329,CSX,"Currently, the U.S. railroad industry dominates less than 50% of total freight in America, indicating a huge opportunity for increasing market share. This opportunity can only be exploited by building railroad infrastructure that caters to the varied requirements of shippers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1330,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of opportunities that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function in a seller’s market and have enjoyed pricing power since 1980, when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike prices on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry. As a result, of the Staggers Rail Act, railroads are hiking their freight rates by nearly 5% per annum on average, while maintaining a double-digit profit margin.Duopolistic Market Structures: Railroads have by and large gained by practicing discretionary pricing in the freight market. In the prevailing duopolistic rail industry, railroad operators will be able to reap maximum benefits from rising prices when the overall demand grows.
"
1331,CSX,"This remains evident from the geographic distribution of markets between major railroads. Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe control the western part of the U.S., while CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern control the eastern part. On the other hand, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National control inter country rail shipment between the U.S. and Canada.CHALLENGES
"
1332,CSX,"Despite the above mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, faces certain external and internal challenges. These are as follows:Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructural improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Moreover, industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Positive Train Control Mandate: The Rail Safety Improvement Act 2008 (RSIA) has mandated the installation of PTC (Positive Train Control) by Dec 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that involve passenger operations. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued its final rule in Jan 2010, on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs for the rail industry at large.Price Regulations: The pricing practices of U.S. freight railroads are the major reasons of friction with captive shippers, who move their products through rail and do not have effective alternatives. According to the latest studies by the STB, approximately 35% of the annual freight rail is captive to a single railroad, allowing it monopoly pricing practices.
"
1333,CSX,"The unfair pricing power exhibited by the U.S. railroads has attracted congressional intervention for exercising stringent federal regulations on railroads. Congress has discussed railroad price regulation but has not passed any new rule so far.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Railroads remain concerned about the proposed regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for power plants across 27 states. The proposed guideline –– Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants –– aims at restricting emission of carbon dioxide by new power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The standard proposes new power plants to limit their carbon-dioxide emission to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour.
"
1334,CSX,"Power plants fueled by natural gas have already met these standards but the majority of the units using conventional resources like coal are exceeding the set limit, as they emit an average of 1,800 pounds of carbon-dioxide per megawatt-hour. Railroads, which transport nearly two-thirds of the coal shipment, are most likely to be impacted by the implementation of the new regulation that could pose a significant threat to utility coal tonnage.
"
1335,CSX,"A Make or Break Week for Q1 Earnings Season
"
1336,CSX,"The 2014 Q1 reporting season is underway and we have results from 29 S&P 500 members. The reporting pace accelerates this week, with 126 companies announcing first-quarter results, including 56 S&P 500 members. While the Finance sector is heavily represented in this week’s list of companies reporting results, we have enough bellwethers from other sectors to give us a good representative of the Q1 earnings season.  
"
1337,CSX,"The low expectations for the Finance sector were borne out by the J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) report and will most likely be reconfirmed by this week’s Finance-heavy line-up of results. There is plenty of read through from the J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) reports, most of it negative, for this week’s reporters, particularly Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C).
"
1338,CSX,"The mortgage banking weakness has been well known and no one was surprised by the sharp declines at both J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo on that front. But even J.P. Morgan’s top-notch investment banking franchise couldn’t shield its results from the persistently weak capital market flows and volumes, particularly on the fixed income side. It doesn’t bode well for Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citigroup, though Morgan Stanley has steadily reduced its reliance on the capital markets business.
"
1339,CSX,"Beyond Finance, we have plenty of leaders from other key sectors on deck for releasing results this week as well. From Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and others in the Technology sector to Coke (KO  -  Free Report) and Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report) in Consumer Staples and Transportation bellwethers like Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp (CSX) and much more in between, this week’s reports span the full spectrum of the economy. As such, it may not be unfair to characterize this as the make or break week for the Q1 earnings season. The trends established this week will likely carry through the rest of this reporting cycle with only minor changes.   Scorecard for 2014 Q1 (as of Friday, April 10th)
"
1340,CSX,"Total earnings for the 29 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +3.2% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 58.6% and a median surprise of +2.5%. Total revenues are up +2.4%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 37.9% and a median surprise of -0.2%. Ex-finance is 12.7%
"
1341,CSX,"It’s premature to draw any conclusions from this small sample of results, but the growth rates and beat ratios for these 29 companies in Q1 are weaker than what we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters. It has overall been a fairly uninspiring start to the Q1 earnings season.
"
1342,CSX,"The chart below shows how the earnings and revenue growth rates for Q1 thus far compare to what these same companies reported in 2013 Q4 and the 4-quarter average. Keep in mind, however, that we have a very small sample size at this stage.Expectations for 2014 Q1
"
1343,CSX,"Total Q1 earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are currently expected to be down -4.0% from the same period last year, a material decline from the +2.1% growth expected in early January 2014. Estimates for Q1 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2013 Q4 earnings calls, consistent with the trend we have been seeing for more than a year now.
"
1344,CSX,"The negative revision trend is widespread, but is particularly notable for the Retail, Basic Materials, Autos, Consumer Staples, and the Energy sectors, as the chart below shows.
"
1345,CSX,"With roughly two-thirds of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations in any reporting cycle, actual Q1 results will almost certainly be better than these pre-season expectations. But Q1 is unlikely to repeat the performance of the last few quarters where we would witness a new all-time earnings total record each quarter. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new all-time record of $267.4 billion in 2013 Q4.
"
1346,CSX,"Current estimates for 2014 Q1 aggregate to a quarterly total of $247.1 billion, but the expectation is that Q1 will be the low point for earnings this year, both in terms of earnings totals as well as the growth rate. Consensus expectations reflect a rebound in Q2, with the earnings totals in each of the following three quarters of the year setting new all-time records one after the other.
"
1347,CSX,"The chart below shows the aggregate quarterly earnings for the S&P 500 as whole. 
"
1348,CSX,"Given the low Q1 expectations, it wouldn’t take much for companies to come out ahead of them. Roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500 members beat earnings expectations every quarter any way. So, more results along those lines would be nothing new and wouldn’t tell us much about the health of corporate earnings.
"
1349,CSX,"What we haven’t seen for a while instead is some evidence of strength on the revenue front and favorable comments from management teams about business outlook. Corporate guidance has been negative for almost two years now, causing estimates to keep coming down and the long hoped-for earnings growth turnaround getting pushed forward.  Guidance is important in any earnings season, but it is particularly important this time around given the relatively elevated expectations for the second half of the year and beyond.

1363,CSX,"The following is an excerpt from the Earnings Trend report, to see the full report, please click here. Uninspiring Start to Q4 Earnings Season
"
1364,CSX,"The 2013 Q4 earnings season ramps up in the coming days, but we have results from 52 S&P 500 members already, as of Friday January 17th. And even though the early going has been Finance weighted, the overall picture emerging from the results thus far isn’t very inspiring.
"
1365,CSX,"The earnings reports thus far may not offer a representative sample for the S&P 500 as a whole. But we do have a good enough sample for the Finance sector as the 19 Finance sector companies that have reported already account for 47.5% of the sector’s total market capitalization and contribute more than 50% of the sector’s total Q4 earnings.
"
1366,CSX,"The sector’s better looking earnings growth picture is primarily due to easy comparisons, particularly at Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report). But in fairness to Bank of America, it didn’t simply benefit from easy comparisons, its earnings report actually was very good. Outside of Bank of America and perhaps Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), the rest of the Finance sector results were actually so-so; while we didn’t see any major mishaps, nothing stood out for positive reasons either.
"
1367,CSX,"Finance sector earnings growth has been primarily a function of cost controls, reserve releases, and some modest momentum in capital markets activity. Loan growth still remains anemic and the mortgage business is steadily losing ground, keeping top-line gains hard to come by.
"
1368,CSX,"Total earnings for the 19 Finance sector companies that have reported already are up +14.2% on -1% lower revenues. The earnings beat ratio is 63.2%, while only 36.8% of the companies have come out with positive top-line surprises.
"
1369,CSX,"This looks good enough performance, but is actually weaker than what we had seen from these same banks in recent quarters. Not only are the earnings and revenue growth rates for the companies below what they achieved in Q3 and the 4-quarter average, but the beat ratios are weaker as well. The insurance industry, the sector’s largest industry behind the large banks, has still to report results and could potentially turnaround this growth and surprise picture for the sector.  
"
1370,CSX,"We haven’t seen that many reports from companies outside of the Finance sector. But the few that we have seen don’t inspire much confidence. Hard to characterize any other way what we have seen from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and even GE (GE  -  Free Report). But it’s still relatively early and we will know more in the coming days.
"
1371,CSX,"The composite picture for Q4 – combining the results for the 52 companies that have reported already with the 448 still to come – is for earnings growth of +7.1% on +1.5% higher revenues and 50 basis points higher margins. The actual Q4 growth rally will most likely be higher than this, a function of management’s well refined expectations management skills.
"
1372,CSX,"But even this growth rate will be the highest quarterly growth pace of 2013, as the chart below shows. 
"
1373,CSX,"The chart above is a picture of accelerating growth. But looks could be deceiving, as the stronger- looking Q4 growth pace is primarily a function of easy comparisons, particularly for the Finance sector (total earnings growth for the S&P 500 drops to +3.4% once Finance is excluded). Easy comparisons aside, the total level quarterly earnings for the S&P 500 appears on track for a new quarterly record.
"
1374,CSX,"More important than what happened in Q4 is the question of whether management guidance for the coming period(s) will get any better from what we have become accustomed to in recent quarters. The recent improvement in the economic backdrop has raised hopes that it will start showing up in management commentary as well.
"
1375,CSX,"My sense is that the preponderance of guidance will remain negative, as has been the case for more than a year now. This will keep downward pressure on estimates for the coming quarters. Trends on the estimate revision front have been negative for a while, but we could afford to overlook such details in the Fed-inspired rally. It will be interesting to see if investors will continue shrug estimate cuts in the post-Taper world.Key Points
"
1376,CSX,"Total earnings for the 52 S&P 500 companies that have reported results are up +14.8%, with 55.8% beating earnings expectations. Revenues for these companies are up +3.4%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 51.9%.
"
1377,CSX,"The earnings and revenue growth rates for these 52 companies are comparable to what we have seen from the same group in recent quarters, but the beat ratios are a bit on the weak side. The lack of positive surprises is ‘surprising’ following the sharp drop in Q4 estimates in the run up to the start of the reporting season.
"
1378,CSX,"Total Q4 earnings for all S&P 500 companies, combing the 52 that have reported with the 448 still to come, are expected to be up +7.1%, which reflects +1.5% revenue growth and modest gains in margins. This compares to +5.1% earnings growth in Q3.
"
1379,CSX,"Easy comparisons, particularly for the Finance sector, account for a big part of the Q4 growth. Total earnings for the Finance sector are expected to be up +25.0%. Outside of Finance, total earnings growth drops to +3.4%.  
"
1380,CSX,"Technology sector earnings are expected to be relatively flat from the year-earlier period, while earnings in the Energy, Medical, and Staples sectors are expected to be below the year-earlier level.
"
1381,CSX,"Earnings growth is expected to accelerate this year, with full-year 2014 earnings expected to be up +9.3% after the expected +4.8% growth in 2013. Total earnings are expected to increase a further +10.8% in 2015.
"
1382,CSX,"Guidance has overwhelmingly been negative in recent quarters and the trend from pre- announcements in the run up to the Q4 reporting season doesn’t appear to be much different either. It will be interesting to see if the recently quarterly trend of negative guidance will remain in place this quarter as well.

1384,CSX,"Q4 Earnings Season: Can Banks Deliver?
"
1385,CSX,"With the December jobs report now out of the way, the market can start focusing on the 2013 Q4 earnings season now. The reporting cycle doesn’t really get into high gear till next week, but we have a Finance-heavy list of 51 companies reporting results this week, including 27 S&P 500 members.
"
1386,CSX,"The Finance sector is heavily represented in this week’s reporters, with all of the sector’s big guns like J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) coming out with results this week. J.P. Morgan has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, with regulatory and litigation issues dominating the headlines. The bank’s Q4 earnings report will likely be quite ‘noisy’, but its superior core earnings power should remain intact.
"
1387,CSX,"The banking group as a whole will continue to suffer net margin pressures as loan growth remains tepid and the mortgage business continue losing ground. On the capital markets front, the equity business likely did fairly good in Q4, while the fixed income and currencies side remained under pressure. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) has a stronger equities franchise, while Goldman has always been a FICC powerhouse. Total earnings for the Finance sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.4% from the same period last year, with easy comparisons, particularly for Bank of America and the insurers, driving the year-over-year growth.  
"
1388,CSX,"The Q4 earnings season has gotten underway already, with results from 24 S&P 500 members out. Total earnings for these 24 companies (not EPS, median or otherwise) are up +18.6% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 54.2% and a median surprise of +1.5%. Total revenues are up +7.2%, with an impressive revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 66.7% and a median surprise of +1.5%. Comparing the results for this admittedly small of number of companies with what we saw from the same group in Q3 and the last few quarters, the earnings and revenue growth rates and the revenue beat ratio compare favorably, while the earnings beat ratio is a bit on the weak side.
"
1389,CSX,"But at this stage, the Q4 earnings season’s story isn’t about the few companies that have reported, but bulk of those whose results are awaited. To that point, the ‘composite’ picture for Q4, where we combine the results from the 24 companies that have reported already with the 476 still to come, is for growth rate of +6.3%. This reflects +1.2% higher revenues and net margin gains of about 50 basis points. Finance remains a big growth driver in Q4 – total earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q4 drops to +3.7% once the sector is excluded.  
"
1390,CSX,"As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, the current +6.3% growth rate for Q4 represents a sharp drop over the last three months, as the chart below shows. 
"
1391,CSX,"This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q3 earnings season was no different. Estimates for most sectors came down since the quarter got underway, but the Q4 revisions were particularly pronounced for the Industrials, Finance, Autos and Energy sectors.
"
1392,CSX,"The earnings growth expected in Q4 at this stage of the reporting cycle is the highest that we have seen in any of the last few quarters. A big reason for that is easy comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represented the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector, helping produce the sector’s impressive +19.4% growth rate.
"
1393,CSX,"Within the Finance sector, the comparisons are particularly easy for the insurance industry – the industry alone accounts for more than a quarter of the sector’s total earnings – given the impact on the industry’s profitability from the East Coast storms in late 2012. Total earnings for the insurance industry are expected to be up more than +40% in Q4, with all the major industry players like Chubb (CB) and Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) producing strong growth rates.   
"
1394,CSX,"While easy comparisons are driving the year over year growth rate in Q4, there hasn’t been much growth lately despite very high level overall total earnings. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 reached an all-time record at $262.5 billion, surpassing the previous record reached the quarter before. Current estimates for Q4 work out to a modestly lower total for the quarter. But when all is said and done about Q4, we will likely have seen another quarterly record.
"
1395,CSX,"But of more interest than Q4 growth will be management guidance for 2014. Companies typically provide guidance only for the following quarter, but they do tend to discuss their outlook their outlook for the coming year on the Q4 earnings calls. It will be interesting to see if management teams see any material improvement in the earnings picture this year along the lines of current consensus earnings expectations for 2014. Total earnings are expected to be up +10% in 2014, up from +4.6% growth in 2013, with most of the growth coming in the back half of the year.Monday-1/13

1409,CSX,"After enduring difficulties in 2013, the railroad industry’s resilience seems to have finally paid off. The industry’s optimal operational efficiency amid an economic downturn and uncertain market conditions has readied it for a healthier 2014.
"
1410,CSX,"Despite predictions of further headwinds in Coal -- one of the major product shipments of rail – the sector emerged strongly on infrastructural developments that supported natural gas and petrochemical product shipments.Zacks Industry Rank
"
1411,CSX,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, railroads are broadly grouped in Transportation (one of 16 Zacks sectors).
"
1412,CSX,"We rank all the 260-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1413,CSX,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
1414,CSX,"The Zacks Industry Rank for the railroad industry is currently #24, implying that the outlook remains positive on this sector. This highlights an optimistic outlook on the industry as railroads are delivering margin growth with gradual recovery in Coal shipments. Further, the upsurge in petrochemical shipments has also uplifted the markets conditions of this industry leading to earnings improvement.  Earnings Trend of the Sector
"
1415,CSX,"The broader Transportation sector, of which railroads are part, reflects a stable growth trend. All sector participants have reported third-quarter results, which have been fairly good in terms of both beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) and growth.
"
1416,CSX,"The earnings and revenues ""beat ratio” for the quarter was 63.6% for the transportation sector. Total earnings for the companies in this sector grew 13.2% year over year on 4.5% revenue growth. Both revenues and earnings showed significant improvement from second quarter growth of 8.3% and 2.2%, respectively.   
"
1417,CSX,"The Consensus earnings expectation is pegged at 16.7% for the fourth quarter of 2013. Overall, the sector is expected to register full-year growth of 15.8% in 2013 followed by an estimated 16.8% growth in the first quarter of 2014. In terms of revenue expectation, the sector is expected to register 4.4% growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in an annual growth rate of 3.5%. The sector is expected to register revenue growth of 4.6% in the first quarter of 2014.
"
1418,CSX,"For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our weekly Earnings Trends reports.Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results
"
1419,CSX,"Going by the quarterly performance of the class 1 freight railroad carriers, we see that most of the companies under Zacks coverage surpassed earnings estimates for the third quarter. These include Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report).  Only one carrier, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), narrowly missed Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, all these carriers have shown significant growth from the year-ago quarter based on volume expansion, strong pricing and cost control measures.  
"
1420,CSX,"Further, we believe rising employee productivity, deployment of fuel-efficient locomotives and undertaking railroad safety measures were some of the key drivers of profitability for the railroads in adverse market conditions.Upcoming Results
"
1421,CSX,"Growth estimates for railroads for the upcoming quarter suggest a strong momentum in earnings. For Canadian Pacific, earnings growth projection is 46.75% and earnings estimate is pegged at $1.88. Canadian National is expected to deliver earnings growth of 10.75%, resulting in earnings per share of 78 cents as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1422,CSX,"U.S. carriers like Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City also remain on the growth trajectory with growth estimates of 14.37%, 14.50% and 25.87%, respectively.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City is pegged at $2.50, $1.49 and $1.15, respectively.  What to Look For in 2014
"
1423,CSX,"There are several near-term catalysts in the railroad industry, which will determine the road ahead for the railroads in the upcoming year.Rising Contribution of Petroleum Product Shipment
"
1424,CSX,"According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) reports, crude oil growth may go up to 10 million barrels per day over a period of 2020 to 2040.
"
1425,CSX,"This surge represents an opportunity for revenue accretion, which the railroads are trying to achieve with infrastructural development. According to industry sources, the role of crude oil as a revenue contributor has grown by leaps and bounds in a four-year span from a mere 3% to 30% of the oil and petroleum products shipment by railroads.
"
1426,CSX,"Despite the fact that rail-based crude transportation costs five times more ($10–$15 per barrel), crude shippers are compelled to rely on rail-based transport. This is due to the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key oil and gas fields like Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale and Permian basin in Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields in Canada.
"
1427,CSX,"As a result, inadequate pipeline developments have given rise to higher penetration of railroads transportation for crude oil shipping in these areas. According to reports, rail-loading capacity is expected to grow to 200,000 b/d by 2013 for crude oil shipments from Western Canada.
"
1428,CSX,"Major railroad companies like Norfolk are seeking expansion strategies fueled mostly by the development of the energy sector, including the gas exploration projects in Marcellus and Utica shale plays as well as ventures associated with coal and power generation. Over the coming years, the company plans to introduce 32 energy-related projects in 14 states under its service areas.
"
1429,CSX,"Canadian Pacific projects crude shipment to reach up to 70,000 oil-tank cars by the year-end and move to 140,000 by the end of 2015. In the coming months, we expect railroads to accelerate their investments in order to create adequate service capacity for the oil and gas markets resulting in exponential growth in crude oil shipments across the rail industry. Consequently, we expect petroleum shipments to remain favorable and emerge as a significant revenue contributor in the long term.Automotive
"
1430,CSX,"Currently, Mexico is a growing market for automotive production and assembly given the lower cost of production in the region. In the first six months of 2013, auto shipments by rail in Mexico increased 2.7 while in the U.S., auto shipment via rail rose about 3.7%. This growth was largely offset by 5.9% drop in rail auto shipments in the Canadian market. However, despite a modest first half of the year, industry sources project that auto production are slated to pick up, resulting in a record level of 16 million, representing the highest sales figure since the economic downturn in 2008.  
"
1431,CSX,"We believe upcoming plants by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY), Mazda and Audi would further boost auto production in Mexico. The facilities also bode well for automotive shipments. Based on these proposed expansion plans, finished vehicle production in the Mexican market is expected to reach 3.5 million units in 2015, up about 35% from the 2012 production level. The growth will provide carriers like Kansas City Southern, which operates across the Gulf of Mexico, ample opportunities to ship raw material into Mexico and return the finished products to the domestic market as well as to the U.S. and Canada.Intermodal
"
1432,CSX,"The railroad industry is gaining largely from the ongoing conversion of traffic from truckload to rail intermodal. On average, railroads are considered 300% more fuel-efficient than trucks, resulting in the growing importance of rail intermodal.
"
1433,CSX,"As a result, railroad companies are increasingly focusing on building their intermodal network across U.S. and bordering nations. Leading freight railroad company, CSX Corp. is currently keen on tapping the underserved Eastern Intermodal market which has projected volumes of 9 million carloads spanning 550 miles yet to be converted into  rail intermodal network from truckload.
"
1434,CSX,"The company is also concentrating on the Northwest Ohio Intermodal Terminal given the growing demand in that area. Further, the company is likely to gain from the expansion of key intermodal terminals in 2013 and awaiting completion of terminals Winter Haven in Central Florida and Salaberry-de-Valleyfield in Quebec in the upcoming year.  Coal
"
1435,CSX,"Fraught with issues raised by the regulatory environmental agency, decelerating demand from power plants for electricity generation and the shut down of coal-fired power plants, there is only a bleak chance for railroads to draw any benefit from this commodity segment, which continues to contribute a large part of railroad tonnage.
"
1436,CSX,"According to EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook, U.S. coal exports have gone down 8.1% in the first three quarters of 2013.  EIA projects Coal exports to total 118 million short tons (MMst) in 2013, which is lower by 7 MMst from last year. In 2014, exports are predicted to go down even further to 107 MMst.
"
1437,CSX,"However, Coal consumption in the U.S. market also has modestly benefited from the recent hike in natural gas prices. According to EIA reports, total coal consumption for 2013 is expected to reach 928 MMst in the U.S, which shows an estimated 4.4% increase over 2012. Further, growth will continue in 2014 with estimated consumption increase of 2.2% to 948 MMst. Although, coal export shipments constitute a large part of railroad shipment, we believe an uptick in the domestic market will help railroads manage coal headwinds to some extent.  Grain Shipments
"
1438,CSX,"Notably, 2013 is expected to be a good year in Grain exports, implying an opportunity to benefit from volume expansion in this product segment. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Agricultural Outlook, agricultural exports are expected to reach $140.0 billion on estimated growth in exports to countries like Canada, Brazil, European Union, offset by a likely drop in shipments to South Korea, Mexico, North Africa, and the Middle East. In addition, imports are also expected to rise the past few years to $105 billion.
"
1439,CSX,"According to the USDA, agricultural exports in 2014 are forecasted at $135 billion, down from an estimated $140 billion for 2013. The decline will result from an expected fall in oilseeds and products, grain and feed exports and cotton exports. However, since imports are expected to rise with gains in horticultural products, sugar and tropical products, we expect agricultural products to have a neutral impact on railroad carloads in the coming year.Rail Investments
"
1440,CSX,"Investment in development and expansion plans remain critical when analyzing railroads prospects. These capital investments are a double-edged sword. While the investments put significant stress on margin performance, forgoing these would result in lesser growth prospects.
"
1441,CSX,"Railway investments are paramount given the evolving supply chain management and increasing role of airfreight carriers in offering freight transportation services. These investments build the required infrastructure needed for railways to stay afloat in a competitive environment not only within the railroad industry but also with other modes like truck, barges and cargo airlines.
"
1442,CSX,"As a result, investments in infrastructural projects have been an integral part of railroads development. However, this sector, characterized by huge capital influx, has been drawing funds primarily through private financing.
"
1443,CSX,"As a result, investment plans when undertaken can have a considerable impact on the liquidity position of the company and may lead to a highly leveraged balance sheet. According to AAR reports, railroads invest approximately 17% of their annualized revenues, which compares with only 3% of average U.S. manufactures’ revenues on capital expenditures.
"
1444,CSX,"According to the Department of Transportation (DOT), the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88% by 2035. As a result, Class I carriers would have to expedite their investments to meet this growing demand.
"
1445,CSX,"It is estimated that railroads would require $149 billion to improve rail network infrastructure within this stipulated period. With respect to current investment requirements, railroads would invest about $24.5 billion in 2013 according to AAR. This projects an escalating trend when compared with recorded investment of $23 billion in 2012 and $12 billion in 2011, as per AAR.
"
1446,CSX,"Given the growing demand and need to upgrade railroad infrastructure to meet new regulations, deployment of fuel-efficient locomotives, upcoming rules on track sharing, railroad safety and high-speed rail services make it mandatory for railroads to infuse more capital on development projects. According to DOT, almost 90% of the railway capacity needs to be upgraded to meet the expected rise in demand level by 2035.  Hence, for railroads it is important to balance profitability levels while investing in infrastructural development projects.
"
1447,CSX,"Currently, the U.S. railroad industry dominates less than 50% of total freight in America, indicating a huge opportunity for increasing market share. This opportunity can only be exploited by building railroad infrastructure that caters to the varied requirements of shippers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1448,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of opportunities that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function in a seller’s market and have enjoyed pricing power since 1980, when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike prices on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry. As a result, of the Staggers Rail Act, railroads are hiking their freight rates by nearly 5% per annum on average, while maintaining a double-digit profit margin.Duopolistic Market Structures: Railroads have by and large gained by practicing discretionary pricing in the freight market. In the prevailing duopolistic rail industry, railroad operators will be able to reap maximum benefits from rising prices when the overall demand grows.
"
1449,CSX,"This remains evident from the geographic distribution of markets between major railroads. Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe control the western part of the U.S., while CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern control the eastern part. On the other hand, Canadian Pacific and Canadian National control inter country rail shipment between the U.S. and Canada.CHALLENGES
"
1450,CSX,"Despite the above mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, faces certain external and internal challenges. These are as follows:Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructural improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Moreover, industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Positive Train Control Mandate: The Rail Safety Improvement Act 2008 (RSIA) has mandated the installation of PTC (Positive Train Control) by Dec 31, 2015 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that involve passenger operations. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued its final rule in Jan 2010, on the design, operational requirements and implementation of the new technology. The final rule is expected to impose significant new costs for the rail industry at large.Price Regulations: The pricing practices of U.S. freight railroads are the major reasons of friction with captive shippers, who move their products through rail and do not have effective alternatives. According to the latest studies by the STB, approximately 35% of the annual freight rail is captive to a single railroad, allowing it monopoly pricing practices.
"
1451,CSX,"The unfair pricing power exhibited by the U.S. railroads has attracted congressional intervention for exercising stringent federal regulations on railroads. Congress has discussed railroad price regulation but has not passed any new rule so far.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Railroads remain concerned about the proposed regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for power plants across 27 states. The proposed guideline –– Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants –– aims at restricting emission of carbon dioxide by new power plants under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The standard proposes new power plants to limit their carbon-dioxide emission to 1,000 pounds per megawatt-hour.
"
1452,CSX,"Power plants fueled by natural gas have already met these standards but the majority of the units using conventional resources like coal are exceeding the set limit, as they emit an average of 1,800 pounds of carbon-dioxide per megawatt-hour. Railroads, which transport nearly two-thirds of the coal shipment, are most likely to be impacted by the implementation of the new regulation that could pose a significant threat to utility coal tonnage.
"
1453,CSX,"Earnings Preview 10/08/10
"
1454,CSX,"The third quarter earnings season is now “officially underway. However, we still have a relatively light earnings release schedule, with a total of only 65 firms, but that includes 18 from the S&P 500.
"
1455,CSX,"We define any fiscal period ending in August, September and October to be the third quarter. So we have already been getting some “pre-season games of firms with fiscal periods that end in August, but those have just been a trickle. As of the 10/7 close, only 6% of the S&P 500 had reported. The 18 from the S&P 500 include some of the most important bellwethers of the U.S. market, including CSX (CSX  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Google (GOOG) and Gannett (GCI). Together they should give some interesting clues on the overall economy.
"
1456,CSX,"On the economic data front, things are going to start slowly, but we have several important numbers due out later in the week. While not a number per se, the minutes of the last Fed meeting are due out on Monday, and will be looked at closely to judge the odds for a second round of quantitative easing (QE2). Wednesday we get the Budget Deficit, which will wrap up the fiscal year. Thursday follows with the even more important deficit -- the trade deficit -- as well as producer prices. Friday wraps up with Consumer Prices and Retail sales.MondayNo numbers, just the minutes of the 9/21 Fed meeting. These will offer important clues as to if the Fed will announce buying longer term T-notes at its meeting on 11/3, and if so, the magnitude of such a purchase program. Based on recent speeches by Fed officials, this seems to be a very contentious issue within the Fed. Personally I favor the idea, but additional monetary stimulus will only help at the margin to get the economy going again. What we really need is more fiscal stimulus.TuesdayThe weekly data on mortgage applications is due out. Recently, most of the activity in mortgages has been due to refinancing as mortgage rates have tumbled to their lowest levels in decades. Purchase applications have been soft, but if they pick up, it would be an indication of a rebound in existing home sales.WednesdayThe Federal Budget deficit is expected to come in at 59.5 billion, up from 46.6 billion a year ago. The data is highly seasonal, but is not seasonally adjusted, so it is the year-over-year comparison that should be looked at. This month wraps up the fiscal year. Through the first 11 months of the fiscal year the Federal Government has spilled $1.26 Trillion worth of red ink, down 8.1% from the $1.37 Trillion spilled in the first 11 months of fiscal 2009.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell by 11,000 in the last week to 445,000. They have fallen in six of the last seven weeks. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have been locked in a tight “trading range. Look for them to fall modestly next week. If they do, they will break out of the trading range to the downside. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A rate of over 500,000 signals that the unemployment rate is probably headed back up and a high probability of a double dip.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late. Last week they fell by 48,000 to 4.462 million. That is down 1.525 million from a year ago. Some of the longer-term decline was due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims rose by 257,000 to 5.135 million. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 9.597 million, which is up 208,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 262,000 below year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many in the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The Producer Price Index (PPI) for finished goods is expected to increase by 0.3% in September, down from a 0.4% increase in August. Inflation pressures are likely to be higher further up the production pipeline for intermediate and crude goods. Excluding the volatile food and energy components to get the core PPI, prices are expected to rise 0.2%, up from just 0.1% in August. Overall inflationary pressure remain very subdued, reflecting the vast amount of slack in the economy.The Trade Deficit is expected to rise to $44.5 billion for August from 42.8 billion in July. This is probably the most important number to be released for the week, and if the trade deficit does rise as expected it will be bad news. The big slowdown in GDP growth we saw from the first quarter to the second quarter can almost entirely be blamed on the deterioration in the Trade Deficit (or, more precisely, net exports). A big increase in the deficit for August would be a very bad omen for GDP growth in the third quarter. Given the recent sharp decline in the dollar it would be disappointing, but currency moves often have significant lags before they affect net exports. Particularly for the short term, the trade deficit is a FAR bigger economic problem than is the budget deficit.FridayThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to increase just 0.2% in September, down from a 0.3% increase in August. If food and energy prices are excluded, the rise is expected to be just 0.1%, matching the rise in August. One of the key reasons we have seen virtually no inflation to speak of so far this year -- particularly core inflation -- is that the cost of shelter has been flat to down. Rent and Owners Equivalent Rent are by far the biggest part of the CPI, accounting for almost a third of the total index and close to 40% of the core index.The N.Y. Fed manufacturing survey is expected to rise to 7.0 for October from 4.1 in September. This is sort of like a mini-ISM number, but with 0.0 as the point dividing expansion from contraction. Thus if the consensus is right, manufacturing activity in New York State will be expanding, and at a faster rate than in August. A reading of 7.0, however, is still quite sluggish.Earnings CalendarCompany Ticker Qtr End EPS Est Year Ago EPS Last EPS Surprise % Next EPS Report Date Time Daily PriceGLOBAL PAYMENTS GPN        201008 $0.69  $0.71  1.75 20101011 AMC $41.78 OCZ TECHNOLOGY  OCZ        201008 ($0.11) NA  N/A 20101011 DMT $3.15 POSCO-ADR       PKX        201009 NA $3.13  N/A 20101011   $120.15 ZEP INC         ZEP        201008 $0.38  $0.31  15.38 20101011 AMC $17.41 AUDIOVOX CORP   VOXX       201008 $0.00  $0.12  300 20101012 AMC $6.84 BANCO LATINOAME BLX        201009 $0.37  $0.43  -82.14 20101012 AMC $14.52 CENTURY BCP-A   CNBKA      201009 $0.51  $0.58  -3.57 20101012 AMC $23.78 CSX CORP        CSX        201009 $1.04  $0.74  10.31 20101012 AMC $56.69 EXFO INC        EXFO       201008 $0.02  ($0.02) -100 20101012 AMC $5.82 FASTENAL        FAST       201009 $0.50  $0.32  6.82 20101012 BTO $53.69 HEALTHCARE SERV HCSG       201009 $0.21  $0.19  0 20101012 AMC $23.89 INTEL CORP      INTC       201009 $0.50  $0.33  18.6 20101012 AMC $19.40 KAYNE ANDSN EGY KED        201008 $0.40  NA  -54.29 20101012 AMC $16.10 KMG CHEMICALS   KMGB       201007 $0.28  $0.44  337.5 20101012 BTO $13.92 LINEAR TEC CORP LLTC       201009 $0.61  $0.27  5.88 20101012 AMC $30.83 MISTRAS GROUP   MG         201008 $0.06  $0.04  14.29 20101012 AMC $11.36 NATL AMER UNIV  NAUH       201008 $0.09  NA  163.64 20101012 BTO $7.73 OIL DRI CORP AM ODC        201007 $0.34  $0.35  9.37 20101012   $21.32 SYNERGETICS USA SURG       201007 NA $0.00  N/A 20101012 AMC $3.10 ACERGY SA       ACGY       201008 $0.26  $0.29  -3.85 20101013   $19.63 ADTRAN INC      ADTN       201009 $0.43  $0.34  25.71 20101013   $35.38 APOLLO GROUP    APOL       201008 $1.29  $1.06  12.26 20101013 AMC $49.85 ASML HOLDING NV ASML       201009 $0.74  $0.07  15.25 20101013 BTO $29.48 AUTHENTIDATE HD ADAT       201009 ($0.03) ($0.06) -50 20101013 AMC $0.59 BANK OZARKS     OZRK       201009 $0.61  $0.50  14.29 20101013 AMC $38.24 DELTA GALIL-LTD DELTY      201009 NA $0.36  N/A 20101013   $8.20 HOST HOTEL&RSRT HST        201009 $0.11  $0.11  4.55 20101013 BTO $15.27 IGATE CORP      IGTE       201009 $0.22  $0.16  17.65 20101013 BTO $17.19 JPMORGAN CHASE  JPM        201009 $0.89  $0.80  53.52 20101013 BTO $39.52 MEDTOX SCIENTIF MTOX       201009 $0.13  $0.09  -15.38 20101013 BTO $11.00 SPARTAN STORES  SPTN       201009 $0.44  $0.47  3.57 20101013 AMC $14.49 TESSCO TECH INC TESS       201009 $0.44  $0.34  4 20101013 AMC $15.55 UNIVL FST PRODS UFPI       201009 $0.52  $0.51  -21.35 20101013 AMC $30.04 WD 40 CO        WDFC       201008 $0.38  $0.46  28.57 20101013 AMC $39.05 ADV MICRO DEV   AMD        201009 $0.06  ($0.26) 100 20101014 AMC $6.87 AMER APPAREL    APP        201009 ($0.05) $0.05  0 20101014 BTO $1.16 COMMERCE BANCSH CBSH       201009 $0.68  $0.63  22.41 20101014 BTO $38.32 CUBIST PHARM    CBST       201009 $0.41  $0.42  9.76 20101014   $23.94 FAIRCHILD SEMI  FCS        201009 $0.39  $0.12  29.03 20101014 BTO $9.25 GOOGLE INC-CL A GOOG       201009 $5.89  $5.13  -1.21 20101014 AMC $530.01 GRAINGER W W    GWW        201009 $1.81  $1.51  10 20101014 BTO $121.99 HUNT (JB) TRANS JBHT       201009 $0.44  $0.31  11.11 20101014 AMC $35.42 IDT CORP-CL B   IDT        201007 NA  NA  N/A 20101014 AMC $17.22 JOES JEANS INC  JOEZ       201008 $0.01  $0.03  0 20101014 AMC $2.10 LANDSTAR SYSTEM LSTR       201009 $0.49  $0.39  2.08 20101014 BTO $37.96 MGIC INVSTMT CP MTG        201009 ($0.63) ($4.44) 93.65 20101014 BTO $9.42 MISSION WEST    MSW        201009 $0.14  $0.13  14.29 20101014   $6.85 NOVAGOLD RSRCS NG         201008 NA ($0.09) N/A 20101014   $9.16

1472,CSX,">>
"
1473,CSX,"An improving U.S. economy, massive surge in automotive shipments, and a sharp rebound in many end-markets are expected to fuel the future growth of the railroad industry. Freight rail is a “derived demand industry -- demand for rail services is tied to the demand for the products that railroads haul. Rail traffic, therefore, acts as a solid barometer of the overall health of the economy. With the U.S. economy emerging from the recession, the fortunes of the railroad industry are also on the mend.
"
1474,CSX,"The U.S. freight railroad industry is witnessing gradual improvement since early 2010. As the U.S. economy continues to grow, albeit at the pace of expansion moderating modestly temporarily in the second half of 2010, demand for carriage also becomes robust and the momentum is expected to sustain in the long-run.
"
1475,CSX,"In the second quarter of 2010, all the Class 1 freight railroad operators in the U.S. achieved commendable results, primarily due to significant improvement in operating metrics, massive growth in business volume and pricing gains. The latest report of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the main trade body of the industry, is even more encouraging.Increasing Freight Loads
"
1476,CSX,"The recent AAR report clearly shows that freight load activity is quickly approaching the pre-recession 2008 level, and if the trend continues, volumes will likely exceed the 2008 level. In August 2010, total carload volume per week was higher than any month since November 2008. The positive momentum is affirmed as the report says carload volume of the first week of September was highest so far in 2010.Improved Industrial Activity
"
1477,CSX,"The U.S. industrial production is expected to grow more than 3% in the second half of 2010. Intermodal traffic, mainly consisting of containers and trailers, is growing at a ramped-up rate. According to the AAR report, weekly average intermodal traffic in August 2010 was 234,000, the highest since October 2008 and up 20% year-over-year.
"
1478,CSX,"Metal and Energy products are witnessing massive shipments. The AAR report shows that demand is particularly strong for iron ore, rolled steel, several metal scraps, and oil and natural gas drilling accessories including pipe, sand and different types of clays.
"
1479,CSX,"Coal is also expected to drive continued strength for the rest of the year driven by industrial and export demand. Going forward, utility coal volumes are expected to recover year-over-year mainly due to increase in electricity generation. Furthermore, coal exports to Europe and Asia are also likely to remain buoyant in the near future.Growing Global Agricultural Demand
"
1480,CSX,"Demand for agricultural products throughout the world is also increasing. From railroad operators’ point of view, agricultural product demand is less cyclical in nature and is a hedge against economic uncertainty. The most revealing feature in the latest AAR report was that China, the largest emerging economy, is turning out to be a net importer of agricultural commodities. The recent decision of the Russian government to stop wheat exports may become a major catalyst for the U.S. grain exporters. Additionally, the AAR report states that demand for potash fertilizer, corn and soybeans also remains healthy.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1481,CSX,"The railroad industry as a whole offers a number of attributes that are difficult to ignore from the standpoint of investors.Discretionary Pricing Power: The freight railroad operators function in a seller’s market enjoying pricing power since 1980 when the U.S. government adopted the Staggers Rail Act. The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike price on captive shippers like electric utilities, chemical and agricultural companies, in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry. Because of the Staggers Rail Act, the railroads are hiking their freight rates on an average by nearly 5% per annum and maintaining double digit profit margin.Competitive Advantage: From the customers’ point of view, rail transport is cheaper and fuel-efficient than truck and ship transport. As a result, railroads are gaining market share from other means of transport. Several truck operators went bankrupt during the peak recessionary period that helped railroads become default freight transporters for mid-to-long distances.Technical Superiority: Overall, investment by railroad operators for product and service improvement is far ahead than other transportation industries. Investments in capacity, innovations and use of several state-of-the-art technologies led to service improvements and enhanced reliability. AAR claims that freight rail transporters together invested a significant amount of $42 billion in the previous two years for railroad track expansion and maintenance.
"
1482,CSX,"Currently, our best pick in the railroad industry is Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report) for which we have an Outperform recommendation. Additionally, we remain Neutral on Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP  -  Free Report) and Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI  -  Free Report). However, due to strong growth momentum of the industry, our long-term view remains positive for all these Class 1 freight railroad operators.
"
1483,CSX,"WEAKNESSES
"
1484,CSX,"Despite the above mentioned positives, the freight railroad industry, like other industries, also has some structural weaknesses. These are as follows:Government Regulations: Railroads are subject to the ratification of laws by Congress that could increase regulation of the industry. A recent report presented by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee stated that the discretionary pricing power enjoyed by the Class I freight rail transport companies are putting excessive pressure on freight customers.
"
1485,CSX,"The Senate Commerce Committee headed by Sen. John D. Rockefeller has opined that the railroads have become financially stable and a higher transportation rate is actually impacting household budgets. It remains to be seen how the railroad industry maintains growth if any adverse changes occur related to its discretionary pricing policy.Capital Intensive Nature: Railroad is a highly capital intensive industry that requires continued infrastructure improvements and acquisition of capital assets. Industry players access the credit markets for funds from time to time. Adverse conditions in the credit markets could increase overhead costs associated with issuing debt, and may limit the companies’ ability to sell debt securities on favorable terms.Unionized Labor: Most of the railroad operator’s employees are unionized and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are bargained nationally by the National Carriers Committee. In the railroad industry, negotiations generally take place over a number of years. Failure to negotiate amicably could result in strikes by the workers resulting in loss of business.
"
1486,CSX,"This week, I'm going to focus on one of my favorite valuation metrics for determining a company's under or overvaluation.  
"
1487,CSX,"Let's first start with a definition.  
"
1488,CSX,"The Price to Sales ratio is simply: Price divided Sales
"
1489,CSX,"If the Price to Sales ratio is 1, then that means you're paying $1 for every $1 of sales the company makes.  
"
1490,CSX,"A price to sales ratio of 2 means you're paying $2 for every $1 of sales the company makes.  
"
1491,CSX,"As you might have guessed, the lower the Price the Sales ratio, the better.  
"
1492,CSX,"A price to Sales ratio of .5 means you're paying 50 cents for every $1 of sales the company makes.
"
1493,CSX,"And paying less than a dollar for a dollar's worth of something is a good bargain.  
"
1494,CSX,"One of the reasons I like the Price to Sales ratio is because it looks at sales rather than earnings like the P/E ratio does.  
"
1495,CSX,"And sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement than earnings.  
"
1496,CSX,"Secondly, I'd be hard pressed to find a screen where adding the Price to Sales ratio didn't improve it.  
"
1497,CSX,"For me, I prefer to look for stocks with a Price to Sales ratio under 1. Although, I'm willing to go up to 4, depending on the industry. But I've found that the best way to use it is to find stocks with a Price to Sales ratio below the median for its Industry.  
"
1498,CSX,"And that's what we'll be focusing on in this week's screen.  
"
1499,CSX,"Let's first start with: Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2

"
1508,CSX,"During the economic downturn, the railroad industry suffered more than most industries. That’s because the railroad business is closely tied to economic growth. When the economy fell into a deep recession, there wasn’t much demand for rail transport.
"
1509,CSX,"In response to the slowdown, railroads slashed costs, streamlined operations and increased productivity. Those moves helped the industry stem the bleeding and stabilize profit margins.Improving Conditions
"
1510,CSX,"Now that the economy has rebounded and is in recovery mode, the railroad industry is making money hand over fist. Improved economic conditions are helping boost sales volumes. According to the Association of American Railroads, rail carloads increased 7.4% in the first half of 2010. Second-quarter carloads were up 13.4% in the second quarter. So far, carloads are up 13.0% in the third quarter.Operating Leverage
"
1511,CSX,"Growing sales volumes coupled with the industry’s cost-cutting efforts have led to explosive earnings growth for railroad companies, as sales gains flow through to earnings. In addition, railroad companies can handle volume growth without a commensurate increase in expenses. This is due to efficient transportation networks and the ability to extend train lengths (adding train cars) at little cost. Through the second quarter of 2010, it appears the industry’s leaner cost structure is sustainable, and that bodes well for earnings growth in the next several quarters.Valuations
"
1512,CSX,"Despite stellar earnings growth and better-than-expected earnings reports, many railroad stocks are trading at relatively cheap valuations. This suggests that the market is still focused on an economic slowdown in the second half of the year.
"
1513,CSX,"Nevertheless, railroad companies are expected to deliver impressive earnings growth in 2010 and strong double-digit growth in 2011. Yet it is easy to find railroad stocks that trade around 15x this year’s EPS estimates and 13x next year’s. In our view, that means expectations are too low on this group. That pessimism should offer some downside protection in the event that overall growth decelerates faster than the consensus expects.Risks
"
1514,CSX,"The biggest risk facing the rail industry is a slowdown in overall economic activity. The recent GDP report shows that growth in this stage of the recovery is weak. If economic growth were to decelerate further, it would negatively impact sales volumes and earnings of the railroad industry. Another risk is the rising price of fuel, which could eat into railroad’s profit margins.
"
1515,CSX,"Here are four railroad stocks that deserve a closer look:Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report)
"
1516,CSX,"Canadian National Railway engages in the rail and related transportation business in North America. It provides transportation for various goods, including petroleum and chemicals, grain and fertilizers, coal, metals and minerals, forest products, and intermodal and automotive products.
"
1517,CSX,"The company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.08 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus by 10 cents, or 10.2%. Canadian National has beaten the Zacks Consensus in the last two quarters by an average of 8.4%.
"
1518,CSX,"In the last month, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2010 are up 13 cents, or 3.4%, to $3.93. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is up 8 cents, or 1.8%, to $4.50.
"
1519,CSX,"CNI has a Zacks #2 Rank, and its shares trade at 13.8x 2010 EPS estimates and 14.3x 2011 EPS estimates.CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report)

"
1521,CSX,"For the second quarter, CSX earned $1.07 per share, an increase of 48.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. It also beat the Zacks Consensus by 10 cents, or 10.31%. In the last five quarters, CSX Corp. has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.6%. 
"

"
1523,CSX,"CSX is a Zacks #1 Rank stock. It trades at 13.9x 2010 consensus estimates and 12.0x 2011 consensus estimates.Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report)
"
1524,CSX,"Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods. Its operations consist of the transportation of coal, coke, iron ore products and automotive products.
"
1525,CSX,"For the second quarter, Norfolk Southern had EPS of $1.04, an increase of 57.5% compared to the second quarter of 2009. NSC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents, or 5.1%. In the past two quarters, Norfolk Southern has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 3.3%. 
"

"
1527,CSX,"NSC is a Zacks #1 Rank stock that trades at 14.7x 2010 Zacks Consensus and 12.5x 2011 Zacks Consensus.Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report)
"
1528,CSX,"Union Pacific provides rail transportation services in North America. It has about 32,000 route miles linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern U.S. gateways.
"
1529,CSX,"The company had earnings of $1.40 per share, 19 cents, or 15.7%, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings were up 79.5% from the year-ago period.
"
1530,CSX,"In the last month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is up 20 cents, or 4.0%, to $5.16. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is up 14 cents, or 2.4%, to $5.96.
"
1531,CSX,"This Zacks #2 Rank stock trades at 14.5x 2010 consensus EPS estimates and 12.5x 2011 consensus EPS estimates.
"
1532,CSX,"Industry Rank Analysis 07-28-10 
"
1533,CSX,"There is certainly a fair amount of gloom out there about the health of the U.S. economy. However, if the economy is so awful, then why are times so good for the companies that actually move stuff around? The two industries that are responsible for moving freight around the country are doing very nicely, according to their Zacks ranks.
"
1534,CSX,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 256 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well -- a single firm with good news can propel a one- or two-firm industry to the top of the charts. But it is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list. The same holds true for the bottom of the list.
"
1535,CSX,"However, in this case, the industries are not particularly small in terms of the number of companies involved. The Railroad industry has 23 firms in it, yet it ranks 13th out of the 256 industries we track. Of those firms, just one, CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) has the coveted Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). However, an additional 5 hold a rank of #2 (Buy).
"
1536,CSX,"Only the best 5% of all socks are awarded with a Zacks #1 Rank and the next 15% get Zacks #2 Ranks. Thus if it were totally random, one would only expect 20% of the firms in an industry to have ranks of #1 or #2 (this mirrors the number #5 and #4 ranks, respectively).
"
1537,CSX,"For the Railroads, 75% have ranks that make them interesting investment situations. The average Zacks rank of the industry as a whole is 2.13, versus 2.25 last week.
"
1538,CSX,"The main competition for the railroads are the Trucking firms, and they are looking good as well, so it is not just a case of the Rails picking up share from the Truckers. The Trucking industry is much larger in terms of the number of companies, with 23 firms. That makes its appearance in the 17th spot that much more impressive. The industry has 4 Zacks #1 Ranked firms and 10 number Zacks #2 Ranked firms.
"
1539,CSX,"The first table below shows the stocks from industries that hold the coveted Zacks #1 Rank. The second table shows the ones with the attractive Zacks #2 Rank. Historically, #1-ranked stocks have far outperformed the overall market, and stocks with #2 ranks have also tended to outperform. The firms range in size from large caps to micro caps, with more of the large caps being found among the Railroads, and the Truckers being mostly smaller-cap firms.
"
1540,CSX,"One thing to note is that while the Zacks ranks on these companies are impressive, the valuations -- particularly given the overall valuation of the market -- are not. Thus is it is possible that the good news has already been priced into these names.

"
1542,CSX,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 Ranked stocks than #4 or #5 Ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week. It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is.
"
1543,CSX,"The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.
"
1544,CSX,"Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked.
"
1545,CSX,"The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

1553,CSX,"Given the better than expected earnings report, including that volumes were up in all markets, the analysts have been busy raising earnings estimates.
"
1554,CSX,"22 estimates out of 25 for the third quarter rose in the last 30 days to push up the Zacks Consensus by 8 cents to $1.02.
"
1555,CSX,"23 estimates, including 3 in just the last week, rose for the full year in the last month. Analysts now expect 2010 earnings growth of 34.3%.
"
1556,CSX,"The 2010 Zacks consensus moved higher by 27 cents to $3.85 per share during the prior 30 days.Value Fundamentals

"
1561,CSX,"Along with all other industries in the U.S., railroads also suffered during the economic downturn. Freight rail is a “derived demand industry -- demand for the rail service is tied with demand for the products that the railroads haul. Rail traffic, therefore, acts as a solid barometer of the overall health of the economy.
"
1562,CSX,"Since around 2003−2004, a number of factors have led to an increase in rail freight volume in the U.S:Rising fuel costs led to an increased demand for rail, since railroads are on an average four times more fuel-efficient than trucks.A surge in U.S. imports and record U.S. agricultural exports boosted rail shipments to and from ports.A rise in natural gas prices caused power plants to burn more coal to generate electricity, and most coal is shipped by rail.Railroad investments in capacity, innovations and use of technology led to service improvements and enhanced reliability.
"
1563,CSX,"By 2006, America’s railroads were carrying more freight than ever before in the country’s history. However, the recent downturn that officially began in December 2007 witnessed reduced traffic and volumes. In 2009, carload traffic was down 16.1% compared with 2008 and down 18.2% compared with 2007.
"
1564,CSX,"With the economy now out of the recession, the fortunes of the railroad industry are also on the mend. The overall sentiment with respect to railroads is clearly improving, with total traffic for the 17th week of 2010 increasing 15.0%, preceded by a traffic increase of 14.8% year-over-year in the 16th week, 16.1% in the 15th week and 17.2% in the 14th week. The volumes grew steadily due to a pick-up in end market demand. Moreover, structural cost cuts during the downturn are expected to help railroads generate high incremental margins.
"
1565,CSX,"Although the macro picture has improved, the recovery appears to be sluggish and fragile, at least over the next few quarters. Our long-term outlook for rail transport is positive. As the U.S. economy recovers, manufacturing production picks up and consumers begin spending again, industry revenue will return to steady growth. Adding to our confidence is Warren Buffett’s investment in the sector − Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway , (BRK.B  -  Free Report) acquisition of the rail company Burlington Northern Santa Fe is what we are talking about here. His investment in the group is clearly a seal of approval.
"
1566,CSX,"On a modestly negative note is the lingering concern about legislative/regulatory changes that may affect industry profitability and operating conditions.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1567,CSX,"One railroad company that we like with a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) is Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), which has great momentum. Its capital position improved with increased liquidity and reduced leverage, followed by the recent equity issuance. Management expects double-digit growth in fiscal 2010, with volume growing in the mid- to high-single digits along with growth in revenue yield. We are optimistic about new business wins and growth prospects for fiscal 2010 and beyond, given the overall improvement in the economy.
"
1568,CSX,"Another of our picks is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), which looks attractive based on the its earnings power, pricing power, potential improvements in network fluidity, cost controls, probable improvements in safety and fewer distractions. Cost-cutting efforts undertaken during the past few years will now accrue to the earnings. Steady pricing, improving volumes and cost saving efforts will likely help the company to outperform its peers in the near term.Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report) is also poised to benefit from the eventual rebound in the economy as suggested by the recent volume gains.   
"
1569,CSX,"Elswhere, we are Neutral on Canadian Pacific Railway (CP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Rail America (RA). Our Neutral recommendations for these operators primarily reflect the lack of near-term earnings momentum in their businesses.
"
1570,CSX,"WEAKNESSES
"
1571,CSX,"The economic growth is tardy and difficult conditions are expected to continue through 2010, with U.S. consumers still conservative in their expenditure. Coupled with this, the new home construction market continues to be weak, which in turn affects a number of commodities transported.
"
1572,CSX,"Growth in automotive sales also will take time before getting into full swing. These sluggish economic conditions will delay the industry recovery.
"
1573,CSX,"We shouldn’t lose sight of the growing concerns about the sustainability of the U.S. recovery given the headwinds from Europe and uncertainty about China’s outlook. While we view the U.S. economic growth trajectory to be essentially on track, some downside risks can not entirely be ruled out. And given the economic sensitivity of the rail transport sector, any diminution of the U.S. growth prospects remains a risk factor for the industry.
"
1574,CSX,"Another potential headwind facing the rail industry is the ongoing debate on increasing regulations in the industry. If this materializes, it may weigh on further efficiency gains and earnings growth.

1590,CSX,"The Chart
"
1591,CSX,"During the market's sell-off in February, CSX shares declined by almost 13%. However, the stock has rebounded nicely. It is up over 31% from its February lows and up 14.5% year-to-date.
"
1592,CSX,"Earnings Preview 4/9/10
"
1593,CSX,"Next week is the “kick-off for the first quarter earnings season. Of course, there are a few firms that have already reported, but all of them have February fiscal period ends, and should be considered part of the pre-game festivities.Alcoa (AA) will report on Monday after the bell and really get the game started. There are not a lot of companies reporting next week, only 61 in total, but what reports lack in quantity they will make up for in importance.
"
1594,CSX,"In addition to Alcoa, 20 more S&P 500 firms will report, including such important bellwethers as CSX (CSX  -  Free Report) in Transportation, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) in Banking, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Google (GOOG) in Technology, and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), which is probably the best one company proxy around for the overall U.S. economy.
"
1595,CSX,"The economic data calendar will also be potentially market-moving. We start out the week with the monthly Treasury budget numbers to see how big the deficit is, then get data on the Trade Deficit on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the focus shifts to Inflation as the CPI is released. Wednesday will also see the Retail sales numbers and the Fed Beige Book.
"
1596,CSX,"On Thursday, as always, we get the initial and continuing unemployment claims data. More importantly on Thursday will be the report on Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization. Finally, we finish out the week with Housing Starts and Building Permits, and well as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey. Any one of those results has the potential to significantly move the markets.  Monday
"
1597,CSX,"•    The Treasury Budget is released. The headline number will be the size of the monthly deficit. However, it will be interesting to see how much of it comes from falling revenues vs. how much from increased spending, and where the spending is increasing. This data is highly seasonal, but is not seasonally adjusted. Thus, ignore the month-over-month comparisons, and focus on the year-over-year changes. In March of 2009, the Federal Government bled $191.6 billion in red ink, and will probably hemorrhage more this year.Tuesday
"
1598,CSX,"•    The Trade Deficit will be reported. In February it was $37.3 billion, an improvement over the $39.9 billion of January, but the improvement came for the wrong reasons -- both imports and exports fell. Look for the March deficit to be in the same neighborhood as the February shortfall, but with both imports and exports rising. Rising oil prices will be a major cause of the rise in imports.Wednesday
"
1599,CSX,"•    The Consumer Price Index will most likely remain very well controlled, particularly if one strips out food and energy prices. In February, the overall index was unchanged and the core rose just 0.1%. Look for headline to be well above the core in March thanks to higher energy prices. The core index is heavily influenced by housing costs, most notably rent and owners-equivalent rent. Look for those components to be either unchanged or down slightly. A higher-than-expected reading, particularly for the core, would be very bad news for the markets since it would raise expectations that the Fed would tighten sooner than people now expect. However, the current data suggests that Unemployment and slack capacity are still much bigger economic problems than inflation, and thus the Fed is likely to keep the Fed funds rate at its current near-zero level for at least the rest of 2010.  
"
1600,CSX,"•    Retail sales should be very strong in March, as evident by the extremely strong same-store sales reports from the major retail chains. Auto sales were also strong in March. Look for an acceleration from the overall rate of 0.3% growth in February and the 0.8% rate excluding autos.
"
1601,CSX,"•    The Beige Book comes out in the afternoon. It is a collection of mostly anecdotal data collected from the 12 Federal Reserve districts and provides some color on the economy. Look for it to show the economy to be recovering but from a very depressed overall level.Thursday 
"
1602,CSX,"•    Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They rose 18,000 in the last week, to 460,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall back modestly next week. Overall we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is, on balance, adding jobs. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go.
"
1603,CSX,"•    Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. However that is in part due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. If one factors in the extended claims paid by the Federal government as part of the Stimulus program, claims soared last week. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. Last week regular continuing claims were 4.550 million, down 131,000 from the previous week. Extended claims (paid from Federal ARRA funds) were 5.808 million, a decrease of 224,000. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
1604,CSX,"•    Industrial Production should continue to rise in March, and at a faster pace than the 0.1% gain in February. Most of February’s gain came from Mining and Utility output, as manufacturing output actually fell 0.2%. Weather is often as much of a factor in Utility output as is the rate of economic activity. Gains should be more on the order of the gains seen in January when both overall industrial output, and manufacturing output climbed by 0.9%.
"
1605,CSX,"•    The same report will also show the rate of Capacity Utilization, which in February rose slightly to 72.7% overall, but slipped in Manufacturing to 69.0%. As with Production, the Utility utilization rate is often as much a function of Weather as economic activity, so see if the overall change is matched by the change for manufacturing. While Utilization rates have been trending upward over the last 8 months, they remain at extremely depressed levels, particularly for Manufacturing. The manufacturing rate would have to rise by 10 full percentage points just to get us back to the long-term average rates of utilization. It is very unlikely that core inflation will take off with utilization rates that depressed. These reports are very important and very under reported and it would be worth your while to pay attention to them.Friday
"
1606,CSX,"•    Housing remains the key thorn in the side of the overall economy. Traditionally residential investment is the key locomotive leading the economy out of recessions, but not this time. Housing starts dropped to an annual rate of just 575,000 in February, virtually unchanged from the year before. With New Home Sales Setting back-to-back record lows in January and February, it is likely that starts will continue to be very slow, as the last thing that builders want to do now is build a lot of speculative inventory. However, we might see some rise on a month-to-month basis since some housing starts might have been put off in February due to the snow storms. Also, most of the February decline in starts was in the very volatile apartment area.
"
1607,CSX,"•    Building Permits are the best leading indicator of housing starts. They were running at an annual rate of 612,000 in February, which would indicate some rise in housing starts in March. Look for a small increase in Permits in March.Potential Positive Surprises
"
1608,CSX,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. While normally firms that report better-than-expected earnings rise in reaction, that has not been the case so far this quarter. While pickings are getting slim, some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS) is expected to report EPS of 0.23, up from a loss of $0.32 per share a year ago. Last time out, FCS posted a positive surprise of 35.3%, and over the last month the mean estimate for its fourth quarter earnings is up 2.43%. FCS has a Zacks #1 Rank.Peabody Energy (BTU) is expected to post EPS of $0.42, down from $0.50 a year ago. Last time, BTU beat expectations by 43.3%, and over the last month analysts have raised their estimates for the about to be reported quarter by 0.12%. BTU is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Talbots (TLB) is expected to post EPS of $0.02 as opposed to a loss of $2.40 a year ago. Last time out the company blew away expectations by 293.8%. The analysts have become far more bullish about the soon-to-be-reported quarter, raising their estimates over the last month by 85.7% (OK, with rounding it's an increase from $0.01 to $0.02). TLB is a Zacks #2 Ranked stock.Potential Negative SurprisesCharles Schwab (SCHW) is expected to post EPS of $0.11 a share, down from $0.19 a year ago. Last time they reported 6.7% below expectations. For this Zacks #4 Rank stock, analysts have cut the estimates for this quarter over the last month by 25.6%.CVB Financial (CVBF  -  Free Report) is expected to earn $0.13 a share this quarter, unchanged from a year ago. They were 91.1% below expectations last time out. Analysts have cut the estimate for this quarter by 8.7% over the last month.

1613,CSX,"U.S. Rail Transport Bids Fair
"
1614,CSX,"The U.S. rail industry includes large railroads as well as regional and local-line haul railroads carrying both freight and passengers. The industry derives a vast majority of revenue from providing Class 1 freight services. The major market segments that the industry caters to are Coal, Industrial Goods, Agricultural Goods, Chemicals, Food & Consumer Goods, Intermodal, Transport & Equipment and Passengers.
"
1615,CSX,"The rail industry is undergoing a resurgence. Rail is estimated to be three times more fuel efficient than road freight transport and in a climate of high fuel prices and increased awareness of environmental sustainability, the distant future of rail looks good. Over the five years to 2009, industry revenue has increased by an average of 2.5% per year. However, slack economic conditions are expected to see industry revenue contract by 9.2% in 2009.
"
1616,CSX,"Strong annual growth over the last five years has been driven by increased demand for freight transport services in all major market segments; however, slowing economic growth in 2008 in the U.S. pulled back the pace of industry expansion. The difficult domestic economic conditions are expected to continue as the liquidity crisis in the financial markets ripples through the economy. Especially hard hit will be the construction and automotive sectors -- major customers of the railroad industry.
"
1617,CSX,"As the U.S. economy recovers, manufacturing production picks up and consumers begin spending again in 2010, industry revenue will return to steady growth. Rail transport has been increasing its share of the total transport division, and currently represents 14.9% of total revenue, making it the third largest transport sector (by revenue) behind truck and air transport. These gains have been made at the expense of air transport, which with the current high fuel prices has become too expensive for many.
"
1618,CSX,"Though the impact of the current recession on this industry will be negative, the long-term outlook for rail transport is positive. Larger railroad companies are expected to expand through acquisitions. Some of the smaller railroads, such as Wisconsin Central and Kansas City Southern, could become targets for larger railroads to acquire.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1619,CSX,"During the recession, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp (BNI) has demonstrated significant operating leverage through its ongoing dedication to control costs and improve productivity. BNI has the best commodity mix and is positioned to be the fastest growing U.S. rail company during the next expansion. The actions taken by management to improve its network and lower its costs should expand the company’s margins when volumes begin to come back online.CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) looks optimistic based on the its earnings power, pricing power, potential improvements in network fluidity, cost controls, probable improvements in safety and fewer distractions. We expect management to continue to successfully hold down its costs with carloads. Management is doing a solid job of cutting costs while planning for the eventual rebound in the industry. Steady pricing, improving volumes, cost savings and a moderating regulatory environment will likely help the company to outperform its peers in the near term.WEAKNESSES
"
1620,CSX,"The slowing economic conditions in the U.S. will cause industry revenue to contract in 2009 as freight volumes fall. Employment in the industry is expected to contract sharply in 2009 as rail companies slash jobs. In the near term, profits are expected to fall as revenue from fuel surcharges shrinks, along with demand reduction.
"
1621,CSX,"Difficult domestic economic conditions are expected to continue through 2010 as the liquidity crisis in the financial markets spreads through the economy. The slowing economic conditions, plunging manufacturing production, consumer spending and international trade is likely to take a further toll on the industry.                    
"
1622,CSX,"Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Crown Holdings (CCK  -  Free Report) could top expectations. CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) could disappoint.
"
1623,CSX,"This will be the first busy week for earnings season. Though the total number of reports is limited, just 68, nearly half will be from large-cap and mega-cap companies.
"
1624,CSX,"Financials will be in particular focus. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and  JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) will release results. General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) is also on the docket and all eyes will be on its finance division.
"
1625,CSX,"Outside the financial sector, reports from Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Google (GOOG) could impact market direction.
"
1626,CSX,"The Fed will add to the potential volatility with Wednesday afternoon's release of the Beige Book. Inflation and housing data are also on the economic calendar.
"
1627,CSX,"Tuesday: March Producer Price Index (PPI), March auto sales, February business inventories
"
1628,CSX,"Wednesday: March Consumer Price Index (CPI), April Empire State manufacturing index, March industrial production and capacity utilization, weekly crude inventories, Fed Beige Book
"
1629,CSX,"Thursday: March housing starts and building permits, April Philadelphia Fed survey, weekly initial jobless claims
"
1630,CSX,"Friday: Preliminary April University of Michigan consumer confidence survey
"
1631,CSX,"The Federal Reserve's web site is not listing any upcoming speeches from Fed officials. The next Fed meeting will occur on Apr 28 and 29.
"
1632,CSX,"April stock options will expire on Friday.
"
1633,CSX,"How results from the financial companies are perceived could have the biggest impact on market direction. Financial stocks have been trading off of sentiment (as opposed to fundamentals or technicals), so sentiment about the quarterly reports will matter much more than the actual numbers themselves.
"
1634,CSX,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises
"
1635,CSX,"Six brokerage analysts have raised their first-quarter earnings estimates on Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) within the past 30 days. Though the consensus estimate remains unchanged at 3 cents per share despite the revisions, the most accurate estimate calls for profits of 4 cents per share. Guidance could be better-than-feared given recent increases in full-year forecasts. The chipmaker has topped expectations during 3 out of the last 4 quarters. Intel is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Apr 14, after the close of trading.
"
1636,CSX,"Crown Holdings (CCK  -  Free Report) has topped expectations during 6 out of the last 7 quarters. Though one analyst did recently lower his first-quarter profit projection, the consensus earnings estimate remains unchanged at 21 cents per share. There is risk, but the historic trend bodes well for another positive surprise. CCK is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 16, before the start of trading.
"
1637,CSX,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises
"
1638,CSX,"More than half of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their first-quarter profit projections on CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) during the past few weeks. The negative revisions have caused the consensus earnings estimate to fall 8 cents to 54 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish at 50 cents per share. The railroad company has missed expectations once over the past 3 quarters. CSX is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Apr 15, before the start of trading.
"
1639,CSX,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) has missed expectations during 3 out of the last 4 quarters, and analysts are bracing for another disappointment. Negative revisions by 3 of the 15 covering brokerage analysts over the past few weeks have sent the first-quarter consensus estimate a penny lower to a loss of 13 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish and calls for a loss of 17 cents per share. Mattel is scheduled to report on Friday, Apr 17, before the start of trading.

Among the companies targeted by the negative revisions are Burlington Northern (BNI), CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Canadian National (CNI  -  Free Report), Canadian Pacific Railroad (CP), Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report).
"
1651,CSX,"This bearishness should not surprise you given the current economic backdrop.
"
1652,CSX,"Carload Volumes Are Down
"
1653,CSX,"The global recession has dampened demand for various products, which in turn reduces shipments. According to the Association of American Railroads, U.S. carload volume is down 15.6% this year. Up north, Canadian railroads have seen volume fall 19%.
"
1654,CSX,"Lower volume has a twofold impact. First, it reduces overall revenues. Secondly, it makes it harder to maintain pricing power. The longer the recession lasts, the more likely it is that price competition will begin to emerge.
"
1655,CSX,"The biggest fear for the railroads right now is that prices could be forced lower, especially if the economy remains weak throughout the remainder of the year. Zacks Equity Research Transportation Analyst Ann Heffron believes that weaker pricing is a threat for the entire transportation sector.
"
1656,CSX,"(Ann has a long-term hold recommendation on all of the railroad stocks under her coverage.)
"
1657,CSX,"Fuel Costs Are A Double-Edged Sword
"
1658,CSX,"The previous decline in fuel prices was a positive since it partially helped to offset the lower volume by reducing costs. However, fuel prices have been rising recently. Oil, in particular, is up by more than 20% from its February lows.
"
1659,CSX,"At the same time, lower shipments make it more difficult for rail companies to charge fuel surcharges, which hurts their revenues. The best case scenario would be for oil to stay range-bound as any further increase could crimp margins.

"
1669,CSX,"Refiners, such as Sunoco, Inc. (SUN), will have among the highest growth rates. Plunging oil prices led to an improved crack spread, which allowed these companies to enjoy widened margins. (Lower demand due to economic conditions will cause profits to drop in 2009, however.)

1670,CSX,"SUN is a Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock classified in Oil Refining & Marketing. The favorable Zacks Rank reflects the fact that fourth-quarter estimates have been revised upwards.
"
1671,CSX,"Staying on the energy front, coal producers CONSOL Energy, Inc. (CNX  -  Free Report) and Massey Energy Company (MEE) should also report strong growth. Though coal prices have dropped significantly since June, much of the 2008 production had already been contracted out. This enabled these companies to enjoy higher prices, relative to the spot market and relative to 2007. (Both companies are also expected to show strong growth in 2009.)

1672,CSX,"CNX and MEE are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks classified in Coal.
"
1673,CSX,"High demand for coal also played a role in maintaining earnings momentum for rail companies.

1674,CSX,"Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (BNI), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) should report growth rates of 18% or better.

1675,CSX,"These are all Zacks #3 Rank stocks classified in Transportation-Rail. All of the aforementioned rail companies should have higher profits in 2009 as well, though rate of growth will be slower than it was in 2008.

1676,CSX,"Outside of the energy sector, drug and medical product companies enjoyed a good quarter. In fact, more than half of the drug companies within the S&P 500 are projected to have generated double-digit earnings  growth thanks to insurance coverage, a lower level of economic sensitivity and Medicare Part D are playing positive roles.

1677,CSX,"Cephalon, Inc. (CEPH), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) should all report fourth-quarter growth in excess of 20%.

"
1689,CSX,"Falling fuel prices should be a positive for transportation companies, but the recession has offset this benefit. As result, brokerage analysts have cut forecasts on several rail and transportation companies in recent weeks.
"
1690,CSX,"Though lower estimates are expected given the current economic environment, Transportation-Trucking appears more vulnerable to further negative revisions than Transportation-Rail.
"
1691,CSX,"Trucking Still Stalling
"
1692,CSX,"Yesterday, Con-way Inc. (CNW) lowered its 2008 guidance. The company expects profits to total between $2.20 and $2.35 per share, down from its previous forecast of $2.60 to $2.80 per share. (The numbers exclude certain charges.)
"
1693,CSX,"CNW justified the wide range by citing ""turbulent market conditions"" and a ""lack of reliable visibility"".
"
1694,CSX,"Throughout 2008, trucking companies have been struggling with a lack of pricing power. This has been particularly evident in the spot market for less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers, though full-truckload carriers have also struggled. Bluntly put, there have been too many trucks.
"
1695,CSX,"Adding to the weak prices has been competition from rail for long-haul freight. Not only has this affected prices and volume for the long-haul segment, but it also sent more companies looking for LTL business.
"
1696,CSX,"The trucking industry is also more susceptible to economic fluctuations than their rail counterparts. Trucking companies are more likely to ship retail items, whereas railroads move coal. As a result, the benefit of the 45% drop in diesel prices is being more than offset by the recession. (Less demand means fewer items being shipped.)
"
1697,CSX,"Con-way's CEO, Douglas W. Stotlar, said that ""decelerating volumes in the LTL market"" and falling prices were the primary reasons for his company's recent struggles.
"
1698,CSX,"Trucking companies with recent, negative revisions include J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) and LTL carrier Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. (ODFL  -  Free Report). JBHT relies more on full-truckload revenues, whereas ODFL is primarily an LTL carrier.
"
1699,CSX,"A few brokerage analysts have lowered their 2008 and 2009 forecasts on CNW before yesterday's announcement. However, many more cuts are likely to occur this week since the 2008 consensus earnings estimate is at $2.79 per share.
"
1700,CSX,"Railroads Still Moving, Thought Not At Full Steam
"
1701,CSX,"Railroad companies enjoyed more pricing power this year. This power included the ability to more effectively use fuel surcharges to boost revenues.
"
1702,CSX,"Compared to trucks, rail is a more fuel efficient way to ship freight over long distances. As a result, rail companies were able to keep market share away from trucking companies, while still maintaining control over prices.
"
1703,CSX,"Rail companies also benefited from the commodity bubble that occurred earlier this year via more shipments. Though demand for steel and copper has been affected by the slowing economy, coal shipments are holding up. Furthermore, a likely continued push for ethanol will help to support agricultural products.
"
1704,CSX,"Offsetting these positives for the industry are the continued housing slump, the problems with the U.S. auto industry and the weakened manufacturing sector.
"
1705,CSX,"Therefore, though estimates are being cut for CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), the outlook is brighter than it is for trucking companies.
"
1706,CSX,"Zacks Rank
"
1707,CSX,"All of the aforementioned companies are Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stocks. This ranking is applied to 60% of the companies within the Zacks Rank universe, or about 2600 stocks. Because the size of this group is so big, there are variances in the quality of companies that have a Zacks #3 Rank.

1708,CSX,"The Zacks Rank operates on a bell curve, with only the top 20% of all stocks given a ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" ranking. Similarly, the bottom 20% of all companies are given a ""strong sell"" or ""sell"" ranking. This model makes the buy and sell ranks more powerful, while maintaining the simplicity of a 5-Rank model.

"
1727,CSX,"In late September, the company announced that it is expecting a reduction in third quarter operating income by $40 million to $50 million and earnings per share by 6 to 8 cents due to the financial impact of recent storms in the Gulf Coast and Midwest. CSX added that the impact is primarily related to asset write downs, business interruption and reroute expenses. For the 2008 year and longer-term, CSX did not change its outlook.
"
1728,CSX,"CSX Hiked its Guidance as did Wall Street
"
1729,CSX,"The company boosted its outlook in early September. CSX expects full-year 2008 earnings per share to range between $3.65 and $3.75, up from a previous range that guided toward the upper end of the $3.40 to $3.60. 
"
1730,CSX,"Analysts have 2008 earnings pegged at $3.67 per share, an increase from last months $3.57. The most accurate estimate is a higher $3.69.

"
1739,CSX,"The company saw all-time records in revenues and operating income, which jumped 15% and 17%, respectively.
"
1740,CSX,"Some of you may notice that Food-Confectionery is near the top of the Industry Rank List. This small group is comprised of three Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stocks: Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), Tootsie Roll Industries  and WM Wrigley (WWY). 
"
1741,CSX,"Rising commodity prices, particularly sugar and corn, are a concern for all three companies. However, the candy companies are attempting to pass along the higher costs to consumers. For instance, Wrigley recently announced its intention to raise prices by 10% on most products. (WWY and HSY are also engaging in cost-cutting strategies to improve their margins.) 
"
1742,CSX,"Brokerage analysts seem to believe that the companies will have some success in managing the higher commodity costs. Full-year profit projections for HSY are up two cents over the 30 days to $2.55 per share. The sole analyst covering TR has raised his full-year forecast by six cents over the past 60 days to $1.29 per share. Two of the 14 analysts covering WWY have adjusted their projections within the past 30 days, causing the consensus estimate to rise by a penny to $2.21 per share.
"
1743,CSX,"Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report) recently raised its first-quarter guidance. The company now expects to earn between 94 and 98 cents per share this quarter versus its previous forecast of 85 to 90 cents per share. 
"
1744,CSX,"Steel Dynamics CEO, Keith Busse, credited decreased import activity and lower inventories at steel service centers for improving market conditions. Inventory levels had been a concern for the industry because of higher Chinese production and weak demand by automakers. Brokerage analysts raised their forecasts on STLD following the release of the new forecast, sending the consensus first-quarter earnings estimate up by a cumulative nine cents to 96 cents per share. Full-year estimates are 12 cents higher at $3.82 per share.
"
1745,CSX,"There have been some signs of a spillover effect. For example, one analyst raised his second-quarter profit forecast on U.S. Steel (X  -  Free Report) within the past week, causing the consensus estimate to move seven cents higher to $2.49 per share. In addition, three of the 14 covering brokerage analysts have adjusted their full-year projections. The new full-year earnings estimate of $9.28 per share is 16 cents higher than a week ago. (The first-quarter consensus estimate is unchanged.)
"
1746,CSX,"Both STLD and X are Zacks #2 Rank stocks and are classified in Steel-Producers. This group also contains one Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy), Gerdau , and three other Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
1747,CSX,"Last week, I discussed negative earnings estimate revisions for trucking companies. As a follow-up, I looked at trends for railroad companies. Within the past 30 days and within the past seven days, brokerage analysts have lowered their first-quarter projections for Burlington National (BNI), Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), CSX (CSX  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern (NSC  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report).
"
1748,CSX,"There are some similarities between the earnings estimates cuts for trucking and rail companies. Higher fuel costs are a headwind. Economic weakness is also a drag on earnings. For the railroads, weakness in the housing sector (lower volume levels of building supplies such as timber and wallboard) are likely to have an impact on first-quarter results. Lower demand throughout the automotive supply chain is not helping either. Plus, weather issues, particularly in Canada, are being factored in to the revised forecasts.
"
1749,CSX,"One factor that still appears to be hurting trucking companies more than rail companies is competition. Rail companies have been taking market share away from trucking companies as fuel costs are making long-haul shipments by rail a more attractive option for customers. In addition, there are more trucks on the road creating downward pressure on spot prices as trucking companies try to keep their drivers busy.
"
1750,CSX,"We are in a quiet period for earnings news. Since the end of February, the number of estimate revisions  both positive and negative  for companies within the Zacks Rank universe has fallen by 50% (based on a rolling four-week calculation). Companies were notably tight-lipped in terms of mid- to late-quarter guidance during the second-half of last year. Furthermore, first-quarter earnings season does not officially start until Apr 10, when Alcoa (AA) is scheduled to report. Therefore, we are likely to continue to see a decreased number of estimate revisions into the first half of April.

"
1753,CSX,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
1754,CSX,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
1755,CSX,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
1756,CSX,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
1757,CSX,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.
"
1758,CSX,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
1759,CSX,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
1760,CSX,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
1761,CSX,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.

"
1765,CSX,"^Net percentage of total estimates for this fiscal years earnings (primarily 2006) that have been revised upwards. This number is calculated by subtracting the number of estimates revised downwards over the past four weeks from the number of estimates revised upwards over the past four weeks and dividing this total by the total number of next fiscal year estimates.
"
1766,CSX,"Last week, three of the largest investment banking firms reported fiscal second-quarter results: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Bear Stearns (BSC). The results topped expectations, but the prices of the three stocks ended the week slightly down after some modest volatility. 
"
1767,CSX,"There was not a single explanation as to why. LEH topped estimates by nine cents with profits of $1.69 per share. The results were six cents below the blowout first-quarter numbers, however, which sparked some concern among investors. Other traders wanted to see what Goldman was going to report the following day. GS topped expectations by 62 cents with profits of $4.78 per share. The quality of earnings were questioned somewhat because of a one-time sale of a power generation facility that resulted in a $700 million gain. BSC said on Thursday that it generated profits of $3.72 per share, 62 cents above expectations.
"
1768,CSX,"The overall state of the equity markets played a role. Stocks were down early last week before rallying on Wednesday and Thursday. LEH and GS reported on down days, while BSC was lucky enough report in the middle of a two-day, 300-point rally. The inability Lehman and Goldman Sachs to top extremely strong first-quarter results caused a bit of disgruntlement. There were also worries about the impact that market volatility and rising interest rates would have on the investing banking sector as a whole.
"
1769,CSX,"On the other hand, earnings estimates for all three firms were raised for this year and next  a very bullish sign in the face of lackluster price action. The latest consensus forecast for LEH calls for fiscal 2006 earnings of $6.46 per share and fiscal 2007 earnings of $6.71. These estimates represent one-week increases of three cents for both forecasts. In regards to GS, the consensus estimates are $16.67 for fiscal 2006 and $16.07 for fiscal 2007. These new projections represent increases of 39 cents and 20 cents, respectively. Estimates for BSC now stand at $12.78 for fiscal 2006 and $13.38 for fiscal 2007, representing increases of 13 cents and 17 cents, respectively.
"
1770,CSX,"Astute investors will notice that the revisions do not fully reflect the magnitude of the fiscal second-quarter surprises. This is partially due to the fact that not all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts. Consensus estimates for both the third and fourth quarters have been ratcheted up, however, implying that analysts expect the positive earnings momentum to continue.

1771,CSX,"Second quarter earnings season does not officially kick off until July 10, when Alcoa (AA) is expected to report. One analyst raised his forecast on the aluminum company last week. The recent change and two other positive revisions within the past 30 days have caused the quarterly estimate to rise by a cumulative three cents to 80 cents per share. Alcoa belongs to the Mining-Non Ferrous group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.57.
"
1772,CSX,"Another company with recent revisions in estimates is CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Two of the 10 covering analysts have raised their quarterly and full-year estimates over the past 30 days, with one analyst adjusting his estimate within the past seven days. The current second-quarter forecast calls for profits of $1.12 per share  a penny above the month-old estimate. The current full-year forecast calls for profits of $4.34 per share, five cents above the month-old estimate.
"
1773,CSX,"CSX belongs to the Transportation-Rail group, which has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.30. This group also contains five Zacks #2 Rank stocks: Canadian National Railway (CNI  -  Free Report), Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), Genesee & Wyoming (GWR  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report). As I have stated previously, the railroads are benefiting from both sustained economic expansion and high energy prices. Elevated fuel prices have resulted in a shift of market share from trucks to rail. 
"
1774,CSX,"Ethanol and coal are also helping the rail industry. On Friday afternoon, UNP issued a press release stating that it set a new all-time record for carloadings in a seven-day period. This was the first-time that the company has set such a record outside of its peak season. UNP is handling a 57% increase in ethanol shipments and is experiencing record coal volumes.
