1,CBOE,"CBOE (CBOE) saw an improvement in its IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating Monday, from 92 to 96. X The upgrade means the stock currently tops 96% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. Winning stocks often have a 95 or higher rating in the early stages of a new price run, so that's a good starting point when looking for the best stocks to buy and watch. CBOE is currently forming a consolidation, with a 138.64 buy point. Look for the stock to break out in heavy trade at least 40% above average. But note that it's a later-stage base, which makes it a riskier entry point. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereThe stock earns a 95 EPS Rating, which means its recent quarterly and longer-term annual earnings growth is outpacing 95% of all stocks. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks. The company reported 38% EPS growth for Q4. Top line growth fell to 225%, down from 262% in the previous quarter. CBOE holds the No. 5 rank among its peers in the Financial Services-Specialty industry group.

3,CBOE,"Bitcoin and blockchain technology have taken off as they gain more mainstream acceptance, from exchange operators like CME (CME) and CBOE (CBOE) to Wall Street investment banks and mobile payment company Square (SQ). Other cryptocurrencies are also trying to become viable alternatives to traditional, government-issued money.But prices have been volatile recently, and new currencies keep appearing, leaving individual investors wondering where they are headed next. Meanwhile, top banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are evaluating blockchain as a cheaper way to settle transactions.The rise of blockchain technology may also threaten the dominance of FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan says, """"We believe that blockchain technology will be as important as the internet was to economic and social change in the past 25 years.

4,CBOE,"ETF providers hope to have cracked regulators' code for creating the first exchange traded product backed by Bitcoin — but it's going to cost you.Van Eck Associates and SolidX Partners on June 6 filed a request to list a Bitcoin-linked ETP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund will be physically backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.The SEC asked companies to pull about a dozen applications for cryptocurrency-linked products in January, and last year rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. SolidX and VanEck were among the companies who had filed to list funds. They hope to have addressed regulators' concerns with changes they made in the new, joint request by increasing the share price and basing prices off regulated trading firms, according to SolidX Chief Executive Officer Daniel Gallancy.""Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,"" Gallancy said in a phone interview. ""We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHopes for a Bitcoin ETF were running high last year after the CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) listed Bitcoin futures, as investors speculated the SEC might approve funds linked to financial instruments trading on major exchanges. But those expectations soured as regulators said they were concerned about the high volatility and lack of depth in the market, and about pricing and trading that would be based on lightly regulated platforms.""While I'm still skeptical a Bitcoin ETP gets approved in any form this year, you gotta be in it to win it, and this extra hustle from VanEck could pay off down the road,"" said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst.SolidX and VanEck want to address these concerns by basing prices for the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on an index that tracks over-the-counter trading by U.S.-based institutions, which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MVIS, a subsidiary of New York-based VanEck, will compile the index and publish price updates throughout the day.VanEck oversees more than $45 billion in assets and manages more than 70 exchange traded products. SolidX is a New York-based financial technology company, developing cryptography software and capital markets products.If approved, the product will be priced at 25 Bitcoins per share, which equals about $188,000 at June 6 prices, to target institutional investors, Gallancy said. This compares with a double-digit share price for most ETFs. This would be a change from the focus in the ETF industry, which has traditionally been on individual investors.The firms haven't determined fees for the fund yet, but Gallancy said it will probably be on the more expensive side compared with other ETFs, as they'll be handling the additional risk and hassle of trading cryptocurrency.SolidX would handle custody of Bitcoin using a so-called cold storage solution, which means private keys that serve as ownership codes are kept offline. Funds will be insured one-to-one by a syndicate of insurers, which the firms didn't disclose.VanEck had previously filed a Bitcoin future-based ETF. A physically backed Bitcoin ETF will be attractive as it tracks Bitcoin spot prices more closely, said the firm's head, Jan van Eck.

6,CBOE,"Options bets on stocks and exchange-traded funds are piling up around key deadlines in President Trump's trade crusade and at least one strategist doesn't think it's a coincidence.Six of the 11 most-active contracts on the U.S. exchanges Tuesday had a June 29 expiration. That's a day before the Treasury Department is scheduled to propose restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S. It's also the last session before Congress can block renewal of a measure known as the trade-promotion authority, which provides for a yes-or-no vote by lawmakers on trade deals.""It is expected that we will get a decent move into this date and this is keeping VIX supported below around 15,"" said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital LLC.The Cboe Volatility gauge slid 8.1% on Tuesday to 15.92 after rising 26% on Monday as U.S. stocks posted the biggest decline since April.

8,CBOE,"Is the IBD 50 trade war-resistant? Judging by the current composition of the list, one could argue, ""Yes, reasonably so.""More than a week after President Trump signed off on a 25% tariff on steel imports from most countries and a 10% hike in aluminum on March 8, the major indexes have taken it in stride. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are up since that day's close. The Nasdaq holds a nice cushion above its 50-day moving average.However, angst over the consequences of the protectionist trade strategy still hangs over the bull market. Will China and Europe retaliate? Which sectors could suffer the most if countries engage in tit-for-tat measures? Will the Scots and Brits really stop drinking Kentucky bourbon if prices skyrocket in the U.K.?No one knows. But in the IBD 50, very few of the companies making the list at the end of Thursday sell a commodity. Such physical goods appear to have a higher risk of getting punished by quotas or tariffs imposed by other countries. Warrior Met Coal (HCC) is the sole coal play in the list and sells in U.S., European, Latin American and Asian markets.In a November release on Q3 results, management expressed confidence it will remain a top exporter of high-quality metallurgical coal for the steel industry.""Strong sales volume coupled with high price realization and an exceptionally low cost structure enabled us to achieve strong free cash flow conversion,"" CEO Walt Scheller said in the release. The firm posted an average selling price of $144.06 per short ton; cash cost of sales rose $7.65, nearly 9%, vs. Q2 to $89.91.Warrior Met shares are trying to rebound off the 10-week moving average for the second time in as many months.The bulk of the IBD 50 firms are in finance, semiconductors and software. Software firms don't deliver their goods on ships or airfreight much these days. And companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and MKS Instruments (MKSI) sell products that enjoy incredible demand.The global era of consumer spending and investment is still going strong. Mastercard (MA) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) are delivering steady growth. The former has posted profit growth of 29%, 15%, 24% and 33% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The latter is expected to boost its earnings 33% this year to $4.55 a share.Trump clearly cares about working class families that rely on a strong manufacturing and industrial base. That's good. But the U.S. economy is truly diversified. The savvy IBD reader recognizes that entrepreneurs deliver innovative new products and services that span a wide swath of industries.Take Casa Systems (CASA). The Andover, Mass., company is the only one in the IBD 50 hailing from the telecom infrastructure industry group. Only six companies in the 26-member group trade at least 30 a share. Its software is a big hit with cable firms expanding their broadband service. Around 40% of its sales come from outside the U.S.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) are delivering excellent products to meet the enormous demand for data security, digital marketing campaigns, video design and editing and document management.Weibo (WB) is virtually 100% unlikely to be impacted by U.S. tariffs, both present and future. The Chinese social media giant has climbed 141% from a breakout at 58.89 in May 2017, but the stock's long-term uptrend remains intact.

9,CBOE,"Stocks in the trading business have been hot and cold, but iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges (IAI) has smoothed out the fluctuations to show a respectable gain this year.The fund illustrates how a portfolio that combines various elements of an industry can trend higher even while some stocks or segments fall out of favor. Since at least 2017, the ETF has corrected no worse than 10% and it's maintained a moderate uptrend since the November 2016 election sparked a rally in financials and other sectors.So far this year, iShares Broker-Dealers is up 10%, beating the S&P 500. The average annual returns (as of May 31) are 35.1%, 16.8% and 18.8% over the past one, three and five years.The portfolio breaks down into three parts. Investment banking and brokerages make up 72%, while financial exchanges are a 27% weighting. A tiny 1% is in custody banks and asset management firms. This year's performance among those and related industries has varied.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIBD's specialty financial services industry is up 7%. From that group, the ETF's stocks include exchange operators Nasdaq (NDAQ), CME Group (CME) and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).The investment bankers and brokers group is up 4%. That includes ETF components such as E-Trade Financial (ETFC), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), LPL Financial (LPLA) and the largest holding of the fund, Charles Schwab (SCHW).But IBD's money center banks, which includes Wall Street veterans Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), is down 4%. Shares of those two institutions remain near the lows of their current price consolidations and underperform other holdings.There's been multiple factors influencing the brokerage and exchange companies this year. Rising interest rates have expanded net interest margins — something noted in Morgan Stanley's Q1 earnings report. The regulatory environment has been easing for banks and other financials. Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point. E-Trade has risen some 45% from a Nov. 27 breakout.Among losers, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) plunged in early February after trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, potentially lowering trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock has yet to recover. Lazard (LAZ) has been basing most of the year.The ETF itself is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 69.49 buy point.

11,CBOE,"With Bitcoin and other coins in the cryptocurrency market still making headlines on a near-daily basis, investors want to know: Can they get in on the digital currency craze, too?X The answer depends on whether you want to actively trade Bitcoin futures or an investment trust — and if you qualify to do so. Because Bitcoin trading is still in its infancy relative to say, government-backed dollars or gold, it can be highly risky.Still, millennial- and smartphone-friendly app Robinhood on Thursday announced it would allow customers in five states to trade cryptocurrencies for no commission fee, starting in February. It's now letting clients monitor market data and create custom alerts for 16 cryptocurrencies.Three of the five companies featured in this year's Best Online Brokers report allow Bitcoin futures trading for a select group of clients. The other two let users see Bitcoin quotes and/or offer digital currency tracking services. All five are keeping a close eye on developments in the cryptocurrency market.And keep in mind — even if your broker doesn't allow cryptocurrency trading or you don't meet their requirements to do so, you can still get exposure indirectly via Bitcoin or blockchain-related stocks and mutual funds or exchange traded funds holding those or Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).Let's start with Fidelity Investments. The Boston-based fund giant does not currently offer Bitcoin trading. But it's been actively monitoring and showing interest in the digital currency field. ""I love this stuff — Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain technology — and what the future holds,""  CEO Abigail Johnson told attendees at the Consensus 2017 conference in May.And in August, the Boston-based fund giant announced a partnership between its Fidelity Labs unit and digital wallet provider Coinbase that allows Fidelity clients to track their cryptocurrency balances in their accounts. While Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market are on Fidelity's radar, according to brokerage services head Ram Subramanian, its view for the time being is that cryptocurrency trades are ""not an appropriate dealer offering.""Likewise, Charles Schwab is taking a wait-and-see approach and does not currently offer Bitcoin futures trading for its clients. But it began displaying real-time Bitcoin futures quotes on its StreetSmart Central and StreetSmart Mobile platforms in December.""On cryptocurrencies, we're actively evaluating and weighing the risks to ensure client interests are protected before we make cryptocurrencies available,"" Schwab spokesman Michael Cianfrocca told IBD. ""Most of the client questions we're getting are more educational in nature — what they are and how they work vs. asking for the ability to invest in or trade at this point.""Given the still untested and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, most online brokers that allow Bitcoin futures trading impose higher margin requirements than the exchanges. They also tend to limit access to more sophisticated traders with amply funded accounts to cover potentially high risk.TradeStation allows its futures account holders to trade Bitcoin futures on both Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME).""We believe that CME's launch of the new Bitcoin futures contract represents a major milestone in the development of cryptocurrency derivatives markets that appear to be more fair and transparent than trading the underlying cryptocurrency,"" John Bartleman, president of TradeStation Group, said in a statement. ""We're excited to support CME's new offering from the first day of trading and to extend to TradeStation clients the opportunity to trade this emerging market.""TD Ameritrade is testing the waters. It offers access to CBOE Bitcoin futures (XBT) via the broker's thinkorswim platform and TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader app, but it's not available to all clients. You must be approved to trade futures in your account and meet certain criteria. The margin requirement for Bitcoin futures is currently 1.5 times higher than exchange margin requirements.""TD Ameritrade is purposely enabling certain subsets of customers to access these markets as part of a conservative and deliberate approach to this new marketplace and volatile product,"" the broker says on its website.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and possible gains first.Interactive Brokers offers trading for both CBOE (GXBT) and CME (BRR) Bitcoin futures. But in order to trade, customers are first required to obtain trading permissions from Interactive for U.S. Crypto Futures. The margin requirement is 50% for long investments. The broker didn't allow customers to short Bitcoin futures initially, but decided to do so in mid-December for CBOE futures, citing client demand.Interactive charges $5.51 per contract for the CBOE futures and $15.01 per contract for the CME futures. Those rates include broker commission, plus exchange, regulatory and clearing fees.Though some investors can now trade Bitcoin futures, it's important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is still young and largely untested. Those who have been watching Bitcoin's price, futures or Bitcoin Investment Trust have seen over the past two months just how volatile the currency and its related investments can be.As Interactive Brokers' website warns: ""Trading in Bitcoin futures is especially risky and is only for clients with a high risk tolerance and the financial ability to sustain losses.""Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

16,CBOE,"There's an options trade that promises stellar returns if U.S. stocks continue to tread water. The catch: It's only managed to deliver that a handful of times over the past decade.Welcome to the forgotten world of buy-writes: an investing style for traders who lack conviction on whether the second-longest bull market on record still has life. It combines long equity exposures with sales of call options to deliver potentially double-digit returns in the event that index moves are subdued.With the main U.S. stock benchmark churning near the midpoint of its trading range, now could be the strategy's moment in the sun. The Cboe S&P 500 BuyWrite Index is besting the equity gauge this year on a price basis, putting it on track for only its third year of outperformance over the past 10.""The investor who is most interested in this fund is someone who thinks the market is going to chop around, go sideways, maybe see a slight pullback,"" said Ted Samulowitz, manager for the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio ETF (PBP) at Invesco Advisers.Here's how it works: A portfolio of stocks is acquired, and call options are written on some or all of the shares. The fund earns income from selling the calls, in exchange for giving up the appreciation beyond the exercise price of the options. In other words, if stocks soar, holders won't participate in much, if any, of the gains.It's an investing style recommended by UBS Group, which points out that money managers can trade ""exposure to significant potential upside in equity markets for a smaller, but certain, extra return,"" according to a recent note.While U.S.-listed passive products tracking the strategy have only seen tepid inflows at best so far this year, it offers a juicy income stream that can cushion against moderate market dips, proponents say.The biggest ETF of its kind, the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio, collects around 125 basis points a month from selling options, according to Samulowitz. That's up from around 80 basis points a month at the end of last year, he said, as the trade has the somewhat paradoxical quality of benefiting from moderate bouts of volatility.""It's just another nice thing about a buy-write strategy because as volatility goes up, we collect more premium,"" said Samulowitz.The Cboe BuyWrite Index trailed the S&P 500 by 6 percentage points last year on a price basis, while the gap was 2.5 percentage points in 2016. But in down years for stocks, buy-writes can outperform, outpacing the return of the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points in 2015.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe AdvisorShares STAR Global Buy-Write ETF (VEGA), for instance, can sell out-of-the-money calls, which allows it to benefit to a certain extent from rising stocks, according to Rebecca Valdez, fund manager at Partnervest Advisory Services, which manages the ETF.There's an argument that investors who seek yield and don't see much upside in stocks should put their money into bonds, but Samulowitz considers buy-write strategies as a substitute for high-yield debt in a portfolio.""If credit spreads start to widen out, the equity cycle is probably not going to roll over for another six months, so the buy-write should continue to outperform,"" said Samulowitz.While the trade can protect against moderate volatility, it isn't a panacea should another massive spike come along, according to Valdez. The Cboe index fell more than the S&P 500 when volatility more than doubled in early February amid a perfect storm of overextended positions and monetary fears.""You can't negate all of the volatility with a buy-write strategy, but you can definitely dampen it,"" said Valdez.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:6 Ideas To Consider If The Stock Market Is Making You NervousExtreme Market Moves Taking Hold As Italian Bonds Test ModelsNew Leaders Emerge Among Market-Beating Foreign Stock Plays

17,CBOE,"Here's one to file under the market's memory-loss.Hedge funds hold the most number of short positions on the Cboe Volatility Index since late January — before the record spike in the gauge that wiped out over $5 trillion in global stocks and jolted investors from their complacent slumber.Meanwhile, money managers are back to selling products linked to equity price swings en masse, either to speculate conditions will remain subdued or hedge underlying exposures.""Combined with a more benign view on the cycle than us, some argue that this is still a time to be selling volatility,"" Morgan Stanley cross-asset strategists wrote in a Monday note. Highly valued assets and an aging U.S. economic cycle suggest that view is wrong, the bank said.The luminaries of high finance sound worried. At JPMorgan's annual quant summit in New York last month — featuring BlackRock, Man Group PLC and Pacific Investment Management Company LLC — a volatility event was dubbed the second-biggest risk to quantitative investing after a geopolitical shock.Another warning: Volatility selling has the biggest potential downside among strategies that weigh assets based on their projected sources of returns, or risk-premia investing, according to the JPMorgan survey. The poll canvassed the opinion of up to 270 investors overall.Traders are ignoring a hailstorm of bearish missives, however, lured by the prospect of easy returns. Hedge funds and other leveraged managers hold the most short VIX futures contracts since Jan. 23, data from last week show.Selling volatility isn't just a favored sport for stock bulls, it can offer a reliable source of income for those seeking to hedge. Take investment manager Plurimi Wealth LLP, which three weeks ago flipped to a short VIX position, driven largely by the belief the gauge would fall back below its European counterpart.""We are short U.S. equities, so short VIX has a very high carry and helps you fund a short position in equities,"" Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at the London-based firm, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""It worked out very well.""Shorting the VIX can buffer a bearish equity position, as the gauge trades in the opposite direction of the S&P 500 about 80% of the time.One reason for the product's enduring appeal: the VIX futures curve, which tracks the implied volatility of U.S. stocks over time, looks similar to recent years in the bull market, according to Armstrong. That suggests warnings that global markets have entered a new regime of higher equity price swings look, for now, premature.And being bullish on risk is paying off. The SG Volatility Trading Index, which tracks hedge funds using volatility trading and arbitrage strategies, gained 2.9% in the first quarter, its biggest three-month advance since 2010. Shorting the VIX outright has also reaped returns, as the gauge has declined to trade at its lowest level since Jan. 26.But to Tony Dwyer, equity strategist at Canaccord Genuity, there's a high likelihood that volatility resurfaces. One reason to worry: even a modest uptick in monetary anxiety could roil risk assets on the current trajectory.The Federal Reserve's policy uncertainty index, for example, shows a historically low reading that ""sets the stage for increased volatility as each major economic release hits the tape,"" he said. The gauge has touched this level only four other times, each of which was followed by a sudden swing in prices.""The cycle is far too advanced to give vol. sellers enough time to be able to withstand mean-reversion,"" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote.You May Also Like:Option Trading: MongoDB Carves Base Ahead Of Earnings Report

18,CBOE,"Stocks are calmer these days, but there's one corner of the market where investor nerves are on full display.So far this month, more than $633 million has poured into U.S.-listed exchange-traded products that benefit from a rise in volatility, putting May on track to be the busiest streak for such inflows since August 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.The largest share of that cash — around $275 million — has gone to the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures product, a note tracking Cboe Volatility Index futures. Meanwhile, the demise of the short-volatility trade is continuing apace in the passive space, with a negligible $2.1 million added to the strategy in May so far — even as the bet is capturing speculators again.The last time investors like mom and pop were punting on price swings like this? August 2016, when the VIX index jumped the following month. Then, just as today, investors fretted over U.S. interest-rate risks and Deutsche Bank's earnings woes. Back then, retail folk voted with their feet by piling into VIX ETFs while institutional investors were relatively unruffled as they surrendered hedges.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA similar dynamic of sorts seems to be in play today. For money managers outside the ETF ecosystem, seeking protection against choppy trading appears less compelling while the VIX index trends down toward January levels.Case in point: hedge funds and other leveraged accounts have flipped back to a net short position on VIX futures, meaning they're wagering on more-muted price swings relative to current levels. That's after the fast-money cohort moved to a long VIX position in March for the first time in two years.Of course, VIX ETPs have appeal beyond retail. Some institutional investors may be limited in their ability to hold derivatives, and prefer the product for its convenience and liquidity.In any case, volatility during the week was relatively well behaved.With ""10-year yields surging through 3% and dragging the dollar with it, the footprint on the VIX has been minimal,"" Michael Purves, Weeden & Co.'s chief global strategist, wrote in a note.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:7 Best Ways To Gauge How The Stock Market Is Doing2 New Ideas To Play Top AI, Bitcoin And Blockchain StocksThe Year's Best Sector And How To Invest In It

19,CBOE,"The stock market took another beating in afternoon trading Thursday after President Trump said steel and aluminum tariffs are coming next week. The news trumped additional testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in front of the Senate Banking Committee.X With close to one hour remaining in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite showed losses ranging from 1.5% to 2%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking well above Wednesday's levels as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were on track for their third straight distribution day.Wall Street was certainly fearful as the Cboe Volatility Index, otherwise known as the VIX, jumped 23%. The put/call volume ratio was around 1.19, a high level.Intel (INTC), Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and United Technologies (UTX) took the hardest hits in the Dow, with losses of around 3%. Shares of United Technologies got a lift Wednesday on news investor Bill Ackman took a stake in the industrial giant.In the stock market today, U.S. Steel (X) jumped 5% to 45.73. IBD's steel producers group was one of the day's best performers, rising more than 3%. President Trump said he'll sign a measure next week imposing tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports.Meanwhile, a couple of high-quality names bucked the selling on strong earnings. Salesforce.com (CRM) added 2.5% to 119. It's too extended, though, after reclaiming the 50-day moving average last month.In the retail space, Best Buy (BBY) jumped 3% to 74.67, but it's not nearly as extended as Salesforce at this point.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportInside the IBD 50, a few names in the financial sector weren't affected by selling in the broad market, including TransUnion (TRU), MSCI Inc.

20,CBOE,"Investors preparing for an era of higher volatility may want to take a pause: A sustained period of price swings isn't in the cards quite yet.X Changes in volatility measures may only be short-term reactions rather than a wholesale regime shift, offering a potential tonic to traders who have been on edge since inflation data punched up turbulence in late January. That handed global stocks their worst month since 2016, while U.S. 10-year yields marched to the highest level in four years.Yet equity and Treasury volatility markets show few signs of unabated fear. The move in the Cboe Volatility Index futures curve has been contained to the front end for the most part, suggesting muted expectations for choppy equity conditions further out. U.S. government bonds tell a similar story.Meanwhile, the appetite for longer-dated paper may re-emerge. Add to that spotty economic data suggesting a peak in the inflation recovery story, and the threats that could move us into a pocket of higher volatility have receded, according to Michael Purves, global chief strategist at Weeden & Co.""The volatility surface continues to normalize,"" Purves wrote in a Wednesday note. ""This presumed rate/volatility regime shift is a much more gradual process than one might have expected.""During February's turmoil, front-month futures for the VIX jumped 38%, while the back end advanced 9.7%. Of course, that difference is to be expected during sharp sell-offs, as investors price in current market mayhem vs. the less-known environment of the future.Yet after the turmoil subsided, increased volatility still mainly showed up in the front end of the curve. Even following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress this past week, front-month futures gained 12% compared with 2.9% for the longer-dated contracts, as traders priced in less impact from his hawkishness down the road.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersNot everyone is convinced the threat of a sustained shift to higher volatility has passed. The ultralow regime is already behind us, according to Societe Generale.""The Fed is more tolerant of market volatility, and central bank balance sheets are gradually becoming lighter,"" derivatives strategists at the bank headed by Jitesh Kumar wrote in a Wednesday note. ""Hence, options market flow could move further away from the kind of short vol carry trade that flourished in the recent past, which have been fueling the depressed volatility environment.""The VIX index rose Thursday to 21, as 10-year U.S. yields hovered near 2.86%.One of the biggest catalysts for increased turbulence is continued pain in the U.S. bond market. But yields may not stay elevated for much longer, if history is a guide. Positioning in longer-dated paper shows extreme bearishness — in the past, that has been followed by a bid for the 10-year.Last month, investors held the most net short contracts on 10-year futures in nearly a year, and have already slightly reduced their short exposure, CFTC data show.The uptick in volatility in the interest-rate market is also modest compared with the panic over higher U.S. yields in the aftermath of the 2016 election or the Taper Tantrum of 2013. A gauge of price swings in the Treasury market has risen by 16 points this year to 63 — still below its five-year average of 68.6.Investors may be reacting to economic indicators that suggest the worst inflation scares are behind us, said Purves.""Forward inflation has consolidated its move higher, but has failed to accelerate while the Citi economic and inflation surprise indices continue to trend downwards,"" he wrote. ""Weaker than expected CPI prints in Europe and the weaker China PMI's confirm that the global growth/global inflation recovery story may well have peaked for the time being.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:New Option Strategy Limits Risk Around EarningsChina's VIX Goes Dark As Government Clamps Down On OptionsVIX ETP Investors Are Quick To Forgive Turmoil As Inflows Resume

"
22,CBOE,"The biggest rally ever in the Cboe Volatility Index (CBOE) is raising thorny questions about the future of exchange-traded products tied to the gauge.An ETP meant to mirror moves in the front of the VIX's futures curve plunged more than 75% in after-hours trading following an 80% spike in contracts that comprise its underlying index during the trading day, potentially putting in play triggers that would enable the fund's owners to liquidate it to avoid losses.Nicole Sharp, a spokeswoman for the note's sponsor, Credit Suisse AG's VelocityShares, said in an emailed statement that ""The XIV ETN activity is reflective of today's market volatility. There is no material impact to Credit Suisse."" She didn't elaborate on the fate of the product.But professional traders said a logical interpretation of language in their prospectuses suggests the notes could be liquidated under circumstances that resemble today's.The surge in volatility has already claimed one victim: Nomura Europe Finance announced the early redemption of its Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN, which had 32.4 billion yen (approximately $300 million) in assets.Trading was halted in VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), which trades under XIV, according to a market statement Tuesday.""If they lose more than 80% of their value, the sponsor has the right to liquidate and they should, or they take on the risk. Thus if Bloomberg's indicative value is correct, they are due to be liquidated,"" Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The fund, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, has been wildly popular in the past year as volatility on American equity markets sank to historic lows, delivering an eye-popping return of more than 187% last year. It pulled in nearly $1 billion in just the first five weeks of this year, while the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN has added almost $750 million over the same time frame.Meanwhile, investors have been reluctant to bet on volatility amid the market's extended period of calm. The ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY) has experienced $83 million in outflows this year, while the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has seen $52 million leave.That all changed in a hurry Monday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank as much as 1,597 points on its way to the worst percentage loss since August 2011. The VIX jumped 115%, sending the XIV and SVXY funds down at least 15%.Those moves picked up steam in after-hours trading, as the spike in the VIX spread to its futures contracts — the assets used to determine the price of the funds, in this case, the inverse of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. To prevent massive selling from pushing the value of the fund into negative territory, the issuers outline so-called acceleration events that would give them the power to liquidate the fund. From the prospectus:""An Acceleration Event includes any event that adversely affects our ability to hedge or our rights in connection with the ETNs, including, but not limited to, if the Intraday Indicative Value is equal to or less than 20% of the prior day's Closing Indicative Value,"" the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN's prospectus states.OTHER KEY INVESTORS.COM CONTENT FOR THE CURRENT MARKET:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

23,CBOE,"The Nasdaq composite led another broad-based rally Friday on the back of decent buying in the semiconductor, retail internet, internet content and other technology sectors to cap a rosy start to 2018.X The tech-rich index, up nearly 0.7% at around 3 p.m. ET, also got an assist from fast growing firms in the game software space, such as Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI). The former, up 5% to 112.46, reclaimed both its 50- and 200-day moving averages in swift trading, a positive sign. Watch for a potential new base to finish.Meanwhile, Activision, a nice winner in 2017, is also showing nice support at the 50- and 200-day moving averages lately, but there's clear upside price resistance near the 66-67 level.Stiff gains in heavier than usual volume are a bullish trend, for it hints at a strong appetite for equities by the institutional crowd, i.e. mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks, insurers and pension managers.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were not far behind, up around 0.5% to 0.6%. The Nasdaq is poised to finish the week up more than 3%. Six of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rallied 1 point or more.Another Dow 30 component, DowDuPont (DWDP), is having a terrific week, rising for a fourth straight session and moving further past a 73.95 entry in a sound flat base. Shares are up 1% to 75.28 in mildly below-average turnover.Keep an eye on the chemical giant's relative strength line, drawn in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts. A sharply rising line means a stock is sharply beating the S&P 500. That's one key to market outperformance for your portfolio. Also, if DowDuPont's RS line stretches into new high ground, that would also be bullish.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) delivered a solid rebound, rising 6% to 2,347 and snapping a ""mild"" three-day losing streak.As noted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week, the Bitcoin-tracking ETF is not at any proper buy point. Keep watching to see if it keeps the current correction to a reasonable decline.Given that Bitcoin Investment soared more than 1,500% last year, it's totally acceptable to see a drop in the 40% to 50% range off the 3,522 all-time peak. However, the market laws of supply and demand still apply. Over time, you want to see this and any other ETF or ETN (exchange-traded note) rise in higher or above-average trade, and fall in lighter turnover.Trading exchanges CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) could be alternatives to playing the Bitcoin trend, but keep in mind that Bitcoin futures trading activity, while increasing, is still small for both of these companies relative to their gigantic business involved with equity index, option, fixed income and commodities derivatives.CME Group, up fractionally on Friday, got a solid bounce off the 50-day moving average earlier in the week. The stock may form a new base, but for now it's well extended after clearing a 128.06 buy point in a good flat base in active turnover on Sept. 6 last year.Meanwhile, government bond investors did not ruffle their feathers following a smaller than expected increase in monthly U.S. payrolls. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, in fact, edged up to 2.47%, meaning that bond prices fell on selling pressure. The yield is still below a 2.62% peak seen in 2017, but one could reasonably expect the yield to continue rising amid broad expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise the cost of money perhaps three more times this year.In December 2015, the Fed pushed the fed funds rate on overnight loans to big banks from a near-zero level to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%. In December last year, the U.S. central bank raised rates for a fifth time, sending the fed funds rate to a 1.25%-1.5% range.RELATED:The Bull Market Is Still Hot: What Should You Do Now?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneA Screen For Excellent Growth Stocks: Inside IBD 50How To Achieve Great Long-Term Investing Returns In Stocks: Use This Simple Routine

Meanwhile, oil prices have been getting rocked this week…
"
25,CBOE,"Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) said Friday that shorting of its popular Volatility Index (VIX) will continue despite the collapse of one of the inverse ETFs betting against it.X The prediction came as the options exchange operator fell short of fourth-quarter forecasts, capping a tumultuous week for the stock. EPS jumped 38% to 87 cents but was a penny below expectations. Revenue leapt 66% to $265.6 million, reflecting the acquisition of Bats Global Markets, but was just below the $268 million consensus estimate, according to Zacks Investment Research.Organic revenue grew 8%, while options revenue climbed 12% to $130 million. Futures revenue jumped 31% to $35.6 million, led by a 21% increase in VIX futures.The popularity of the VIX, which is a measure of the S&P 500's future volatility, led to the launch of products that hedge against it. VIX's value goes up in times of volatility, but the extreme turbulence of the week caused the price of the inverse products to tank, and trading in them was suspended on Tuesday.During the earnings call, Cboe executives downplayed the importance of these trades, pointing out that exchange traded products that are designed to short volatility made up less than 5% of average daily volume of VIX in Q4.Management did not provide an exact overall number for the volume of VIX short futures, but they told analysts the total direct volumes from short and long volatility exchange traded funds was around 7%.Management predicted the strategy of short-selling VIX is not going away despite the recent turbulence, and stressed that issuers had made a ""self-interested decision"" to redeem their exchange traded notes.Cboe also said that, outside of those who had invested in inverted volatility products, those making the play are ""true professionals.""Shares of Cboe sank 3.6% to 107.11 on the stock market today, closing above their 200-day moving average after tumbling as much as 13% intraday. For the week, Cboe tumbled 20% amid worries about VIX trades. CME Group (CME), which beat quarterly estimates last week, rallied 2.5% Friday.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.The recent closure of short volatility exchange traded notes means traders do not have to hedge these trades with Cboe's VIX futures any more. Credit Suisse (CS) said Tuesday it will terminate its VelocityShares Inverse VIX product. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Fidelity prevented clients from trading ProShares Short VIX Short-term Futures ETF (SVXY) temporarily.Cboe stock smashed through its 50-day moving average Tuesday as trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, raising concerns about the options exchange's trading volume.Meanwhile, the company was pleased with how smoothly the launch of Cboe Bitcoin Futures XBT, the first Bitcoin futures contract on an established exchange, had gone in December. By the time of the first settlement auction in January there had been more than 124,000 contracts traded with a nominal value of $1.5 billion.

26,CBOE,"Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) stock lost more than a tenth of its value Tuesday and smashed through its 50-day moving average line as trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, raising concerns about trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange.X Shares in Cboe dived 10.4% to 116.94 on the stock market today, plunging through the 50-day for the first time in 10 months in its heaviest share volume in 11 months. Cboe, which found some support above its 200-day line, hadn't closed below the 50-day since late 2016.Cboe is home to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which is seen as a key psychological indicator on fear in the markets. It serves as a measure of the S&P 500's future volatility, and its popularity led to the launch of products which hedged against it.And while the major averages rallied off intraday lows Tuesday following the worst percentage loss (4.6%) for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 2011, Cboe was the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.Cboe's plunge came as trading in VelocityShares Inverse Vix Short-Term (XIV), ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures and VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium-Term (ZIV) was halted. Sales restrictions were also placed on all three products.While the VIX enjoyed a record rise in the past two trading days, the forced closure of short volatility ETNs means traders do not have to hedge these trades with Cboe's VIX futures any more. Quantitative analysis trading strategies have taken advantage of volatility products, with the risk being hedged with futures contracts.It is feared the loss of this business in the future could affect Cboe's corporate profits.Swiss-multinational banking giant Credit Suisse (CS) holds a 32% stake in the VelocityShares Inverse Vix, which launched 2010, and issues its exchange-traded note.The bank said Tuesday it will terminate the product and redeem the notes, which were worth a combined $1.6 billion on Friday. The acceleration date is expected to be Feb. 21, with trading to end the day before.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.""The XIV ETN activity is reflective of today's market volatility,"" Credit Suisse VelocityShares spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said in a press release, ""There is no material impact to Credit Suisse.""The ETN acceleration was triggered as the intraday indicative value of XIV on Monday was equal to or less than 20% of the prior day's closing indicative valueCredit Suisse stock was down 2%.Meanwhile BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager and an operator of the iShares ETF fund family, Tuesday called for a regulatory classification system to label both inverse and levered exchange traded products differently than regular exchange traded funds.Blackrock also said inverse and leveraged ETPs said to deliver double or triple market returns, ""are not ETFs, and they don't perform like ETFs under stress. ... that's why iShares does not offer them.""The 50-day moving average, which measures the running average of price closes over the past 50 trading sessions, acts as a support level during an uptrend, but can also act as a resistance level during a downtrend.However if a stock breaks below the 50-day line in heavy volume for the first time in a run and cannot rally back, it is often a signal that buying demand is drying up and the stock's run is ending.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED INWhen To Sell Stocks: Big Break Below 50-Day Line Can Mark End Of A Huge RunStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Always Cut Your Losses ShortDow Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Not HistoricHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

27,CBOE,"A key part of a swing trading strategy is how it minimizes losses in stock market corrections. But you also need nimbleness to get back in quickly when the market turns. Otherwise your performance can lag.This most recent correction in March started with little exposure in IBD's SwingTrader. Taking profits on the way up left us in cash at the Nasdaq composite's closing high on March 12 (1). We tried a trade in PayPal (PYPL) on March 14 (2) when the market was still close to its highs. We started scaling out the next day as the stock reversed.After a quick drop in the market, we put HubSpot (HUBS) on SwingTrader. It was only a half position. Though HubSpot was breaking out, the Nasdaq's rally attempt never cleared the high from two days earlier (3), which made us cautious. HubSpot exited the same day, ahead of its stop loss, because it reversed from its highs. It was a rare day-trading example for SwingTrader, but the negative action spurred us to protect capital.The Nasdaq composite had a more powerful rally attempt on March 26 (4). This time, the index was up over 3% and cleared the previous day's high. A spike in the Cboe Market Volatility Index, otherwise known as the VIX, also suggested a possible short-term bottoming signal. IBD's Psychological Market Indicators page shows this signal's history for the past year.We tried Netflix (NFLX) that day because of its relative strength at the time. Whereas the Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average, Netflix was well above its 50-day line. But this didn't pan out either. As the market and the stock reversed, we started scaling out of the Netflix position early in the day and removed the remaining shares at day's end.The Nasdaq had another rally attempt that failed quickly on March 29 (5). GoDaddy (GDDY) joined for only a day. We didn't wait for the stop loss and removed the stock as it and the market both showed bearish reversals. The early removal kept the loss small at just over 1%.IBD'S TAKE: SwingTrader is soundly beating the S&P 500 by going to cash before both 10% corrections in 2018. Take a free trial today.It was four losses in a row, but the damage was minimal. First, each purchase was one at a time and HubSpot was only a half position. Second, we cut losses quickly, averaging less than a 2% loss for each trade. That would keep the hit to your portfolio well under a half percent per trade. The Nasdaq by contrast fell 10.9% during that time.One of the psychological aspects of markets is a tendency to find success on the third try. It's a pattern that repeats itself. Often these waves down can last weeks or months. In the swing trading strategy, time is condensed and focused more on days.This latest third rally attempt began on April 3 (6) after another VIX spike suggested a short-term bottom. This time the Nasdaq had more substance to its pullback, with more than a 10% drop from its high. While the index gained 1% on this first day, it was an inside day. That's where both the high and low fall inside the trading range of the previous day. They tend to be questionable signs of direction changes.The following day, however, showed more power with a 1.5% jump on an outside day (7). Both the high and low fell outside the previous day's trading range. The Nasdaq closed near its peak, and it broke above the high from two days prior. We started adding stocks to SwingTrader the next day.The biggest headwinds have come from headlines, mostly on tariffs and fears of a trade war. Still, the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day (8), increasing the chances of the rally continuing, at least in the short term. The index poked its head above its 50-day line but closed the week back below it. Some retracement here wouldn't be unusual. The four names currently on SwingTrader held up through last week.

29,CBOE,"Accelerating inflation is bad. No, wait! It's actually not that bad. X In what turned out to be a mini-lesson in how to view the market action, the major indexes erased early losses, spurred by a bigger-than-forecast jump in January consumer prices, then thrust sharply higher in a sharp increase in trading volume.

30,CBOE,"What's going on with the stock market? After more than a year of gradual to solid gains, investors suddenly discovered that stocks can go down, sharply.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite saw more than a week of heavy selling in whipsaw action, breaking key support lines and leaving them 10% off their highs as of the Feb. 8 market close. Leading stocks crumpled under selling pressure.But despite the breathless coverage of ""record losses"" for the Dow, the stock market has not had some historic meltdown. After an unusually calm 2017, the major averages are in the midst of their biggest pullback in years — and pullbacks and corrections are normal parts of healthy markets. The market has now moved into a correction.The major averages has rallied for past three sessions and was on track for another gain on Wednesday. That's encouraging, but investors should look for further evidence before assuming a new market uptrend is underway.Here's an in-depth analysis of recent stock market action and how you should respond as an investor.The stock market hasn't crashed, though you might not know that from the news. But its losses signaled a change in market direction for the immediate term.After several months of gradual, steady advances, stocks rose sharply for the first few weeks in 2018. The Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rose about 8%, with Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and energy stocks among the big winners.That followed a strong 2017 with few hiccups in the stock market. Investors became complacent with the stock market rising and never suffering a bad loss. Up until Jan. 30, the S&P 500 index hadn't fallen 1% or more since last August. The market hadn't had a cumulative pullback of even 4% since the presidential election. Eventually that had to change.One big change affecting the market is interest rates, which have climbed sharply in 2018 to multiyear highs in the U.S. and around the world as economies have picked up steam.A surprising jump in U.S. wage gains intensified concerns about inflation and the likelihood of a more aggressive Federal Reserve. This week's congressional budget deal that boosts federal spending sharply — on the heels of the big Trump tax cuts — pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to a four-year high of 2.88%. The 10-year bond had ended 2017 at 2.41%.The Dow and other major stock market indexes hit record highs on Jan. 26. The S&P 500 was already up 7.5% in 2018, with the Dow industrials up 7.7% and the Nasdaq 8.7%. Amazon and Netflix had sprinted 20% and 43%.But on Feb. 1, IBD switched its stance on the market direction from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure. The market had finished mixed that day after an up-and-down session. That followed a few mild distribution days — days with selling in above-average volume — since the market top.IBD'S TAKE: Staying in sync with the market direction is one of the most important things an investor can do. Investor's Business Daily lets readers know at a glance what the current state of the stock market is. The Market Pulse graphic in The Big Picture column lets you know if the market is in a confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure or a correction. Subscribers also can find the market direction arrow clearly displayed on the Investors.com home page.Meanwhile, more leading stocks showed weakness. Alibaba (BABA) tumbled on earnings, while several other top China internet stocks struggled as well. Homebuilders and RV makers, two leading groups that began to sell off sharply near the stock market top, continued to slide. Yet there were still some new breakouts.That switch in market direction was a clear warning sign for investors. Market direction is critical and lets you know whether you should be looking to buy stocks, take profits or move to cash. In a confirmed uptrend, most stocks are likely to rise and leading stocks are more likely to deliver huge gains. In a correction or bear market, even top-rated stocks find it hard to make headway. When the market is under pressure, breakouts may occur but are more likely to fail, and other leading stocks struggle.On Friday, Feb. 2, the January U.S. employment report showed that average hourly wages rose 2.9%, the biggest annual gain since 2009 and much higher than expected. That pushed yields even higher, raising the odds of a more aggressive Fed just as Jerome Powell took over as chairman from Janet Yellen. Meanwhile, Apple led a sell-off in the broader iPhone ecosystem on its weak handset sales and current-quarter guidance. Fellow Dow stocks Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) plunged on earnings.Stocks sold off significantly, including the Dow's ominous 666-point tumble, capping the worst weekly percentage losses in two years for the major averages.The next Monday, Feb. 5, stocks plunged in violent action. Talk erupted about the Dow falling 1,175 points, its biggest point loss ever. But that point loss reflects the fact that the Dow is so much higher than it was in prior drops, such as in 1987 or 1929. In percentage terms, the Dow's 4.6% fall was the biggest since August 2011, but only the 25th largest since 1960. For perspective, the Dow plunged 22.6% in its Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987.Still, that Feb. 5 loss was significant. The S&P 500's 4.1% drop was also the worst since August 2011, while the Nasdaq composite's 3.8% was its biggest since the post-Brexit-vote sell-off in June 2016. On a technical basis, the market undercut important support areas. The major averages all fell through their 50-day moving averages, along with many leading stocks. Laggard Apple (AAPL) undercut its 200-day line.The stock market had clearly worsened since Thursday, Feb. 1. The market's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, skyrocketed to multiyear highs. Psychological indicators like the VIX are secondary market gauges to the major averages and leading stocks, but can be contrarian signals. When fear hits extreme levels, it's often a sign of at least a short-term bottom. IBD left the market direction at uptrend under pressure.The stock market went on a wild ride Tuesday, in part because of volatility related to VIX-related products. Stocks sold off sharply intraday but closed higher. The Nasdaq and some leading stocks retook their 50-day lines.But one good stock market day isn't meaningful. In fact, most of the best percentage gains in history are in the midst of deep corrections or bear markets.On Wednesday, stocks whipsawed again, and this time closed lower as a renewed rise in Treasury yields spooked investors again. The Nasdaq fell back below the 50-day line while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials found resistance there. Chips, energy and some China stocks were notable losers.On Thursday, shares opened higher but quickly turned lower as Treasury yields moved back to recent multiyear highs. The Dow Jones fell 4.15%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Leading stocks reeled. After a week of negative action, most stock breakouts from the last several weeks had failed while longer-term winners were slashing gains and falling through support areas.This combination of negative action triggered a shift to an outright market correction, signaling that investors should move to the sidelines. At Thursday's close, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials were 10% off their highs, the traditional level for a correction.On Friday, big swings continued. The Dow tumbled intraday through its Tuesday, Feb. 6 low, joining the other key indexes. The S&P 500 index briefly undercut its 200-day average for the first time since mid-2016. But the major averages then rebounded strongly, closing with gains of 1.4%-1.5%.Even with that gain, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell just over 5% for the week, their worst performance in two years.For a return to a confirmed market uptrend, the major averages must rebound over several days, with at least some strong gains in heavy volume. Friday's rally was encouraging. But as Tuesday's rebound showed, one good day isn't enough.The major averages rose more than 1% on Monday, closing above their Friday intraday highs, passing an early test. Stocks rose modestly on Tuesday, rebounding from morning losses.On Wednesday, the major averages opened lower on hot inflation data. But stocks soon reversed higher, even as the 10-year yield hit 2.90%. The Nasdaq composite rose more than 1% in afternoon trading, moving back above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones advanced more modestly, still below that key support level. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index fell sharply. Look for a rally attempt to be confirmed by one or more price gains in heavy volume in at least one of the major averages.The Dow industrials get a lot of popular attention, but the index represents only 30 stocks. The broader Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index are usually the gauges you should focus on.Another confirming sign of a market uptrend will be if leading stocks break out of bases into buy zones. If there's nothing to buy, the market may be telling you it's too soon to return.Some leading stocks were entering or reclaiming buy points or hitting new highs by Wednesday.Back in December and at the start of the new year, IBD explained why stock market gains in 2018 could be smaller than in 2017, with more corrections during the year.The S&P 500 rallied 19.4% last year, double the historical norm. It was one of only 19 times that the index had returned more than 15% since 1962. After such a strong year, stocks typically rise but not as much. In only one of the 19 cases was there a stronger gain (1997), while there were only four times when the next year was negative. The average gain was 7.5%.Meanwhile, few signs indicate a bear market is looming. Bear markets are typically associated with a recession. That seems unlikely in the near term, with economic growth strong across the globe for the first time in several years.While bond yields are rising as a result, inflation is still low. The Federal Reserve aims to raise rates toward more normal levels. But the Fed, like other central bankers, does not want to unnerve financial markets.Earnings are robust, with more S&P 500 companies beating profit views than at any time since 2009. Companies are hiking 2018 earnings forecasts on the new Trump tax cuts.Some people say we're due for the nine-year bull market to end, but stock market cycles don't follow a set calendar. Bear markets typically are preceded by a sharp ascent. Good examples include the tail end of the dot-com rally in early 2000 and the housing bubble run-up to 2007.While January 2018 was a strong month, for much of last year the major averages were just grinding higher. And there were few climax runs in leading stocks. Square (SQ) exhibited some climax-like characteristics, but that stock was turbocharged as part of the Bitcoin climax top in December.Another harbinger of a bear market — big year-over-year increases in margin debt — also is relatively low. However, the rise of double- and triple-leverage ETFs means that margin levels may not reflect speculation and investor exposure as well as before.If the market had moved into a full-blown bear — often defined as stock market down 20% or more — you'd see sustained heavy selling, breaking through multiple support areas in heavy volume. Rebound attempts would be short-lived. The vast majority of stocks would fall, with leading stocks breaking down en masse.Pay attention to the market by following the major averages and leading stocks. IBD's daily market analysis, including the Stock Market Today articles and The Big Picture, will keep you in sync with the S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq as well as top stocks and groups.Don't fight the stock market. Most stocks move with the market, so a correction is a time to sell stocks and move to the sidelines.For those determined to stay invested, you should probably take at least partial profits. Follow sell rules. If a stock falls 7% to 8% below your buy point, just sell. Don't let stocks that had run up 10% or more turn into losers. Remember, if you get out and a stock bounces back, you'll get another chance to buy — or you'll have capital for another quality stock.Keep in mind that these rules apply to individual stocks. When it comes to diversified mutual funds and ETFs, long-term investors may take a different approach. Whereas specific stocks might not bounce back in the next upturn, the broad market eventually will recover. Investors can use market pullbacks and corrections to add to holdings of diversified funds.Still, there is a way for fund investors to reduce losses and capture gains in the next upturn through market timing. The ETF Market Strategy uses the current market direction in IBD's Market Pulse feature to determine when to buy and sell a broad stock index ETF like PowerShares QQQ (QQQ).When the stock market clearly resumes an uptrend — whether it's next week or months from now — you want to be ready.  The market can turn very quickly. When a new rally takes hold, the first leading stocks that break out often turn out to be big uptrend winners.So stay engaged with the stock market. This is a great time to build a watch list. Buying right solves most of your holding and selling problems.Look for highly rated companies with strong and rising relative strength lines. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. If the market corrects or moves sideways, these stocks may set up in bullish patterns and be leaders in the next uptrend. Good examples of top stocks with RS lines at or near record highs include Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) and AbbVie (ABBV).For more help finding quality stocks, check out IBD's premium products Leaderboard and Marketsmith.You can also look for stocks that found support at their 50-day line and didn't give up too much ground.A great place to find potential stocks to watch during a downturn is via IBD's stock lists, including the IBD 50, the Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders.Keep editing your watch list during corrections. Some stocks that hold up well initially will break down, while others will begin to outperform.When everyone is bullish, nobody wants to sell but there are no longer many people left to buy. That's why excessive bullishness can mark at least short-term tops. Markets rise on a wall of worry. They need investors coming off the sidelines and buying stocks. So a dose of fear in investors is healthy.Pullbacks and corrections clear the decks and set the stage for a new strong uptrend. Leading stocks can set up in bases, and you can buy these first movers when the major averages confirm the new stock market rally.The original version of this story published on Feb. 8.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:When To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains

32,CBOE,"The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite suffered their worst one-day and weekly losses in years, while leading stocks suffered major damage. The stock market moved into a correction. Nvidia (NVDA), Snap (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR) rallied on strong earnings. Grubhub (GRUB) shot up on a big deal with KFC and Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM). Tesla sold off after in-line results and an out-of-this world publicity stunt.X With the major averages and many leading stocks tumbling, intensifying losses from the prior week's big losses, the stock market moved from uptrend under pressure to an outright correction.

37,CBOE,"Equity volatility is elevated but options trading shows investors' appetite for protection hasn't picked up, indicating hedging is needed, according to Goldman Sachs Group (GS).Strategists led by John Marshall observed that ""a large number"" of S&P 500 hedges expired over the past three weeks, leaving the average investor more exposed to stock swings. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index almost doubled in the first quarter as concerns over global trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stirred up market turbulence. The options gauge, known as VIX, jumped 20% to 23.89 as of 12:11 p.m. in New York.While the heightened volatility has been largely contained in the stock market, that increase may suppress the risk appetite in other assets over the coming months, potentially spurring widespread turbulence, according to Goldman Sachs.""A shift towards risk reduction and expectation of higher volatility is likely to change the trading dynamics in 2018 and increase the value of time spent on hedging,"" the strategists wrote in a note to clients. ""The spike in VIX and realized volatility was large enough for investors outside the equity market to take notice.""The firm identified seven major concerns, including a credit meltdown and growth deceleration, as the biggest threat to financial markets. After studying the relationship between each risk factor and all asset classes, the strategists recommended the cheapest options for each dangerous scenario.Investors fretting over credit stress should buy options on Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund, they said. For those worried about rising interest rates or inflation, derivative contracts on VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) are attractive.The strategists don't recommend buying S&P 500 options to hedge against losses in the U.S. equity benchmark, because they see contracts on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index and WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) as cheaper.

38,CBOE,"President Trump's escalating trade war with China has been roiling the stock market.China on Wednesday slapped tariffs on $50 billion in U.S. goods, one day after the Trump administration announced plans for tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports. The first round of tariffs from China on $3 billion in American products had been in response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.For many, this is a sign that the war is on. But what consequences will this have on ETFs holding stocks that are caught in the trade war crossfire?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The biggest thing for the market right now is to figure out whether (the Trump tariffs are) a trade poker or trade policy,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. ""If the tariffs are really trade poker, all that is doing is creating near-term uncertainty in the marketplace and increasing volatility.""Indeed, equity market volatility as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) was on average 55% higher in the first quarter of 2018 vs. the record low average of last year, according to Bloomberg Finance and SSGA. And, February and March marked the first time two consecutive months saw outflows from U.S.-listed equity ETFs since February 2008 as investors reallocated into safer areas of the market.""What's important to know for ETF investors is China is the largest country exposure in well-diversified ETFs Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM), iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets (IEMG) and SPDR Portfolio Emerging Markets (SPEM),"" said Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. ""Investors get sizable exposure to China, but what they also get is exposure to other countries ... they do get the benefits of diversification.""Vanguard's $68 billion VWO, BlackRock's $41.9 billion EEM and $49.2 billion IEMG, as well as State Street's $1.7 billion SPEM each gained between 10% to 12% this year to their Jan. 26 peaks. However, those funds were 7% off their highs through April 4. And $4.5 billion iShares China Large-Cap (FXI) was down 12%.Rosenbluth says that investing in a single-country ETF comes not only with that emerging market's specific risk, but will also depend on what kind of companies are represented and how trade agreements evolve over time. For example, a South Korean ETF would provide exposure to a large-cap multinational name such as Samsung Electronics, where demand for its products is global and not just coming from the U.S.What's important, stresses SSGA's Bartolini, is ""looking at the percent of revenue that different sectors generate from China. And the biggest sector that generates revenue from China is the technology sector. That is led by semiconductors."" He estimates that the tech sector gets about 9% of revenue from China, and within that, the semiconductor industry generates 30% from China.""If there's a protracted trade war, that could curtail some of the positive revenue and growth that the tech sector has been experiencing,"" said Bartolini, ""And this is all happening at a time where you're having more stock-specific risk impacting that sector, particularly with Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and now some of the recent semiconductor news that came out with respect to autonomous vehicles."" Despite the macro noise, however, he says that ""the micro or fundamental signal still remains quite strong for tech stocks.""With China being a major importer of soybeans, ETFs such as $15.8 million Teucrium Soybean (SOYB) could be hit by the tariffs, said Dave Nadig, CEO at ETF.com. ""I think aerospace and defense is another area where we see some concern about whether or not we're going to have a pullback there,"" he added. Funds in this sector include $5.8 billion iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA), $1.3 billion SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) and $1 billion PowerShares Aerospace & Defense (PPA). They fell 6% to 7% from their highs, though they've since trimmed losses.On the positive side, Canada is exempt from the tariffs and is a major exporter of steel to the U.S. ""This potentially removes a competitor for Canadian companies in the sense that China won't be able to compete, and that could be quite good for the Canadian economy overall and Canadian steel manufacturers in particular,"" Nadig noted. Canadian ETFs include $2.6 billion iShares MSCI Canada (EWC) and $554 million Vanguard FTSE Canada (VCE), both of which have declined with the market sell-off.""History would suggest that nobody wins a trade war,"" said Nadig. ""They're universally bad for not just the countries involved but the global economy. I'm sure there are relative winners and losers in a trade war, but overall, it's just bad!""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Apple Retakes Key Support As Big-Cap Tech Stocks Boost DowHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpLooking For Better Returns?

39,CBOE,"The prime suspects in February's global rout may be at it again.Inverse exchange traded funds — which use leverage to bet against stocks and volatility indexes — have seen trading activity skyrocket to ominous levels as markets whipsawed last week. In fact, turnover has only been higher two other times since the financial crisis: in 2016 during a correction and in February when a surging Cboe Volatility Index forced short funds to unwind.The difference this time is that inverse leveraged technology ETFs are at the center of the action, rather than volatility products.There's nothing necessarily odd about a pickup in volume during periods of market stress.

Indeed, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VXX) had muted increases in value traded compared to inverse tech funds.""One theory for SPY and VXX's lack of heightened volume might be that the very big fish aren't worried or are already hedged, and that the sort of mid-sized institutional crowd is playing this,"" Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. ""It's the quick buck trading group.""On average — over the four days through March 27 — one inverse ETP share was traded for about every 50 shares traded on the U.S. tape.

In the past two years, average daily turnover was $140 million.The jump in volume has an ominous historical parallel, according to Balchunas.""If you just look at the tech-geared stuff doubling or tripling in volume, it's the same way the financials leveraged ETFs traded in 2008,"" he said.

""Citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash — no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities,"" she said.That explosive potential helps explain why so many tech entrepreneurs and investors turned cryptocurrencies into a 21st Century gold rush, even as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has trashed Bitcoin as ""a fraud.""Dimon and other titans of finance voice certainty that commercial banks will remain indispensable, cryptocurrencies will stay on the fringe, and governments will want to keep it that way.Blockchain's potential to revolutionize the financial system has some central banks studying whether to issue their own digital currency. Yale University scholars have proposed the FedCoin. In this cryptocurrency future, FedCoin could make monetary policy more flexible and forceful, even allowing for negative interest rates.If a cryptocurrency acted as a reliable, widely accepted store of value, people could cut ties to their banks. They could keep some crypto cash in digital wallets, with other liquid assets in mutual funds, stocks and government bonds.A Bank of England study concluded that a central-bank cryptocurrency could boost GDP by 3%. Gains would come, in part, from shrinking ""monetary transaction costs that are analogous to distortionary tax rates.""Yet FedCoin looks far-fetched at present because of the massive disruption it could cause. Central bank crypto dollars ""could endanger the economically and socially important financial intermediation function of commercial banks,"" JPMorgan analysts warned.The contribution of fractional reserve banking to global growth — turning each $1 of deposits into $10 in loans — could fade. ""We would expect that central banks would think twice before disturbing this source of capital to the private sector."" Dimon is surely right about one thing: The cryptocurrency future will depend heavily on government. That could mean smothering it with regulation, stealing its thunder via FedCoin or cultivating it with a light regulatory touch.Bitcoin hit its 2018 low early on Feb. 6, the morning of a key Senate cryptocurrency hearing, briefly undercutting $6,000. The chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission both urged stronger oversight. But the financial regulators stopped short of sounding an alarm. Nor did they call for any legislation to rein in cryptocurrencies. In the weeks after that hearing, Bitcoin rebounded to around $11,000 but it has retreated yet again to below $7,000.Bitcoin had doubled in the first half of December, hitting a peak above $19,000 just as Bitcoin futures began trading on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME (CME). The anticipation of futures trading, touted as validation from U.S. regulators, stoked speculation.At the Senate hearing, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who earned his fortune as an early investor in the cell phone industry, said he sees a parallel between mobile phones then and cryptocurrencies now. ""The same kind of transformation is about to take place,"" he said.Warner criticized the CFTC for embracing Bitcoin options at this stage. He fretted that total cryptocurrency market capitalization could hit $20 trillion — vs. $300 billion now — with another 2017-like surge.""This rises potentially to the level of a systemically relevant event,"" Warner said.Yet there's reason to doubt that cryptocurrency frenzy will return. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) — Ma Bell in Warner's analogy — banned credit-card purchases of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the SEC and foreign governments have cracked down on initial coin offerings. And lately, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google, Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have banned cryptocurrency ads.Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned via Twitter not long ago that cryptocurrencies ""could drop to near-zero at any time."" He added that ""traditional assets are still your safest bet.""The Bank for International Settlements, the central banker for global central banks, has warned that cryptocurrencies in the future could become a ""threat to financial stability"" if regulators aren't vigilant. U.S. regulators appear to be playing catch-up. As of Feb. 6, the cryptocurrency working group put together by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had held a single meeting.Politicians and central bankers worry that cryptocurrencies won't hold value in a panic. ""When things really go bad, where do Americans turn?"" Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker asked a fintech conference last fall. ""Well, they're going to come back to the government. That's the history of the country.""Harker did allow that other currency models might work if another ""large player"" besides the government provided trust.Who could fill that role? Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz offered some thoughts on the coffee chain's January earnings call.""I personally believe that there is going to be one or a few legitimate, trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology,"" Schultz said. He doubted that Bitcoin would be one of them.Cryptocurrencies ""will have to be legitimized by a brand in a brick-and-mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.""Starbucks wants to play a role but isn't making a big investment in a cryptocurrency future right now, Schultz said.Cryptocurrency investors have speculated that Amazon might accept Bitcoin or one of its digital rivals. That specific cryptocurrency would vault past competitors as a trusted store of value and useful medium of exchange. Amazon even registered the domains AmazonEthereum.com, AmazonCryptocurrency.com and AmazonCryptocurrencies, kicking such talk into high gear.Alternatively, Amazon, Walmart — or a consortium of large companies — might issue their own cryptocurrency. Doing so could let them save on transaction costs and act as a competitive weapon.But Amazon has also been cozying up with JPMorgan. Recently, Amazon and JPMorgan have partnered in a health care venture and in creating a new type of bank account.Yet imagine if Amazon or Walmart rewarded loyal customers with tokens that could escalate in value. The tokens would jump to the head of the cryptocurrency pack with potential for broad acceptance as a currency. Customers would likely hoard the tokens, rather than spend them. The effect on sales and profits might be electric.For a digital currency to gain wide acceptance from outside businesses, the issuer would have to act like a central bank. Governing a currency requires trust, so some functions might need independence from corporate issuers.Those milestones could ease fears of a massive cryptocurrency crash. The Fed shouldn't need to rush in and save the day if AmazonCoin or WalmartCoin crashed.Currencies rely on conservative and predictable rules to assure the public that massive money printing won't destroy value. Could people trust the central bank of Amazon?Then again, will people always be able to count on the Fed?The Fed controls the creation of money, but central bankers seem to be losing their grip. Any loss of faith in the dollar and the Fed bodes well for a cryptocurrency future as dollar-skeptics look for an alternative store of wealth — besides gold.Bitcoin's peer-to-peer electronic payment system, first proposed in 2008 to verify transactions through a decentralized public blockchain, arrived on the scene as the global financial crisis triggered bailouts of one big bank after another.Bitcoin fulfilled famed economist Friedrich Hayek's idea of denationalizing money. He believed competition could help keep central banks honest and prevent runaway inflation.Doubts fueled by ""ballooning balance sheets of the major central banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis"" motivated early cryptocurrency investors, JPMorgan analysts wrote. Yet the lack of any upsurge in inflation since ""has surely reduced concerns about fiat (legal tender issued by a central bank) money.""Yet the Fed now faces a much different challenge: a runaway federal deficit even amid a strong U.S. economy. The deficit will top $1 trillion in fiscal 2019 and $2 trillion by 2027, and there's no fix in sight. Republicans have overseen big deficit-financed tax cuts and increased government spending. Democrats want more generous Social Security benefits, Medicare for all and debt-free college.""The continued growth of public debt raises eventual sustainability questions if left unchecked,"" Goldman Sachs economists warned recently.The Fed seems on track to suffer the same fate as the Bank of Japan. The BoJ has been forced to accommodate sky-high government deficits with easy money and asset purchases. Japan, with a falling working-age population, hasn't had a whiff of inflation. But the U.S. might be a different story.Deutsche Bank global credit strategist Jim Reid put this shocking headline on a November report: ""The Start of the End of Fiat Money?"" Reid argued high debt levels will keep the Fed and other central banks too accommodative, putting fiat currencies at risk.""The fiat currency system may be seriously tested over the coming decade and ultimately we may need to find an alternative,"" Reid wrote. ""Cryptocurrencies are all the rage at the moment and are as much about blockchain as anything else, but there could be an increasing desire for alternative"" mediums of exchange in the years to come.""Keep in mind that fiat money is a relatively young innovation. It's only truly been the norm since President Nixon ended the dollar's quasi-gold standard in 1971.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisBurned By Bitcoin?

43,CBOE,"The avalanche of volatility pouring down on investors took another victim Tuesday with the liquidation of a newfangled security at the center of the storm. It remains to be seen if the move will stabilize markets that have already seen $3 trillion of value erased.X While U.S. equities calmed somewhat, questions remain over how a security that quickly became a favorite of investors could enact enough stress in the market's plumbing that it shook stock markets from New York to Tokyo.The catalyst has been unprecedented moves in the Cboe Volatility Index (CBOE) that have roiled the market for exchange-traded products tied to the fear gauge. Credit Suisse said a spike in VIX futures will force it to liquidate an ETP that moves in the opposite direction, effectively wiping out a fund whose market value topped $2 billion three weeks ago.More than a dozen other funds triggered limit up/limit down rules that halted trading as of 10 a.m. ET. Among the suspensions was a ProShares inverse ETP, which sank more than 80% in after hours trading Monday. Horizons ETFs Management Canada  suspended redemptions of its ETF that bets against VIX futures.The VIX swung wildly Tuesday, tumbling as much as 40% before trading flat around 36. It more than doubled on Monday in its biggest-ever runup and topped 50 earlier Tuesday.Betting against volatility has become a popular money-making strategy in the years since the financial crisis, with banks and other financial companies offering a plethora of 'short-vol' products. But exchange traded notes and funds that give investors a quick and easy way of entering the trade have also been criticized for their risks. BlackRock has been calling for regulation that would clearly spell out the dangers associated with such inverse and leveraged exchange-traded products.Credit Suisse Group is buying back the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), which it issued. The ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) is meanwhile expected to open for business on Tuesday, ProShares Advisors, which manages the fund, said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The VelocityShares notes, which mirror the inverse performance of the Cboe volatility index, will be called on Feb. 21, the bank said in a statement Tuesday. XIV dropped 14% during the session on Monday and its net asset value plunged more than 80% in late trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit Suisse said it's redeeming early because the indicative value on Feb. 5 was equal to or less than 20% of the prior day's closing indicative value.The bank has not suffered any trading losses related to the exchanged-traded note, the company said in an earlier statement Tuesday. The Swiss lender was the biggest holder on the note with 32% at the end of the third quarter. The ETN had a market value of about $2.2 billion at its record high on Jan. 11.The surge in volatility had already claimed one victim: Nomura Europe Finance announced the early redemption of its Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN, which had 32.4 billion yen ($297 million) in assets.OTHER KEY INVESTORS.COM CONTENT FOR THE CURRENT MARKET:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

The social-networking platform is rising from a test of support at its 10-week moving average, below a 108.40 buy point in a late stage flat base.Earnings action is light Monday, primarily limited to thinly traded names. Reports due after the close include Casey's General Stores (CASY), which is climbing the right side of an 16-month consolidation and is 113% off a September low. KMG Chemicals (KMG), a stock that ended Friday 8% below a 59.50 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, is also reporting.RELATED:The Big Pic: Nasdaq, S&P 500 Tell Different TalesBitcoin Futures Surge As CBOE Trading StartsIBD 50: Time To Buy Stocks In These New Sectors?

45,CBOE,"Bitcoin rebounded Tuesday after briefly undercutting the key $10,000 support area once again as South Korea banned the use of anonymous bank accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges and U.S. regulators signaled more scrutiny into companies suddenly pivoting to blockchain technology.X South Korea, which accounts for 20% of global Bitcoin transactions, said the new ruling will begin at the end of the month and will ban foreigners without local bank accounts and children under 19 from purchasing Bitcoin.But the crackdown may be a precursor to a larger one as Seoul considers banning all crypto trading.Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it will be monitoring companies' names and business models to ensure they aren't just taking advantage of investors.""The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed-ledger technology,"" Chairman Jay Clayton told an audience at a Northwestern law school conference, according to Bloomberg.Long Island Iced Tea changed its name to Long Blockchain (LBCC) in December, sending shares soaring 183% over the name change. In October, an animal hormone production seller Bioptix changed its name to Riot Blockchain (RIOT) with the intent of investing in the blockchain space. Eastman Kodak (KODK) jumped over 200% after announcing it was creating Kodakcoin earlier this month, and Hooters operator Chanticleer Holdings (BURG) said it was getting a cryptocurrency loyalty program.Bitcoin's spot price was $11,119.59 on CoinDesk, after briefly undercutting $10,000.

Bitcoin's spot price was $17,711.73 on Coindesk, up 7.1%.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a Bitcoin-tracking investment vehicle, rose 13.1% in the stock market today.The moves in the market come as more officials warn against getting seduced by Bitcoin's massive price increases. The SEC this week issued some advice about cryptocurrencies. Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday said Bitcoin's presence in the payments world was very small, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and a ""highly speculative asset.""As for other cryptocurrency-related stocks, Overstock.com (OSTK) — an online retailer that has rapidly moved into blockchain — advanced 11%.That stock catapulted higher on Monday after Morgan Stanley Investment Management disclosed an 11.4% stake in the company, and again on Wednesday after Overstock's CEO said he might sell the Overstock.com business to fund a blockchain-based global property registry system.On Thursday, Overstock and its subsidiary tZero — a blockchain-based capital markets platform — said it had signed a letter of intent to partner with Siebert Financial (SIEB) to offer ""deeply discounted online trading"" in the first quarter of next year.

47,CBOE,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages to record highs helped by Trump tax cut momentum. Bitcoin futures had a successful launch on the Cboe Global Markets (CBOE). Walt Disney (DIS) agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox (FOXA) while also launching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" The Federal Reserve raised rates while the FCC repealed net neutrality. Adobe Systems (ADBE) had strong earnings and guidance while Oracle (ORCL) missed on cloud revenue and cloud guidance.X The Nasdaq rose 1.4%, the Dow industrials 1.3% and the S&P 500 index 0.9%, all hitting record highs Friday as the GOP finalized its tax legislation with apparently enough support to pass. The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers. Some analysts are expecting around $200 million from the film domestically. The film opened to the public on Thursday evening, with an estimated $45 million in ticket salesThe Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal utilitylike oversight on internet service providers, delivering regulatory reversal sought by Comcast, AT&T, Verizon Communications and other ISPs. FCC chairman Ajit Pai  said the new rules will ""return regulatory parity to the internet economy."" He said some giant internet companies engage in anti-consumer behavior, while ISPs have been unfairly targeted by regulators. State regulators, Comcast and others said Congress should step in and pass internet legislation. One analyst put the chances of that at less than 30%.The Federal Reserve raised rates at its final meeting of the year, as expected. Policymakers also still expect to raise interest rates three times next year and didn't seem concerned about Trump tax cuts overheating the economy. Economic data backed a Goldilocks scenario. November retail sales were much stronger than expected, core consumer inflation cooled.Several biotechs popped on news stemming from the American Society of Hematology conference last week in Atlanta, while clinical trial data from others fell short. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared Monday after it reported improvement in patients using its LentiGlobin therapy to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Fellow CAR-T player Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), though, retreated nearly 22% in two days despite strong data in patients with a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Investors wanted more data, analysts said. On Tuesday, GlycoMimetics (GLYC) rocketed on data from its drug in acute myeloid leukemia, but Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) sank following its presentation of its sickle cell disease drug. Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) crashed on its hemophilia A drug data, suggesting a later approval than a rival treatment from Biomarin (BMRN).

OPEC said that it doesn't see oil markets balancing until late next year on increased U.S. production, throwing into doubt recent talk of forming an exit strategy from its output cut deal. The International Energy Agency raised its 2017 growth forecast for U.S. crude by 390,000 barrels per day and by 870,000 bpd in 2018 vs. estimates in its November report. But the energy watchdog sees a ""closely balanced market"" in 2018.Western Digital (WDC) raised its financial outlook after settling a lengthy legal battle with Toshiba over the ownership and expansion of a flash-memory-chip business. Toshiba Memory will be allowed to sell its stake in the joint venture to a consortium led by Bain Capital. Western Digital gets to participate in the development of new factory expansions and certain rights to the chip output. Western Digital shares rose on the news, but closed the week up just 0.2%.Consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL) committed to spending $390 million on components from optical device maker Finisar (FNSR) to help fund a new factory in Texas to make vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.

Boeing shares hit record highs. That's despite Delta Air Lines (DAL) snubbing the aerospace giant. Delta will buy 100 Airbus (EADSY) A321neos, worth $12.7 billion at list prices. The carrier had been in talks to buy 100 of Boeing 737 Max 10 jets.Airbus fell on reports, confirmed Friday, that CEO Tom Enders will leave at the end of his term in February 2019, while COO Fabrice Bregier will exit in February, amid U.K. and French corruption probes.Delta Air Lines (DAL) raised its fourth-quarter unit revenue guidance, lifting shares above a buy point despite a weaker margin outlook. JetBlue (JBLU) also raised unit revenue guidance, but shares reversed lower.

49,CBOE,"Online retailer Overstock.com (OSTK) on Wednesday said that its CEO and founder, Patrick Byrne, and the economist Hernando de Soto have helped form a new joint venture that will build a blockchain-based global registry system intended to strengthen property rights in the developing world.But could Overstock.com be sold off, potentially to a private-equity or investment firm, to pay for that project? Byrne hasn't ruled the option out.""One of the possibilities is I sell the (Overstock) business and we have all the capital we need,"" Byrne told the Financial Times, adding that he has commissioned Guggenheim Partners to explore a possible sale.The sale of the online retailer, the Financial Times noted, would leave Byrne with Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary that focuses on blockchain investment.Overstock jumped 14% to 60.90 in the stock market today. That jump came just two days after the stock blasted 22% higher after Morgan Stanley Investment Management disclosed an 11.4% stake in the company.The new joint venture announced Wednesday, called De Soto Inc., was formed by Byrne and De Soto along with Medici Ventures. The move marks Overstock's latest advance into the shared record-keeping technology, which was initially used to process Bitcoin transactions.More recently, though, the technology has increasingly been tested out by other companies — from IBM (IBM) to JPMorgan (JPM) — to potentially process financial transactions more quickly or create a digital trail to track shipments and prevent fraud.In a blockchain, transactions or other data are recorded on a digital ledger that everyone participating in the recording of that information can see. Everyone involved has to agree that the information being recorded is accurate before it is sealed off in a block of code, making it difficult to tamper with.But in many parts of the world, property ownership is based on informal documentation, allowing room for exploitation and corruption.De Soto, a world-renowned economist, has long seen stronger property rights as a way to prevent government repression and a way for the poor to participate in the economy. He has also seen blockchain as a way to solidify claims to property ownership.""You have an Internet of Things,"" de Soto told IBD last year. ""But what you don't have is an Internet of Rights.""De Soto Inc. plans to use blockchain to bring together scores of those informal property records to create a ""global repository on which ownership and transfer can be based."" The company plans to launch its first pilot program early next year.""About 80% of the world's population is unable to enter into the modern global economy due to lack of visible and standardized property records,"" de Soto said in a statement. ""Billions of people have resources that cannot easily be transformed into productive capital. Blockchain is a powerful tool to solve these structural issues, which are some of the principal causes of poverty and conflict.""Within real estate alone, the poor segments of the population in developing nations own $14 trillion in assets that amount to ""dead capital,"" or something that, essentially, has little value because it lacks the documentation necessary to convert it into money.""Lacking formal ownership and the legal protection it affords, citizens of the developing world may turn for protection to terrorist organizations, who gain power by promising enforcement of de facto local property ownership,"" Overstock's statement said.Meanwhile, as the hype grows around Bitcoin, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said Tuesday that it will allow traders to short Bitcoin futures, a spokeswoman told Bloomberg. Cboe (CBOE) debuted such futures on Sunday. Cboe Bitcoin futures tumbled 7% to $16,750 on Wednesday.CME Group (CME) will launch its own Bitcoin futures contract next Monday.Interactive Brokers sank 1.6%, but has been on a long run.RELATED:Here's What Fed Chief Janet Yellen Thinks About BitcoinBitcoin Futures Soar In Debut; These Crypto Stock Plays JumpSEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesHere's Why Bitcoin May Be The 'Bubble To End All Bubbles'

""Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.""Twitter will continue evaluate and update the policy as the industry evolves, the firm also said. Facebook issued a similar policy on Jan. 30, and Google made its change on March 14 amid concerns that crypto ads might rip off their users.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast week, Bitcoin plunged on reports that the social media platform was considering a ban on cryptocurrency-related ads, falling near the $7,000 level.On Monday, Bitcoin fell 6.1% to $7,937.40, according to Coindesk, and had reached as high as $8,980.99 on Saturday. Ethereum tumbled 9%. Bitcoin Cash dropped 7.1%. And Ripple, also known as XRP, retreated 7.6%.Shares of Twitter rallied 2.8% on the stock market today. Among Bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) was down 1.9%, Long Blockchain (LBCC) fell 1.8%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) tumbled 6.3%, and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) sank 8.1%.Overstock.com (OSTK) gave up 1.3% to 44.60.

He has no evidence,"" Zhu told CNBC. ""There is no content for his report and we see no fraud as a third-party investor-relations firm.""Longfin CEO Venkat Meenavalli was unavailable for comment Monday, but said in December that the company's several-billion-dollar cap was unjustified when the stock hit its record high of 142.82 on Dec. 18. It came just days after the firm announced it was acquiring Ziddu.com, a blockchain-focused firm which had zero revenue.But there was positive news on the digital currency front after Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) President Chris Concannon said the market could support the launch of a Bitcoin exchange traded product, or ETP.In a letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission, he cited data collected from the company's launch of Bitcoin futures late last year.In January, the SEC voiced concerns over investor protection and market fragmentation, but Concannon has claimed Bitcoin commodity markets ""are developing quickly.""""While the current Bitcoin futures trading volumes on Cboe Futures Exchange and CME (CME) may not currently be sufficient to support ETPs seeking 100% long or short exposure to Bitcoin, Cboe expects these volumes to continue to grow and in the near future reach levels comparable to those of other commodity futures products at the time that they were included in ETPs,"" Concannon said in his letter.He also stated that being able to invest in digital currencies through an ETP would ""provide a more transparent and easily accessible vehicle for gaining such exposure.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

51,CBOE,"The problem with investing is you can lose money — and sometimes a lot of it.Investors in VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term Exchange-Traded Note (XIV) learned that the hard way. The product blew up and has since been liquidated, leaving investors with big losses. Now, they're suing Credit Suisse Group (CS), the note's issuer, and Janus Index & Calculation Services, the publisher of the note's intraday indicative value and closing indicative value.XIV was one of 19 exchange-traded products that tracked the Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX. XIV wasn't an ETF, but an exchange-traded note (ETN). ETNs don't hold underlying securities, like stocks or bonds. They're unsecured debt instruments issued by a bank that promises to pay the performance of an index. XIV promised to pay the inverse of the VIX. If the VIX went down, XIV would go up that amount, and vice versa. It did this by buying and shorting VIX futures.XIV had become popular because over the previous five years it had returned 2,200%, according to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. Then on Feb. 5, the VIX jumped 100%. Reports say the note's price was $72.59 at 4 p.m. ET and fell to $4.22 by 5:10 p.m., during which time its indicative value was not updated every 15 seconds as was typical. Janus Index & Calculation Services was responsible for providing the estimates of the note's value. Because the note had lost more than 90% of its value, Credit Suisse enacted a provision the next day to close the ETN to prevent further losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The issuers build in a cushion so that if it lost 70% of its value, it liquidates. It's all done,"" said Peter Shea, partner at law firm K&L Gates. ""In this instance, the VIX shot up so high it ate into about all their cushion by the end of the day.""The investors are suing, saying they suffered damages because they relied ""on the integrity of the market, they paid artificially inflated prices for the Notes. Plaintiff and the Class would not have purchased the Notes at the prices they paid, or at all, if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely inflated by defendants' misleading statements,"" according to court documents.Credit Suisse told IBD: ""The publicly available prospectus accurately and fully disclosed the risks of an investment in XIV, which is only intended for sophisticated institutional clients. Credit Suisse did not engage in any conduct designed to mislead investors regarding XIV's value or cause the Feb. 5, 2018, decline in XIV's price.""Janus was not available for comment.""People will sue because they'll say that they didn't realize they would get liquidated and have their losses locked in. In other words, they didn't read the prospectus,"" Shea said. ""It's a very sophisticated product and a lot of people don't have the basics to understand it or have simplified disclosure to educate themselves on the basics of it, so a lot of retail investors should stay away from products like this.""""There's no denying it was painful,"" said Bloomberg's Balchunas. ""But unless there is some kind of manipulation we haven't seen, it doesn't seem like much of a case, because everything was disclosed in the prospectus and the ETN tracked what it was tracking. VIX futures had as good of a day as the ETN had bad. Since you're inverse the futures, you went down as much as they went up.""Another exchange-traded product suffered huge losses on Feb. 5 as well, but managed to stay open.The ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) also fell about 90% that day. On Feb. 27, the fund changed from giving the inverse performance to one-half the inverse (-0.5x) of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index for a single day. If the fund meets its new objective, on a day the index falls 1%, the fund should rise approximately 0.5%, before fees. Similarly, on a day the index rises 1%, the fund should fall about 0.5%.Its sister fund, the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY), now seeks to give one and one-half times (1.5x) the performance of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index for a single day. If the fund meets its new objective, on a day the index rises 1%, the fund should rise approximately 1.5%.The change was made without notifying shareholders because, as ProShares says on its website, it believed it was in the best interests of the funds and their shareholders to promptly implement this change.

Shares popped intraday Friday, rising to 44.58, but closing up just 1 cent at 43.21.The Linux software giant also reports Dec. 19. Red Hat is expected to report earnings per share of 70 cents, up 15%. Revenue should climb 19% to $734 million.Like Adobe, Red Hat retreated from a record high on Nov. 28 to tumble to just below its 50-day line on Dec. 4.

And the $210 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures fund, or UVXY, gathered $13.3 million, the data show. Both funds promise to provide twice the performance of the Cboe SPX Volatility Index.The funds had been hemorrhaging money since the equity selloff sent the VIX to its highest level in two years on Feb. 5. The price of UVXY, for example, soared as much as 71% that day, but then plunged by a record 33% in the following session.In the meantime, buyers also have been pouring money into a strategy that bets against volatility. The ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures fund, ticker SVXY, saw a single day inflow of almost $300 million following the market rout. With the VIX showing a hint of normalcy, sliding back to around 20 after soaring by the most on record last week, some investors are comfortable betting on market calm again.

66,CBOE,"Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top: Patiently waiting for the VIX to explode has finally been rewarded in a big way.Among the biggest winners from last week's turmoil is the mysterious buyer of out-of-the-money options tied to the Cboe Volatility Index priced at about 50 cents apiece.Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, estimates that the trader dubbed ""50 Cent"" (a play on the rapper known as ""50 Cent,"" Curtis Jackson), has made nearly $200 million total on this trade since the start of 2017 — thanks to a swing of $400 million in a single month.""At one point, '50 Cent' became '30 Cent,' scrimping on his usual VIX option purchases, unwilling to pay up for the 50 cent VIX options that were his namesake,"" Chintawongvanich wrote. ""But in early February, when it seemed like Fiddy's fortunes could go no lower, it came: redemption.""But these gains linked to VIX options may be somewhat of a Pyrrhic victory for their owner: The strategist says that these calls were one way a large, income-earning portfolio of risk assets elected to hedge against a downturn.""We think the reason '50 Cent' was so adamant about paying a fixed price (50 cents) on a fixed number of contracts (50,000) is because they had a fixed hedging budget for the year,"" he writes.Meanwhile, the so-called VIX Elephant has gone the way of its relative, the woolly mammoth: It's now extinct. This trader, who put on massive VIX call spread trades while selling puts to benefit from a rise in volatility, has closed out all positions to earn a net $40 million on the trade, according to Chintawongvanich.

88,CBOE,"Oil posted the biggest loss in two months Wednesday as record crude production from U.S. fields reignited worries that supplies will swamp demand.Futures slid 2.5% in New York. Crude output from American wells jumped to 10.25 million barrels a day last week, vaulting the U.S. into the elite of world producers alongside Saudi Arabia and Russia. With production set to climb even higher later this year, the Saudi- and Russia-led alliance of other major suppliers will come under renewed pressure to reconsider self-imposed output caps aimed at eroding a glut.""Production was up fairly strong,"" Nick Holmes, an analyst at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC in Leawood, Kansas, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets, said by telephone. ""There's still some trepidation on the supply side and will U.S. shale growth overwhelm the strong demand that we expect this year?""The U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly tally of domestic output shows the country is probably already on par with Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer and de facto leader, and closing fast on Russia. Saudi output probably averaged 10 million barrel equivalents a day last month and Russia pumped an estimated 10.98 million a day in 2017. To be sure, the numbers aren't directly comparable because they involve differing time periods.U.S. production has jumped 78% in the past six years as drilling techniques perfected to release natural gas from shale were adopted by oil explorers. With oil still trading above $60 a barrel, shale drillers may be inclined to boost production because they can buy hedges that lock in profits and shield them from any subsequent price declines.The bombshell production report on Wednesday came a day after the government made a surprise revision to its supply outlook that forecast domestic daily output will hit 11 million barrels in November, a year sooner than previously expected.West Texas Intermediate for March delivery dipped $1.60 to settle at $61.79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level in four weeks. Total volume traded was about 68% above the 100-day average.Brent for April settlement declined $1.35 to end the session at $65.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the lowest level since late December. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $3.96 to WTI for the same month and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since July.Oil market volatility, as measured by the CBOE/Nymex Oil Volatility Index, jumped to the highest level since November after touching September highs during the day.Further weighing on crude prices was a strengthening U.S. currency, which reduced the appeal of dollar-denominated raw materials as investments. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, rose as much as 0.6%.""The real story is investors remain cautious with continued U.S. supply growth,"" Matthew Beck, managing director of an $8 billion oil and natural gas portfolio at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston, said by telephone. At the same time, ""you've seen a general strengthening in the U.S. dollar. That's a bit of a drag on oil prices as well.""The EIA also said on Wednesday that American crude in storage tanks and terminals increased by 1.9 million barrels last week as refiners shut or limited operations to conduct seasonal maintenance. Gasoline and diesel stockpiles expanded as well.

89,CBOE,"For a fledgling asset class whose idiosyncrasies are understood by few, there sure is a lot of money swirling around in volatility trades.Investment strategies and products married to market swings were thrust front and center by the worst market meltdown in seven years, in which the Cboe Volatility Index surged to its highest level since 2015. VIX-related securities were halted, volatility-targeting quants blamed, and options trading in benchmarks for turbulence ballooned.Too big to ignore, it's an asset class in its own right, with the might to push around the broader market. Getting a grip on it has confounded strategists and managers alike. Even its designers are amazed by its heft.""It doesn't surprise me that it's become so big. What surprises me is that it's in some ways sapped liquidity from other parts of the market,"" said Michael Schmanske, the founder of Glenshaw Capital Management who previously worked at Barclays Capital and helped oversee the launch of some of the first VIX ETPs. ""These guys have taken volatility to the next level and believe it needs to be part of a managed portfolio.""There are two categories of securities linked to price turbulence, roughly speaking: ones tied to the VIX directly, and others that take their cue from the volatility of individual stocks. Altogether, estimates for the space are anywhere from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. Beyond that is the options market, which itself is an implicit bet on swings in shares.Funds that fall under this category use realized volatility as data inputs and were called out as potential culprits for exacerbating Monday's trading.Volatility is key to the investment decision of these programmatic funds often employed by pensions and insurers — a specific level is set, and leverage will be adjusted to maintain that objective depending on how much each asset class swings. Theoretically, if stocks begin to trade wildly, they may scale back their footprint. Or, in the case of Monday, they may have been selling into the downturn.Estimates from both Barclays PLC and Societe Generale SA pin the space between $400 billion and $500 billion.Risk parity often gets lumped in with vol-targeting funds because asset riskiness is a central input. However, they operate quite differently. Risk parity attempts to hold an equal amount of risk across asset classes and uses longer-term volatility inputs — it won't trade based on a few days of volatility spikes.Risk parity has been called out before as the equivalent to portfolio insurance in 1987, a hedging technique that systematically sold stock index futures as the equity market declined, creating a vicious feedback loop that caused the market to crash. Based on back-of-the-envelope math, risk-parity funds have about 1/100th of the capacity to move markets as portfolio insurance did in 1987, according to AQR Capital Management estimates.The Greenwich, Connecticut-based quantitative money manager estimates the size of risk-parity funds to be between $120 billion and $250 billion, with AQR and Bridgewater Associates LP's All Weather Fund being the largest players. Others estimate the space is larger — SocGen sees it at twice the size.The market's boogeymen, commodity-trading advisors, are related to volatility because these trend-following managers often use market swings as inputs to select the sizes of their positions. Leverage among the funds may be smaller than before the financial crisis, but they've been able to accrue more assets as momentum across markets marched forward to boost returns.AUM for them is about $250 billion, according to SocGen data through 2017. Before Monday's sell-off, they also held a near-record footprint in both equities and commodities.Products directly linked to the VIX may manage as much as $8 billion, according to SocGen estimates. Exchange-traded products, like the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX ETN, known by its ticker XIV, have been directly blamed for causing the VIX to spike Monday as they were forced to de-risk with surging volatility. Credit Suisse, with a market cap of about $46 billion, is the note's backer and has said it will buy back the ETN.Assets in the exchange-traded products have significantly shrunk in size since Monday's maelstrom: short-volatility ETPs manage $700 million, down from a record $3.7 billion in January. Including long-volatility funds, assets total more than $3 billion.As for strategies tied to the VIX — which play on the gauge with a combination of futures and options — there's between $2 billion and $4 billion behind the trades, according to SocGen.This one is the behemoth, and can take many different forms. For example, variance swaps are derivative contracts that make a bet on the magnitude of movement on the underlying asset. But effectively, any option is a bet on the volatility of the underlying asset.Over-the-counter options trading in U.S. equities reached about $2.7 trillion in notional amounts outstanding in the first half of last year, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements. For listed S&P 500 Index contracts, the 20-day average notional value traded has been about $4.2 trillion. But traders typically talk about vega, a measure of an option's sensitivity to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset. That sits at roughly $8 billion vega.

96,CBOE,"Trading patterns associated with the new kingpin in volatility options resurfaced on Wednesday, hours before concerns about trade protectionism roiled markets.The so-called ""VIX Elephant"" — the moniker bestowed upon the options giant by Macro Risk Advisors head of derivatives strategy Pravit Chintawongvanich — traded more than 2 million contracts, closing out positions in January VIX options and rolling the trade over to same-strike options that mature the following month.This entailed buying back 262,500 January VIX puts with a strike price of 12, selling 262,500 15 calls, and buying back 525,000 25 calls in order to close out the existing position. Then, the new position was established by selling 262,500 12 February puts, buying 262,500 15 calls, and selling 525,000 25 calls.This particular trade, which stands to gain should implied equity volatility rise moderately, confirms a definitive shift in the Elephant's buying and selling patterns.""While the 'Elephant' originally traded three-month options, rolling after two months, they appear to have switched to a one-month cycle,"" the strategist writes.Daily volume in options tied to the Cboe Volatility Index hit their second-highest level on record Wednesday, exceeded only by the last time the Elephant — joined by another mystery volatility buyer known as ""50 Cent"" — went on the stampede at the start of December.The timing of that roll proved fortuitous: A spike in implied volatility allowed the Elephant's previous positions to be closed at a loss of $2 million rather than $20 million to $30 million. However, Chintawongvanich estimates that this trader is down roughly $35 million since then as market calm prevailed.""More generally, the 'Elephant' trades reflect a trend towards low premium outlay hedges with minimal convexity,"" the strategist concludes. ""Clients we talk to have been more interested in VIX call flies or S&P put flies that carry well and have a fairly low initial cost, but may not mark up as much as an outright option in a risk-off scenario.""In other words, this Elephant might soon be seeing a new animal on safari: copycats.

104,CBOE,"Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that regulators ""may be back with our friends from Treasury and the Fed to ask for additional legislation"" governing cryptocurrencies.Both Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo told senators that there's a gap in the regulatory structure because neither regulator has oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges.Their testimony could be more bad news for cryptocurrency markets as China, India and South Korea are aggressively moving to defuse what those governments seem to perceive as a threat. But the hearing also provided reason for hope that the U.S. will continue its go-slow approach to regulation and remain a hospitable place for alternative currencies to blossom. Bitcoin hit its peak just days after Bitcoin futures began trading on the CBOE, which was greeted as a validation of the currency from U.S. regulators and arguably fueled speculation.The price of Bitcoin fell as low as $5,947.40 intraday, down more than two-thirds from its mid-December peak. Bitcoin recovered to climb 11% to $7,675.10 as the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average erased big opening losses and moved solidly higher.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), two companies benefiting from the rise of mining for Bitcoin and rival cryptocurrency Ethereum, which suffered deeper losses than the broad market over the past week, saw mixed action. Nvidia jumped 5.6% and AMD advanced 0.6% on the stock market today. Nvidia reports earnings after the close on Thursday.As for other Bitcoin- and blockchain related stocks, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rocketed 22.5%, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) leapt 21% and Long Blockhain (LBCC) climbed about 1%.Overstock.com (OSTK) shot up 11% after it launched a discount stock trading platform with Siebert Financial (SIEB).IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Both the SEC and CFTC are part of a cryptocurrency working group recently announced by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that has only had a single meeting. The SEC has taken action on several occasions to halt fraudulent Initial Coin Offerings, while the CFTC, which approved Bitcoin futures trading, said that doing so has allowed it to monitor the cryptocurrency exchanges for fraud and price manipulation.Giancarlo said the agency had announced several enforcement actions, with more to come. ""We are working the beat hard,"" he said.Meanwhile a few senators noted their concern about states such as North Korea using Bitcoin to evade sanctions.How concerned Bitcoin investors should be by more proactive enforcement and a potential closing of gaps in the regulatory structure depends on whether cryptocurrencies can thrive in a regulated market that lacks anonymity and polices illicit activity. SEC boss Clayton made clear that he views cryptocurrencies with a high degree of skepticism, saying that promises of cheap, fast and secure transactions have been ""elusive.""But Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who earned his fortune as an early investor in the cell phone industry, said he sees a parallel between mobile phones back then and cryptocurrencies now. ""The same kind of transformation is about to take place."" Warner talked about the possibility that cryptcurrencies will reach $20 trillion in value, saying ""this rises potentially to the level of a systemically relevant event.""The hearing came as Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements General Manager Agustin Carstens called Bitcoin a ""combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.""BIS, known as the central banker for global central banks, has warned that cryptocurrencies could become a ""threat to financial stability"" if regulators aren't vigilant.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Everyone Calls Bitcoin Investment Trust An ETF, But It's NotGovernment Spending Spree Risks Overheating Economy, Icing StocksHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

105,CBOE,"The sound of euphoria just got a bit louder.The new year isn't even two weeks old, and already $2.1 trillion has been added to the market capitalization of global equities. The market is verging on such overbought levels that not even reliably bullish analysts can keep up with the new highs.Optimism is upending the once-dour mood of a rally noted for the hate it inspired. The bull market, now in its ninth year, has finally reached the point of euphoria, said Morgan Stanley's U.S. equity strategists.""Now, we have seen a total reversal with people having a hard time even imagining how the market could decline,"" they wrote in a report dated Monday. ""We must admit the speed and relentlessness of the move is a bit troubling.""A melt-up, crude and tax rally, equity euphoria — call it what you will, but finding cynicism is not an easy task.It's not just Wall Street embracing the animal spirits powering equities to their highest levels on record. About 60% of individual investors think the stock market will go higher in the next six months, the highest percentage since 2010, according to a survey by the American Association of Individual Investors. For every bearish investor, there are nearly four bulls.Maybe too many dire predictions have failed to come true, but U.S. managers are now finding it difficult to bet that the rally loses steam. With short positions on the decline, net leverage among institutional investors has been steadily rising over the past few months to the highest level since 2015, according data on Morgan Stanley's prime brokerage.Likewise, short interest on the largest exchange traded fund tracking the S&P 500 is the lowest level on record, while shorts on the largest emerging-market fund are the lowest in over a year, IHS Markit data show.The sell side is also on board. Bank of America's oft-cited contrarian measure, its sell side indicator that uses the average of Wall Street strategists' equity-allocation recommendations, rose for the third straight month to the highest level in six years.Though it hasn't hit a sell signal yet, at this pace the indicator will reach a tipping point by the end of January, the bank's equity strategy team said.Considering the Cboe Volatility Index of stock-options prices is hovering near a record low, it comes as no surprise that positioning in the options market contains hints of exuberance throughout.The ratio of bearish to bullish options is at its lowest level since 2014, judging by one-month averages tracked by Cboe. Over the past 20 days, there have been on average 1.8 call options for every put.Finally, the ultimate euphoric signal for chart watchers: the relative strength index, which tracks the magnitude and speed of price fluctuations.The 14-day relative strength index for the S&P 500 Index, MSCI Asia Pacific Index, MSCI World Index, Nikkei 225 Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Index are all in overbought territory. Together, the average of the gauges is on pace for a weekly record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

106,CBOE,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has mellowed out on Bitcoin after vehemently warning against it last year, while Eastman Kodak (KODK) became the latest company to pivot to blockchain.X Dimon, a vocal critic of Bitcoin, told Fox Business that ""I regret making"" a comment last year in which he called Bitcoin a fraud. He did not elaborate.But he reiterated his view that blockchain, the record-keeping technology behind Bitcoin, is ""real."" He said that initial coin offerings — a form of cryptocurrency fundraising used by many blockchain startups — had to be looked at ""individually.""Dimon in recent months has compared Bitcoin to the Dutch tulip craze in the 1600s, said he would fire any JPMorgan trader caught dealing in the cryptocurrency, and predicted it was bound to implode. He also has said an unregulated currency's prospects for survival are essentially zero, as governments would be unlikely to tolerate one.""Bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about Bitcoin as it gets really big,"" he told Fox Business, ""and I just have a different opinion than other people.""In October, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the bank was ""very open-minded"" to digital currencies that were properly regulated.Bitcoin slipped 1.3% to $14,774.42, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin futures were off 1% at $14,790 on Cboe (CBOE) and dropped 1% to $14,755 on CME (CME).Kodak soared 121% to 6.85 in the stock market today. Long Blockchain (LBCC) — formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Corp., a company that sold iced tea — jumped nearly 20% after saying that it would not go forward with a planned stock offering. Long Blockchain said it was still moving ahead with its plan to buy equipment to be used in the mining of cryptocurrency. Long Blockchain still maintains a business that sells drinks.Riot Blockchain (RIOT), once exclusively a biotech firm, on Tuesday said it ""has established"" Digital Green Energy Corp. as a wholly-owned subsidiary to identify ""environmentally friendly projects with large energy capacity and a cost-efficient rate for cryptocurrency mining and data center operations."" Shares climbed 2.6%.JPMorgan, which reports Q4 results Friday, rose 0.7%, and Goldman Sachs (GS), which is reportedly is setting up a digital currency trading desk, added 0.85%.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and potential gains.Meanwhile, worries continued to mount over the volatile cryptocurrency, whose value has heaved higher in recent months and raised concerns of an epic collapse.Two companies — Rafferty Asset Management and Exchange Traded Concepts — have canceled plans to launch three Bitcoin exchange traded funds, according to Reuters, after the SEC ""expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation"" of futures contracts tied to the currency.The frenzy surrounding Bitcoin has also drawn more attention to blockchain, with an increasing number of what one analyst called ""blockchain pretenders"" looking to ride the trend's coattails by adding ""blockchain"" to their name or abruptly shifting operations to focus on the technology.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin In 2018: Can Futures, Mainstream Investors Tame The Hysteria?Bitcoin Jumps, Ethereum Hits A High, Visa Suspends Crypto Debit CardsSeagate Stock Soars On Report Of Investment In Ripple CryptocurrencyBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

107,CBOE,"Bitcoin traded sharply higher Friday, while rival cryptocurrency Ethereum pegged a new high and Ripple retreated from Thursday's record levels. Meanwhile multiple cryptocurrency debit card providers suspended service under orders from Visa (V) Europe.X Companies including Bitwala, Cryptopay, Wirex and TenX reportedly told customers that their prepaid cards would no longer function, though funds stored on cards are safe while they seek to resolve the issue with card issuer WaveCrest. The cards allow users to spend cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.In a statement to The Next Web, Visa is said to have clarified that its move was not a crackdown on cryptocurrencies, but action against one company that broke its rules.Meanwhile, amid a state crackdown in China, Bitcoin miners are setting up shop outside the country.Bitmain, an operator of two of China's largest Bitcoin-mining collectives, will establish regional headquarters in Singapore and now has mining operations in the U.S. and Canada, the company told Bloomberg.On the spot market, the price of Bitcoin was up 10% at  $16,731.48, according to CoinDesk.

110,CBOE,"The new year brings new predictions. Almost everyone turns into a prognosticator, guessing how markets will perform and what geopolitical events will unfold.X Unlike bloviating TV pundits, advisors tend to refrain from bold predictions. But their prudence is put to the test when clients press them for answers.Problems can arise when clients expect their advisor to forecast how markets will move in the months or year ahead. While advisors usually prefer to hedge — and redirect clients' attention to financial matters that they can control — some individuals may still assume their advisor should be able to see the future with some level of precision.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market Review""A small group of clients will ask for your predictions every time they see you,"" said Mark Fried, an advisor in Newtown, Pa. ""And in December and January (during our annual review), a lot more of them will ask. That's especially true now when the market has gone up for so long. They want to know when it's going to end.""Author of ""Road Rules for Retirement,"" Fried has a standard reply. It involves a prop that he keeps nearby.Vacationing in Mexico about 25 years ago, he bought a crystal ball. Whenever clients ask him to predict the future, he gestures to the orb and replies, ""I'm not sure. Let me check.""Clients usually laugh, and Fried makes his point: It's foolish to pretend we know what will happen and plan based on such unknowns.Advisors who avoid making predictions still give considerable thought to the future. But rather than speculate about market swings or other variables, they work with clients to plan for a range of scenarios.Fried likes to explore how economic and political conditions might change over the next six months or year. Then he'll explain how such changes could affect a client's portfolio.To reinforce his point about the limited value of even the most confident predictions, Fried invites clients to note every forecast that they hear or read in the media. When they review the list a year later, the results are predictably awful.Seasoned advisors understand that clients' eagerness to know the future often masks a larger concern. Their deeper anxiety may revolve around whether they're positioned to weather storms — from market meltdowns to global trade disputes.Having a detailed financial plan in place can reassure clients that they can rest easy regardless of any foreseeable market shocks.When Jason Staley's clients ask for his predictions, the Pittsburgh, Pa.-based advisor responds by reviewing their investment policy statement and asset allocation. They see how he has designed their portfolio to withstand a range of outcomes.""I've learned to navigate the conversation back to things that are time-tested and true,"" Staley said. ""When clients try to pin me down, I might say it's a coin flip"" and shift attention to their customized financial plan.Clients with more aggressive risk appetites may look to their advisor to predict moves in Bitcoin or the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Few planners oblige.When Pat Kelly's clients ask about Bitcoin, the Detroit-based advisor emphasizes the highly speculative nature of that investment. If they continue to show interest, he refers them to Coinbase, a digital currency exchange.Like many advisors, Kelly has learned over the years to scale down his predictions. He says that early in his career, he'd offer a narrow range based on what he set as a target average return for the coming year.""I'd give a tighter, more specific range,"" he said. ""Now I'll give a wider range. I'll draw a big bell curve for the client and say, 'You need to get comfortable with this range. If I get more specific, I'll probably be wrong.'""If clients want more concrete predictions, Kelly plays market historian. Rather than look forward and guess, he'll look back and draw lessons.""I might say, 'Let's stress-test different market environments based on a period of rising interest rates,'"" he said. Analyzing historical data can provide at least one indicator of what the future holds.He also likes to remind clients of their overall investment objectives. Otherwise, they might get too immersed in day-to-day market swings.""If you get caught up in the weeds, you can make more emotional decisions,"" Kelly warned. ""I'll tell clients who ask for my predictions that the reality is, regardless of my answer, my goal is to help them achieve their retirement goals over the next 10 years or more.""RELATED:How Will Retirement Robos Evolve?What's The Stock Market Doing now?

The more-relevant percentage loss of 4.6% was not historic, but still the worst since August 2011. The S&P 500 index tumbled 4.1%, also its worst drop in six years, while the Nasdaq composite fell 3.8%. All three indexes drove below their 50-day moving averages.Investors should be extremely cautious about making any buys in the current market environment.

118,CBOE,"At least one of Wall Street's biggest firms is growing more comfortable with cryptocurrencies.X Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies such as Bitcoin, according to people with knowledge of the strategy. The bank aims to get the business running by the end of June, if not earlier, two of the people said. Another said it's still trying to work out security issues as well as how it would hold, or custody, the assets.The move positions Goldman Sachs to become the first large Wall Street firm to make markets in cryptocurrencies, whose wild price swings and surging values have captured the public's imagination but given pause to established institutions. Already, the bank is among just a few mainstream firms clearing a new breed of Bitcoin futures offered by Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME Group (CME). Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC), for example, have been taking a wait-and-see approach.Goldman Sachs is now assembling a team in New York, one of the people said. While the bank hasn't made a decision where to house the desk, one possibility is that it will operate within the fixed-income, currencies and commodities unit's systematic trading function, which conducts transactions electronically, two people said. Darren Cohen, in the firm's principal strategic investments group, is also looking at opportunities, another person said.""In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them,"" Michael DuVally, a spokesman, said in a statement.Publicly, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has been circumspect. He tweeted in October that his firm was looking at how to deal with Bitcoin. In a Bloomberg Television interview last month, he said his bank didn't need a Bitcoin strategy yet because the digital currency is still just developing and volatile.And when the bank began clearing futures earlier this month, it demanded that some clients set aside funds equal to the full value of their trade, people familiar with the policy said at the time. The conservatism deterred some customers and led them to take their business elsewhere.

121,CBOE,"Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is no stranger to the annual IBD Best Online Brokers survey. It popped into the five best brokers overall two years ago and returned this year, helped by its reputation for low-cost trading and technological prowess.X The company caters to self-directed individual investors, registered investment advisors and other institutional clients. It welcomes investors of all experience levels, but doesn't aggressively market to the beginners. It's found a highly profitable niche focusing on active traders who don't need a lot of hand-holding.Interactive Brokers scored high in this year's survey (see broker survey methodology) when it comes to Low Commissions & Fees, Trade Reliability and Mobile Trading Platforms. It also ranked among the best brokers in Low-Cost/Free ETF Trading, Options Trading Platform, Site Performance and Equity Trading Tools.Interactive Brokers' trading fees are so low that it was basically able to watch from the sidelines in the first quarter of 2017 when a price war broke out among major brokers like Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Fidelity. After the dust settled, Fidelity and Schwab were at $4.95 a trade, with Ameritrade a bit higher at $6.95.Interactive Brokers is still well below the competition with a base rate of U.S. fixed 0.5 cent per share per trade. High volume trades have a lower per-share fee. Several exchange traded funds (ETFs) are also available commission-free.  For ETF investors, IBKR's Mutual Fund/ETF Replicator finds ETFs whose performance replicates a specific fund's objective with generally lower fees.Improvements aren't always just about cost. With 483,000 client accounts in 201 countries, IB also recently expanded its mutual fund offerings to include offshore funds for overseas customers.The company's technology expertise is one of the main reasons it can keep costs low.""The vast majority of our executive team has some sort of programming background,"" said Steve Sanders, executive vice president of marketing and product development, who's been with the company for 17 years. ""We're basically a technology company that happens to be in the trading business.""Founder, Chairman and CEO Thomas Peterffy got his start in the financial markets in the late 1970s when he bought a seat on the American Stock Exchange and became an individual market maker in equity options. T.P. & Co. soon formed and eventually morphed into Timber Hill. In 1983, Timber Hill immediately gained an edge on the competition by becoming the first company to use handheld computers for trading.Peterffy did not have years of education in computers. He basically taught himself when he emigrated to the U.S. from Hungary in 1965. His first job was architectural draftsman for an engineering firm. The story goes that a new computer was purchased at the firm, but no one knew how to program it. Peterffy, with no programming experience at the time, volunteered to do it. The rest, as they say, is history as the experience helped spark his interest in programming and technology in general.In 1993, Interactive Brokers was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer, making Timber Hill's intercontinental electronic network and trade execution services available to customers. Last year, Interactive Brokers sold its Timber Hill options market-making business to Two Sigma Securities. Terms weren't disclosed.Interactive Brokers went public in May 2007. According to Sanders, the company was founded on three competitive advantages that Interactive Brokers still embraces after more than 10 years as a publicly traded company: Low costs, a wide range of products with access to markets around the world and a relentless focus on technology.Interactive Brokers' technology prowess is a big reason why it was the first online broker to offer trading in Bitcoin futures. The company said it took many man hours to make it happen, but the technology infrastructure was already in place.According to a company news release, Bitcoin futures contracts started trading on the CBOE (CBOE) the evening of Dec. 10. By 9:15 a.m. the next day, 201 Interactive Brokers accounts had placed 1,240 trades totaling 1,429 contracts, representing about 50% of exchange-recorded volume.""We launched Bitcoin futures in response to client requests,"" Sanders said. ""It was in keeping with our philosophy to make products available at the best possible price.""Trading in Bitcoin futures isn't a huge revenue generator for Interactive Brokers at this point, but it's hard not to see trading in the cryptocurrency market contributing to daily average revenue trades (DARTs) for the company. DARTs are a key metric for online brokers, representing the total number of trades each day that generate revenue.In December, DARTs totaled 699,000, up 18% from December 2016. Total customer accounts jumped 25% year over year and new accounts surged 78% to 8,900. ""Our DARTs are much higher than the competition,"" Sanders said.Total option contracts came in at 24 million, up 10%. Future contracts grew 11% to 9.8 million.At the end of 2017, client equity (the value of clients' accounts) jumped 46% from the year before to $124.8 billion, while customer margin loan balance surged 52% to $29.5 billion.The company's recently launched IB Debit Mastercard, the first product of its kind. The card lets clients borrow against their accounts at an extremely low interest rate. It is available as part of a new integrated financial management account that lets users invest, borrow, spend and earn from one account. Annual percentage rates range from 1.41% to 2.66%.Account holders can take advantage of Interactive Brokers' stock yield enhancement program, where clients lend out their shares for short sales and split profits 50/50 with IB. ""In cases of hard-to-borrow stock, it can be lucrative,"" Sanders said.Longtime IB customer Klaus Kraemer, likes the broker's Trader's University, which offers webinars, educational videos and trader apps as well as live global trading commentary. Also, he said. ""I was always impressed by the fact that the company took the best bid/ask prices from the various exchanges, information only available to brokers at the time, and eventually gave it to individual investors.""For less experienced investors who want more direction, Interactive Brokers'  Investors' Marketplace is an area where users can search for an advisor, hedge fund or other provider of investment services.Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

127,CBOE,"U.S. stocks got off to a riveting start to the new year, particularly in the tech sectors, as Apple (AAPL) behaved the way one would expect for a leading stock that is testing support at a key technical juncture.X Apple, the global consumer electronics and digital services play, rose more than 1.7% to 172.36 and bounced off its rising 50-day moving average.The 50-day line, which graphs a stock's average closing price over the trailing 50 trading sessions, has been rising ever since the stock edged slowly after a key breakout from an early-stage base at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017. Gains from that breakout from a solid cup with handle reached nearly 50%.More recently, Apple on Oct. 27 cleared a new second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 and volume was brisk, 64% above the stock's 50-day average turnover.Apple and fellow Nasdaq tech giant Alphabet (GOOGL) (up 1.9% to 1,073.21, now extended past a recent flat base entry at 1,006.29) helped lead the Nasdaq composite up 1.5% by day's end. The Nasdaq soared 28.2% in 2017, its best annual gain in four years.The Nasdaq 100 rallied nearly 1.8%; the index-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), also up almost 1.8%, is now 28 cents below the all-time high of 158.77.The S&P 500 rallied more than 0.6% as investors also scooped up shares in infrastructure and building materials firms (please see the prior Stock Market Today column for more details), top Chinese company ADRs that are highly profitable and growing strong revenues, steel, automaker and generic drug groups.The Steel-Producers group is shaping up as Tuesday's top performer among the 197 groups tracked each day by IBD (see the entire list by going to Data Tables within the Stock Lists section of Investors.com).Strength in Apple, Chevron (CVX) (extended after a December breakout past a base on base at 120.99) and Walt Disney (DIS) (forming a new base) helped the Dow Jones industrial average edge 0.2% higher, overcoming a sell-off in insurance titan Travelers (TRV).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) got off to a great start in 2018, rising at one point 15% to an intraday high of 2,320 in dull trading. At the end of 2017, even after a deep four-session plunge that took the Bitcoin-tracking ETF from as high as 3,522 to as low as 1,155, Bitcoin Investment still finished the year with a 1,556% return.It's likely that interest in Bitcoin is set to only rise, given the growing acceptance of e-commerce, digital transactions, concerns over the unusual gains in U.S. and other equities in 2017, and the relative ""newness"" of the alternative currency. The fact that both the CME Group and Cboe now conduct futures trading in Bitcoin is one of this currency's greatest accomplishments over the past few months.Watch to see how Bitcoin Investment acts around both the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. The latter has been catching up some, now well above 1,400. But the 50-day moving average, which usually acts as an excellent defense-oriented sell signal when a growth stock torpedoes through it in huge volume, has not been an effective timing indicator for this ultrahot ETF.Going back to Apple, amid all the speculation that the iPhone marketer is going to go on a huge shopping spree, investors should continue to simply monitor the price-and-volume action on a daily or weekly basis. And so far, the action remains healthy. One big reason is the possibility for further double-digit top and bottom line growth.Two, earnings growth may accelerate.The Street sees earnings rising 24% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $11.46 a share, up from an 11% jump in FY 2017 (ended in September that year). Services revenue is one big part of that picture. New products or new editions of the iPhone, MacBook and Apple Watch form another big part.Apple's ratings on Stock Checkup remain good, including a 90 Composite Rating and a decent B- grade for Accumulation/Distribution, which hints that fund managers are net buyers over the past 13 weeks of trading. The Accumulation grade goes from The C rating is neutral.In the medical sector, heart pump innovator Abiomed (ABMD) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) continue to show leadership.The former rose more than 3% to 192.49, retaking its 50-day moving average in quiet yet rising turnover. Watch for a potential new flat base to form, possibly presenting a 200.38 entry.Abbott, a diversified pharmaceuticals, medical products and diagnostic systems giant, rallied more than 3% to 58.79 and new highs in steep turnover. Shares are still in buy range after clearing a narrow and shallow flat base with a 56.79 buy point.The 5% buy zone for Abbott, which has scored three quarters in a row of double-digit top and bottom line growth (EPS up 17%, 13% and 12% while revenue is up 30%, 24% and 29%), goes up to 59.63.Abiomed is a member of IBD's Sector Leaders growth stock screen.Investors dumped utility stocks as interest rates rose.The Dow utility average fell nearly 1.1% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note jumped sharply to 2.47%. The yield is near last month's peak of 2.49%. On Dec. 13, the Federal Reserve hiked the fed funds rate on overnight bank loans for the fifth time since December 2015. The new target rate is now 1.25%-1.5%.RELATED:This Tech Breaks Out Today: Stocks Near A Buy ZoneHow To Invest In 2018: What To Do For Better ResultsHot Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50Can You Spot The Next Major Stock Market Top?

129,CBOE,"Bitcoin continued to trade wildly on Thursday, a day after swelling past $11,000 and then face-planted at below $10,000, as Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein said the cryptocurrency doesn't meet traditional standards for money while a top Federal Reserve policymaker said Bitcoin is a ""niche product.""X The digital currency, ever sensitive to price swings and the emotions of big and small investors alike, was down 2.8% to $9,540.14 in afternoon trading after sinking to $9,021 intraday. Etherium, another cryptocurrency, was down 2.4% to $427.51, but off their worst levels too.Last week, Bitcoin hovered in the $8,000 range. The latest big price swings come as more smaller, less sophisticated investors, curious about the hype, hop aboard and then bail on what has become a wild ride this year for the cryptocurrency.Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Thursday that it's too soon for his bank to develop a Bitcoin strategy, and questioned calling the digital instrument a ""currency.""""Something that moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency, doesn't feel like a store of value,"" Blankefein told Bloomberg Television.Goldman's commodity chief said Wednesday that Bitcoin should be treated as a commodity.Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said Thursday dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could be a major rival to established currencies or that the Fed itself would issue its own cryptocurrency.""Digital currencies are a niche product that sometimes garners large headlines,"" Quarles said. He warned that digital currencies could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if they became widely used.A Bank of England official on Wednesday downplayed the risks of the cryptocurrency, but urged caution nonetheless.""This is not at a size where it's a macroeconomic risk to the global economy,"" Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor with the central bank, told BBC Radio 5 Live, according to the Guardian, ""but when prices are moving like that, my view would be investors need to do their homework.""But Joseph Stiglitz, the World Bank's former chief economist and a Nobel Prize winner, told Bloomberg on Wednesday that ""Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight. So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed.""David Mondrus, CEO of the blockchain company Trive, took issue with that comment.""Yes, circumvention of third parties, including government is one of the major uses/cases of Bitcoin,"" he said in an emailed statement on Wednesday, ""but it is precisely because of the failure and overreach of such parties that it was invented.""He added: ""Maybe it's time we stopped relying on third parties, governments and regulators to keep us safe and relied on ourselves.""Also Wednesday, U.S. authorities appeared to tighten the screws on the cryptocurrency. A federal court in California has told the trading platform Coinbase to submit to the IRS information about anyone who has moved $20,000 or more through their accounts annually between 2013 and 2015, according to the Verge.Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the biggest declines that day occurred as some trading platforms experienced hiccups in service amid some immense traffic volumes.Despite the growing skepticism, Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Cantor Fitzgerald plan to launch Bitcoin futures, following similar decisions by CME Group (CME) and CBOE (CBOE).Crypto-related stock and investments were also volatile in the stock market today, including Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), Overstock (OSTK), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Patent Group (MARA).Bitcoin investment vehicle Bitcoin Investment Trust rose 1.4%, rebounding from much-steeper losses. Overstock, which takes Bitcoin and has focused more on the record-keeping technology behind the cryptocurrency known as blockchain, lost 9.4%. Marathon Patent, an IP licensing firm set to acquire the cryptocurrency miner Global Bit Ventures, bounced back 3%. Riot Blockchain, which manages record-keeping technology behind bitcoin, gained 3%.Square (SQ), which is testing out letting some Square Cash users buy and sell Bitcoin, rose 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose graphics cards are used in the processing of cryptocurrency transactions, rose 2.2% and 0.55%, respectively.  Square, Nvidia and AMD were caught up in Wednesday's tech sell-off.RELATED:Bitcoin Clears $10,000; Crypto Stocks Are VolatileJPMorgan CEO Called Bitcoin A 'Fraud'; Now His Bank May Trade Futures

130,CBOE,"D.C. news moved markets during the week. The Dow and S&P 500 index hit record highs as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and other financials rallied on tax-cut hopes and rising bond yields. Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains. The Dow rose 2.9%, its best weekly gain of 2017. The S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and other financials also rallied on rising bond yields while many retailers rebounded on holiday sales hopes. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% as tech leaders struggled, including China internets, many chipmakers and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB.)Bitcoin's roller coaster ride continued this week, clearing $10,000, then $11,000, then face-planting closer to $9,000 before moving back to around $10,700. The jolts came as smaller investors get more active in trading the much-hyped cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, big financial names continued to weigh in on the prospects of digital currencies: Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles called digital currencies a ""niche product"" that could pose ""serious financial stability issues"" if adopted more widely. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that something that ""moves up and down 20% in a day doesn't feel like a currency."" But derivatives regulator CFTC OK'd Bitcoin futures at the CME (CME) and CBOE (CBOE), with CME saying it'll launch futures on Dec. 18. Cantor Fitzgerald and reportedly Nasdaq (NDAQ) also are moving toward offering futures in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose 55% for the week.Cyber Monday was the biggest yet: Adobe Analytics said shoppers spent $6.59 billion online, up 16.8% from the prior year, with nearly a third of that spent via mobile devices. Amazon (AMZN) also announced that this was its single biggest shopping day in history, overtaking the most recent Prime Day; the Echo Dot proved most popular. Adobe believes this will be the first holiday season to surpass the $100 billion mark in online sales. But shares of many brick-and-mortar retailers rallied on expectations of a strong or at least better-than-feared year-end performance. Macy's (M) said it will hire extra holiday workers due to strong demand.General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019. The top carmaker in the U.S. sees self-driving vehicles as a cornerstone of future mobility — and a potential profit driver. It faces a slew of new entrants in a rapidly transforming auto sector, not least Alphabet (GOOGL) and its Waymo self-driving unit. Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong. But GM says its ability to both develop self-driving solutions and manufacture cars gives it an edge vs. tech rivals in the race to put self-driving cars on public roads on a commercial scale. GM shares look set for a 4% weekly drop but are up 22% on the year.Marquee auto and tech companies also looked to the future at Automobility LA, a curtain-raiser for the LA Auto Show. Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich sees self-driving cars as one of the biggest data collectors in the next decade or so. Intel's self-driving partner BMW (BMWYY) said its autonomous cars will hit the road in 2021. SUVs and crossover utility vehicles — the autos in hot demand today — dazzled on the floors of the auto show.General Motors reported a surprise decline in U.S. auto sales, while Ford (F) had stronger-than-expected gains. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) sales fell, largely in line, as the automaker slashes fleet sales.The Federal Reserve is on track for a December rate hike, Jerome Powell, the current Fed governor who will replace Janet Yellen as chair in February, signaled in a Senate hearing on his nomination. Powell also said that he sees the current 4.1% unemployment rate as about the lowest it can go without putting upward pressure on inflation. His remarks suggest that the Fed's hawkish-but-patient tilt probably won't change much after Yellen's exit. Powell also hinted that he favors a lighter touch on bank regulation.Meanwhile, the economy continues to show broad strength. New home sales in October surged to a 685,000 annual pace, a 10-year high.

Bitcoin prices reversed on spot markets after testing $20,000 earlier.XCME's Bitcoin futures, with the ticker BTC, fell back to $18,865. Cboe Bitcoin futures were at $18,800, near session lows but up sharply from Friday's $18,105.CME Group is a much bigger player in futures than Cboe, while its Bitcoin contract will be derived from prices on four exchanges.

It should also be easier to buy and short.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) will let its investors trade Cboe Bitcoin futures starting Monday, but will wait on CME's contract.

135,CBOE,"Riot Blockchain (RIOT) on Monday said that TessPay, a blockchain payments company it majority owns, wants to merge with Cresval Capital, a move that would mark the latest among many in recent weeks that Riot has made in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as worries about rising froth in those markets intensify.X Riot — once a biotech company that rebranded itself in October to focus more on developing blockchain technology — said Tess entered into a non-binding letter of intent to merge with Cresval, a company focused on the exploration of mineral resources.Cresval does not currently have any exploration projects underway, and the company said its material assets are mineral claims in British Columbia.Under the letter of intent, TessPay will get 80 million shares of Cresval and Cresval's shareholders will keep 8.4 million shares of the combined company. The merged company would be the first backed by Riot to be a public, standalone company, Riot said.After the closing of the potential merger, TessPay would change its name to TessPay, Inc. That company would trade on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada. Riot Blockchain would get 41.6 million shares from its 52% ownership of TessPay.A merger, if it were agreed to, would likely close in the second quarter of next year. However, the company said that no deal was guaranteed.""The decision to take the company public provides us access to traditional capital markets as we continue developing our blockchain technology solution,"" Jeff Mason, TessPay's CEO, said in a statement. ""This environment will also foster transparency and accountability moving forward, providing confidence to investors and prospective customers alike.""Shares of Riot Blockchain spiked 45.5% to close at 23.08 on the stock market today. The stock has more than doubled in value over the past month as the price of Bitcoin has soared. Marathon Patent Group (MARA), another stock that has emerged recently as a Bitcoin play, surged 43%.The merger, if it goes through, would come amid an explosion of startups dealing in blockchain, the record-keeping technology used to clear cryptocurrency transactions with potential applications in banking, government, real estate, delivery tracking and an array of other areas. But with that expansion have come concerns about a blockchain bubble.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game?

152,CBOE,"Bitcoin prices on spot and futures markets fell significantly for a second straight session on Wednesday, while Bitcoin Cash was set to resume on Coinbase after a dodgy spike in that cryptocurrency hours before its surprise listing.X Bitcoin dropped 8% to $16,214.04, after hitting $17,822 in early trade and then tumbling to $15,577.74, according to Coindesk. Bitcoin futures fell to $16,700 on the Cboe (CBOE) and the CME (CME)  Wednesday.In a blog post, Coinbase's chief addressed suspicions that his staff may have exploited its move to list the rival Bitcoin cryptocurrency.""Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter,"" wrote CEO Brian Armstrong. ""If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies  —  directly or indirectly  —  I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.""Announcing the insider trading probe, Armstrong added that the San Francisco-based startup's policy forbids employees and contractors from trading on ""material non-public information,"" such as when a new asset is added to its platform.The incident marred a milestone month for Coinbase, which became the top free app on the Apple (AAPL) App Store for the first time as the price of Bitcoin punched through the $12,000, $13,000 and $14,000 marks in rapid order before topping $19,000 over the weekend.Bitcoin Cash traded at $3,732 on Coinbase.

153,CBOE,"Bitcoin began 2017 trading under $1,000. Then it got much bigger. Investors big and small arrived, sometimes bailed hard — as they did on Friday — then arrived some more. Concerns were raised that Bitcoin barely qualified as money. Concerns were raised that its immense transaction volumes were swallowing up the world's energy. Comparisons to Dutch tulip mania piled up, and a securities regulator in December said ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy Bitcoin.""X Which all leads to one question for 2018: Is there any chance Bitcoin's jagged, face-melting run for the stratosphere might become a bit tamer?The advent of Bitcoin futures from Cboe (CBOE), CME Group (CME) and, eventually, Nasdaq (NDAQ), has the potential to reel Bitcoin back into orbit. A Bitcoin ETF in 2018? Certainly not impossible. Greater attention from regulators could help inform investors and stamp out fraud.After a week of some moderation on spot market, volatility has roared back in recent days. Shares of Bitcoin-related stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) are also seeing big daily moves, while companies looking to rebrand themselves with blockchain such as Long Island Iced Tea (LTEA) and Net Element (NETE) keep jumping in. And other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum and Litecoin, have shot up in price recently.But most big banks are unlikely, for now, to gorge on the tulips, and it's still debatable whether treating Bitcoin like a normal investment will make it behave like one. Others wonder if investors are prepared for the more complicated world of investing next year that the futures will bring — to a market where 40% of all Bitcoins are reportedly in the possession of 1,000 holders who could, on a whim, lop thousands of dollars off its price.""So, someone who put in $10,000 now has $2 million in his account — does he know how to protect it when trading might go against him?"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and potential gains.Those questions were perhaps underscored on Friday, when Bitcoin's price crumbled below $12,000, then picked up another $1,000 later in the day, after a week of warnings from financial officials abroad and worries about possible insider trading. Bitcoin futures contracts from Cboe and CME were tracking close to the price of Bitcoin itself.Futures contracts will allow investors to wager on whether Bitcoin's price will rise or fall without owning the cryptocurrency directly. If more investors, possibly anticipating a bubble, use the futures to bet on a drop in Bitcoin, that might help tap the brakes on cryptocurrency's feverish price increases, the reasoning goes.That short-selling would also allow investors to hedge against their long bets on Bitcoin and make plays in the market more easily.""So if I bought Bitcoin at $200, and it's trading at $15,000, I might want to hedge out some of that without actually selling my Bitcoin,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""And this might be much easier with futures, to get in and out of that position intraday.""The contracts would also have trading and price limits, and could open a pathway for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that would trade on the stock market — a development Dusaniwsky said was likely in 2018. Cboe this filed with the SEC to list six Bitcoin ETFs. The more securities available overall, the more opportunity to short. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, also wants to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The massive retail brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) said this month that it will let some clients trade Cboe's Bitcoin futures, and rival E-Trade Financial (ETFC) followed days later. Also this month, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said it would allow customers to make some bets against those futures.Last week, there were some indications that short-sellers may have moved in and tempered the markets. Bloomberg reported at that time that the price of Cboe's Bitcoin futures, which cost up to 13% more than Bitcoin itself, had over a few days drifted much closer to the spot price of the cryptocurrency.But not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin futures will mellow out cryptocurrency markets.""While the futures markets help bring traditional financial institutions into the space, they do encourage speculation rather than owning the underlying asset and are unlikely to dampen volatility,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, said in an email, noting that a Bitcoin ETF or mutual fund would instead be more helpful in easing volatility.Any short-sellers would also be betting against a cryptocurrency whose price has ballooned more than 1,300% since the beginning of 2017. While short-selling seems likely, there might not be as much of it as many are anticipating.""Number 1, short-sellers aren't gluttons for punishment,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""With Bitcoin going up $1,000 a day some days, I don't see these guys jumping into the short side, just doing outright short positions, on a whim.""Financial institutions might be fine with letting their customers make futures trades, but the big banks are largely staying away from doing it themselves.But Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies and hopes to have it running by the end of June, sources told Bloomberg Thursday.That would make Goldman the first of Wall Street's top trading firms to jump into the crypto-mania. Peers like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are waiting to see what what happens.Bitcoin futures are too new and too small, with too little regulatory underpinning, for the banks to get into right now, said CFRA analyst Ken Leon before the Goldman news broke.The volatile cryptocurrency isn't exactly fodder for banks' wealth management divisions, either. Banks, who have tried to detox from the high-risk investments that battered them during the financial crisis, would also have to calculate the potential loss risk of any asset tied to Bitcoin.""I wouldn't expect to see JPMorgan (JPM) involved anytime soon,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a corporate-finance partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which advises clients on cryptocurrency markets.But hedge funds are getting in the game. Fortress Investment Group and Horizon Kinetics have purchased Bitcoin recently, while executives from firms like Quantbot Technologies and Steven Cohen's Cubist Systematic Strategies recently met to discuss how they could profit from cryptocurrencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Still, as Bitcoin's price has scorched higher, and as startup entrepreneurs attach the ""crypto"" prefix to whatever's trending, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started to notice. The agency in December stopped at least two initial coin offerings — a form of digital fundraising — that it deemed suspicious or in violation of securities laws.The SEC has also issued advice to investors to avoid getting conned, and even urged caution when considering celebrities' promotions of things like ICOs — an announcement that came after Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Paris Hilton and a few others have thrown their support behind them. ""Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,"" the agency warned in November, later adding that those celebrity endorsers ""often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure … compliance with federal securities laws.""But as Bitcoin exchanges strain under the weight of more interest and more serious money, disputes among developers over how best to speed transactions through the network seem likely to resurface in 2018.Disagreement over how to proceed has led two ""fork"" currencies that have formed out of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash, in August, and Bitcoin Gold, in October. Those cryptocurrencies use different algorithms and equipment and have different sizes of the blocks of code that store transaction information.As that debate goes on, or as Bitcoin's price drifts out of reach, investors could turn their attention to lower-profile, lower-drama currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin and others.""Some of them could even gain advantage in the future by offering better compliance with regulatory requirements,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note in December.As more people have piled into Bitcoin, the doubt from bigger names in the financial world has built up on a daily basis. Most recently, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin's presence in the payments landscape was still very small. But she said, as others have, that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" UBS' global chief economist called Bitcoin the ""bubble to end all bubbles"". Brian Armstrong, the co-counder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in a December blog post: ""Please invest responsibly.""""Most of the investors that I talk to, they look at Bitcoin truly as a commodity,"" Tinnen said, adding that they tend to guard against the cryptocurrency's occasional stabs downward with defensive investments elsewhere. ""I have to say that they are very enthusiastic, and sometimes that enthusiasm means that they are not always taking as clear-eyed a view as they should in order to hedge it.""Others, Dusaniwsky said, might not be the kind of traders you typically see on the stock market. They might not be familiar with the investment vehicles that are coming into the market. They might not know how to use, say, stop-loss orders, he said, or otherwise trade their positions more professionally, if the up-market this year heads south.""You've got a lot of sheep that are long Bitcoin,"" he said, ""and the wolves might be starting to get into the market.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.3% for the week and the Dow 0.4%. Energy stocks, which could be big winners under the new 21% corporate tax rate, were leaders, with Chevron, Diamondback Energy (FANG) and several other oil plays to hit buy zones. There were several notable earnings reports as companies got ready for the post-Christmas week.Bitcoin futures from CME Group (CME), the world's biggest futures exchange, launched on Sunday with an opening trade at $20,650, but tumbled to just under $14,000 Friday, in sync with Cboe (CBOE) Bitcoin futures. Spot prices tumbled intraday below $11,000. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs (GS) was developing a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, with a possible debut in June, which would make it the first big bank to be a cryptocurrency market maker. And amid a growing market fixation on anything blockchain, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. vaulted a cool 183% Thursday after the iced-tea seller said it was rebranding itself as Long Blockchain (LTEA) to focus on ""the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.""Diamondback Energy (FANG) broke out in strong volume Wednesday, with Chevron (CVX), Concho Resources (CXO) among those clearing buy points on Thursday. BPBP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among those breaking out in less-impressive trade. Energy stocks are seen as big winners from the tax cuts, while crude prices are holding at two-year highs. U.S. crude inventories fell in the latest week but production hit yet another high. Saudi Arabia reportedly is looking at buying natural gas shale assets in Texas. Meanwhile, several mining stocks, including Vale (VALE) and Rio Tinto (RIO), also broke out.Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter and guided much higher than views for the current quarter. Micron earned an adjusted $2.45 a share in the quarter ended Nov. 30, up nearly eight times the 32 cents reported in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 71% to $6.8 billion. Analysts expected Micron to earn $2.20 a share on sales of $6.39 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn an adjusted $2.58 a share on sales of $7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling $1.95 and $6.08 billion. Shares rose 4%.Consumer spending and the housing market turned it up a notch in November as the economy fires on pretty much all cylinders. Third-quarter GDP growth was revised down a tick to 3.2%, still the best pace since the first quarter of 2015, as business investment extended its recent strength. Consumer spending rose 0.6% on the month, while wages rose 0.4%. Consumers saved just 2.9% of income in November, the weakest in a decade, which is probably a reflection of greater optimism in the economic outlook. Existing-home sales surged 5.6% to a 5.81 million annual pace, the best in 11 years, as the supply of homes for sale got even tighter. New-home sales skyrocketed 17.5%.Nike (NKE) reported a 5% sales drop in North America, its second straight quarterly decline. But the No. 1 sports brand comfortably topped expectations as Q2 profit fell 8% to 46 cents a share and revenue rose 5% to $8.55 billion vs. views for 39 cents EPS and $8.39 billion. China sales rose 15%.

Shares fell 2.3% Friday.FedEx (FDX) easily beat Q2 forecasts, delivering 14% EPS growth to $3.18 while revenue grew 9% to $16.31 billion, and raised guidance to $12.70-$13.30 per diluted share for the year, up from prior outlook for $12-$12.80. FedEx Express revenue rose over 8%, Ground segment revenue grew 12%, and Freight sales rose 10%. Shares rose 4.15%. The report come as FedEx and UPS (UPS) are in peak holiday delivery season, having beefed up staffing to meet delivery goals. UPS has encountered some delays in getting packages to customers.Red Hat (RHT) reported Q3 profit that edged views while revenue, operating margin, and billings also topped estimates. The open source Linux software company is ramping revenue from new products — OpenShift and OpenStack — for hybrid cloud computing, analysts said. For the current quarter Red Hat estimated revenue in the range of $758 million to $763 million, above the consensus of $755 million. It projects adjusted earnings of 81 cents, topping the consensus estimate of 75 cents. Full-year revenue guidance was raised by $21 million at the midpoint to $2.906 billion. But shares sank 4.55%.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 73 cents, up 14%, while revenue rose 14.6% to $1.88 billion, both beating views.

Analysts said they were impressed with the online tailor's performance, with revenue of $295.6 million, up 25%. Concerns were raised, however, about the Stitch Fix's declining gross margin amid heavy capital expenditures. The recent IPO fell 9.8% on Wednesday but rose 5.6% for the week.Accenture (ACN) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations.

158,CBOE,"Many investors are asking: Should I buy Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies? And if not, why?X Bitcoin, the leading digital money, surged to a new record high above $17,000 Dec. 7 and was recently trading around $15,000. It's now risen nearly 1,550% this year and is up 6,540% since a low in January 2015. Nearly every day Bitcoin and other cryptos are making headlines. Some experts call them the new gold.But are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies real investments or a speculator's game? And what about initial coin offerings, a hybrid of initial public offering and crowdfunding that has spawned Etherum and other projects? Even Wall Street is divided, so many experts warn Main Street investors to stay away or proceed with great caution.No less than Goldman Sachs (GS) is said to be considering a cryptocurrency trading operation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yet JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Dec. 8 he remains""highly skeptical"" of the cryptocurrency. Dimon in September called Bitcoin ""a fraud"" in September and said it would likely stay on the black market.Far from being safe for widows and orphans, like utilities, the Bitcoin market — which hit $150 billion in August — looks more like the 1840s gold rush. Many rushed in, but few got rich.On Nov. 12, Bitcoin fell to around $5,500, wiping out a rally on news that a plan to split the crypto currency was called off. It's bounced back since and was trading around $15,800 late Dec. 8.One risk is that governments likely will limit the currencies' use, such as barring them for tax payments, which would keep them out of the mainstream, according to UBS. China recently banned initial coin offerings and trading in cryptocurrencies, and it may not be the last government to act on concerns about giving up control over the flow of funds, the ability to monitor taxable gains or appearing vigilant in protecting investors.But many retailers are accepting Bitcoins as payment, including Microsoft, Target, Home Depot and Subway. And more uses are in the works.Only a handful of ETFs and other exchange traded products have significant exposure to Bitcoin or other cryptos. One is Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). It's attracted $2.5 billion in assets and is up more than 1,250% this year.With a Bitcoin futures launch just around the corner, more vehicles could emerge soon. CBOE will start trading futures Dec. 10, followed by CME on Dec. 18. Earlier in the year, ETF provider VanEck's SEC filing to create a Bitcoin ETF was withdrawn because of a lack of futures.The surge in Bitcoin's value is a boon for Coinbase, an exchange where crytpocoins can be bought, sold and stored in wallets. Coinbase added more than 100,000 users Nov. 2 in a 24-hour period after CME Group announced its plans to introduce Bitcoin futures by the year's end, Bloomberg reported.In a picks-and-shovels move vs. actually holding Bitcoins, ETF provider Reality Shares in November filed to offer Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy ETF, which would invest in companies that commit significant resources to blockchain technology, the Street.com reported. Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptos. Also in November, Amplify ETFs also filed for Amplify Blockchain Leaders ETF and Horizons ETF Management filed for Horizons Blockchain Index.Bitcoin arrived on the scene in 2009. The digital currency is created and held electronically. Its value stems partly from the fact that it's decentralized; no single institution or government controls the network. It was developed based on a proposal from a software developer called Satoshi Nakamoto, according to CoinDesk, which tracks cryptocurrency prices and reports on events in the crypto space. Low transaction costs are another feature along with instantaneous transfers.Perhaps its biggest attraction is that its supply can't be increased or decreased at the whim of a controlling entity. Similar to gold and other precious metals, Bitcoins can be ""mined,"" but it's done by using computing power in a distributed network. And like gold, Bitcoin supply is limited. And it's headed toward terminal creation.Bitcoin rules state that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created, though the coins can be split into smaller parts. That could make Bitcoin, like gold, an attractive inflation hedge, backers say. There are 16.67 million Bitcoin in circulation now.On the other hand, the potential creation of new digital currencies creates ""the possibility of limitless supply of different cryptocurrencies,"" undermining the value of existing ones, UBS warned recently.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), an ETF that tracks the price of gold bullion, is up about 8% this year. That might look meager next to Bitcoin's surge. Hence, internet news searches for Bitcoin now outnumber those for gold.But cryptocurrencies have been volatile. On the way to its all-time high this year, Bitcoin plunged 28% from $2,682.59 on June 12 to $1,938.94. And it plummeted 35% from $4,950.72 on Sept. 1 to $3,336.41 on Sept. 14.Critics warn of a bubble. ""The relatively high volume of cryptocurrency turnover, against limited real-world use, suggests that many buyers are seeking speculative gain, never intending to use cryptocurrencies to make a real-world transaction,"" UBS analysts said in report quoted by CNBC.The blockchain software behind Bitcoin makes the digital currency a method of transferring value, but unlike at, say, a bank or real estate company. With blockchain, those expensive middlemen are no longer needed to ensure a transaction takes place as intended, a protection supplied by the blockchain software itself. The result: faster and cheaper transactions.And since blockchain and cryptocurrencies offer various layers of anonymity, they are seen as attractive to those living in countries where transfer of wealth is restricted. Detractors say cryptos also draw drug dealers, money launderers and tax dodgers along with legitimate investors.Coinbase is involved in a lawsuit in which it's trying to fend off IRS attempts to scan customer accounts for unreported taxable gains, Bloomberg reported.Those who want to own cryptocurrencies directly can go to exchanges to buy and trade them. Some of the largest are U.S.-based Coinsetter, Coinbase, Cryptsy, London-based Bitsamp and Bulgaria-based BTC-e.They'll need what the industry calls a wallet to store the private keys that give access to cryptos. Major exchanges offer soft, or hot, wallets for customers. Such wallets are available for desktop computers and mobile devices and include Bitcoin wallet, Mycelium, Xapo and Blockchain, according to Coindesk.Hard wallets in the form of flash-drive like devices bring an extra layer of security, by limiting exposure to the internet. They have to be plugged into a computer or phone before they can be spent. Three popular ones, according to Buybitcoinworldwide.com, are Ledger Nano S, KeepKey and Trezor. Just remember, don't lose it, forget your password or fail to back it up, or you might lose your cryptocurrency forever.While proponents extol the fraud-proof safety of blockchain technology, wallets have proved vulnerable. In the latest mishap, an estimated $280 million of Ethereum ether coins were locked up after a user accidentally deleted the code needed to access digital wallets hosted by Parity Technologies. The freeze affects all multisignature wallets created on Parity after July 20.Ethereum has jumped 5,628% this year from $8.03 on Dec. 31, 2016, and was at $459.99 Dec. 8. It surged as high as $464.99 early in the day.Meanwhile, the financial industry is moving ahead.In other moves by financial companies to bring Bitcoin to investors, on Sept. 6, CoinIRA, Goldco's digital currency unit, launched its new Digital IRA Bundles. The bundles, available in amounts of $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000, come prepackaged with digital currencies. Investors can choose from three portfolios based on their risk appetite: conservative, moderate or aggressive. The conservative bundle is made up of 50% Bitcoin, 41% Ethereum and 3% each in Ether classic, Litecoin and Ripple.Could exchange traded funds make digital cash more widely accessible?""A diversified ETF that has some exposure to cryptocurrencies will likely be somewhat less risky than direct investment,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, told IBD. ""But that's a bit like comparing the risks associated with juggling knives to those you'd face juggling chain saws.""Thus far no exchange traded funds trade on a major exchange like SPDR Gold Shares or iShares Gold Trust (IAU). Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Investment Trust, which launched May 4, 2015, trades over the counter. Grayscale had filed for SEC approval to trade GBTC on NYSE Arca, but on Sept. 27 withdrew the application, remaining as a less-regulated investment trust.Morningstar Direct lists GBTC with its ETFs, but there doesn't appear to be an efficient arbitrage mechanism that keeps the price and NAV in balance. GBTC recently traded at a 44% premium to its holdings.GBTC shares fell as much as 54% from an Aug. 31 high but have rebounded to hit record highs and are up more than 1,500% this year. They started tumbling 20% Sept. 1 after short-seller Citron Research called GBTC the ""most dangerous way to own Bitcoin"" and said it should trade no higher than $550 a share.""Right now, many investors are using the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is arguably even riskier than Bitcoin because it trades at high premiums, which means you could lose money even if Bitcoin doesn't go down,"" Eric Balchunas, ETF Analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, told IBD. ""In contrast, the ETF structure and its creation/redemption process would give investors the best possible chance to get A fair deal on investing in Bitcoin. ETFs have proved themselves in terms of being able to handle all kinds of non-equity holdings, such as bonds, physical gold and derivatives.""Potential ETFs under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission include Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, which the SEC rejected in March amid concerns including lack of liquidity and regulation. Officials are again reviewing the ETF candidate, a seemingly recurring process over the past three years.ETF provider ProShares on Sept. 27 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. Instead of owning the currency, both ETFs plan to track Bitcoin futures contracts.But the same day, VanEck withdrew its Aug. 11 application for VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which would have also invested in Bitcoin futures. According to VanEck's application withdrawal letter, the SEC's policy is to not review a registration statement until the underlying instruments (Bitcoin futures contracts) become available.Even Fidelity Investments is dipping its toes in the cryptocurrency field by teaming up with Coinbase. Fidelity's innovation unit on Aug. 9 said it will allow Fidelity customers to view their Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin balances in their Coinbase wallet accounts.Balchunas puts the odds at about 50/50 of a new ETF option in the next two years.""There have been two key developments since the SEC rejected it in March,"" he told IBD. ""One is the likelihood of a regulated Bitcoin futures and options markets, and the second is that the SEC's changing with the new administration, and its brand-new head of the division of investment management was a lawyer at the same firm that represented the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin filing.""Still, caution is warranted.""In an ETF wrapper, volatility of Bitcoin could prove higher than alternative currency-based products and investors will need to be prepared,"" Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research, told IBD. ""Interestingly, ARK Innovation (ARKK) and ARK Web X.0 (ARKW) provide exposure to Bitcoin, but have diversification to more traditional equity investments such as Amazon.com, Tesla and Twitter, dampening the risk.""ARK Investment Management, which runs six ETFs, offers exposure to Bitcoin and was the first ETF to own GTBC shares, which has helped boost the funds' performance.ARKK and ARKW were the top two sector ETFs based on their year-to-date returns through Dec. 7, according to Morningstar Direct, with respective gains of 83% and 80%.ARKK has attracted $295 million in assets since its October 2014 launch; ARKW has gathered $193 million since September 2014. Both funds bear a 0.75% expense ratio.Kinetics Internet (WWWFX) and Kinetics Market Opportunities (KMKNX) are among several Kinetics Mutual Funds that also own GBTC.Even as more options unfold for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, investors should keep in mind potential risks.""If market prices retain any useful informational content, which theory suggests they do, then the 10x run-up in the crypto market capitalization over the last year signals there is something important taking place,"" ZenCash co-founder Rob Viglione said. ""Whether that something ends up being radically transformational, or simply a speculative delusion is yet to be seen.""This article was first published Nov. 13.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free With New Apps For BeginnersThe IPO Market's Hidden Gems: Can You Find The Next Google?Here's The Latest Bitcoin Rival That's About To Hit The MarketFidelity Starts Test To Let Customers See Their Holdings In Bitcoin, Other Digital CurrenciesMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Wal-Mart

166,CBOE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly Monday morning, while Bitcoin's wild ride took another leg down.During Thursday's session, chip giants Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) undercut recent breakouts while Facebook (FB) drifted below its 50-day moving average. Those issues come as energy stocks power up, with Chevron (CVX) among Thursday's powerful moves into buy zones.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly above fair value.Bitcoin futures were falling yet again this week, with CME and Cboe futures tumbling to about $14,100. CME futures opened trading on Sunday evening at $20,650. Several Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks were retreating as well.Long Blockchain (LTEA), which surged 183% on Thursday on its decision to change its name from Long Island Iced Tea, was down 31% in premarket action. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) lost 12% and Overstock.com (OSTK) 5.5%.Intel fell 1.7% to 46.76 in Thursday's stock market trading, dropping below a 47.40 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Volume was 44% above normal, slightly more than on Wednesday's breakout. However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers, Micron Technology (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal. Concho Resources (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while EOG Resources (EOG), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading. But those moves still added to the general optimism surrounding the sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged 5%, becoming extended after leading the way with a high-volume breakout Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Next Potential Pitfall In WashingtonThese Oil, Mining Stocks Hit Buy Zones On Global Growth, Trump Tax Cuts: Investing Action PlanArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

The company said it would request to change its trading symbol as well. Long Blockchain would continue to operate in the beverage business.Long Island Iced Tea said it was in the ""preliminary stages of evaluating specific opportunities"" for blockchain.

Citron's founder, Andrew Left, told CNBC this week ""there's nothing there.""He also said he had taken a short bet against Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), adding that there were ""limited opportunities"" to bet against businesses related to Bitcoin but that the ones available were ""nice and juicy.""Bitcoin Investment Trust crashed 26%, but still has a big premium over Bitcoin prices.Bitcoin prices were tumbling for a third straight day.

179,CBOE,"South Korea will prohibit initial coin offerings, or fundraising via cryptocurrencies, making it the latest nation to crack down on the increasingly popular practice over concerns about fraud.The decision, announced Friday by the nation's Financial Services Commission, comes after China this month also moved to ban ICOs. In the U.S., the SEC this summer said securities laws could apply to such digital fundraising.Bitcoin was essentially flat late Friday morning. The digital currency's value surged over the summer to around $5,000. But it then tumbled after China's ICO ban and plans to halt cryptocurrency trades on domestic exchanges, as well as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon's prediction that Bitcoin was destined to implode.""Raising funds through ICOs seem to be on the rise globally, and our assessment is that ICOs are increasing in South Korea as well,"" the Financial Services Commission said in a statement, according to Reuters. The regulator added that anyone conducting an ICO would be hit with ""stern penalties.""IBD'S TAKE: China and South Korea might be cracking down, but as cryptocurrencies grow, they've become tougher to ignore by the financial industry's old guard. Here's what some Wall Street giants are doing in the digital currency space.Meanwhile, the exchange-traded fund provider ProShares wants to set up two Bitcoin-exposed exchange traded funds — ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC for the approval of those funds.Those funds, which have not begun trading, would be listed on NYSE Arca and follow Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the filing said.That filing comes as more people seek exposure to Bitcoin. CBOE last month said it planned to roll out its own Bitcoin futures in the coming months. The SEC in March rejected a Bitcoin ETF proposed by the Winklevoss twins.Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which sell graphics cards often used to process cryptocurrency transactions, rose 1.1% and fell 0.8%, respectively, in the stock market today.RELATED:JPMorgan CEO Has Another Reason Why He Thinks Bitcoin Is Doomed'Bitcoin Jesus' Makes This Prophecy On The Digital CurrencyWhy Bitcoin Is Rebounding After Getting Trashed Last WeekBitcoin Dives Again: BTCChina To Halt Trades; China Shutdown 'Certain'

181,CBOE,"Volatility is low. But does that mean it's abnormal?A group of researchers and economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York set out to answer that very question in a blog post Monday. The results weren't so clear cut. ""Are investors complacent? The evidence is mixed,"" they wrote.The Cboe VIX Index, which measures implied volatility of S&P 500 stocks, has ticked higher in recent days. But even with the gauge now sitting above its average level for 2017, it's still far below the bull-market average.""Based on similarities to the low-volatility environment before the financial crisis, some suggest that investor complacency may contribute to a major correction in equity markets when volatility returns to a 'normal' level,"" the authors wrote. Should the VIX return to its average of around 20 since 1990, the S&P 500 could fall 5% to 10%, according to the authors.But what if today's seemingly abnormally low levels of volatility aren't so abnormal, and that it's the volatility of the past that was oddly high? To check the hypothesis, the authors looked to a theory of asset pricing — the idea that stock prices are equal to the expected value of discounted dividends. Going by that, equity valuations and dividends should have roughly the same volatility.That hasn't been the case, though. Since the 1950s, stock prices have experienced nearly 10% more volatility than dividends — a result, for the most part, of wavering investor sentiment, according to the authors, who cite Robert Shiller's research. Today, realized volatility is about 6% — closer to the 7% historic volatility of dividends — so maybe volatility that now seems freakishly low is actually where it was always supposed to be.On the other hand, the authors found some evidence that volatility is being held down by traders selling options hand over fist, potentially a sign of complacency. They looked at the gap between realized and implied volatility in the S&P 500, treating it as a kind of profit margin for sellers of options. Right now, it's less than half its historical average.""Beyond the current level, we can also observe that the volatility risk premium has been below its long-run mean and has exhibited less volatility since around 2012,"" they wrote, adding: ""the volatility risk premium appears to be low both in absolute terms and relative to its historical norm, which may suggest complacency.""

The move comes as Nasdaq seeks to leverage its expertise in market technology and data analytics, and is the result of a plan announced earlier this month to funnel capital and resources from slower growth businesses into reinvestments in higher-return areas.""As a technology company, our growth path requires a review of our core strengths matched with the evolving needs of our clients,"" Adena Friedman, president and CEO of Nasdaq, said in a statement.Nasdaq stock popped 0.65% to 77.63 on the stock market today, after rising to a record-high 78.31, briefly clearing a 77.85 buy point off a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: A good flat base reflects unusual strength. This is why this supergrowth stock pattern is worth paying attention to.The businesses under review include Nasdaq GlobeNewswire; Nasdaq Influencers; Nasdaq Media Intelligence; Nasdaq IR Websites and Newsrooms; and Nasdaq Webcasts, which have generated roughly $195 million in revenue and $25 million in operating income over the past 12 months ended June 30, the exchange giant said.Nasdaq said it has not set a timetable for the process, nor made final decisions on any alternatives at this time.The company describes itself as the creator of the world's first electronic stock market, with its technology powering more than 90 marketplaces in 50 countries, and one in 10 of the world's securities transactions.Nasdaq earns the No. 9 rank among its peers in the Financial Services-Specialty industry group, one of 197 groups tracked by IBD. CBOE (CBOE) is ranked No. 1 within the group.RELATED:Nasdaq Clears Key Benchmark, Hitting 80-Plus RS RatingBest Stocks To Buy And WatchNasdaq Shows Improved Relative Strength; Still Shy Of Benchmark

Nasdaq 100 futures rallied 0.6% vs. fair value.  The major averages hit record highs Friday as Republicans unveiled their final tax bill with apparently enough support to pass.

But Netflix is increasingly becoming a must-have for households, even if they subscribe to other streaming or traditional pay-TV services. Netflix is a major reason why many traditional media players are scrambling.Netflix shares rose 0.3% to 190.12 in Friday's stock market trading. Netflix is in a flat base with a 204.48 buy point, but is currently trading below its 50-day moving average. A strong retaking of that support level in high volume could offer a buying opportunity.Comcast held out better than most media and entertainment stocks, but finally broke down in September before finding a bottom in early November. Comcast has formed a handle in a six-month consolidation, creating a 40.83 buy point.Comcast's Relative Strength line has been weak for months, as the stock has retreated while the S&P 500 index continued to march higher.Comcast is the leading U.S. cable and internet provider. It also owns NBCUniversal, making it a major content creator.Verizon is the No. 1 wireless operator. Telecom giants are often seen as distinct from cable and media stocks, but there is growing overlap. Americans, especially teens and young adults, increasingly use their smartphone as their screen for content. Also,Verizon offers pay-TV and internet service via Fios. Verizon also plans to launch 5G wireless broadband in select U.S. markets, competing with Comcast's landline broadband.Verizon bought Yahoo earlier this year following its purchase of AOL. Verizon owns Huffington Post and Tech Crunch.Verizon cleared a 51.28 bottoming-base buy point on Dec. 4, but then fell back down. But the Dow industrials component retook that entry on Dec. 11, closing Friday at 52.67.AT&T has an even better claim as a media claim than Verizon. In addition to being a wireless giant, AT&T owns the DirecTV satellite service, along with the streaming DirecTV Now. AT&T also is trying to buy Time Warner (TWX), which would make a major content player, with CNN, TNT, HBO and more.The Justice Department is fighting to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, saying it would be anti-competitive.AT&T has cleared a 37.64 cup-with-handle buy point last week, ending Friday at 38.24. But there are definitely reasons to be cautious. AT&T fell to a two-year low on Nov. 6. It's rallied since then but the stock has no prior uptrend before the current consolidation. Shares have closed above their 200-day moving average for the first time in eight months.CSX CEO Hunter Harrison died Saturday from complications from an undisclosed illness.

192,CBOE,"A Wall Street analyst's downgrade of megacap tech leader Apple (AAPL) didn't ruffle the feathers of institutional investors, even as major stock indexes cooled mildly Tuesday. Apple, down 0.9% to 174.79, still hovered only 1% below its newest buy point, 176.34 in a flat base.X Apple is also still extended from a prior buy point at 160.97, stemming from an eight-week cup with handle.Apple is also up more than 47% since it broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 in early January. That cup with handle was part of a long bottoming base pattern, one of the most bullish chart patterns that help an investor time a new buy correctly after a stock has made a devastating correction.Nomura Instinet cut its rating on Apple to neutral on concerns that iPhone X sales are already incorporated into the stock's price. Jeffrey Kvall also noted a ""historically full multiple.""Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) took a well needed break, showing wild action as the Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund careened from a new all-time high of 3,523 to an intraday low of 2,630.With an intraday range of 33.9%, Bitcoin Investment is definitely not for the faint of heart. Yet for those who embrace time-proven chart patterns that have shown up in the greatest stock market winners going back to the late 19th century, Bitcoin Investment is acting just as one would expect after it bolted out of a deep yet well-formed cup with handle at 985.10.The gain from that Nov. 22 breakout has now exceeded 257%. The buy point is derived by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the two-week handle, or 985.00.At 3:40 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite rebounded a bit to cut its losses to around 0.4%. The leading U.S. equities index is also still up for the week following Monday's 0.8% boost. Investors are showing unwillingness to dump stocks as the House of Representatives passed a major tax reform package on Tuesday. The Senate is expected to do the same as early as Tuesday evening and send it to the White House for President Trump's signature before Christmas.The S&P 500 eased almost 0.2%. Finance, REIT, utility, solar and automaker stocks led the downside.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.The Dow Jones industrial average was off nearly 0.1%, with just two more components in addition to Apple down 1 point or more: Visa (V) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Goldman has gained nearly 4% since clearing a 247.84 buy point in a nine-month saucer with handle.Notice on a daily chart that Goldman broke out past the proper entry on Nov. 30 with a 2.6% gain in volume that expanded 148% higher than its 50-day average, a good sign. The Street expects the giant in fixed income and commodity trading and mergers and acquisitions to increase Q4 profits 2% to $5.16 a share.Microsoft (MSFT), one of the tech components within the Dow 30, dropped 1% to 85.53 in light trade and is mildly below an 86.30 buy point in a new flat base. The cloud computing, business software and Xbox giant initiated its slow yet steady advance with a late-July 2016 breakout past a 56.87 buy point in a three-month flat base that's part of a longer saucer pattern.As noted in this Investor's Corner column, the saucer pattern requires patience on the part of the investor before a proper new buy point finally emerges.Microsoft holds a solid 91 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Apple sports a 94 Composite, supported in part by a stronger EPS Rating than Microsoft (90 for Apple on a scale of 1 to 99, 68 for Microsoft). A 90 EPS Rating means that Apple is superior to 90% of all companies in IBD's database in terms of near-term quarterly and long-term annual profit growth.Back to Bitcoin Investment Trust. While the ETF has simply skyrocketed amid a surge in interest in the alternative currency, one reason why Bitcoin perhaps has not yet reached bubble conditions is the fact that both the Cboe and CME Group have only recently begun trading futures on their respective exchanges.Two, the total value of Bitcoin being traded globally is said to be only a fraction of the total value of trading in bonds, stocks, commodities and forex.A third reason why Bitcoin could see future growth is that professional money managers are showing an increasing appetite. The Bitcoin.com news website reported that hedge fund manager Bill Miller, a former star of the Legg Mason Value Trust mutual fund, currently has half of its assets in Bitcoin.While biotech shares have not had a merry fourth quarter, Biogen (BIIB) stands out as one large-cap firm that could potentially break out.The stock got hammered after so-so Q3 results (earnings up 22% to $6.31 a share, revenue up just 4% to $3.08 billion), but the sell-off was limited to 13% after Biogen notched a 52-week peak of 348.48. Since then, the stock has been forming a flat base that could also stretch into a saucerlike pattern.Biogen's earnings have nearly quintupled from $4.12 a share in 2009 to $20.22 last year. However, growth is expected to slow amid stiff competition in treatments for multiple sclerosis and other chronic medical conditions. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising just 9% to $22.06 a share this year and up 8% to $23.81 in 2018.Within the IBD Big Cap 20, the current list showcases just one medical stock, AbbVie (ABBV).In other financial markets, investors dumped U.S. government bonds following the Federal Reserve's third hike in short-term interest rates of the year. On Dec. 13, the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 1.25%-1.50%, up from 0.25%-0.50% in December 2015.Utility stocks fell en masse, with the Dow utility average sinking 1.6%. The Dow transports edged 0.2% higher despite a bump up in crude oil prices. WTI near-term futures rose 0.5% to $57.42 a barrel.RELATED:Can You Identify Major Stock Market Tops?

194,CBOE,"Depending on who you ask, Bitcoin is a bubble, a fraud, a money-laundering vehicle, a volatile mess or a crucial, necessary phase in monetary evolution.XStill, the currency, down sharply on Friday and over the weekend before a partial rebound Monday morning, has skyrocketed in value this year. Until it incinerates everybody's cash or transcends central banks as we know them, a whole bunch of Bitcoin-related plays — Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Goldman Sachs (GS) CME Group (CME) and CBOE (CBOE) — remain stocks to watch.Graphics processors from Nvidia and AMD are used to vet and clear cryptocurrency transactions. By clearing Bitcoin transactions, ""miners"" create more of the crypto coins. Nvidia is 24% extended past a 174.66 entry. It's often a good time to take profits after a 20%-25% advance.""Typically, growth stocks tend to advance 20% to 25% after breaking out of a proper base, then decline and set up new bases, and in some cases resume their advances,"" according to IBD's advice on profit-taking.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is currently ranked No. 7 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Shares of Nvidia jumped 5.3% to 216.14 on the stock market Friday, after the chipmaker late Thursday delivered strong third-quarter earnings and guidance.""We've been bearish for most of this year, anticipating that a slowdown in gaming would drive sharp revenue deceleration in 2017,"" Nomura-Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a research note on Friday. ""However, Nvidia demonstrated good diversity in gaming with Nintendo Switch and cryptocurrency, offsetting weakness in core gaming earlier in the year.""Third-quarter sales for Nvidia's cryptocurrency-related products dropped 53%.""We remain nimble in our approach to the cryptocurrency market,"" management said on Nvidia's earnings call. ""It is volatile, does not and will not distract us from focusing on our core gaming market.""AMD, which plans to join forces with Intel to compete against Nvidia in laptop gaming chips rose 1.3% to 11.26 on Friday. In October, AMD, on its third-quarter earnings call, said it was forecasting ""some leveling-off of some of the cryptocurrency demand.""Goldman Sachs is currently near a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Shares eased 0.3% to 240.15 on Friday.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Goldman is considering developing a cryptocurrency trading operation. Contrary to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who has said the cryptocurrency is doomed, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein appears to have hedged on the digital currency.He told CNBC this week that ""maybe Bitcoin is a kind of a bubble."" And he said ""it hasn't crossed my desk to set up a Bitcoin trading desk, but I wouldn't preclude it.""He added that he had a much more open mind about things like Bitcoin and that he had been wrong about other innovations taking off in the past. But he then said Bitcoin is ""something that I'm not comfortable with; I'm kind of an old dog to be absorbing that kind of a new trick.""Last month, Blankfein tweeted that he had not made up his mind about Bitcoin.Still thinking about #Bitcoin. No conclusion - not endorsing/rejecting. Know that folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold.— Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) October 3, 2017CME Group late last month said it would launch Bitcoin futures before year-end.

195,CBOE,"The major market averages were modestly higher in early morning trade Friday ahead of the GOP's scheduled unveiling of its reconciled tax-overhaul plan. All three major indexes — the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced about 0.5% apiece.X Meanwhile, Bitcoin futures — which debuted this week on the Cboe (CBOE) — rose nearly 8%.Among the Dow Jones industrial components, Boeing (BA) extended a win streak to four trading sessions, rising another 0.8% to a fresh record high.

The video-streaming giant broke out to a brief rally past a 190.05 cup base buy point in October, before surrendering those gains.Among companies reporting earnings, Adobe Systems' (ADBE) beat-and-raise Q4 results sparked a 1% gain early Friday. Shares continued to rebound from their 50-day line, where they have been finding support the last two weeks.Oracle (ORCL) dropped over 5%, as a double-bottom formation broke down. The company reported solid fiscal-Q2 earnings results late Thursday, but its cloud-computing revenue and total revenue outlook fell short of the Street's targets. The stock was at a 6-month low and below its 200-day line.Meanwhile, warehouse retailer Costco (COST) rose over 4% after topping fiscal-Q1 estimates, as better-than-expected same-store sales fueled the earnings beat. Shares have been strong since a Nov. 21 breakout above a 173.19 cup-with-handle entry. The stock is about 13% from that level Friday.CSX (CSX) plunged nearly 8% early Friday after CEO Hunter Harrison took a medical leave of absence. The stock was now about 4% below a 55.09 flat-base entry after a breakout on Nov. 30 and close to triggering the 7%-8% sell signal.Inside the IBD 50, financials were among the day's winners. Leaderboard member SVB Financial (SIVB) advanced 1.8% and is still in buy range from a 223.92 alternate entry.On the downside, China-based names were under pressure in early trade. Alibaba (BABA) fell 0.7%, looking to end the week with a near-4% decline. Shares are squarely below their 50-day line after finding resistance there Monday.RELATED:Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisOne Of The Hottest Dow Stocks Has A New Buy Point: Investing Action PlanWill The 'Big 6' Retailers Nab All Of The Holiday Shopping Cheer?S&P 500 Rises As Bitcoin Futures Debut, Disney Buys Fox, FCC Ends Net Neutrality, Fed Sticks To Script: Weekly ReviewFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

202,CBOE,"Goldman Sachs (GS) is reportedly considering developing a cryptocurrency trading operation, a move that would come as more investors seek exposure to forms of digital money like Bitcoin even as it meets resistance from regulators, economists and finance-industry executives.XAs described by the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the situation, Goldman is in the early phases of the initiative, which could involve the bank's strategic investment and currency-trading segments. The efforts might not materialize, the Journal said.But the involvement of currency-trading and strategic investment divisions, the Journal added, indicates that Goldman ""believes Bitcoin's future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.""That future would differ dramatically from the one predicted by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon in recent weeks has said Bitcoin ""will end badly"" and would likely be relegated to the black market, arguing governments would be unwilling to tolerate a currency that operates outside of regulatory boundaries. He also said he'd fire anyone at JPMorgan caught trading Bitcoin.While banks have been more open to blockchain, the record-keeping technology that underpins Bitcoin transactions, a trading platform on a large U.S. bank would mark the biggest embrace yet of digital currencies. Bitcoin was up 2.1% to $4,415.95 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: As cryptocurrencies grow, they've become tougher to ignore by the financial industry's old guard. Here's what some Wall Street giants are doing in the digital currency space.Elsewhere in the financial world, Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman told the Journal last month that the Bitcoin market was ""obviously highly speculative, but it's not something that's inherently bad.""CBOE Holdings (CBOE) has said it plans to introduce Bitcoin futures. Fidelity Investments is testing out a project that makes data on consumer digital cash holdings available on Fidelity.com. Exchange-traded-fund giant ProShares has asked the SEC to approve to Bitcoin ETFs, while the regulator earlier in the year rejected one proposed by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.Regulators in some nations have been concerned about security risks and scams. China has banned initial coin offerings and has ordered cryptocurrency exchanges in the nation to stop trading. South Korea has also said it would ban ICOs, and the SEC has said securities law may apply to such offerings.Bitcoin's price has swung wildly on the crackdown in China and the comments from Dimon and others. Some analysts say the digital's price volatility will ease as the market for it grows.Banks in recent months have struggled with low market volatility, hurting results from their trading desks. Goldman has said that it has misplayed the market in its trading division.Goldman Sachs rose 1.5% to 240.65 in the stock market today, hitting its best level since late March as it builds the right side of a base. Morgan Stanley advanced 1.6% to 48.92, moving just above a shallow cup-with-handle base with a 48.59 buy point.

204,CBOE,"The allure of bitcoin was too much for CME Group (CME).The world's largest exchange owner reversed course today and said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, only a month after dismissing such a plan. The largest cryptocurrency, which has surged more than sixfold this year, climbed to a record high after the announcement.CME's neighbor across the street in Chicago seems to have had a lot to do with the decision. Cboe Global Markets said earlier this year that it was going to begin a bitcoin futures contract by year-end or early 2018, and awaits approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CME contract will settle in cash and use a daily price from the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, which is supported by digital exchanges Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken. Missing from that list is Gemini, one of the other large global exchanges, which struck a deal with Cboe.A functioning derivatives market could help professional traders and investors access the incredible volatility inherent in bitcoin without having to trade on unfamiliar venues that may risk anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules. It will also allow traders to hedge their cash positions in the digital currency, which to date has been difficult to do.""As the world's largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities,"" Terrence Duffy, CME's chief executive officer, said in a statement today.The creation of bitcoin futures is a key step in opening the asset to institutional investors, who currently have few opportunities, said Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. Bitcoin Investment Trust, currently one of the only avenues for investors seeking bitcoin-backed securities, is trading at a premium of more than 30 percent above net asset value. The trust, known as GBTC, is a ""physical"" fund, meaning it holds bitcoin itself.""The amount of institutional money in bitcoin now is very little because there are very few vehicles,"" Bogart said. ""If there are bitcoin futures, there can be futures-based"" exchange-traded funds.In the race for bitcoin derivatives, both CME and Cboe have lost to a startup. LedgerX won CFTC approval to offer swaps and options on bitcoin and began trading earlier this month. Volumes have been light so far. Yesterday, 103 bitcoin swaps traded on LedgerX, while nine options contracts changed hands, according to the exchange. The LedgerX options trades are physically-delivered, giving investors who hold a contract to maturity the ability to own bitcoin outright.Ari Paul, a co-founder of Blocktower Capital, said LedgerX is starting out slowly on purpose. ""DRW is a market maker there,"" Paul said. ""There's pretty low volume. A million dollars a day. I do expect them to have a lot of volume very soon. They are intelligently ramping up.""Many investors who want to can't maintain ownership of bitcoin now, what's known as custody, ""either for regulatory reasons or because it's scary and hard,"" Paul said. But in a regulated market like futures that doesn't become an issue. ""The ability to easily short allows for market neutral strategies and makes high-frequency trading much easier. That draws a lot of attention from hedge funds and the traditional finance world.""CME and Cboe face challenges to win over investors to their bitcoin futures. If the underlying pricing is unsound that could steer people aways, said Mark Williams, a finance lecturer at Boston University's Questrom School of Business.""The concern is that CME will attempt to treat bitcoin like a corn or wheat future when this commodity is in a highly risky class of its own,"" Williams said. ""One of the major spots to buy and sell bitcoin are through unregulated bucket shop exchanges located outside of the reach of U.S. regulators."" He noted that since 2009, almost half of these types of exchanges included Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin market, have gone bust. ""CME has no other commodity future that looks like or behaves like bitcoin. To me this means trouble.""Jon West, head trader at digital asset brokerage Omega One, said the amount of daily margin CME and Cboe require will be a key ingredient. If it's too high ""then it's not very useful for hedging because you need to have so much money in your account,"" he said. CME should take it slow as it designs its contract, he said. ""It's a very complex asset with a lot going on.""The creation of bitcoin futures should make it easier to create an exchange-traded fund based on the digital asset. Yet so far that's been a much harder task. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March rejected a bitcoin ETF proposed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — the co-creators of the Gemini exchange — saying necessary surveillance-sharing agreements were too difficult given that ""significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,"" according to the agency.CME is a giant in trading with products including futures on the S&P 500, oil and gold, and customer connections all around the world. The timing of the decision is a bit of a surprise. Just a month ago, CME President Bryan Durkin said on Bloomberg Television that ""I really don't see us going forward with a futures contract in the very near future.""Under Duffy's leadership it has pulled back from business interests that didn't align with its historic role as a futures powerhouse, such as shutting down its European operations and exiting credit-default swap clearing. Its resistance to bitcoin futures was seen as aligned with Duffy's vision of keeping the company's focus on what it has always done well.""I'm a little concerned about the fact that both of those futures contracts are cash settled,"" said Garrett See, chief executive officer of DV Chain, a sister company of trading firm DV Trading, which trades cryptocurrencies. The Cboe contract will be settled using auctions on the Gemini exchange. See said there has not been a lot of volume in those auctions, so he raised the question of what happens if an auction fails, or there's not enough volume to keep it from being manipulated.""I'm really excited to see derivatives come into the space,"" See said. ""I see it as a great step, but in an ideal world I'd really like to see physical delivery"" in futures.Another benefit is the increased regulation that will come with bitcoin futures, Omega One's West said. ""Futures trading should deter some black market business and push it into more regulated places,"" he said.

And while the Fed isn't dismissing the potential risk that Bitcoin could pose, Yellen said it's unlikely to spark a major crisis.""So undoubtedly, there are individuals who could lose a lot of money if Bitcoin were to fall in price, but I really don't see that as creating a full-blown financial stability risk,"" she said.Prior to Yellen's comments, Bitcoin and its futures contracts took a sharp turn lower, bringing down related stocks as well.Bitcoin slid 3.4% to $16.591.72, according to CoinDesk, after flattening out earlier, while Cboe's (CBOE) futures tumbled 5.5% to close at $17.055, after being down just slightly earlier.Other stocks in the cryptocurrency space also sold off. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) plunged 18%, Square (SQ) lost 5%, and Marathon Patent Group (MARA) fell 2%. But Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an investment vehicle that tracks Bitcoin, rallied 2.7%, and Overstock (OSTK) leapt 14%.The drop underscores the volatility in the cryptocurrency market as more investors show interest in it. The SEC has recently urged caution for anyone considering investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. UBS' global chief economist this week called the cryptocurrency the ""bubble to end all bubbles.""RELATED:Overstock Founder Could Sell Business To Fund Blockchain Property VentureBitcoin Futures Soar In Debut; These Crypto Stock Plays Jump

The SEC recently advised caution when investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.If you miss a buy opportunity the first time, a second one could be lurking just around the corner.First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend (FGD) set up a chance to buy shares on Thursday as it bounced off its 50-day moving average. It's still in potential buy range from the rebound. But it's also close to a 26.20 cup-base entry, which sets up another opportunity. The ETF has made small gains in between some of the bases it's cleared as it advances along the 50-day line.The $497.7 million fund, which tracks the Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index, marked its 10th anniversary last month. To be considered for inclusion in the index, companies must pay a current dividend, have a current-year dividend-per-share ratio greater than or equal to its five-year average ratio, and have a five-year average payout ratio of 60% or less for U.S. and European companies and 80% or less for all other countries. They must also have a three-month daily average trading volume of at least $3 million.The resulting stocks are ranked by dividend yield. The top 100 highest-yielding stocks make the index. Weightings for individual holding are capped at 10%.Greater Europe accounted for nearly 50% of assets, with the U.K. making up about 14% of that, according to Morningstar Direct. North America and Greater Asia represented roughly 25% each. FGD's top holdings as of Dec. 11 included Waddell & Reed Financial (WDR), Guess (GES) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA). Finland's Fortum, the U.K.'s easyJet and France's Natixis are also among its biggest holdings.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.The fund's year-to-date return of 15.7% through Dec. 12 trails the S&P 500's 21.1% gain. Its average annual returns over the longer haul also lag the benchmark index. But its 3.9% annualized dividend yield is well above the S&P 500's average 1.8% payout.The ETF carries a 0.58% expense ratio.Tuesday's pick, iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), remains in potential buy range from a recent rebound off its 50-day line.RELATED:Apple Dips But Dow Hits New High; Bitcoin Ignores 'Bubble' TalkApple, Disney Lift Dow To Record Close; Will This Hurt Bitcoin?New Innovator IBD ETF Leaders Fund Geared To Capture Market TrendsCheck Out This List Of IBD Dividend Leaders

The futures contract, which expires in January, soared 20% to $18,550 in late-afternoon trade. The cryptocurrency's price was recently near $17,200, according to CoinDesk. While the futures launch was seen as a move toward Bitcoin's legitimacy, it could have a ""material negative impact"" on the digital currency's price as investors potentially move to futures and out of Bitcoin, Munster said in a research note.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) surged more than 12%.Sector rotation is underway as stock market leadership has shifted from high tech to builders and financials over the past few months.The top sector fund, iShares US Home Construction (ITB), gained 25.5% during the three months through Dec. 5.

Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and NVR (NVR).The other YTD outperformer is VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals (REMX), with a 61.7% YTD return as of Dec. 5. It came in fourth based on a three-month return of 17.2%. Shares slipped below the 50-day moving average, but could set up a buy opportunity on a solid move above the line. REMX broke out from a cup base in late July and rallied 39% to its Nov. 29 intraday high.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) came in second with a three-month return of 17.4%. It has been under pressure much of the year — it's down 13.4% YTD.

217,CBOE,"Bitcoin just passed $11,000, and a bid by the world's largest futures exchange to make it even more mainstream is probably inevitable.But that doesn't mean U.S. regulators will let trading resemble the Wild West.Since CME Group (CME) announced last month it would bring Bitcoin to the derivatives market, the company has been in heavy negotiations with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While the agency has limited power to halt CME's plans — or a proposal from Chicago rival Cboe Global Markets Inc. (CBOE) — it is demanding changes.The CFTC has been working with the companies to ""address various issues, and to change some aspects of the contracts,"" Erica Elliott Richardson, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement. ""We expect that outstanding issues will be resolved in the near future,"" she added, without providing specifics.Bitcoin is on a tear in 2017, an 11-fold surge that took off even more after CME Chief Executive Officer Terrence Duffy announced in October that the company would offer futures trading by the end of the year. The move is considered key to Wall Street's broader embrace of the crypotcurrency, likely enabling increased speculation and — perhaps someday — products such as exchange traded funds.Still, Bitcoin's jump has been met with caution in some circles, and outright dismissal in others. Vanguard Group Inc. founder John Bogle advised investors on Tuesday to avoid the virtual currency ""like the plague,"" while JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon has called it an asset bubble and a fraud.Under U.S. law, exchanges like CME, which profit from increased trading volumes, can approve new futures contracts themselves. The process, which is used in most cases, is known as self-certification and involves sending a written confirmation to the CFTC that the contract complies with relevant rules. Often, agency officials will engage in a back-and-forth with a company.Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ) also intends to introduce Bitcoin futures and is planning to roll them out next year, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussion a private matter.Spokesmen for CME and Nasdaq declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Cboe didn't respond to a request for comment.CME and Cboe have provided the CFTC with draft terms for contracts governing Bitcoin futures, said Elliott Richardson, the agency spokeswoman. She added that ""concerns about Bitcoin futures expressed by some market participants"" have been a factor in the CFTC's discussions with the companies.Earlier this month, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairman of Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR), wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that Bitcoin's large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn't be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives. An outsize loss on the digital currency could cripple a firm, preventing it from meeting its obligations to pay out on all sorts of contracts.""A large cryptocurrency price move that destabilizes members that clear cryptocurrencies will destabilize the clearing organization itself,"" wrote Peterffy, whose firm is a CME clearing member. That could impair ""its ability to satisfy its fundamental obligation to pay the winners and collect from the losers on the other products in the same clearing pool,"" he said.The CFTC has been reviewing CME's and Cboe's plans for managing risks associated with Bitcoin futures and collateral requirements, said Elliott Richardson. Cboe's contracts will be cleared by Options Clearing Corp., while CME will clear its own futures. CME has estimated that initial margin on the contracts — or the amount of collateral set aside relative to the value of a trade — may be as high as 30%, an unusually high amount.""Once the contracts are launched, commission staff will engage in a variety of risk-monitoring and oversight activities,"" said the CFTC's Elliott Richardson. ""These activities include monitoring and stress-testing positions and observing and analyzing open interest, initial margin requirements, and variation margin payments.""

223,CBOE,"As the cryptocurrency market cap cracks the $100 billion barrier, digital cash like bitcoin has become increasingly difficult for finance's old guard to ignore.XGoldman Sachs (GS) in a note this week outlined the basics of bitcoin investing to clients. CBOE Holdings (CBOE) last week said it planned to debut its own bitcoin futures. Fidelity Investments on Wednesday said it partnered with Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, in a test project that allows most customers to view data on Fidelity.com which shows the digital cash they hold on that exchange.""This integration demonstrates the continued commitment of traditional financial institutions to adopt digital assets and widen access for customers,"" Coinbase said in a blog post about the Fidelity test.But actually allowing clients to trade bitcoin? That could take some time for the nation's largest financial institutions.Even as bigger investors step into the bitcoin arena, regulations across the world are inconsistent, observers say. Access to an exchange where someone can trade bitcoin depends on geographic location. Different states have different license requirements. Regulatory agencies might have different rules around trading cryptocurrency from nation to nation.Goldman, in its note, also pointed out that the market was still relatively small and subject to whipsaw price swings, but that investors could use block trading for bigger orders.""What the big players and the reputable companies need is, in particular, a legal and regulatory stable environment,"" said Marco Khron, CFO of Genesis Mining, a bitcoin mining company. ""They are reluctant also because, or in part because, some of it is kind of a new area for them.""Bitcoin and blockchain — the ledger technology that underpins bitcoin transactions — are ""emerging from their infancy, but mass adoption is still many years away,"" Hadley Stern, senior vice president and managing director at Fidelity's R&D unit, Fidelity Labs, said in a statement on Wednesday.Still, Coinbase Partnerships Lead Kristen Stone, in an email, said the company has seen a ""significant uptick"" in interest from bigger financial players. The company said that over the past six months, financial firms like hedge funds and proprietary trading firms have started trading bitcoin and ether, another digital currency. Many were still exploring the possibilities, but a few had started to test strategies in the market, she said.""As bitcoin liquidity increases, I expect that major US banks would also become interested in exploring the space,"" she said.The moves from the larger financial institutions come during an eventful few weeks for bitcoin. After a dispute over the best way to speed transaction-processing, a portion of the bitcoin community this month spun off Bitcoin Cash, an offshoot of bitcoin. Bitcoin surged to a record high earlier this week, while Bitcoin Cash nose-dived, possibly as more traders flocked to bitcoin or returned to it after waiting out the split, an analyst told Bloomberg.Bitcoin's prices can be sensitive, twitching higher or lower depending on when a bigger investor makes a move. Perception also goes a long way.""People's impression of how valuable this is, because the market is still fairly young, is more important than, let's say, when you're trading equities or certain fixed income, or traditional and regulated asset classes,"" said Lex Sokolin, global director, fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.That proneness to volatility has attracted traders with an appetite for risk. Bitcoin also tends to move independently from stocks and bonds. The currency is also seen as a cushion against political turmoil, given its ""decentralized structure,"" according to a statement from crypto-asset broker Bitcoin Suisse.Banks' adoption of blockchain, the ledger technology that is the basis for bitcoin transactions, has already been widespread. At least one bank has become more open to trading bitcoin.Switzerland's Falcon Private Bank said last month that it got the OK from regulators to allow clients to buy, sell and hold bitcoin through the bank. The bank will be working with Bitcoin Suisse to provide that service to clients.Meanwhile, the currency continues to attract investment firms sometimes backed by more well-known, deep-pocketed names. The Digital Currency Group has gotten investment money from Mastercard (MA) and Bain Capital Ventures. Pantera Capital, another cyrptocurrency-centric firm, has a bitcoin investment fund that has been backed by the likes of Fortress Investment Group.Harmonizing regulations could take time. Fraud and security remain concerns for traditional investors.The SEC in July said that U.S. securities law ""may apply"" to offers of digital assets like popular Initial Coin Offerings, which raise funds via digital assets. But the cryptocurrency market could claim more victims before solid rules are established.""I think the question is: How much money do people first need to lose in order for a regulator to step in?"" Sokolin said.Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) declined to answer questions about their plans for bitcoin trading. JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for an interview.But Goldman analysts, in their note to clients, signaled that cryptocurrencies are no longer a fringe, cyberpunk endeavor.""Indeed the debate has shifted from the legitimacy of the 'fiat of the internet' to how fast new entrants are raising funds,"" Goldman analysts said in a recent note that contained an FAQ to clients.""Whether or not you believe in the merit of investing in cryptocurrencies (you know who you are) real dollars are at work here and warrant watching especially in light of the growing world of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fundraising that now exceeds Internet Angel and Seed investing,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), an exchange traded fund tailored to the price of the digital currency, rose 10% in the stock market today.RELATED:Frustrated JPMorgan CEO Unleashes This Tirade On U.S. 'Stupidity'Here Is The First Bank To Warn On The Q3 Trading Environment

224,CBOE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were mixed early Friday, following broad-based selling Thursday.XIn Thursday's trading, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages. Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Sina (SINA), Morgan Stanley (MS), Square (SQ) and Qualys (QLYS) were among the many leading stocks falling below recent buy points Thursday, with Square and other top stocks breaking through 50-day support. Some recent breakouts are struggling to hang on, such as Netflix (NFLX).Nvidia late Thursday reported blowout Q2 earnings and bullish Q3 revenue guidance, though some cited concerns over Q2 data center revenue. Nvidia shares tumbled more than 7% Friday morning, after big losses on Thursday before results. Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP) was a different story with the same ending. Snap's adjusted loss, revenue, user growth and average revenue per user missed forecasts, sending shares crashing 13% toward record lows.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.1% below fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.3% against fair value while Dow futures were essentially flat.Asian markets retreated, with China's Shanghai composite off 1.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 2%. In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE lost 1.2%, Germany's Dax 0.3% and France's CAC-40 1.1%.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. Due to the negative action Thursday and in recent days for the major averages and leading stocks, the market direction has been downgraded to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend.""So what should you do as an investor now?Distribution days are piling up rapidly on the Nasdaq composite, signaling institutional selling.In isolation, many top stocks don't look that bad. Apple fell 3.6% on Thursday to 155.32, back below a 165.75 flat-base entry. If markets improve, Apple could easily regain that entry. But combine that with Nvidia, Square, Electronic Arts (EA) and others that have sunk back into bases, and the overall trend does not look favorable.Netflix is technically back in buy range after sinking 3.8% Thursday. But after two days of selling in above-average volume, Netflix is close to round-tripping from its late-July post-earnings breakout. Netflix fell 1.3% to 166.95 early Friday, right at the 166.97 entry.The market is not in a correction. But consider taking profits in winning stocks. Don't let a hefty gain turn into a loser.

233,CBOE,"Stock futures fell early Friday, as Amazon.com (AMZN) retreated on a big earnings miss.Nasdaq 100 futures skidded 0.7% vs. fair value, near their worst levels of the overnight session. S&P 500 index futures slid 0.35%. Dow industrials futures retreated 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.55% intraday Friday, China's Shanghai composite lost a fraction and Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 0.5%.XOn Thursday, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index reversed lower from record highs, though they finished off the session's worst levels. The Dow industrials closed higher Thursday on Verizon (VZ), Merck (MRK) and Boeing (BA),The sell-off tested many leading techs, including Apple (AAPL) Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).IBD'S TAKE: Stocks have been rising strongly for several months, so investors have grown complacent. The CBOE Volatility Index, the market's fear gauge, has been falling to all-time lows. Long-time VIX lows are often associated with at least short-term market tops, and sometimes long-term tops.Looking ahead to Friday night, Tesla (TSLA) will host a ""handover party"" for 30 Model 3 sedans.Amazon's second-quarter revenue rose 25% to $38 billion, the second straight quarter of accelerating growth and slightly beating forecasts. But the e-commerce giant's earnings tumbled 78% to 40 cents a share, far below analyst forecasts for $1.40 according to Zacks Investment Research. Amazon's third-quarter operating income guidance wasn't great either.Amazon fell 3.1% to 1,013.50 in late trading. Take that with an extra pinch of salt. Overnight stock moves often aren't confirmed by regular trading, and Amazon's results often leave investors and analysts uncertain initially. Still, the after-hours action suggests that Amazon is in danger of undercutting a 1,016.60 flat-base buy point.Amazon's breakout came on lackluster volume. And it's a late-stage breakout, which is more likely to fail.Apple fell 0.9% to 150.56 in Thursday's session, recovering from an intraday low to 147.30, below its 50-day moving average around 149. Apple, a Dow Jones industrial average component, did drift to around 150 in late trading. It's the second time in a week that Apple has tested that key support level but is closing above it.Alphabet, meanwhile, slid 1.3% to 952.51. For the third straight session the Google parent tried to close above its 50-day line but could not. Alphabet topped second-quarter views late Monday, but the FANG stock reported higher traffic acquisition costs, or what it pays partner sites to carry its ads. Some analysts cited a revised search deal with Apple as a possible culprit.Microsoft fell intraday to 72.32, dropping below its 72.99 buy point, cleared on July 17.

Tesla is still trying to recover from its early July plunge in massive volume, amid concerns over the Model 3 rollout and lackluster Model S and Model X production and deliveries.Tesla is throwing a party Friday night to give an initial batch of 30 Model 3 sedans to customers.

234,CBOE,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point. Edwards Lifesciences has fallen back below a buy point in a big cup-with-handle base, undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), D.R. Horton (DHI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Fortinet (FTNT) are among the many other top-rated stocks set to report earnings Wednesday.RELATED:Texas Instruments, AMD Beat Q2 Targets, Guide HigherAT&T Q2 Adjusted Profit Beats, Pay-TV Video Subscribers FallWill Facebook Earnings Support Its Strong Stock Growth?The Big Picture: Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials LeadHow To Win With Growth Stocks Like Netflix, Nvidia During Earnings

Some estimates have $8.25. Either way, it would be a slim decline from $8.42 a year earlier. Complicating the earnings report will be a $2.74 billion fine from the European Union.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks barely dipped Friday even as the CBOE Volatility Index hit a record low. Longtime lows in the volatility index, or VIX, are often associated with short-term or even long-term market tops.Net revenue should rise to $20.825 billion, up 19% vs. a year earlier.While Alphabet gets the vast majority of its revenue in online advertising, cloud computing has become a growth area. Amazon may be looking over its shoulder regarding its dominant Amazon Web Services division in regards to Google and Microsoft (MSFT), which reported booming cloud gains last Thursday.Alphabet has a Composite Rating of 95, which means it outperforms 95% of all stocks based on a variety of proprietary IBD ratings including earnings. All-time winning stocks often have Composite Ratings of 95 or better near the start of big runs.Alphabet shares rose 0.1% to 993.35 on Friday stock market trading, about 2% below a new flat-base buy point of 1,008.71. An aggressive investor could see 994.09 as alternative entry.Alphabet is up 25% in 2017, but that makes it a laggard next to fellow FANG internet giants Amazon (up 35%), Facebook (43%) and Netflix (NFLX) (52%).Facebook reports earnings on Wednesday while Amazon is due Thursday.The design software maker is expected to report a 14% EPS gain to 33 cents with revenue up about 5.5% to $478 million.Cadence Design has a Composite Rating of 97.

236,CBOE,"The CBOE Volatility Index, the market's fear gauge, fell to an all-time low on Friday, but investors shrugged as the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite barely declined. The last notable VIX low on June 9 helped trigger the big tech stock reversal, with Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) along with the FANG stocks of Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), leading the way.XThe Volatility Index estimates expected volatility based on S&P 500 index option prices. Commonly known by its ticker, the VIX highlights intense fear or complacency in the market. Low VIX readings are a sign that investors are especially bullish. Excessively bullish readings are often marked by at least short-term market tops.The VIX fell to 9.30 intraday, undercutting the 1993 all-time low of 9.31, before closing at 9.36.  The fear gauge didn't plunge on Friday — though it did make its move near the close — but had been moving steady lower since July 6.The market barely reacted on Friday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 down less than 0.1%. Apple did test its 50-day moving average, but closed pennies lower. Meanwhile, Nvidia and Netflix hit record highs. Facebook and Amazon are right at record highs while Alphabet is setting up for a possible breakout.On July 9, the Nasdaq and many top techs were at all-time highs when low VIX reading of 9.37. Techs sold off hard that day and on June 10, and continued to drift lower over the next few weeks. The VIX hit a short-term high on June 29, when the S&P 500 index bottomed and a slightly lower top on July 6, when the Nasdaq marked a low.But the major averages didn't really fall that far or for long. The S&P 500 dipped 2% from its June 19 peak, while the Nasdaq lost just 4.1% from its June 9 top. Even the big-cap Nasdaq 100 only retreated 5.4%. And the major averages quickly bounced back to new highs.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. It's understandable why investors have become complacent. The bull market is more than eight years old, with big gains coming over the last several months, especially since Election Day. They've heard so many dire warnings, from Brexit and Donald Trump to, yes, low VIX readings, that turned out to be nonevents or the catalyst for big market gains. Of the FANG+ stocks, Alphabet is up 25% in 2017, and it's the laggard. Apple is up 30%, Amazon 35%, Facebook 43% and Netflix 52%. Nvidia, meanwhile, is up a whopping 63% since May 9.But just as with the housing boom of the past decade, the idea that the stock market can only go up is dangerous.Consider the psychology: Stocks rally as investors turn upbeat and pull money from the sidelines. But if ""everyone"" is bullish and fully invested, who's left to buy? If the market assumes everything will go well, what news will propel equities higher?Consider history: Sometimes extremely low VIX readings signal much bigger market shifts. The VIX hit a low of 9.39 in December 2006. Over the next 22 months, the VIX surged to 89.53 in October 2008, as the global financial crisis peaked and stocks collapsed.The December 1993 VIX low also spurred a big rise in the fear gauge. The major averages had a big correction in 1994 as the Federal Reserve raised rates in a preemptive move against inflation.Extremely low fear is one more reason to be cautious. The current market rally has generally come on below-average volume, with indicates lackluster conviction by institutional investors. And it's the middle of earnings season, with Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet on tap next week, followed by Apple on Aug. 1.Is Friday's record VIX low a sign of a short- or long-term market move? Don't try to predict. Pay attention to the major indexes and leading stocks and act appropriately.RELATED:Fear Gauge Flashed Extreme Bullishness Just Before Tech SelloffThe Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear ItselfPsychological Market IndicatorsThese Three FANG Giants Are Ready To Report EarningsFor Earnings Trades, These 4 Names Look The Most Actionable

239,CBOE,"As a much-vaunted Trump reflation trade fizzled and the U.S. president found himself embroiled in controversy, the big market surprise in the first half was that volatility actually fell.Traders who shorted the VIX saw their bets pay off as the gauge plunged 20%, taking its quarterly average to the lowest level since 2006. The question is, how long can it last?JPMorgan Chase is warning of more market turbulence as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan begin paring their economic stimulus, while Goldman Sachs Group says net positions in exchange-traded products favor long bets on volatility over short. In other words, investors are bracing for less-stable times. These charts show how:As the CBOE Volatility Index continued to edge lower this year, investors increasingly paid up to protect against a rebound, sending the cost of calls vs. puts to the highest level since October 2015.VIX options volume has surged this year, with an average of almost 680,000 contracts changing hands on average each day. Nearly 2.7 calls traded for each put, the most since 2007. At around 4-to-1, the call-to-put ratio is at its highest since September 2014.The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX) ETN, the most popular security that gains when volatility rises, had inflows in June for a fifth month out of six this year. Investors have reduced their bets against the exchange-traded note, sending the short interest to 23% of shares outstanding from 48% in March, according to IHS Markit data.The VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term (TVIX) ETN and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures (UVXY) ETF, two levered products, also saw inflows in June. The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), which profits with falling volatility, had its first monthly withdrawals since February, even as it continued its advance. It's gained 76% this year.But while hedgers are putting on strategies to protect against market turmoil, the crucial question of timing remains. Low correlation has been key to subdued swings and is one of the factors that Morgan Stanley monitors to detect a shift in the volatility regime.For now, Goldman Sachs recommends being selective when buying options as a large jump in volatility is needed to offset the carry cost of purchasing contracts. While the VIX rebounded in June — the month in which the index recorded the highest number of monthly gains in the last 10 years — it's fallen in three of the past four Julys. It gained 3.2% at 10:44 a.m. in New York.

Excessively bullish readings are often marked by at least short-term market tops.The VIX fell to 9.37 intraday, quickly followed by an abrupt and powerful selloff in the Nasdaq and leading tech stocks. Apple (AAPL), a Dow industrials component, fell 3.9%, closing just above its 50-day moving average after sinking as low as 146.02. Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are all down more than 3% while Nvidia (NVDA) has lost 6.5%.The VIX has rebounded for a double-digit percentage gain in afternoon action before closing up 5.6% to 10.73.It's understandable why investors have been blase. The current bull market has been running for eight years, with momentum accelerating in recent months. The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite, Dow Jones industrial average and small-cap Russell 2000 index hitting all-time highs Friday morning on the stock market today even after British elections created more uncertainty about Brexit. Investors have heard so many warnings, from Brexit to Donald Trump, that turned out to be nonevents or the catalyst for big market gains. Apple, Tesla (TSLA), the FANG stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet are all up more than 20% in 2017. Tesla is up some 70% this year alone, with Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all up about 30% or so, with Alphabet the ""laggard."" Bank stocks such as Citigroup (C) are breaking out or clearing key technical levels this week.But as investors have ever more complacent about possible risks, you should be worried.Consider the market psychology. Stocks rally as investors turn upbeat and pull money from the sidelines. But if ""everyone"" is bullish and fully invested, who's left to buy? If the market assumes everything will go well, what news will propel equities higher?IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. The last time the VIX hit a low, on May 9, the fear gauge nearly doubled by May 18, with major market averages suffering a sharp drop on May 17, and leaders such as Apple and Facebook also taking hits and bank stocks tumbling. Of course, that market fear faded quickly, and stocks have sprinted to new highs.Sometimes extremely low VIX readings signal much bigger market shifts. The VIX today undercut the December 2006 low of 9.39. Over the next 22 months, the VIX surged to 89.53 in October 2008, as the global financial crisis peaked and stocks collapsed.The December 1993 VIX also spurred a big rise in the gauge. The major averages suffered a big correction in 1994 as the Federal Reserve raised rates in a preemptive move against inflation.Is Friday's VIX low the start of a significant market move or a short-term shift? Don't try to predict. Pay attention to the major indexes and leading stocks and act appropriately.RELATED:The Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear ItselfTesla Is On A Tear, But Other Auto Stocks Face An 'Unprecedented' Risk5 Ways To Get Ready For The Market's Next TurnGraphics Chip Maker Nvidia Soars To Record High, But ReversesForget FANG: Brokerages Add Apple, Microsoft To Create FAAMG

264,CBOE,"XMajor U.S. index-tracking ETFs were mixed Friday as Nvidia (NVDA) sent the chip sector reeling.The stock indexes had taken off to early gains after shrugging off the surprise U.K. election outcome. British Prime Minister Theresa May lost the Parliament majority after a national election she had called to help strengthen her position.Small-cap stocks led the upside with iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) rallied 1%, on track for a new closing high. The ETF cleared a 141.92 flat-base buy point.SPDR S&P Midcap 400 (MDY) also broke out, climbing past a 320.58 flat-base entry. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) staged a breakout too, advancing 0.3% to take out a 211.69 buy point. Pfizer (PFE) and  JPMorgan (JPM) were the top gainers in the underlying blue-chip index, but Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) sank.Chip funds reversed sharply lower as iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) crashed more than 3% each. Component stock Nvidia reversed from a new high to a 6% loss after short-seller Citron Research said the graphics chip designer will fall to 130.

266,CBOE,"Graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) soared to its second record high in as many days on Friday after an investment bank said it could benefit from a host of new markets, including self-driving cars, but then suddenly reversed after a short-seller predicted a drop in shares.XNvidia had jumped 5.4% to an all-time high of 168.50 intraday on the stock market today but switched gears after Citron Research's note predicting a drop to $130.Nvidia shares closed down 6.5% to 149.60 Friday, part of a broad, sharp sell-off among leading tech stocks. Nvidia shares had climbed 50% year to date through Thursday's close. The stock broke out of a 13-week consolidation period with a buy point of 121.02 on May 10.Short-seller Citron, which said that it was once high on Nvidia's prospects, said there is weakness in the company's core gaming business. It notes that Citigroup recently upped its price target on shares to 180.""In the recent frenzy in Nvidia shares, it has added more to its market cap than the total valuation of its competitor (Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)). Now it is fueled by an irresponsibly bullish number from Citi,"" Citron said.Nvidia stock has received price-target hikes from four Wall Street firms over the past two days.On Friday, Argus Research kept a buy rating on Nvidia and raised its price target to 175 from 140. RBC Capital Markets maintained its outperform rating on Nvidia and upped its price target to 175 from 150. And Susquehanna Financial Group on Friday reiterated its neutral rating on Nvidia stock because of valuation, though it raised its price target 140 from 110.Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said Nvidia stock could reach 200 if it increases its graphics processor unit (GPU) attach rates with virtual-reality ready computers and gains share with automakers in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).In addition to virtual reality adoption and ADAS wins, another possible catalyst for Nvidia is growth in e-sports, or competitive video game playing, Rolland said. E-sports requires PCs with high-end graphics processors.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes nine chip-industry players such as Nvidia and Applied Materials.Downside risks for Nvidia include Intel (INTC) making inroads into professional graphics and Advanced Micro Devices gaining market share in gaming GPUs, he said.On Thursday, Citigroup increased its price target on Nvidia to 180 from 145 on expectations that its sales to data center customers will continue rising.""Looking forward, we believe (the) stock is not pricing in continued growth in data center sales,"" Citigroup analyst Atif Malik said in a report. Citigroup's ""bull case"" scenario has the stock hitting 300 on data center, automotive and other opportunities. Malik rates Nvidia stock as buy.Investment bank Needham reiterated its buy rating on chipmaker MaxLinear (MXL) and raised its price target to 34 from 32.Needham analyst Quinn Bolton increased his sales and earnings targets for MaxLinear to reflect its May 12 purchase of Exar.MaxLinear stock lost 4.6% to 30.32 on Friday.

267,CBOE,"Apple (AAPL) led a decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, but not all indexes slumped. As of 2 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average held a thin gain of around 0.1% while the S&P 500 edged nearly 0.1% lower in the aftermath of shock election results in the U.K.Meanwhile, the big winner of the day: small caps, yet again, boosted in large part by community and regional banks. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied more than 1.1% and is poised for a solid weekly advance on top of last week's 1.7% rebound.The Nasdaq composite, initially up more than 0.4%, backtracked more than 1.6% lower by around 2 p.m. ET and got as low as 6218. Given that the composite rallied 2.1% and 1.5% in the prior two weeks, a down week would not be a surprise.Volume on the Nasdaq is running sharply higher vs. the same time on Thursday — boosting the chances that the premier growth index will tack on a new distribution day, or bout of unusually heavy profit-taking by institutional investors.Among those IBD industry groups and subgroups rising 2% or more in the stock market today, just two hailed from the top 40: foreign banks and plastics makers. Beaten down stocks including heavy construction, department stores, metal products distribution, oil and gas drilling, and Southwest banks jumped 3% to 4%.Meanwhile, chipmaking and chip equipment firms led the downside with groupwide losses of more than 3%, topped only by IBD's telecom fiber-optic industry group, sinking more than 4%.Back to Apple, the stock fell 3% to 150.34 and dived to as low as 148.43 intraday. The current market leader is hovering just above its 10-week moving average near 148.81 (please see the weekly chart below). The iPhone and iPad giant may provide a new follow-on entry point for savvy investors who had bought at the original buy point of 118.12. (IBD covered that potential buy point in an earlier Stock Market Today column before the actual breakout.) That correct buy point stems from a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a cup with handle.Apple also generated a secondary buy point near 140 as it eased gently to its 10-week moving average during the weeks ended April 14 and 21. A first or second pullback to the 10-week moving average, followed by a strong rally in heavy volume, offers a fresh opportunity for investors to buy or add shares.Note that during the first test of the 10-week line, Apple had already rallied past a 141.12 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern, which also provides a chance for a holder to add a small amount of shares to bolster the position and be in position to compound gains in an individual stock.In a three-weeks-tight or four-weeks-tight, the weekly price close must be within 1% to 1.5% of the prior week's close.Apple's IBD SmartSelect ratings have sharply improved since its January breakout. Today, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the megacap tech owns a respectable 91 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, a 72 EPS Rating, a 92 Relative Price Strength, and a B+ for Accumulation/Distribution.On the downside, Snap (SNAP) sank 4% to 18.14 in fast turnover. The money-losing Snapchat site owner is on course to post an all-time closing low and is close to giving up all of its gains since going public March 2 at 17 a share.Venice Beach, Calif.-based Snap has a float of 364 million shares and 1.16 billion shares outstanding.Snap's RS Rating of 9 and B+ Accumulation Rating may seem in conflict with each other. However, keep in mind that the RS Rating generally covers 12 months of price action. Snap has traded barely more than three months.Since late May, Snap has enjoyed just one up day in above-average volume, indicating that institutional demand for the stock is questionable.RELATED:Will Snap See Further Weakness, And Can Apple Break Out Again?CBOE Volatility Index Hits Lowest Since 1993: Why You Should WorryHow To Spot Major Market Tops: Here's The Simple MethodWhat Is A Cup With Handle, And How Does It Help You Make Money In Stocks?

268,CBOE,"XStock bulls tilted toward smaller companies on Tuesday as the Russell 2000, up at one point nearly 0.8%, heavily outperformed its large-cap brethren indexes.The S&P 500 slumped 0.1% on the back of heavy selling in the semiconductor sector. Intel (INTC) was off just 0.3%, but at 35.67 the processors giant is barely hanging on to its still-rising 200-day moving average. Intel's drop helped weigh on the Dow Jones industrial average, which finished down fractionally and got help from at least four components that rose 0.5% or more.The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, lost 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.4%. The Russell 2K finished 0.5% ahead, but is trailing the 500 and Nasdaq in terms of year-to-date returns.At 1376, the Russell 2000 is up just 1.4% since Jan. 1, vs. gains of 9% for the Nasdaq composite and 5.1% for the 500.Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. Monday, according to preliminary data. Thus, a distribution day will likely be recorded for the Nasdaq, which fell more than 0.2%, while the S&P 500 escaped the addition of another distribution, or bout of unusually intense professional selling.Investor fear, at least among options traders, rose amid headlines expressing concerns over nuclear threats from North Korea as well as the frosty ties between the U.S. and Russia. The CBOE Market Volatility index, or the VIX, jumped more than 8% and hit as high as 15.88, marking the highest level since November.Fear is good for bull markets, as it helps keep cash on the sidelines or forces some investors to sell. These traders may eventually return into the market, giving a future boost to equities.In a curious divergence, advancing stocks outweighed losers, especially in a big way for the NYSE (18 to 11). Numerous building-oriented stocks helped pace the upside. Virginia-based homebuilder NVR (NVR) reversed off its intraday low and rose more than 2.3% to 2,115 in above-average volume.Meanwhile, two relatively new issues also feed off the building sector and have been showing good chart action. Both the February 2014 IPO Installed Building Products (IBP) and Jeld-Wen (JELD,) an expert in doors and windows that debuted on the NYSE on Jan. 27, may deserve a spot on your watch list.Jeld-Wen, down 1.6% to 31.33, is finding vital buying support at the newly created 50-day moving average. Installed Building Products is extended after rising past a 44.40 flat-base entry on Feb. 27. Look for a potential pullback to the 50-day or 10-week lines.Tech IPOs are also thriving. Alibaba (BABA), a new member of IBD Leaderboard, dropped more than 1% to 110.44 on Tuesday,  but the Chinese e-commerce giant is still up sharply since clearing a 104.67 cup-with-handle buy point earlier in the year. It also formed a three-weeks-tight follow-on entry.Alibaba had earlier broken out of a solid cup-with-handle at 85.10 last year, initially in low volume. Buyers then came in strong the next several days as Alibaba reported strong quarterly results.Wall Street expects Alibaba's Q1 earnings to soar 51% to 71 cents a share.Glaukos (GKOS), formerly on IBD Leaderboard, rebounded more than 2% after a steep fall on Monday. Watch to see if the maker of an innovative nanoscale stent to treat glaucoma can hold up at its 10-week moving average.Shares have escalated more than 40% since initially breaking out of a cup with handle at 36.10 on Jan. 6.Glaukos has notched four quarters in a row of profits, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, sales rose 64% to $33.2 million, breaking the $30 million barrier for the first time. The Street expects the Laguna Hills, Calif., firm to lost 2 cents a share in Q1. But in FY 2017, expect Glaukos to earn 17 cents a share, then boost that figure by 200% to 51 cents in FY 2018.The small-cap medical play has 34 million shares outstanding and a 15-million-share float.Snap (SNAP) continues to struggle yet remains well above its 17 IPO price. The Snapchat operator, now at 20.70, is still nearly 30% below its all-time high of 29.44. Snap has 1.16 billion shares outstanding and a market cap of $24 billion. Sales jumped 590% last year to $404 million.Analysts have lowered their consensus estimates on Snap's net losses expected for this year (now 54 cents a share) and in 2018 (a 33-cent-per-share loss).On Wednesday, keep a lookout for data on the Atlanta Fed business inflation expectations (10 a.m. ET) and U.S. crude oil and fuel inventories (10:30 a.m. ET).RELATED:Stock Market Today: Why Snap Could Fall Back To Its IPO PriceHow To Trade Stocks And Win: Tips On Concentration And Risk By A World-Class Airplane RacerThe Income Investor: Could These 3 Dividend Plays Produce Big Gains In 2017?

269,CBOE,"Small-cap stock ETFs crushed their large-cap siblings in the postelection rally last year on hopes that President Trump would unleash the forces of growth pent-up in America. This year, they are crushing hopes.The small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) jumped 14% from Nov. 8 through December end, but has slipped 0.1% year to date. Its large-cap sibling, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), rose 5.5% over both periods.That sharp reversal of fortune for small caps was in the spotlight at the fourth annual FTSE Russell Small Cap Summit.""Our viewpoint is one of caution going forward,"" given small-cap valuations, earnings and the outlook for fiscal stimulus, said Steven DeSanctis, the SMID (Small And Midcap) strategist at Jefferies & Co.DeSanctis has been described by CBNC as ""one of the longest-running and most widely followed small-cap strategists on Wall Street."" He spoke to IBD on the heels of the summit.A comeback for small caps — companies with less than $2 billion in market capitalization, such as IBD 50 stock Nutrisystem (NTRI) — may depend on how these top trends play out, in his view and in the view of other investing experts at the FTSE Russell summit:Russell Rhoads, director of education at CBOE Options Institute, says that the index shows that investors perceive the risk for the U.S. small-cap market to be low and ""could indicate the beginning of a rotation back into small caps.""That raises concern for Rhoads given ""a market driven by sentiment and headlines."" An unanticipated event could shake the markets and smaller stocks tend to underperform when there is a pickup in risk, DeSanctis said.""I'm shocked we haven't seen a real elevation of volatility,"" he added.That is a level last seen around the time of the dot-com bubble in 2000, said Tom Goodwin, senior index research director at FTSE Russell.But he urges investors to keep P/Es in perspective, citing research that shows they explain about a third of the movement on share prices on a 10-year horizon and are even less predictive of future returns in the shorter term.""Valuations are elevated and a watch point,"" he said, ""but I wouldn't want to make too much of it.""The market's expectation of accelerating GDP growth was part of the reason why small caps ran way ahead of large caps late last year. But recently GDP estimates have moderated and the yield curve has flattened, which troubles small-cap experts.DeSanctis said: ""Smaller stocks offer the best returns over time. However in the near term, they should lag."" It may serve ETF investors well to temper expectations.But expectations for big defense spending, big infrastructure spending and big tax cuts are starting to slip. With the market pricing in reforms, the stock market rally could be in trouble if Trump fails to deliver, with small caps especially hard hit.DeSanctis is watching whether the promised economic stimulus will happen this year or become a 2018 issue.""This will really hurt those stocks that need to borrow and have debt on their balance sheets,"" DeSanctis said. ""Small-cap companies need to borrow to grow and, thus, this will hurt them specifically.""Monetary policy tightening will ring especially sweet in the ears of small-cap investors.According to FTSE Russell's Goodwin, U.S. small-cap stocks tend to perform positively over longer time frames during extended rate-tightening periods.RELATED:What Is Going On In The ETF Market?

270,CBOE,"Large-cap and megacap names dominated their small-cap peers as the stock market thrived on a broad rebound in afternoon trading Tuesday. Amid a 1.7% rebound in WTI crude oil futures, oil exploration firms helped lead the upside, and a 1-point gain by Dow 30 component Chevron (CVX) is helping the Dow Jones industrial average keep its head above the important 50-day moving average.WTI futures, helped by news about further trouble at Libya's oil-shipping ports, are currently near $48.45 a barrel, still down nearly 11% off their Feb. 23 peak of $54.45.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average accelerated gains to nearly 0.9%, practically equaling the gain by the S&P 100 index, which tracks the largest 100 companies in U.S. equity markets by market cap.The S&P 500 was also up around 0.9% amid reports that Republican leaders have vowed they will not quit at passing reforms to the Affordable Care Act, perhaps the biggest legacy from the President Obama administration. The Nasdaq composite slightly trailed with a nearly 0.7% lift. The Russell 2000 is catching up, rising more than 0.7%.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility index, a key measure of fear among index options traders, dropped nearly 6% to 11.65. On Monday, the VIX hit as high as 15.11, marking the highest level since Nov. 14.Among those giant companies, at least five names are showing excellent action after breaking out over the past five months. They deserve a close look. Home Depot (HD), a member of the Dow industrial average, sports the highest EPS Rating within the 30 components at 97. The stock, which earns a 95 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, broke out past a 137.42 saucer-with-handle entry.Home Depot may benefit from the reported rebound in demand for single-family homes among the large millennial generation, in addition to ongoing strength in the do-it-yourself home-improvement market.Home Depot is No. 14 in the IBD Big Cap 20 in the latest IBD Weekly.Please see the top of page A2 in the current IBD Weekly print edition. The ""Vital Signs"" economic shapshot of three housing industry-related graphs showed that the supply of existing homes for sale in February dropped 6.4% vs. a year ago. ""Tight supply is limiting choices and boosting prices. That's good news for new-home sales, which jumped last month to their second-best reading of the current recovery,"" IBD noted in the commentary adjacent to the charts. Visa (V) is second best in the Dow with a 96 EPS Rating, meaning that its long- and short-term earnings growth is superior to 96% of all publicly traded companies. The megacap firm is acting well following its Jan. 24 breakout past a shallow cup-with-handle-like base at 82.59.Wall Street expects Visa to post a 16% jump in fiscal second-quarter profit to 79 cents a share on an 18% bump up in revenue to $4.29 billion. For FY 2017, ending in September, analysts currently forecast EPS up 17% to $3.32 a share and revenue up 18% to $17.73 billion.Boeing (BA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also deserve close watch as all three have decent dividend yields that are higher than the 1.95% yield for the S&P 500 itself. Plus, all three stocks have shown nice advances following their own breakouts.Cisco sports the highest annualized yield among the three at 3.4%, followed by Boeing at 3.2% and JPMorgan at 2.3%.Solid earnings prospects are likely one key driver of these three stocks' current moves up.The Street sees earnings in FY 2017 rising 29% to $9.31 a share for Boeing, 4% to $6.57 for JPMorgan (followed by a 15% jump in FY 2018), and 1% to $2.38 for Cisco, which would mark the eighth straight year of increasing profits.Gold miners fell sharply and were the biggest decliners among 197 industry groups and subgroups covered by IBD. Greenwood Village, Colo.-based heavyweight Newmont Mining (NEM) slid more than 3% to 32.91 and continues to struggle since falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages on Feb. 22 and 27, respectively.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of Newmont is positive at a B-, but that's more than offset by a poor Relative Price Strength Rating of 39 on a scale of 1 to 99. In general, focus on those companies with excellent growth in sales, profits and an RS Rating of 80 or higher. Snap (SNAP) sank nearly 4% to 22.95, which is a natural pullback following strong gains in the prior six sessions.A key technical line of support and resistance for Snap may in fact be the 10-day moving average, which responds more quickly than the traditional 50-day line. For now, Snap showed bullish action when the stock burst back above the 10-day line on March 22 in the sixth highest volume in a single session since its March 2 debut.If Snap holds its recent gains, expect the 10-day line to keep rising and catch up with the stock itself. The 50-day moving average won't show up on a Snap daily chart until late May.You can see the 10-day moving average in green in all Leaderboard charts. In Leaderboard, markets writers and editors note when a sharp decline below the 10-day line following a strong breakout and gains of 10% to 15% or more can provide a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The highly popular social media firm will clearly need plenty of time and a strong rebound in order to fashion the possibility of a good breakout.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should Snap Stay On Your Watch List?Stock Market Today II: Is It Time To Add These 7 Chip Industry Leaders To Your Portfolio?Stock Market Today III: Why You Could Hold These 7 Dow-30 Stocks Longer For NowHow To Invest: First, Know The General Market Direction Via The Big PictureWhat To Buy: These Stocks Are Near The Proper Buy Zone

271,CBOE,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were flat to slightly higher early Friday morning as White House aides told GOP lawmakers that President Trump is done negotiating and wants a House vote on the ObamaCare replacement bill on Friday.It could be a key day for bank stocks such as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Dow components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).But big-cap techs Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) face key technical tests. All five are big S&P 500 index stocks.Dow industrials futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index futures climbed less than 0.1% above fair value while Nasdaq 100 futures were break-even. All were off late Thursday highs.During Thursday stock market trading, the Dow Jones industrial average erased intraday gains and closed just below break-even  after the House delayed a planned Thursday evening vote due to a lack of support. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell 0.1%.It's unclear if the House actually will vote Friday, especially if the American Health Care Act lacks sufficient support.Markets are worried that a health care defeat could derail Trump's tax cuts and other pro-growth agenda items. That's what triggered Tuesday's big stock losses. But some analysts argue that a quick American Health Care Act defeat could speed up tax cuts.The CBOE Volatility Index, the market's so-called fear gauge, hit a 2017 high on Thursday. But that's a little like saying Shaquille O'Neal is having a career year for making free throws — it's not that high. The ""VIX"" has been trading near excessive bullish levels for months.Bank stocks were searching for direction. Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs clung to slim gains Thursday, while JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (WFC) edged lower. But all are trading below their 50-day moving averages after losing that key support line in recent days.Alphabet also undercut its 50-day line Thursday, as its YouTube advertising woes are becoming a real problem. The stock fell 1.3% to 839.65. It's down nearly 4% this week, dropping below an 867.10 buy point along the way. Google's parent had climbed for nine straight sessions before that, setting a record high last Friday.Meanwhile, Netflix and Amazon are on the other side of the 50-day and 10-week lines, looking to find support there. Netflix has been rebounding from its 10-week line for a while, creating an alternative buy point around 140.Amazon fell 0.1% to 847.38, continuing a four-weeks-tight pattern with an 860.96 entry. Amazon is still in range from a prior 821.75 buy point.Hospital stocks and health insurers are among those most affected by the GOP health plans. But hospital stocks have been on the sick list for some time, while Medicaid-focused insurers such as Molina (MOH) also have struggled. Keep an eye on health insurer giants such as UnitedHealth (UNH). UnitedHealth has fallen for six straight sessions, closing Thursday at 165.29. That's pulling back to a 164.10 buy point as well as its 50-day line.Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8% intraday as the yen dropped against the dollar for the first time in several days.

272,CBOE,"Everything's fine and calm on Wall Street if you trust the market's standard fear gauge. Just one problem: The world doesn't feel so calm these days.Between an unpredictable political climate, rising interest rates and stretched valuations, there's building frustration that the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, is losing its luster as a reflection of investor anxiety. The measure, which tracks expected volatility through options pricing, sits just two points above its historical low.Taken at face value, a stubbornly low VIX is flashing signs of complacency, even as some investors fear turbulence ahead. That's not to say the VIX isn't functioning how it's supposed to. It's a function of realized volatility, not necessarily a sentiment gauge, a read on what traders are willing to pay for options — the VIX has no emotions, said Dennis Davitt, a portfolio manager at Harvest Volatility Management LLC, which oversees about $9 billion.""The VIX is what it is: a series of numbers from the S&P 500,"" said Davitt, who also helped create Credit Suisse Group AG's fear barometer in 2009. ""It's like arguing that your gas gauge is wrong. I can yell at it if I want it to be higher, but it's still going to run out of gas.""There are plenty of structural reasons for a low VIX, such as falling stock correlations and more traders selling risk premium as rates remain low. On top of that, there's evidence that the perceived calm is related to improving economic expectations. Even Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, whose fellow policy makers once lamented the suppressed level of implied volatility, said in her Wednesday news conference that the ""simple message is the economy is doing well.""Still, if that's not enough to satiate fear-analyzing desires, here are some other gauges that could be used to supplement or outright replace the VIX.Researchers at the Bank for International Settlements say the dollar is becoming the best fear gauge as its appreciation can depress demand for credit while also reflecting reduced investor appetite for the riskiest assets. Hyun Song Shin, head of research at the BIS, in a November report, said the dollar is better than the VIX as it's a truer barometer of global appetite for leverage.While trading below its one-year average, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Financial Stress Index's level of 0.1 is higher than its five-year mean. Positive readings indicate more market stress than normal, while negative ones signal less anxiety. The GFSI also takes more into account than just option pricing, and looks across asset classes. The gauge reached a four-year high of 0.85 in February 2016 amid a market slump.Despite the apparent market calm, investors have been paying up to hedge against large stock moves, a more specific measure than the VIX shows. A gauge tracking the cost of out-of-the money S&P 500 Index options has averaged 135 this year, its highest quarterly level since the final months of 2015. The CBOE SKEW Index, up 12% in March, rallied with the VIX when the U.K. voted to leave the European Union and before the November presidential election. The index is at its highest level since Brexit.Key measures of the pace of yield changes show that fluctuations have slid this year. The Merrill Option Volatility Estimate, or MOVE Index, measures swings based on one-month options for two to 30-year Treasuries and reached its lowest since October. A similar slide is seen in the CBOE/CBOT index of 10-year Treasury note volatility. The measure gives more immediate signals through of the trading day unlike the MOVE, which only updates at the end of trading.Some smaller competitors have also developed their own risk indexes in attempt to take a bite out of CBOE's market share. Take NationShares, which first launched its gauge in 2013. The Nations VolDex index focuses on at-the-money options and has plunged further than the VIX to hit an all-time low on Monday. Bats Global Markets Inc. also introduced what it calls a more robust version of the VIX last year. So far, it has closely mimicked the VIX's move down this year.The fear barometer, which tracks the cost of bearish to bullish three-month options, reached its highest level since the November election on Friday. It currently trades around its one- and five-year averages. The index hit a record before last year's Brexit vote that spurred an equity sell-off.Yet even Davitt, the Credit Suisse index's co-founder, concedes that each volatility index has its own merits, since they each take a slightly different look at trader expectations.""You need to use them in tandem,"" said Davitt. ""Any one on its own can get you into trouble.""

275,CBOE,"OPEC and its partners have seen the post-agreement oil rally evaporate as the U.S. inventory glut becomes impossible to ignore.West Texas Intermediate closed at the lowest since Nov. 29, the day before OPEC approved the first supply cuts in eight years. Crude supplies rose 8.2 million to the highest level in weekly government data since 1982. Harold Hamm, the U.S. shale oil billionaire, warned on Wednesday that the industry could ""kill"" the market if it embarks on another spending binge. The market swoon stoked the second-highest WTI options trading volume ever.Oil had fluctuated above $50 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other countries started trimming supply for six months starting Jan. 1 to reduce a global glut. While U.S. shale output has rebounded, larger-than-expected cuts elsewhere and signs of growing demand suggest stockpiles will eventually decline, according to Goldman Sachs Group.""People are nervous about the global supply-demand balance,"" Adam Sieminski, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and former head of the Energy Information Administration, said by telephone. ""Shale is coming back with $50 oil and there's uncertainty about whether OPEC and its partners are going to roll over the production agreement.""West Texas Intermediate for April delivery dropped $1, or 2%, to close at $49.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 85% above the 100-day average. The contract has tumbled 7.6% in four days.Brent for May settlement slipped 92 cents to $52.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close since Nov. 30. The global benchmark crude closed at a $2.36 premium to May WTI.""If we settle below $50 tomorrow there's a good chance that we'll come in Monday to see some liquidation,"" Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said in an interview.WTI options volume jumped to more than 550,000 on Thursday, according to preliminary Bloomberg data. Oil market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index, rose to a three-month high at the close of trading.""We're seeing a huge spike in demand for options on the move below $50 for WTI,""  Clayton Rogers, an energy derivative broker at SCS Commodities in Jersey City, N.J., said by telephone.Saudi Arabia's oil minister Khalid Al-Falih said this week global inventories are falling slower than expected, opening the door to extend the output-cut deal beyond its initial six months. Producers will meet in Vienna in May to decide on the next steps. But he insisted the kingdom wouldn't act alone.""I think there will be a rollover of the agreement, but I don't think the Saudis are going to rollover to Russia, Iran and Iraq,"" Sieminski said. ""We will have to see compliance from them.""OPEC members exceeded their pledged output reduction last month, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq told state-run news agency KUNA. Compliance by non-OPEC countries is at about 50%, he said.U.S. crude production increased for a third week to 9.09 million barrels a day, the EIA said Wednesday. The nation's output is projected to surge to a record 9.73 million barrels a day next year, according to the EIA's monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook on Tuesday.""The market was very hopeful about what OPEC was doing and that we were going to see inventories decline as a result,"" Jacques Rousseau, a managing director of the Washington-based research firm ClearView Energy Partners, said by telephone. ""The numbers from the EIA were pretty brutal.""

276,CBOE,"X   Another day, another solid gain in the President Trump bull market.

As expected by the pundits, Trump did not show any wavering in his pledge to cut taxes…
"
277,CBOE,"Here's another sign that beneath the surface of placid stock markets, investors aren't exactly sound asleep.It's the persistently high premium that traders are paying for equity options, visible in the difference between implied and realized volatility in the S&P 500 Index. The gap, definable as the intangible cost of stock insurance over and above what is accounted for by the market's swings, has now lingered for 51 trading days.That's the longest streak in almost a year and one of the longest in the past decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Implied volatility has exceeded realized by 3.9 points on average each day since October, about 12 times the average gap over the past decade.""This chart illustrates two 'alternative facts' that have been thrown around a lot lately,"" said Patrick Hennessy, head trader for the $88 million IPS Strategic Capital Absolute Return Fund in Denver. The fund trades primarily options on the S&P 500 and CBOE Volatility Index. ""The first is that options are cheap. The second is that low volatility means that there will soon be a spike in volatility. Yes, volatility is a mean-reverting asset, but that does not necessarily indicate that it will immediately pop higher.""In the last 10 years, the longest run of S&P 500 implied volatility trading above realized swings lasted 81 days through March 2012. The VIX rallied 43% in the following two months as the S&P 500 slumped, reaching a low in June of that year.In other occasions when volatility bets were above actual price fluctuations for more than 51 days, the VIX fell in four of the six instances. Last year, it jumped ahead the British vote to leave the European Union.The VIX rose 1.9% at 8:36 a.m. in New York to 11.5, still near a more than two-year low reached Jan. 27. Most market participants expect volatility will pick up, though betting on it has proved particularly costly, according to Hennessy.""The question is not if, but when?"" he said. ""This trade has not been profitable since Donald Trump has been elected president.""

278,CBOE,"Donald Trump is a different kind of president, touting an ""America First"" vision and conducting trade negotiations and tax policy debates seemingly on the fly via Twitter and TV. Yet investors have taken the hyperactive populist in stride, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring above 20,000 for the first time this week.The stock market rally has breadth: Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS), Caterpillar (CAT), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Home Depot (HD) have broken out in recent days and weeks. (Apple, Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs and Home Depot are all Dow industrials components, but the five reflect a wide array of sectors). And the uptrend has depth: Hundreds of stocks have been hitting 52-week or all-time highs.No wonder investors aren't worried. And that's the problem.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighting growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. The CBOE Volatility Index estimates expected volatility based on S&P 500 option prices. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), commonly known as VIX after its ticker, highlights intense fear or complacency in the market. Low VIX readings are a sign that investors are especially bullish.The VIX has fallen steadily since Election Day as the Dow industrials and other major averages have rallied. On Friday, the VIX fell to a fresh two-and-half-year low intraday, nearly tumbling to a decade low.Extreme bullishness can be a sign of a market top, at least a short-term peak. Likewise, extreme bearishness can foreshadow a market bottom.IBD's David Chung issued a note of caution in Wednesday's The Big Picture:""At some point, U.S. stocks will indeed cool off. Investor complacency, as measured by the CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, is dangerously thick. The VIX hit extreme lows at the end of 1993, the end of 2006 and the spring of 2011, and each time the indexes staged sharp corrections of 20% or more.""Think of it this way. Stocks rally as investors turn bullish and pull money from the sidelines and into the market. But when ""everyone"" is optimistic and fully invested, who's left to buy? If the market assumes everything will go well, then what news will propel equities higher?The stock market is pricing in a lot of good news that hasn't happened yet — corporate tax cuts, regulatory reform and higher infrastructure spending. Meanwhile, investors don't seem concerned about the risk of growth-killing protectionism barriers or a full-blown trade war. And don't forget that the Federal Reserve is planning on several rate hikes this year, and markets have wobbled whenever policymakers even hint at hikes.In any case, when contrarian psychological market indicators like the VIX go to extreme levels, you don't need to rush into cash. They are secondary market gauges. But be ready to act and pay extra attention to the number of higher-volume declines in the major averages (distribution days), as well as the price and volume action of leading stocks.RELATED:Be Ready To Act When Investor Psychology Reaches Extreme Levels

279,CBOE,"The major market averages sold off Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling back below 20,000 and recent breakouts such as Intel (INTC), Boeing (BA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) being tested.The warning signs of a sell-off had been building. Investors had grown dangerously complacent.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose 13% to 11.93 on Monday, hitting 12.90 intraday, after tumbling last week to its lowest levels since mid-2014, nearly hitting a decade low.The CBOE Volatility Index estimates expected volatility based on S&P 500 option prices. Commonly known as VIX after its ticker, the gauge highlights intense fear or complacency in the market. Low VIX readings are a sign that investors are especially bullish. Extremely low readings are often followed by market tops, at least in the short- or intermediate-term.Psychological market indicators like the VIX are secondary. That's why excessive bullish or bearish sentiment readings by themselves should not trigger a rush to sell or buy stocks. But you should be prepared, and focus even more closely on the action of the major averages and the price and volume action of leading stocks.The major market averages suffered their worst losses of the years. The Dow industrials lost 0.6% Monday after falling more 200 points at their low. Dow components Boeing, Intel and Home Depot (HD), pulled back toward buy points cleared last week, with Intel just closing below the entry area. Google parent Alphabet closed below its buy point as its unsightly post-earnings retreat continued.IBD'S TAKE: To keep abreast of the market action, including the major averages and leading stocks, investors should read The Big Picture, a daily comprehensive look at the market action.

280,CBOE,"When taking the family on a road trip, you plot your route and expect to stick to it. But you might run into a few twists and turns. Accidents and weather may lead to detours. A scenic route might catch your fancy. Those whining kids make you speed up for the next rest stop.With swing trading, you also need a certain flexibility to maximize profit and minimize losses.William O'Neil, founder of IBD, referred to the flexibility in his own trading as ""bending with the breeze."" He, like many legendary traders, would quickly discard a strong conviction given a change in market conditions or chart patterns. Defending your initial assessment when conditions have deteriorated is a sure way to lose money. In reality, you are usually protecting your ego rather than your money.IBD's Swing Trader starts with an initial assessment and goal, but has no problem shifting gears and communicating with subscribers via alerts.Take a recent trade in  Yandex (YNDX). The stock was added on Jan. 24 after breaking out of a two-week consolidation (1), part of a larger pattern. Yandex gapped up at the open and was bought at 22.99 with volume coming in at the highest level of the short consolidation. The setup initially stated a profit goal of 5% to 10%, with possible earlier profits being taken with a decisive close below the 5-day moving average line.All was well the next day as the stock quickly reached more than a 3.5% profit (2). Following the nice gain, Yandex dropped nearly to the entry price, but volume petered out. By the end of the week (3), Yandex rallied again, but reversed and traded in the lower part of its range for the day. This was the second time Yandex was turned back from its prior high of 23.87 in August (not shown on the chart).In addition to the action on the individual stock chart, the market also started flashing warning signals. The Nasdaq composite was making new highs, but that was coupled with extremely low readings on the CBOE Volatility Index, lagging small-cap indexes and a high distribution count.The initial trade goals for Yandex were scrapped in favor of locking in the profit as it stood. The stock was removed at 23.61 for a 2.7% profit in four days.The removal of Yandex proved prescient as it fell with the market the next week and could have easily been removed at a loss rather than the modest profit.That kind of flexibility, over the long run, gets you to your destination with the best possible ride.Details on all current trades and past trades for SwingTrader are accessible to subscribers and trialists.

284,CBOE,"Stocks closed near session lows Friday as oil prices slumped. Apple (AAPL) lagged in the Dow, while Verizon (VZ) bucked the trend, rising about 0.4%. Apple lost 1.7% on new worries about sluggish iPhone 7 orders.The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, dropping below its 50-day moving average after retaking that support level on Thursday. The Nasdaq also lost 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.7% Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly lower than Thursday's levels.Crude oil prices were down 4% to $44.48 a barrel on reports that Saudi Arabia is not expecting an agreement among major producers on freezing oil output next week. Curbing production would lift crude prices, but such an agreement has been elusive. U.S. crude futures rose 2% for the week.In the stock market today, Facebook (FB) gapped down below a 128.43 buy point, but damage was limited, after the company said it overestimated the average time users spent watching videos between 60% and 80%. Shares of Facebook 1.6% to 127.96.Shares of Twitter (TWTR) soared 21% on a CNBC report that said the company is nearing a sale, perhaps to Salesforce.com (CRM) or Alphabet (GOOGL).

285,CBOE,"If you try hard enough, you can still make money trading volatility in the calmest U.S. stock market in six decades.One tactic, skew buying, is paying off for speculators who take a position on price discrepancies between bullish and bearish options on the S&P 500 Index. Traders who bet investor appetite for equity protection would remain brisk even as the CBOE Volatility Index slid to a two-year low are making money after bearish puts rose versus bullish calls at the fastest rate since 2014.Such a move is unusual in a market where the VIX spent most of the month more than 25% below its one-year average, according to Macro Risk Advisors. The benchmark's sharp rally after the Brexit sell-off and subsequent monthlong sideways move created the ideal conditions for the trade, something that previously happened in late 2014, MRA said.""S&P skew had flattened out during the rally back from the Brexit lows,"" Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at MRA, wrote in a client note on Thursday. ""As the market stopped rallying, skew steepened back out to normal levels. Surprisingly, owning skew actually made money in August.""By MRA's logic, after stocks rally, the demand for protection eases and skew settles down, creating room for upside in the options trade if investors start to get antsy again. That's what happened in late 2014 when the equity benchmark recovered from a six-month low before settling into a monthlong malaise, they said. The same conditions arose this year as stocks rebounded in July from a multimonth low after the Brexit vote only to spend August going nowhere.Traders have been seeking returns wherever they can in a market that hasn't seen a 1% move in either direction for 39 days, the longest such streak in more than two years. The spot price for VIX contracts has also stagnated, staying below 15 for the past 42 sessions.But the cost of protecting against losses has been rising relative to bets for further gains. Investors have been wary of getting overextended with the U.S. presidential election looming and amid continued uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's timetable for an interest rate hike.It's likely the fear gauge itself will start to show heightened investor anxiety given the seasonality of the stock market, according to Russ Koesterich of BlackRock. Over the past quarter century, the VIX has averaged over 22 in September, the highest of any month. The index slipped 9.2% to 12.24 in New York.A VIX spike would be a bearish signal for stocks, as the measure moves in the opposite direction of the S&P 500 about 80% of the time. The resulting disruption to the index's grind higher would threaten to derail the present environment that's so conducive to buying skew as investors pay more for protection against losses. The measure is already back within a point of its one-year average.Koesterich says the Fed's upcoming rate decisions have the potential to derail the S&P 500 itself, especially if the central bank defies the timeline priced in by markets.""To the extent the Fed tightens a bit faster than the languid pace discounted by markets, that would likely be a catalyst for some mean reversion in volatility,"" Koesterich, head of asset allocation for BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. ""Historically, the S&P 500 has declined by around 1.3% for each one point rise in the VIX. Should the VIX overcorrect and rise back toward the highs hit in January, investors could be looking at something more nasty.""
"
286,CBOE,"It's time to position for the end of that peaceful, easy feeling that's enveloped markets this summer ahead of a month fraught with event risk, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.""We remain 'cynically bullish' on financial asset prices,"" writes a team led by Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett. ""Tactically, the 3P's (Positioning, Policy, Profits) still argue for upside; but with risk assets up 15%-20% since Feb, and Sep a big 'policy month' we once again recommend buying volatility.""Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at Jackson Hole on Friday will usher in a period in which central bankers dominate headlines, with the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Bank of Mexico, and the Fed all slated to deliver interest rate announcements in September — all against the backdrop of the U.S. elections creeping closer.Hartnett concludes that investors aren't positioned for a firming macroeconomic environment coupled with a Federal Reserve that's more aggressive with rate hikes than is currently priced in. This combination could produce a ""bond shock"" that has the potential to roil equity markets, as well:Expectations for a dovish Fed are coinciding with macro strength in the U.S. (most obviously in housing and consumer spending) as well as highest level of wage inflation since January 2010. If average hourly earnings push above 3% year over year, it will be hard for bond yields to remain so low. But the biggest catalyst for higher yields would be stronger economic data in Europe and Japan, reversing the DM demand for Treasuries.In a separate note,  Head of U.S. Equity and Quantitative Strategy Savita Subramanian pointed to seasonality — that September is typically the worst month for U.S. stocks — as one of 10 reasons to expect a pullback in equities.Bank of America joins strategists at UBS Securities LLC in warning investors to prepare for a mean reversion in volatility.Volatility has had seemingly nowhere to go but up for the vast majority of the past four years, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) averaging 15.34 since 2013, relative to its long-term average of 19.75. In fact, this index hasn't risen by a full point in a single session since the U.K. referendum in June.And it's been hard to make money betting on higher volatility even when the spot levels of the VIX move higher. That's because investors aren't able to simply buy the VIX index to take a long volatility position. With the curve in relatively steep contango in the front end, the negative roll-down costs of a long position weigh heavily on the performance of exchange-traded products that hold short-term VIX futures.Macro Risk Advisors Head Derivatives Strategist Pravit Chintawongvanich observed that 57% of the decline in the iPath S&P 500 VIX short-term futures ETN from June 30 (in the wake of the Brexit vote) until Aug. 22 has been attributable to this rolldown, and less than half to the actual drop in implied volatility.

287,CBOE,"First, the good news for Friday. Stocks closed out a tough day at session highs and semiconductor ETFs defied a broad sell-off.Gains for exchange traded funds invested in chipmakers came amid an earnings beat for Applied Materials (AMAT), with the stock gapping up 7.1%.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) popped 1.4% on the stock market today for an all-time closing high of 50.79. Reports for Q2 earnings have given the chipmaker segment a boost. Heavyweights that have beaten expectations include Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM).The tech-heavy Nasdaq has now risen for eight consecutive weeks.However, the major index-tracking ETFs slid lower Friday with losses extending widely across stock, bond and commodity sectors. Some market watchers attributed the cautious investor sentiment to a slew of recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials.Utilities led the decline in the S&P 500, falling 1.2%. Materials eked out a gain of 0.2%.Even ""safer"" equity plays such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) managed only to eke out a 0.1% gain.Foreign developed and emerging markets fared even worse Friday.SPDR Euro Stoxx 50 (FEZ) gave up 0.9%. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets (IEMG) lost 0.6%.Gold, a safe-haven asset, also pegged losses as the dollar rose against a basket of other major world currencies.

The CBOE Volatility Index is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility measured through S&P 500 stock index option prices.

However, it sits at its lowest level in the past year after falling for the eighth-straight week as the stock market rallied.Despite the caution Friday, the major indexes including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average continue to hold near all-time highs.Here's how major exchange traded funds across major asset classes performed today, with IBD Relative Price Strength Ratings.The RS Rating is a measure of a stock's price performance over the last 12 months, compared with all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.1%, RS 53PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), 0%, RS 64SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.5%, RS 53IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.1%, RS 64IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), 0%, RS 64IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.7%, RS 32Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -0.6%, RS 7gSPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.9%, RS 66United States Oil (USO), +0.4%, RS 26IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.2%, RS 32PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), +0.4%, RS 2IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +0.4%, RS 1

290,CBOE,"U.S. stocks are hitting record highs, and volatility is hitting new lows, but can it last? According to Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, traders should look at more than just the CBOE Volatility Index to get the full picture.""At sub-12, the VIX seems low considering the macro risks on the horizon. However, looking at just the VIX can be misleading,"" he writes. ""The VIX only measures the cost of options expiring over the next month.""The problem with just looking at the near term, he says, is that this only includes the market's short-term expectations. ""To gauge how much the market is pricing in risk 'on the horizon', we need to look at longer-dated volatility.""This is where the VIX futures curve comes into play, or what traders expect volatility to be in the longer term future. While it is sitting about where it was one year ago, the curve is steeper, meaning that volatility is expected to increase at a more rapid pace.In terms of what this means for stocks, Bespoke Investment Group says that there is reason to believe that stocks will see a pullback, but it shouldn't last long.""There is some validity to the call that we're due for weakness when the VIX closes below 12, but only in the very near term,"" the firm writes. Its analysis shows that over the next week, the S&P 500 declined an average of 0.56%, but then rose 3.04% over the next three months.Not only that, but the VIX sitting below 12 isn't actually that unusual. While volatility has been historically high since the financial crisis, there have been a number of periods in the past where it stayed low for quite some time.But with a lot of unknowns in the market, such as geopolitics to monetary policy, there is certainly a lot of risk to try to price in. Now it all depends on how much of that risk actually comes to fruition.""If these risks fail to materialize and the market continues to experience low volatility, then the VIX spot will stay low and eventually these VIX futures will 'roll down' the curve to the level of VIX spot, which they must converge with on settlement,"" Chintawongvanich concludes.

291,CBOE,"Understanding mass psychology in the market can give you an edge in identifying key market turns.Many psychological indicators are available, but they stand secondary in value to price and volume action. In order to know the market's trend (or change in trend), use the psychological gauges to supplement, not substitute, your analysis of the daily action of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and leading stocks. The Big Picture column will help you time market tops and bottoms with excellent accuracy.The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, highlights intense fear in the market. The VIX is calculated using option prices, both puts and calls, at varying strike prices on the S&P 500.As investors get fearful, they buy more puts on the S&P 500 to hedge their portfolios, and that drives up the premiums for those options. This leads to a spike in the VIX; it may mean larger moves, either up or down, will show up on the S&P 500 index itself over the next 30 days.When trying to determine a market bottom, these measurable increases in fear gain value as a ""contrarian"" indicator. The more fearful investors get, the more likely a bottom is near. Why? These investors have likely sold their positions because they fear a further market drop. The VIX confirms when fear levels are sufficiently high to suggest that weaker holders have been shaken out and removed as an obstacle to the market's future rise.A VIX reading higher than 45 has often been shown to correspond with major market bottoms. During the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX almost hit 90.The most recent trigger above that level occurred during the August 2015 correction (please see accompanying chart). At that time, the market was looking at a number of disconcerting factors. Four rate cuts by the People's Bank of China had failed to stimulate their economy; oil was at a 6.5-year low; and the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy appeared it would end in the near future.On Aug. 24, the VIX hit a high of 53.29, while the S&P 500 plunged 5.3% intraday. It marked the end of the correction. It wouldn't have been the place to start buying aggressively. Fear can always get worse before it gets better. But it can put you on alert to vigilantly look for price and volume action that suggests a bottom has been reached. Eventually, the market followed through on Sept. 5 (by the Nasdaq) and again on Oct. 2 (by the S&P 500).The VIX can also be used to help identify intermediate corrections. IBD research has found that when the VIX rises to extend more than 20% above its 10-day moving average on an intraday basis, it suggests fear has increased on a short-term basis. If IBD's Big Picture notes a bottom has been reached, often via a follow-through day, the VIX spike can give you more conviction in its validity.

292,CBOE,"Say what you want about U.S. equity investors after the U.K. vote on the European Union. Just don't say they were unprepared.The precautions taken by traders to hedge against Brexit are playing out in today's market, where options-derived measurements of market stress are actually falling despite a second day of weakening stocks.While the S&P 500 index extended its post-Brexit loss with a 2% decline at 2:49 p.m. on Monday, the CBOE Volatility index fell 8.4%, marking the first time since 2008 that the two have simultaneously declined to such a degree. The rare concerted move is a sign to analysts that investors are getting out of hedges they bought as VIX futures volume surged 40% in the four days leading up to the U.K. referendum.With the S&P 500 seeing tempered selling after its biggest loss in 10 months on Friday, investors are feeling comfortable enough to exit hedges, according to Dan Deming of KKM Financial. The biggest exchange-traded fund tracking the index has seen volume of bearish options jump over the last two sessions as traders look to take profits on hedged positions and sell contracts to other investors seeking protection.""You can certainly make the case that investors were bracing for this, with all the hedging taking place,"" Deming, a Chicago-based manager at KKM Financial, said by phone. ""Now you're seeing an unwind because there hasn't been a massive downward follow-through in the S&P.""The S&P 500 slid to 1,995.80 on Monday, extending its two-day decline following Brexit to 5.6%. The VIX lost 8.4% to 23.59, after surging 49% Friday. It's the first time in almost eight years and just the second day in history that the benchmark equity gauge fell 1.5% while the VIX lost more than 5%, Bloomberg data show. The two gauges have moved inversely to each other 82% of the time in the past decade.""Historically we've seen political events get priced out of the market fairly quickly afterwards,"" said Deming. ""That's being factored into the decision of how much volatility investors want to own at this point.""A spread monitored by options traders to track demand for protective hedges -- implied vs. realized volatility on the S&P 500 -- widened to a record in the days leading up to the Brexit referendum, even as shares powered higher.Investors should remain aware of how quickly the VIX can change directions, said Deming. The CBOE VVIX index, which measures implied volatility on the fear gauge itself, sits about 25% above its 2016 average.The drop in the VIX doesn't necessarily mean a retreat in perceived risk, according to Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM Partners in Stamford, Conn. In fact, the futures curve on VIX contracts, which tracks expectations on how volatility will move over time, is little changed from Friday, he said.The VIX closed above 25 on Friday for the first time since February, when the S&P 500 was about 8% lower than its current level. Heading into the Brexit vote, the net long position held by asset managers was close to the largest since at least 2010, according to Macro Risk Advisors. The firm also sees traders closing those positions.""Anecdotally, much of the flow on our desk was clients unwinding or adjusting hedges,"" Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at MRA, wrote in a client note on Monday. ""We think the initial move may have been muted due to investors being fairly well-hedged going in.""

293,CBOE,"Rune Madsen is having a pretty good week.His Runestone Capital Fund has managed to avoid losses even as global markets slipped into spasm after U.K. voters opted out of the European Union. The $10 million volatility hedge fund wagered on U.S. equity swings via instruments such a futures, S&P 500 Index options and exchange-traded products.Long volatility has been roughly the only place to hide in a market downdraft that threatens to lop $2 trillion from global equity value in the space of a few hours. The strategy involves owning anything that gets more valuable as share prices widen, a good bet on a day when the MSCI All-Country World Index is down 3%.""In these kinds of markets, as a long-short volatility trader, you can have your best day or your worst,"" Madsen said from London on a day that started for him at 1:30 a.m.. ""We've caught some of the up and down moves this week so we're net positive.""Gauges of share volatility rose the most since the selloff of Aug. 24, with the CBOE Volatility Index climbing 43% to the highest in four months. In Tokyo, the Nikkei Volatility Index jumped as much as 26% earlier, while convulsions in Europe's equity market pushed a measure of 30-day swings in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index close to the highest in five years.""I won't take my eyes off my screen,"" said Madsen, whose hedge fund is up 30% this year and has outperformed 98% of its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ""There's no model that can predict a day like this, where volatility can move up or down 10% in 15 minutes. There's a coffee machine near my desk and that's about how far I'll go.""As financial markets awakened to the prospect of Britain quitting the EU, risk assets slumped from Asia to Europe and the U.S. As of 12:40 p.m. in London, the MSCI All-Country World Index was down 3% -- set for the biggest plunge since August.Trading of options and derivatives has risen in instruments that gain with market turbulence, among them VIX futures. Daily volume in those exceeded 122,000 contracts this week, 40% above the 2016 average prior to that. A spread monitored by options traders to track demand for protective hedges -- implied versus realized volatility on the S&P 500 -- widened to a record in recent days even as shares powered higher.""There was some blind optimism in the market although polls were always very tight,"" said Chetun Patel, the London-based head of strategy at Mariana Capital Markets LLP, a brokerage that specializes in equity derivatives. ""I don't think the market was positioned for it.""The U.K. will have two years to negotiate its EU exit, the first ever from the 28-nation union. Britain's decision comes at a time of extreme skepticism about the effectiveness of central-bank stimulus. Possible consequences of the U.K. leaving may include a spike in inflation for the nation, a rise in unemployment and even a recession. Governor Mark Carney said the Bank of England is ready to pump billions of pounds into the financial system, while the European Central Bank said it's ready to provide liquidity in euros or other currencies.""The moves we're getting in volatility around the world are not one-day events,"" Madsen said. ""It's not just a bad economic release. It's essentially a change of path.""

294,CBOE,"U.S. stocks fluctuated within a fairly narrow range and the major indexes continued to trade mildly lower in afternoon trading Thursday.The Nasdaq fell 0.2% while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were now off less than 0.2% as of 1:15 p.m. New York time. Small caps fell a bit more, with the Russell 2000 off 0.3%. The small cap-dominated Russell led the key indexes last year with a 19.5% advance.Volume was running lower vs. the same time Wednesday.In essence, institutions appear to be hesitating to add to positions with the market near all-time highs, but selling is also limited. Meanwhile, while Apple (AAPL) continues to exert newfound strength as it remains extended more than 8% past a 118.12 cup-with-handle entry, other tech stocks appear poised to help join the market leadership and boost the odds of sending the major indexes to further new highs.Apple initially broke out past a 110.33 cup-with-handle entry that was part of a long, deep bottoming base pattern. Shares in Apple, the largest company in the U.S. financial markets with a $671 billion market cap, were off a trifling 0.5% to 128.10 after vaulting more than 7% on Wednesday following a surprise swing higher in quarterly profit.The 5% chase zone in Apple stretches up to 124.02, so for now the stock is extended past the proper buying range.However, keep in mind that some measures of investor sentiment remain near extreme levels, including newsletter editor bullishness (above 60% in the Investors Intelligence survey) and the CBOE Volatility Index still below 12. Track both at IBD's Psychological Market Indicators feature, found inside the Market Trend section at Investors.com. GrubHub (GRUB), a recent mainstay in the IBD 50, added 0.5% to 41.68 and briefly eclipsed a 42.13 cup-with-handle entry. Watch for Q4 results on Wednesday; the consensus analyst estimate calls for a 32% jump in profit to 25 cents a share.GrubHub, a leader in online and mobile food ordering and delivery service, has grown earnings 143%, 8%, 12%, 11%, 35% and 77% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, GrubHub tops the Internet-Content group with a 99 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, meaning that the Chicago-based software firm ranks highest in terms of a combination of fundamental, technical and institutional sponsorship measures.Oclaro (OCLR), following a wild session on Wednesday, was trying to stabilize as it rallied 1.7% to 9.61. The stock has been bouncing around in a trading range between 8 and 10 since mid-November.The  key player in components and systems for fiber optic networks, reported a 600% leap in fiscal second-quarter earnings to 21 cents a share, nearly 17% above the Street's view. That increase, of course, was boosted in part by the fact that Oclaro earned just 3 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. However, analysts see Q3 profit jumping another 533% to 19 cents a share.Q2 revenue lifted 64% to $153.9 million, a quarterly record.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) added to Wednesday's big gains, rising more than 3% to 12.48. It's well extended now after finding support at its 10-week moving average near 10.35.However, the CPU giant and arch rival of processor king Intel (INTC) could be a turnaround play and it appears set to end two straight years of net losses. Wall Street sees profit rebounding to 6 cents a share this year and then soar 367% to 28 cents in 2018. Cavium (CAVM), an expert in semiconductor designs for data networking, data storage and telecom gear, rose more than 1% to 67.24 and powered past a 66.22 buy point within a long cup with handle.The San Jose, Calif., small cap posted a 100% rise in Q4 earnings to 56 cents a share as revenue jumped 124% to $226 million.That top-line increase marked a third quarter in a row of growth acceleration. Revenue was flat in Q1 2016, then rose 2% and 60% the next two quarters.RELATED:Stock Market Today: When Did Apple's 2nd Breakout Take Place?Inside The IBD 50: Which Companies Show Grand Earnings Estimates For FY 2017?How To Track The Market: Read The Big Picture Every Day

295,CBOE,"The stock market pared a small part of its losses Monday as indexes headed for their worst declines of the year so far.Small caps led with a 1.5% tumble in the Russell 2000, basically putting the index back where it was a week ago.The Nasdaq slid 1.1%, undoing much of last week's gains. Some high-tech companies that rely on many foreign workers cited concerns about new requirements to enter the U.S. under new rules imposed by President Trump.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The S&P seems to have hit some resistance at 2300 after making three straight highs near that level last week.Volume was running moderately higher compared with the same time Friday. Losers beat winners by 4-to-1 on the Nasdaq and by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE.Alphabet (GOOGL) was off more than 2% and trading close to its 824.40 entry. The stock was one of the most actively traded Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Excessive complacency often foreshadows market tops. The CBOE Volatility Index surged Monday after the VIX fear gauge hit its lowest level since mid-2014 on Friday.Another heavily traded stock was Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), which plunged 8% in more than five times its average volume. The civil engineering, technology and management consultant reported adjusted quarterly profit of 38 cents a share, 2 cents below analysts' consensus estimate. The stock had been forming a flat base, but Monday's sell-off roiled the pattern.Financials were broadly lower. Zions Bancorp (ZION) and Sterling Bancorp (STL), both members of the IBD 50, were trying to climb after touching potential support at the 50-day moving average.Retail was the day's best-performing sector as Wal-Mart (WMT) climbed nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrials component tries to end a six-week slide.Energy, metals and some cyclical stocks were lagging the most.Oil stocks came under pressure after the price of U.S. crude fell nearly 1% to $52.66 a barrel. On the Dow, Chevron (CVX) was off nearly 2% after touching the lowest price since Nov. 29.

297,CBOE,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 20,000 this past week, so it should not be a surprise that many of the 30 blue chip stocks are market leaders. Several are extended, but there are six Dow stocks were in buy range to start this week: Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Home Depot (HD), Intel (INTC) and United Technologies (UTX).With the market selling off Monday, several breakouts were tested, with three of these highlighted Dow stocks closing below buy points.Apple broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point at 118.12. Shares have inched their way higher, closing Friday at 121.95.Apple fell 0.3% to 121.63 on the stock market today, rebounding from intraday lows of 120.66.That's still within 5% of the entry point. If you buy above that point, a stock is vulnerable to a pullback.Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, the only one of these six Dow industrials to report this coming week.Analysts expect Apple to report a 2% revenue rise, ending three quarters of decline. But EPS should fall again, though only 2%. Investors are betting that Apple's upcoming 10th anniversary smartphone, unofficially known as the iPhone 8, will revive its fortunes later this year.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow and other major averages are at record highs while leading stocks are breaking out but the CBOE Volatility Index hit a fresh two-and-a-half-year low on Friday, nearly reaching its lowest point since early 2007. Find out why sometimes the only thing investors have to fear is no fear at all.Boeing broke out of a flat base on Jan. 24, clearing the 160.17 buy point. The next day, Boeing topped earnings forecasts, while its 787 Dreamliner is now cash flow positive, a good sign for future stock buybacks and dividend hikes. Investors looked past weak guidance and pushed shares higher. Boeing on Thursday went beyond 168.18, the top of its 5% chase zone, but pulled back Friday to 167.70.Boeing sank 1.3% to 165.52.Intel broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 24, exceeding the 37.44 buy point. The world's No. 1 chipmaker late Thursday reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings and gave a strong Q1 sales forecast. Intel closed at 37.98, rising intraday to 38.45, a 16-year high.Intel sank 1.5% to 37.42, just below buy range.Home Depot moved beyond a 137.42 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern in solid volume on Jan. 23. The home improvement chain's stock didn't make much progress, ending the week at 138.33. Home Depot will report earnings on Feb. 21.Home closed up 0.1% to 138.47, barely above the entry point.Caterpillar cleared a flat base on Jan. 25, closing slightly above the 97.50 buy point as President Trump authorized a border wall, boosting construction-related firms. The stock dipped back below the entry area on Thursday as the heavy construction equipment maker reported Q4 earnings and trimmed its 2017 guidance. But Caterpillar nudged higher on Friday, ending the week at 98.99.Caterpillar fell 2.2% to 96.79, just below the buy point.United Technologies formed a cup-with-handle pattern with a 109.52 buy point. United Tech cleared that entry zone several times from the end of November to mid-December, but didn't finally hold that level until Dec. 19. Shares have not moved much since then.On Wednesday, United Tech reported earnings, with Q4 sales and its 2017 revenue forecast a little light amid Pratt & Whitney jet engine production woes.Shares fell 1% last week, closing at 109.70, just above the buy point and the rising 50-day line.United Tech dipped 0.5% to 109.16, below the buy point and the 50-day line.RELATED:Common Investing Mistakes: Chasing A Good Stock Too Far Up In Price

298,CBOE,"The stock market moved lower but is trading off its intraday lows heading into midday trading.The Nasdaq dropped 1.1%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average fell a respective 0.9% and 0.8%.The blue-chip index is back below its coveted 20,000 mark.Wal-Mart (WMT) was one of the two positive stocks on the Dow, rising 0.8%. The stock is still well-below its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.Financial stocks underperformed with JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) falling 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively.Chevron (CVX) was another big loser, falling 2% as oil prices retreated 0.8% in the stock market today.Large-cap tech stocks felt the pain in early trading, though they were beginning to recover from their lows.Despite a price target raise by Canaccord Genuity, from 925 to 950, Alphabet (GOOGL) fell more than 2%, following up on Friday's weakness after missing Q4 earnings expectations.Tesla (TSLA) dropped 1.2%. The stock has displayed spectacular gains since December, rising over 40% from its lows as it builds the right side of a long cup base.IBD'S TAKE: Excessive complacency often foreshadows market tops. The CBOE Volatility Index surged Monday after the VIX fear gauge hit its lowest level since mid-2014 on Friday.Amazon (AMZN) pulled back to its 821.75 cup-with-handle buy point earlier this morning before rallying back above it. The stock is down 1%. The e-commerce giant will report earnings on Thursday after the market close.Alibaba (BABA) traded down 1.5%. The stock gapped up on an impressive earnings beat last week as it builds the right side of a base. The Chinese internet retailer showed significant accumulation last week.Facebook (FB) was trading just above its 129.37 cup-with-handle entry. After a 15% drop late last year, the social media company has battled back to within striking distance of new highs. It will report earnings Wednesday after the bell.After reaching a new high last week, Apple (AAPL) pulled back in today's action, falling 0.7%. The stock remains within buy range from a 118.12 cup-with-handle entry. It had been gaining momentum from its breakout in recent days.Netflix (NFLX) fell 1.6% after approaching new highs on Friday. Despite today's drop, the stock remains extended from a 129.39 cup-with-handle buy point.The IBD 50, a list of leading growth stocks, fell hard in Monday's session as only two stocks traded positively on the day: CommScope (COMM) and Essent Group (ESNT).The latter, a longtime IBD Sector Leader, is attempting to gain strength from last week's breakout and remains within buy range from the 34.04 flat-base buy point.On the downside, United Continental (UAL) and Sterling Bancorp (STL) fell 4.4% and 2.9%, respectively. United is breached its 50-day line, a key area of support. Increased capacity has become a potential headwind in recent days, following American Airlines' (AAL) management commentary.RELATED:Apple, MasterCard, Exxon, EA, AMD, Fed: Investing Action PlanApple, Intel Lead 6 Dow Stocks In Buy RangeTop Insurance Provider Sets Up To Move Higher; New Base FormedAirline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back Up

"
300,CBOE,"U.S. equities shaved off some of Monday morning's steep losses, yet the broad decline remained largely intact with one hour left in the trading session.Higher volume on both exchanges vs. the same time on Friday indicated some intense profit-taking by large money managers. Oil and gas, wood products, fiber optic tech, and internet content firms led the market's downside.Given the sell-off, IBD investors need to pay close attention to the degree of pullback by their stocks that have broken out of well-formed bases or rallied off a key support level, including the 10-week moving average. And a few in techland appear to be doing just fine.They include megacap consumer tech play Apple (AAPL), sinking just 0.6% to 121.23, still above a cup-with-handle breakout at 118.12; Applied Materials (AMAT), an emerging play for actuator chips, down 2.1%; and fellow chip-equipment firm KLA-Tencor (KLAC), off only 0.3% to 85.88 and holding above an 83.33 flat-base entry.Actuators convert digital signals into physical motion, light or sound and pose as the next step in the Internet of Things megatrend. Applied Materials, down nearly 2% to 34.31, is still more than 10% past a recent flat-base breakout at 31.17; and its RS line continues to rise.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is one several blue-chip stocks that have broken out in recent weeks. Apple is one of six Dow stocks in buy range to start the week. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) continues to hint that it's not ready to succumb to a big sell-off, even after rallying more than 260% from a March 2016 breakout past an early-stage cup with handle at 33.16 and flashing climax-run-like action at the end of December. Shares in the leading graphics processors firm edged 1.6% lower following a sharp rebound over the prior nine trading sessions.Watch to see if Nvidia has the strength to form a new cup-type base, which must be a minimum six weeks in length.The Nasdaq composite, falling as much as 1.4% early, was off nearly 1% as of 3 p.m. New York time. The Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.9%.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 dropped 0.8%; both key indexes also were rebounding from midmorning lows, while the Russell 2000 suffered the worst slide, down around 1.2%. The small-cap gauge, as well as the S&P SmallCap 600, are now both down for the year after leading the major indexes with stout rallies in 2016.Returning to Apple, the iPhone maker is set to report December quarter-ending fiscal Q1 results after the close on Tuesday. One big question: Will the Silicon Valley titan finally snap its three-quarter string of shrinking earnings per share?Overall, though, the action in Apple has been steady since the stock climbed out of its long bottoming base pattern with a Sept. 14 breakout past 110.33. Back then, it formed a nice cup with handle that lasted roughly five months. The decline from head to toe in that cup was a little more than 20%. But in the latest cup-with-handle pattern, which began with a stalling day-like session on Oct. 11, Apple corrected merely 12% from high to low within the base.What does that mean? It may indicate that institutions have become more comfortable with holding their shares or even adding to positions.Both today and in the next few days, keep a close eye on those stocks that bounce hard off this week's intraday lows, as well as those highly rated companies that actually make the positive side of IBD's long-running ""Stocks On The Move"" table, part of IBD's proprietary list of screens to help you find the greatest stock market winners.Often, the biggest growth plays will show up repeatedly on Stocks On The Move as they bottom out after a sharp correction, shape the right side of symmetrical-looking base patterns, and break out amid a confirmed uptrend.No doubt, a few stock in energy, telecom and manufacturing sectors are performing poorly after attempting breakouts. They included international oil and gas explorer Hess (HES) (rising just 3% past a 63.86 pivot point); July 2016 IPO Impinj (PI) (breakout past 37.80 flawed cup with handle lasts just five days, now in new basing formation); and Verizon (VZ) (fails to complete a new base after the June 2016 breakout past 54.59 sees limited daylight).The point: Not all breakouts succeed. So one must always have the psychological strength to cut losses short, at a maximum of 7% to 8% but preferably less, at 4% to 5% from the purchase price.Meanwhile, fear is up sharply in the stock market today, at least among options traders; keep an eye on CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, which tracks the volatility premiums on S&P 100 index options. As noted multiple times in the IBD daily Big Picture premium feature, the VIX had reached levels where it would not be a surprise to see stocks taking at least a short break.RELATED:Dow Loses 20,000 As VIX Fear Gauge Spikes From Excessive LowsHow To Trade Stocks: Why The Bottoming Base Pattern Still Matters TodayHow To Trade Stocks II: How Apple Formed A Bottoming Base In 2009How To Trade Stocks III: Which IBD 50 Firms May Have The Rosiest Sales Growth In 2017?The Best Stock Brokers: Trading Wisdom From the Former Chairman Of E.F.

305,CBOE,"When you're driving down the road, your speed is often tempered by your visibility. When you have blind curves or fog, you slow down. The same might be said for the market. While the long-term prospects have a lot of potential, a swing trading style may still require caution on our speed. The Market Action in IBD's SwingTrader product keeps abreast of short-term market trends and here are a few signs we'll be watching to help judge trading velocity in the new year.In this column a month ago, we pointed out that an unusual divergence was occurring between the Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq Composite. The Russell's performance was surpassing the Nasdaq by a differential not seen in more than a decade. The first week of 2017 saw a different picture. The Russell 2000 corrected more, bounced back less, and even had days in sharp contrast to the Nasdaq's. On Jan. 5, for example, the small-cap indexes were down more than 1% while the Nasdaq was up mildly. Of course, a single data point doesn't make a trend, but continued divergence is worth watching.On the short term, the Nasdaq is offering a ""V-shaped"" pattern. The ""V"" shape, where a correction is immediately followed by movement straight back to new highs, is prone to failure, or at least a mild break, before leading to a sustained rally. In stocks, this pattern offers a little-known offensive selling opportunity. After a prolonged run, a sharp pullback down to the 10-week moving average line followed by an immediate to rebound to new highs often occurs at the peak.The Nasdaq is showing some of those attributes right now with a one-week pullback followed by a one-week recovery to new highs. However, the pullback wasn't very sharp at around 2.5%. However, shallow market corrections generally lead to short rallies that make little progress into new high ground before going sideways again.Other indicators are also at levels usually associated with short-term tops rather than bottoms. The CBOE Volatility Index (the ""VIX"") is low, the number of stocks above their 50- and 200-day moving averages is high, and the Investors Intelligence weekly survey of newsletter writers shows a lot more bullishness than bearishness (a contrarian indicator where the market usually goes opposite to the sentiment).While we haven't seen much in the way of  large and prolonged corrections the last few years, we have waded through two to three years of sideways action. That might not scare a lot of investors out of the market, but it has certainly worn some out. A long period of sideways action can often act as a reset in the same way a traditional bear market with a 20%-plus correction would.While an expectation based on history is essential to informing your investing decisions, ignoring divergences from your expectations can be perilous. The market is constantly giving you feedback as to whether your thesis is correct. Astute investors make constant corrections to their course based on that feedback. While current market sentiment looks at a Trump administration as economically favorable, that could change when the reality of administrating hits. But making changes based on market  conditions will help get you to your investment destination safely.Short-term market trends can be accessed in the Market Action section of SwingTrader by subscribers and trialists.

306,CBOE,"U.S. stock futures tumbled, as ongoing vote tallies showed that British voters have decided to leave the European Union.S&P 500, Nasdaq futures lost more than 5% with Dow futures crashing 700 points. Meanwhile the U.K. FTSE 100 was indicating an 8.7% loss. The pound crashed 10.5% to a 30-year low vs. the dollar after hitting a 6-month high earlier Thursday. In Japan, the Nikkei crashed nearly 8% after triggering circuit breakers, as the yen hit multi-year highs. Gold and U.S. Treasuries also rallied on safe haven flows, while crude futures sank  6%.Central banks have sounded the alarm over a potential Brexit, with chiefs of the Fed, Bank of Japan and Bank of Canada all citing the vote as a potential disruption to the global economy. Yellen said yesterday the decision could have consequences for financial markets, and ""in turn for the U.S. economic outlook."" The International Monetary Fund had warned that a so-called Brexit risked damage to the U.K. economy.""Risk-off is back,"" Joe Quinlan, chief market strategists at U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, said by phone. ""We've got a fragile, weakening economy and the last thing we need is for one of the stronger developed economies to falter. If it's a leave vote, you just chipped away a little bit at global growth for the next 12 months.""Polling before the referendum had indicated a vote too close to call. By 4:15 a.m. in London, 560,000 more votes had been cast for a so-called Brexit than for staying. Results counted suggest London and Scotland are largely voting ""Remain,"" while the rest of the country is mainly in the ""Leave"" camp.Futures contracts on the CBOE Volatility Index soared 53 percent in after-market trading, after the VIX plunged the most since 2013 Thursday. Equity futures and other risk assets had climbed earlier after a YouGov poll showed support for remaining stood at 52 percent, while a separate survey conducted by Opinium indicated a slight lead for the Leave camp.Final results for the U.K. vote are due at about 2 a.m. on Friday. An analysis by JPMorgan Chase & Co. indicated a 51.1 percent chance of a Brexit, according to a client note.The equity gauge could plunge as much as 7 percent in the event of a Brexit, Bank of America Corp. strategists led by  Savita Subramanian wrote in a note prior to the referendum. A vote to remain would weaken the dollar and boost crude prices, spurring a 3 percent to 4 percent rally in U.S. stocks, they said.The vote comes at a time when uncertainty already plagues U.S. stocks, with questions around the Fed's ability to stoke growth, the fall elections, a four-quarter decline in corporate profits and price-earnings ratios that are close to a decade high. The S&P 500 plunged 11 percent in its worst-ever start to a year before recovering through April. It's virtually been stuck in place since, struggling to hold above the 2,100 level that has capped three rallies since November.
"
307,CBOE,"The U.S. options market is underpricing the risk of British secession from the European Union, according to a New York-based firm that arranges volatility trades.Implied volatility for S&P 500 Index at-the-money contracts expiring in 30 days sits at 15.1%, a price that is actually below the average level of the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Placidity can also be seen in the benchmark index's fear gauge, the options-derived benchmark that has fallen 12% in the last week after reaching a four-month high.With the potentially market-moving referendum set for Thursday, strategists at Macro Risk Advisors say investors should be bracing for bigger price swings. A vote to leave the EU would unleash turmoil across global markets, the type of outcome for which investors have historically been unprepared, according to MRA.""If you're looking to hedge with the pound, people already beat you to it,"" Dean Curnutt, CEO of Macro Risk Advisors, said in a phone interview. ""But when you start to get away from the U.K. and Europe, there's an opportunity to buy options and insurance on things like the S&P that didn't reflect the potential for spillover. In the past, the market hasn't shown a very strong ability to understand risk and price outcomes based on politics.""One cost-effective way for an investor to protect against a market decline would be to use three-month put spreads, strategies designed to hedge against a short-term drop in an asset, according to MRA. Such protection now costs roughly the same as it did a year ago, a comparatively quiet period for markets, the firm said.Viewed as the more likely outcome as recently as last week, the Brexit option has seen its popularity wane. A poll published over the weekend showed 45% of voters supported remaining in the union, while 42% favored leaving. Odds at betting shops also suggested dwindling support for the secession following Thursday's murder of U.K. lawmaker Jo Cox, who backed staying in the EU.Still, anything with a probability of 30% or more ""ceases to be a tail risk and must be confronted as a realistic potential outcome,"" MRA wrote in a June 9 client note.As the likelihood of a Brexit has decreased, so has the CBOE Volatility Index, which slipped 5.4% on Monday, the most in four weeks. The gauge of price swings has fallen in five of the last six sessions. It added 0.3% to 18.42 at 10:05 a.m. in New York. The volatility index generally trades inversely to the S&P 500.Resilience has been a guiding principle this year in the U.S. stock market, where investors have been unwilling to embrace bearishness. With a 0.6% gain on Monday, the S&P 500 sits just 2.2% from an all-time record even after two straight weeks of declines. The benchmark gauge bounced back earlier this year after getting off to its worst-ever start, erasing an 11% loss in less than two months.While the recent spot price may indicate less worry heading into the Brexit referendum, that hasn't stopped investors from piling into VIX-linked products. Trading in five of the most popular VIX instruments surged to more than 4% of total volume on U.S. exchanges, a level that before last week had never been reached, according to data compiled by Sundial Capital Research and Bloomberg.Meanwhile, as of June 7, hedge funds and large speculators held more short bets on VIX futures than at any time since 2013, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Less than a quarter of these short positions were covered during last week's 14% VIX increase, making calls on the gauge an ""excellent hedge"" for a long portfolio, according to Schaeffer's Investment Research.""Short-term VIX calls remain an attractive portfolio hedge in the event that market participants react unfavorably,"" Todd Salamone, senior vice president at Cincinnati-based Schaeffer's Investment Research, wrote in a client note on Monday. ""We see short volatility speculators as particularly vulnerable to a negative surprise.""

311,CBOE,"U.S. stock-index futures were little changed as investors turned cautious in the year's last full week of trading, following a rally that sent equities to record levels.S&P 500 futures expiring in March rose 0.1% to 2,263 at 6:03 a.m. in New York. The underlying benchmark closed 0.1% higher on Monday, while small-cap shares jumped 0.6%. Contracts on the Dow gained 24 points to 19,861 Tuesday. The CBOE Volatility index dropped for a fourth session, set for its lowest close since August. The gauge of investor anxiety, known as the VIX, has tumbled 48% since a Nov. 4 peak.Strategists on average expect the S&P 500 to end 2017 at 2,356, according to the mean of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That implies a 4.1% gain from Monday's close. The gauge has advanced 11% this year, putting it among the top four developed-market benchmarks. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap firms has climbed almost 15% since the day of the U.S. election. All four major benchmarks reached all-time highs after the vote, with financial firms leading gains on bets higher borrowing costs will boost profitability.
"
312,CBOE,"Fresh off three straight record closes and with call volume at all-time highs, options traders are adding to bullish bets on the S&P 500 Index. They're paying the least since July 2014 to protect against a decline in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) before Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision.The surge in optimism has sent the cost of options betting on a 10% gain in the S&P 500 to record levels relative to at-the-money contracts. While SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust calls were among the most traded Monday, the bullishness was especially notable Friday, when an opening block trade of 70,000 December $232.50 calls changed hands at the same time as a block of 35,000 December $230 calls.The CBOE Volatility Index has lost 5.2% in December and is trading at its lowest monthly average level since August. It climbed in the past four Decembers. Strategists are bullish on the S&P 500 for next year, betting that it will rise to 2,317 by the end of 2017, according to the average of 11 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.Bullish investors who are skeptical of the S&P 500's torrid pace of gains should buy call spreads, Credit Suisse Group equity-derivatives strategist Mandy Xu wrote in a Dec. 12 note to clients. She recommended using the strategy on stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Transocean (RIG), which have rallied more than 10% since the presidential election, surpassing their 52-week highs, while the cost of bullish options on the shares has remained relatively stable.Here are some other notable S&P 500 options statistics:Call volume on the S&P 500 surged to a record high of more than 1 million contracts on Dec. 8, compared with less than 880,000 bearish puts. Short interest on the S&P 500 ETF sits at 2.8% of shares outstanding, 1.7 percentage points lower than the one-year average, Markit data show. The ratio of outstanding bearish options relative to bullish ones on the fund was at 1.8 as of Friday, in line with its one-year average.

315,CBOE,"Money managers, producers and consumers made the biggest bets on West Texas Intermediate crude prices in nine years, amid signals more volatility is coming.Global markets were roiled after Donald Trump's election as U.S. president and as OPEC continued negotiations on a deal to cap output. The U.S. dollar climbed to the highest since January. A measure of oil volatility surged last week to a seven-month high, a sign that traders were anticipating bigger price swings.Wagers on higher and lower prices held by speculators and hedgers reached 1.47 million contracts in the week ended Nov. 15, the most since 2007, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Trading volume of calls giving investors the right to purchase West Texas intermediate futures rose to a record that day. The CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index reached the highest since April. Brent oil shorts, bets that prices will fall, rose to the highest in more than two years.""There's tension in the market, with both producers and consumers worried about what OPEC does or won't do on Nov. 30,"" said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. ""They want to be protected from surprising price moves.""Investors are weighing the chances that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will complete a deal to cap output at its Nov. 30 meeting in Vienna. While Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih told Al Arabiya television he's optimistic a deal will be reached, only seven of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg last week expect the group to set output targets for its members.OPEC agreed in September to cut their collective output to 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day and has been trying to persuade other suppliers, notably Russia, to join the cuts. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said he's confident the group can reduce record oil inventories and bring forward the rebalancing of the market.""The Saudis are working hard to reach a deal,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. ""You don't fight the Fed in the bond market and when it comes to oil you don't fight the Saudis.""The September agreement marked the end of OPEC's two-year long experiment with pumping at will. Saudi Arabia led the group in the effort to grab market share and curb the development of more expensive reserves such as U.S. shale.While U.S. production has dropped from last year's 44-year high, the decline is slowing. The Energy Information Administration this month raised its output forecast for 2017. Rigs targeting oil in the U.S. rose the most in 16 months last week, according to Baker Hughes.Producers and merchants increased short positions, or protection against lower WTI prices, to the highest level since March 2011. They added 66,613 bearish contracts over the past two weeks as prices retreated from last month's peak at above $50 a barrel.""The Saudis want higher prices but won't sacrifice just to see a major competitor, U.S. shale, benefit,"" said Sarah Emerson, managing director of ESAI Energy, a consulting company in Wakefield, Mass. ""The Trump election changes things. In one day the U.S. shale business got better. The government will be more responsive to the industry.""Money managers' net-long position in WTI advanced for the first time since mid-October, climbing by 3,906 futures and options to 163,321. Shorts climbed 14% while longs rose 8.1%. WTI  gained 1.8% to $45.81 a barrel in the report week. It rose 3.9% to $47.49 on Monday, the highest close since Oct. 28.In the Brent market, money managers increased short positions by 11% to 157,016 during the week, the highest level since September 2014, according to data from ICE Futures Europe. The net-long position in the global benchmark slipped by 4.6% during the week to the lowest since January.In fuel markets, net-bullish bets on gasoline decreased 35% to 25,796 contracts, as futures slipped 2.5% in the report week. Money managers were net-short 393 contracts of ultra low sulfur diesel, from net-long 7,791 the previous week. Futures advanced 0.2%.""I suspect that when the OPEC meeting is over there will have been a lot more smoke than fire,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass. ""If they don't come up with a convincing agreement, they'll be forced to revisit the issue before long.""

316,CBOE,"Oil tumbled as a record increase in U.S. crude stockpiles heightens the pressure on OPEC to reduce production.Crude inventories rose 14.4 million barrels last week, the biggest gain in data going back to 1982, according to the Energy Information Administration. A 2 million barrel  increase was forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Imports surged 28% to the highest in four years. Prices were down before the report's release on record OPEC output last month, which is complicating the group's effort to stabilize prices.Oil is continuing its retreat triggered by the failure last week of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on the member quotas required to implement an output deal reached in Algiers in September. While Goldman Sachs Group sees little chance of an agreement at an official meeting of the group on Nov. 30, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and OPEC's head remain confident of a deal.""Market conditions have deteriorated and we're back at $45,"" said Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors LLC in New York. ""This report increases the pressure on core OPEC members to come to an agreement on cuts by the time they meet on Nov. 30.""West Texas Intermediate for December delivery dropped $1.33, or 2.9%, to settle at $45.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It's the lowest close since Sept. 27. Total volume traded was about 15% above the 100-day average at 2:44 p.m. ET.Brent for January settlement slipped $1.28, or 2.7%, to $46.86 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It's the lowest close since Sept. 27. The global benchmark crude ended the session at a 93 cent premium to January WTI.Oil market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index, has climbed over the past week as futures moved lower. The index rose as high as 45.51 Wednesday, the highest since Sept. 27.""We're right back at the price we saw before the OPEC meeting in September,"" said Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist in Seattle at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $133 billion of assets. ""There's been a lot of bullish speculation in the market and the news hasn't supported it. We're now going to test the bottom end of the recent range.""The gain left U.S. crude supplies at 482.6 million in the week ended Oct. 28, according to EIA data.

317,CBOE,"Major stock ETFs suffered moderate losses Monday as investors turned leery ahead of a key British referendum on staying in the European Union. Adding to the mood of caution, a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting starts Tuesday, but the exacting timing of the next rate hike remains uncertain.The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX or ""fear index,"" hit its highest level in three months as anxieties on several fronts mounted. The IBD ETF market strategy changed direction to uptrend under pressure. That calls for judicious buying decisions.IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), which tracks an index with exposure to futures contracts on the VIX, soared nearly 15% on the stock market today.Diversified technology ETFs were knocked back as the sector helped lead the S&P 500 lower. Many have a hefty stake in Microsoft (MSFT), which lost nearly 3% following news of its agreement to acquire LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion. The social network for professionals has an estimated 433 million users. LinkedIn stock spiked nearly 47% to its highest level since early February.Microsoft touted the deal as potentially accelerating growth of its Microsoft Office 365 unit.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gave up 1.1% on the stock market today. At nearly 10% of portfolio assets, Microsoft is XLK's No. 2 holding after Apple (AAPL).Microsoft's social networking bid marks its entry into an arena considered a soft spot for Apple, its Cupertino, Calif., rival. Apple itself was in the spotlight Monday, as its annual Worldwide Developers Conference opened. The iPhone maker's fans got hoped-for updates to its artificial intelligence-powered assistant, Siri. Among the changes, Siri was finally opened up to third-party app developers.Global X Social Media Index (SOCL) jumped 4% amid the LinkedIn news, setting a 2016 high of 20.56 but closing near the session low. SOCL holds 30 stocks and has a nearly 11% weighting in LinkedIn, its largest holding.SOCL also counts Yahoo (YHOO) among its top-10 holdings. Verizon (VZ) and AT&T (T) are reported to be preparing final bids to buy Yahoo's core internet assets, estimated to be in the $5 billion range.Jay Jacobs, director of research for Global X, said today's news could indicate the beginning of a third major phase for the social media industry. According to Jacobs:Gold rose to its highest level in nearly a month on Monday, as a risk-off mood returned to the stock markets. The U.S. Fed, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank and Bank of Japan are all scheduled to meet this week, and they are likely to hold monetary policy steady as concerns about the global outlook grow again, according to CNBC.

319,CBOE,"In this year's stampede to protect portfolios and generate income, options on exchange traded funds are booming.It's not just traders and institutional investors who are stoking demand for these more sophisticated investment strategies. There's rapidly growing interest from individual investors and financial advisors too, said Frank Tirado, vice president of the Options Industry Council (OCC).""Options strategies address a lot of the worries that investors have -- the drawdown in the markets and the zero interest-rate environment,"" Tirado told IBD in a phone interview.Click Here To See A List Of Top Performing ETFs In 2016Options are financial instruments that allow investors to profit from price moves in a stock or ETF without actually buying the stock or ETF itself. They give the holder the right to buy (a call) or sell (a put) the underlying security at a specified price (the strike price) by a specified date. They're available on ETFs big and small, including some best-performing ETFs of 2016, such as Global X Gold Explorers (GLDX). Options strategies also now come in an ETF wrapper, such as PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio (PBP).Roughly 41% of all option contracts bought and sold in the first quarter were linked to underlying exchange traded funds, according to the Options Industry Council. That's up from 37% in 2015, 30% in 2009, and just 17% in 2006.By some estimates, ETFs now account for about 70% of all equity options trading volume vs. 30% for stocks. That's the reverse of equity trading, where ETFs represent roughly 30% of trading volume and stocks 70%.Tirado cautioned that options generally are not as intuitive as buy-and-hold investment products. ""You have to really understand the strategy,"" he said. The OCC executive and other options trading pros offered advice and insights in a recent interview.IBD: What trends are you seeing in ETF options trading?Frank Tirado is vice president of the Options Industry Council, a Chicago-based cooperative that educates investors about the benefits and risks of exchange-listed equity options: One of the biggest trends is growth. Options on ETFs have grown more than six times from 231 million contracts in 2006 to more than 1.5 billion contracts in 2015. Options on ETFs represented about 37% of all U.S.-listed options contract volume in 2015. This growth trend continued through the first quarter of this year, with about 41% of all U.S.-listed options contract volume coming from exchange traded funds.Cole Feinberg is vice president of exchange traded funds at Goldman Sachs Asset Management; GSAM offers options on 60% of their ETFs, which is above the industry average: Income-generating strategies such as buy-write and covered call strategies seem to continue to be the most prevalent tactics associated with ETF options trading. This is an ongoing benefit of ETF options as a method of allocation.IBD: What are the goals of ETF options trading?Matt Moran is vice president of institutional marketing at Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the leading options exchange among 14 in the U.S.: Investors are using ETF options to enhance overall portfolio performance through a variety of strategies, such as hedging of downside risk, selling of options to harvest premium income, and gaining exposure to market sectors or asset classes. In recent years, ETF options as a group have experienced much more growth in volume when compared to stocks or options on single stocks.IBD: Are ETF options a strategy for the average investor, and how to begin?Tirado: Yes! Millions of investors, advisors and institutions use options to generate income and to manage risk. A great place to get started is our options education program.IBD: How are options used to protect portfolios in a choppy market?Tirado: The protective put and the collar are conservative strategies that allow investors to protect their ETF position only if options are listed on that ETF. With the protective put, the ETF owner buys a put as a safeguard in anticipation of an ETF dropping in price. The protective put provides investors with limited risk because of the put protection, while still maintaining the upside potential of the ETF.The collar is another defensive strategy to employ when investors are looking for protection from an unexpected sharp drop in the price of the underlying ETF. With the collar strategy, the investor writes a call option and buys a put option with the same expiration as a way to hedge a long position in the underlying ETF. This strategy is a combination of both the protective put and covered call strategies. The benefit is that the short call helps pay for the protective put, so that the cost of “insuring” your ETF position is reduced. In some cases, a collar can be constructed at no premium cost.Moran: To protect against extreme downside moves in their portfolios, investors use strategies such as protective puts, collars and put spread collars. For example, CBOE S&P 500 95-110 Collar Index accepts a ceiling or cap on S&P 500 gains in return for a floor on S&P 500 losses. The strategy entails:IBD: How are options being used to generate income in a near-zero rate environment?Tirado: With prolonged low interest rates, the covered call has come back in fashion as an income-generating strategy. This basic strategy allows investors to generate income from ETFs they already own. The covered call works by selling or writing call options against the ETF the investor already owns. In exchange for selling the call, options premium is collected as income. However, there is an obligation when an investor sells a call: If the call option the investor sells is exercised by the buyer, the investor may have to deliver the shares of the underlying ETF. Since the investor already owns the underlying ETF, the potential obligation is “covered,” as reflected in the name ""covered call.""  That is why the covered call is best implemented in a sideways market.IBD: Why trade ETF options rather than stock options?Moran: When compared with stock options, ETF options can provide exposure to sectors or entire markets or commodities, with less company-specific risk.IBD: How should one decide between trading options on market indexes and options on ETFs, which typically track indexes?Feinberg: As mentioned, ETFs are well-established as the go-to vehicle for many investors for building asset allocations in their portfolios. To the extent investors are already using ETFs as the building blocks, the option on the ETF, rather than on the index, tends to make more sense because it matches more precisely the desired exposures. Also, from a big-picture perspective, there are simply many more choices in ETF options, so investors can get more precise exposure compared to the traditional market-cap-weighted indexes.IBD: Which ETFs are most popular for options trading?Moran: SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM), iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) are among the top 10. With options on ETFs, investors can manage risk for exposure to U.S. stocks, emerging markets stocks, commodities, volatility and the like.IBD: What should one look for in a good options trading candidate?Tirado: It is important not to put the cart before the horse. An investor’s research on the underlying ETF and their investment goal will determine which options strategy to select. For example, if an investor needs to protect a concentrated ETF position, then the collar might be right. If, however, an investor needs to generate income because of the low-rate environment, then the covered call or cash-secured put might be right.IBD: What are common mistakes investors make when using options on ETFs?Tirado: The most common mistake that investors make when using options is not comprehending the options strategy. Options investing can be complex and take time to learn. Understanding the importance of options, as well as their complex nature, is key. The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and the U.S. options exchanges created the Options Industry Council, which provides unbiased education on the benefits and risks associated with using exchange-listed options.Feinberg: I think people can misunderstand the liquidity of the ETF and thus the associated options. Some investors tend to avoid ETFs that they perceive to be illiquid due to a lower trading volume. This then limits the universe of products they are willing to analyze and ultimately utilize. The fact is, the liquidity of the ETF is driven by the underlying basket or the holdings of that ETF -- and by extension, the ETF’s options, which are also driven by the liquidity of the underlying basket.

320,CBOE,"When drawing up your ETF investing action plan for the week ahead, it pays to watch the pros.Robert G. Smith, president and chief investment officer at Sage Advisory, tells IBD how he's positioning portfolios given the abrupt Fed-induced twists and turns in the stock market. The Austin-based investment firm manages roughly $12.1 billion in overall assets, with its ETF strategies accounting for $2.6 billion.IBD: What surprised, disappointed or heartened you this past week?Robert Smith: There were no real surprises for us on the economic or stock market front. We have been expecting the economic statistics to roll along as they have been, in a climate of muted growth, low to very moderate inflation, and suboptimal level of productivity. The problem for the market is that earnings and sales trends on a successive quarter-over-quarter basis continue their downward trajectory of the last year or more, and stock prices are not fully reflecting that as of yet. With poor underlying fundamentals across many sectors, and the threat of a change in global central bank policies swirling around the markets, investor sentiment is becoming uneasy and cautious.IBD: Are you tweaking any positions?Smith: We have been positioned in low- to minimum-volatility holdings through most of this year, and that strategy has vastly outperformed the broader market so far. For example, iShares Edge MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) is up 5.14% year to date vs. 1.03% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). We are not yet abandoning this strategy, but are constantly evaluating the Federal Reserve’s official comments on raising interest rates to get some sense of the timing and pace of policy adjustments. These have been the dominant factors behind most of the volatility exhibited in the markets this year, rather than corporate fundamentals and market technicals.Those statements and actions may help trigger some adjustments in our current defensive strategy, but only time will tell.IBD: How has the uncertainty affected your investment processes?Smith: This has made investment management extremely difficult, as it is very hard to appropriately model policy and related market volatility within a broader investment strategy traditionally driven by fundamentals, historical relative valuations and technical factors.IBD: What are you looking out for in the week ahead?Smith: There are a number of factors to consider, but perhaps the end of earnings season and the new Fed language will continue to have a halting and negative effect on price action. Clearly, most participants had written off the likelihood of any Fed action until later in the year, if at all. The complacency was apparent in the VIX (the CBOE Volatility Index, or ""fear index"") price levels and indeed in corporate bond spreads that are near their tights for the year.Announcements about the likes of George Soros and Warren Buffett taking significant positions in gold and gold miners, and shorting the S&P, will continue to weigh on market psychology. Cash flows into long volatility investments have started to mount from the institutional sector, and this hedging activity portends more downside than upside potential for the market in the days ahead.IBD: What are you monitoring internationally?Smith: The European Central Bank is soon going to embark on their next wave of security purchases, and the market will await with high anticipation that policy initiatives remain as aggressive as they have been.Japanese actions on this front are slipping, and some moderation may be under way which is acting as a negative undertow to otherwise modestly positive economic reports compared to recent years.China is living within its own financial reality, which is not great and teetering due to excessive leverage and bad debts across the corporate and banking system. Investor reactions to these conditions have been odd and quite erratic, bringing more pessimism to the global investment sentiment at the moment.IBD: Do you have an overall favorable view of foreign stocks?Smith: We remain underweight emerging markets and overweight developed markets, but with a heavy defensive, low-volatility orientation. The dollar will likely resume its ascent off the back of the recent Fed speak that has now shot through the markets. That, in turn, will likely put a freeze on commodity price increases and pressure those economies that are dependent on producing them in large order relative to their respective GDPs.IBD: What is your advice for investors?Smith: Perhaps investors need to be mindful of the extended risk characteristics that exist within many of the broad fixed-income ETFs such as iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG) and others. The duration and yield characteristics are now as far apart from each other as they have been in decades, because of investors’ intense search for yield and their apparent complacency about moving out of the yield curve to find it.While rates may not rise precipitously near term, there is some vulnerability for investors who ignore the extensions in average maturities and durations that have occurred within these index ETFs.Indeed, there may be some price shocks coming for investors who have not already reviewed this issue and made some risk adjustments to avoid some of the potential downside volatility.Also, this same concern should be extended to fixed-income proxies found in the equity markets, which may also suffer some underperformance compared with the broader equity market in this environment.

The price of the 1.5% security due in August 2026 rose 2/32, or $0.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 97-22/32.Another gauge of price swings, the CBOE/CBOT 10-Year Treasury Note Volatility Index, last week touched its lowest level since 2013.Treasury 10-year notes rose Tuesday after a report showed U.S. consumer confidence declined more than forecast in October. Government data on Oct. 28 will show U.S. GDP grew at a 2.5% annualized rate in the third quarter, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.A gauge of demand fell to the lowest since July and the second-lowest since 2008 at a $26 billion two-year U.S. note auction Tuesday. The U.S. will sell $34 billion in five-year notes Wednesday and $28 billion in seven-year securities on Thursday.""Trading is going to be all about supply this week,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy in New York at Societe Generale SA, a primary dealer. ""The next big data point is the GDP print. We're looking at another potentially weak quarter and that doesn't qualify us for any urgency in raising rates.""

325,CBOE,"CBOE Holdings (CBOE) said it agreed to buy Bats Global Markets (BATS) for about $3.2 billion in a deal that would tie an electronic upstart together with the owner of the Chicago Board Options Exchange.Edward Tilly, chief executive officer at CBOE Holdings, will keep that role in the combined company, while Bats chief Chris Concannon will become president and chief operating officer, the companies said in a statement on Monday. The market operators plan to use Bats technology and will base the firm in Chicago.The deal, a mix of cash and stock, adds to a flurry of dealmaking in the exchange-operator industry -- Deutsche Boerse's $14 billion planned purchase of London Stock Exchange Group would be among the biggest in the industry's history.Shares in Bats have surged 20 percent since Sept. 22, the day before Bloomberg News reported the companies were in talks. They jumped 2.2 percent before the opening bell on the stock market today.The two companies have vastly different roots. Lenexa, Kansas-based Bats was founded in 2005 by high-speed trader David Cummings of Tradebot Systems Inc., and its trading software is regarded as among the industry's best. Bats went public in April.CBOE still runs open-outcry pits in Chicago, a throwback to an era when humans instead of computers drove trading -- though it does run the all-electronic C2 exchange, too.CBOE said it will cut costs in part by moving to a single trading platform. The companies expect annual cost synergies of $50 million within three years of the transaction's completion. Those will increase to $65 million within five years.The deal, which still requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of 2017, the companies said.

The Nasdaq lost 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average was off 0.7%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.6%.Volume was running below Thursday's levels at the same hour. Declining stocks led advancers significantly.Energy, mining and some medical industry groups were the weakest in Friday's trading. Crude oil prices were down 4% to $44.50 a barrel on reports that Saudi Arabia is not expecting an agreement among major producers on freezing oil output. Curbing production would lift crude prices, but such an agreement has been elusive.Solar energy, cybersecurity, PC hardware, department stores and steel makers were up more than 1%.Yahoo (YHOO) fell 3.5% in heavy volume.

327,CBOE,"The stock market remained lower in afternoon trading Monday, with the energy sector one of the few bright spots.The main indexes were at session lows. The Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.8% each as the S&P 500 declined 0.7%. Volume was tracking lower. Losers led winners by 17-to-9 on the NYSE and by 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Crude prices rose 3.5% to just over $46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. There was some movement toward a sidebar deal on output limits ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the International Energy Forum in Algeria.Energy, metals and some cyclical stocks were the best performing in today's trading. Fiber optics, the No. 1-rated industry group of IBD's 197 groups, was the weakest, down nearly 4%. Group leader Acacia Communications (ACIA) gapped down to a 9% loss.

CBOE shares fell 3% below the 69.58 buy point of a cup with handle.Twitter (TWTR) slipped 3% in busy trading, as the stock gave back a modest portion of Friday's 21% surge. The stock soared on rumors of a buyout. But on Monday, Oppenheimer downgraded the social media company to underperform, saying an elevated valuation should not be expected given slowing user growth and falling user engagement.Carnival (CCL) erased an early gain sparked by its better-than-expected earnings. Despite that, and the fact that the cruise line operator raised guidance, the stock was down nearly 2% in triple its usual volume. The stock met resistance at the 200-day moving average for at least the fifth time since May, as the stock continued in a long consolidation.Thor Industries (THO) was up nearly 1% in active trading ahead of the RV maker's earnings report after the close of trading. Analysts expect a profit of $1.33 a share, up 2% from the year-ago period. That would continue a trend of slower EPS gains, although the stock is near highs after finding support at the 50-day moving average two weeks ago.RELATED:Twitter Price Tag Unlikely To Top $17; Disney Downgraded; Marriott ToutedOil Jumps As Deal Hopes Rekindled Ahead Of Wednesday's MeetingThis Hoosier Stock Is Near Buy Point After Joining S&P 600

328,CBOE,"Anxiety may have been hard to locate in the U.S. equity market before Tuesday's downdraft. But that didn't mean it wasn't there.One measure of expected turbulence, the relative cost of options that pay when stocks decline vs. those that appreciate when they rise, jumped to the highest level ever recorded just before the S&P 500 Index buckled on Tuesday. Call it the new normal for investors conditioned to expect the worst when it comes to politics, the economy and corporate earnings.Even with Hillary Clinton taking her biggest lead in the polls since August vs. Republican Donald Trump, the relative cost of hedging a 5% decline in an exchange traded fund tracking the S&P 500 is twice the cost of betting on a gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. High readings in the indicator known as skew came even as the CBOE Volatility Index spent the previous three weeks trading below 14, on average.Blame it partly on the experience of investors during the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, when weeks of calm was shattered by a political event and options worked in damping the resulting plunge. The market may be seeing its smallest fluctuations in more than a year, but traders remain on alert for events that could whip up declines.""If there's a potential shock to the system when you have low volatility, that boosts skew,"" Matt Friedman, senior vice president of options trading at Convergex in New York, said by phone. ""Investors are bracing for potential downside risk, regardless of how likely it is. At the same time, you're seeing people dismiss the potential upside.""Upheavals that shatter prevailing calm in equities are becoming more frequent. Markets were shocked out of one of the longest stretches of tranquillity ever recorded last month when $600 billion was erased from the value of shares on Sept. 9. In the last two years there have been five similarly extreme shifts in volatility — as many as occurred in the prior two decades, according to data complied by Deutsche Bank AG and Bloomberg.The Deutsche Bank study examined instances of rapid mood transitions in U.S. equities, counting times when realized volatility in the S&P 500 surged from a very low level, below 10, to above 20 within six weeks. On that basis, the market has seen its prevailing calm broken five times since 2014, matching the total in the preceding 20 years — a stretch that encompasses two full-blown bear markets.At the same time, tools for hedging stocks or betting on declines are proliferating. Trading in exchange traded funds and notes tied to the VIX has gone from nothing a decade ago to hundreds of millions of shares a day. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN recorded more volume on Sept. 13 than any company in the S&P 500, with a record 110 million shares changing hands.In the options market, traders are paying about twice as much for two-month contracts protecting against a 5% drop in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, relative to bullish ones, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure reached a record on Sept. 30, the data show.That's happened as Clinton has built about a 5-point lead on Trump in a race that includes third-party candidates, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. The forecaster FiveThirtyEight on Tuesday gave Clinton an 83.6% change of winning in its polls-only model, approaching her high of 89.2% in mid-August.After closing the gap on Clinton during September, the Trump campaign has experienced setbacks in recent days, including a tape released on Oct. 7 of the Republican candidate making lewd comments about women. Now, less than a month before Election Day, the Republican party is erupting into open warfare, with Trump pledging to campaign unshackled from party leaders.""There's some frustration about the state of political discourse in the country, and the rancor between and even within the two sides,"" said John Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management, which oversees about $230 billion. ""There's concern about how we're going to possibly stitch this back into one working country again. That's weighed on peoples' nerves and weighed on their sense of security.""The high skew on the S&P 500 ETF stands in contrast to trading in VIX contracts, which show investors only expecting a post-election, single-day move of about 1.6% for the S&P 500, according to Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors in New York. That's less than half the average following the past two presidential votes and in line with the historical average dating back to 1968.Wall Street forecasters also don't appear worried about the possibility of a major election-based decline. They foresee the S&P 500 finishing the year at 2,175, according to a survey of 19 strategists. That's 1.8% higher than the index's closing price on Tuesday.""People are concentrating so much on hedging, they might be overlooking a relief rally,"" said Friedman. ""We're up 5% on the year, yet it seems like everyone is still waiting to be sold on why we can continue higher.""

331,CBOE,"Sector investing is many things to many people.Sector equity ETFs allow seasoned investors to make tactical bets for successful investing. They're tools that even the average investor can put to strategic use, for fine-tuning portfolios or managing risk. They can serve as single-stock substitutes for savvy investors looking to harvest tax losses too.Sector exchange traded funds continue to find their way into investors' portfolios, even if asset growth slowed in 2015 for the first time since 2008.There were 321 sector equity ETFs holding $298.72 billion at the end of 2015 vs. 261 funds with $129.85 billion at the end of 2010, according to Morningstar data.Intense stock market swings since 2015 have highlighted the influence that sectors can have on portfolio returns.

332,CBOE,"In a volatile environment, choosing the right sector to buy into, or the right sector to avoid, is more important than ever, according to ETF issuer Charles Schwab.There are sector-investing holdouts, too. They see these funds as pricey options that just aren't worth it for most investors.Recently, IBD discussed the issues tied to sector investing with a panel of ETF investing pros.IBD: How does a sector-based approach help investors?Jeremy Held is director of research and SVP for Denver-based ALPS Advisors, a $14.12 billion asset manager that provides innovative investment solutions: Sector exposure is one of the most important decisions an investor can make. A recent Morningstar study concluded that sector exposure may in fact be more important that style, country or regional factors when explaining the risk and return characteristics of an investor’s portfolio.  Investors can take advantage of sectors by using them to customize portfolios based on risk tolerance, or to gain exposure to attractive investment themes without taking on single-stock risk.IBD: Why is sector investing more important than ever in a volatile market?Held: While keeping track of sectors is always important, it is particularly relevant in a period of heightened volatility. As volatility increases, the performance difference between sector winners and losers is magnified. For example, when the VIX (the CBOE volatility index or ""fear index"") averages more than 20 for a given calendar year, the return difference between the best- and worst-performing sectors is 50% greater than in years when the VIX is below 20. In other words, being exposed (or not exposed) to the right sector has a much greater portfolio impact when volatility is high.IBD: What are the main strategies within sector-based ETF investing?Held: There are typically three sector strategies in the marketplace today:Mean reversion strategies are based on the concept of buying the losers, whereas momentum strategies are based on buying the winners. An equal sector strategy, as the name suggests, is based on maintaining equal exposure to every sector of the market. All three strategies -- for different reasons -- have proven to be very successful over time under the right circumstances.A mean reversion strategy tends to work very well during periods of higher volatility and when sector leadership changes rapidly, such as when the tech bubble crashed in 2000 and during the financial crisis of 2008-09. A momentum strategy works in the exact opposite scenario -- when volatility is low and trends persist for long periods of time. An equal sector strategy seeks to capture the best of both worlds. This strategy has enough exposure to every sector to participate in a momentum market rally, while also minimizing the negative impact of any one sector during a time of market volatility.IBD: How should investors go about using sector ETFs strategically as well as tactically?Held: Sectors are often used strategically as buildings blocks to help investors customize portfolios. For example, more conservative investors often overweight defensive sectors such as utilities, health care and consumer staples. These sectors tend to perform better in market downturns and have actually led the market in each of the last 12 recessions since World War II. By contrast, investors that are looking to participate more in the market’s upside will tend to overweight more cyclical sectors, such as consumer discretionary, technology or industrials.In addition to being used as part of a long-term investment strategy, sectors are also frequently used as a stock substitute. Using sector ETFs, rather than individual securities, allows investors to obtain exposure to a particular investment theme without taking the risk of a single stock.IBD: How do you approach sector investing in your ETF-based portfolio strategies?Douglas Sandler is chief U.S. equity officer at RiverFront Investment Group, a Virginia-based firm that manages $5.3 billion in assets. RiverFront is the second-largest ETF strategist in terms of assets, and its solutions often combine strategic asset allocation with shorter-term tactical tilts: ETF selection is generally the last step of our U.S. equity investment process. Our investment process always starts with identifying the stocks that we believe offer the most attractive risk/reward profiles. This is determined based on our three cornerstones of investing -- value, quality and momentum. Then we build a ""target portfolio"" that maximizes the number of attractive stocks for a defined level of risk. Finally, we select ETFs that replicate as many of the characteristics and biases in the ""target portfolio.""Vern Sumnicht is CEO of iSectors LLC, a Wisconsin-based money manager and ETF strategist with $175 million in AUM. ISectors emphasizes sound asset allocation as the foundation for investment portfolios: We don’t approach ETF sector investing using a momentum-based sector rotation or market timing strategy. Instead, our iSectors Post-MPT Allocations use an asset allocation (Modern Portfolio Theory) approach to sector investing.Rather than attempting to rotate into the top-performing market sectors, we are looking to allocate our portfolio among market sectors in such a way as to optimize our returns and maintain a low threshold of loss (risk).We focused our attention on slicing up the investment universe into nine low-correlated, primary sectors: basic materials, financials, real estate, Treasury bonds, technology, utilities, health care, gold, and energy.All other sectors are highly correlated to one of these nine sectors. However, these nine sectors have the lowest correlation to each other. Therefore, these are the primary sectors or asset classes we use to allocate our clients’ portfolios.IBD: How do you determine momentum or the loss of momentum in equity sectors?Sandler: We use momentum in two ways: confirmation and risk management.From a confirmation standpoint, we believe the best investments represent attractive value and appear most likely to have that value recognized by the market over the next three to six months. For this reason, both value and momentum are two of the three cornerstones of our investment discipline.Momentum is also an important tool in our risk-management process, because it helps us gauge whether our convictions are either early or wrong. RiverFront uses tools that measure momentum, like relative strength, in our entry and exit decisions because they offer independent, unbiased feedback on investment decisions.Sumnicht: Our iSectors Post-MPT Allocations don’t use momentum for determining which equity sectors to invest in. Academic studies and historical returns from momentum-based products cast doubts on the effectiveness of these kinds of strategies in the equity market. Given stocks’ tendency to revert to the mean, fundamental measures of undervaluation based on price-earnings ratio, book value, debt, and earnings growth factors have a greater chance to determine attractive equities than price momentum strategies.IBD: What mistakes do investors make when using sector ETFs?Sandler: The No. 1 mistake by the average investor when picking an ETF is focusing on what we believe to be the wrong characteristics: fees, liquidity and brand familiarity. In our opinion, those are three of the least useful. How an ETF performs ultimately is a function of how it is constructed. We believe every ETF has a bias, like a weighting methodology that favors small caps, or an overweight to a certain industry, or a concentration in just a handful of stocks. We believe it is these biases that will impact returns far more than fees, liquidity or brand familiarity.Sumnicht: For most investors, it is probably a mistake to try to time the trading of sector ETFs using momentum-based strategies. Although we re-optimize our allocation on a monthly basis, our iSectors Post-MPT Allocation strategy wouldn’t be considered a tactical momentum or market timing strategy. The difference lies in the fact that we are always fully invested and never moving in and out of cash, which is typical of a tactical or market timing strategy. In addition, we don’t focus on maintaining a portfolio of top-performing sectors, which is typical of a momentum strategy. Our iSectors Post-MPT strategy focuses on maintaining an optimal, risk-adjusted allocation using the nine primary ETF-based sectors we have described.Held: The biggest mistake investors make is the unintended sector risk that lies inside mutual funds or ETFs that they already own. These risks are often masked by the fact that these funds typically hold a large number of securities, offering the illusion of diversification. However, it is not uncommon, particularly for smart-beta or factor-based funds, to be concentrated in a very small number of sectors.For example, funds that offer exposure to themes such as low-volatility or high-dividend stocks. These are often sector funds in disguise, with heavy concentrations in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples or telecom stocks.Investors are well-advised to look under the hood of their mutual funds and ETFs to make sure they are not making unintended sector bets.IBD: Why are sector equity ETFs not part of Betterment portfolios?Dan Egan is director of behavioral finance and investing for Betterment, an automated investing firm in New York City with $4 billion in AUM. Robo-advisors such as Betterment are roiling the financial advisor industry by offering investors low-cost portfolios of exchange traded funds through online platforms: First, let's be clear that Betterment's portfolio includes exposure to all sectors. We simply use very broad-based, low-cost exchange traded funds to do it.Sector-specific ETFs have a strong tendency towards higher expense ratios and higher turnover, which lowers the investor's take-home returns. Holding the same stocks as Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI) using a sector-ETF based portfolio would cost you about 10 times more (57 basis points vs. 5 basis points). And that’s just the expense ratio. They have higher turnover costs and bid-ask spreads too.So why do people use sector-specific ETFs? To avoid, or double-down, on certain sectors. An active manager will generally use sector-focused funds when they believe they can produce better-than-market returns by varying exposures.Betterment believes it can improve its investors' returns in ways that don’t require using higher-cost funds.IBD: Sector bets may not be ideal for every passive investor, but how about those willing to assume slightly more risk for a shot at higher rewards?Egan: Why not simply increase your allocation to small-cap, value and emerging market stocks?IBD: Have you ever considered using a set of sector ETFs to construct a broadly diversified ETF portfolio?Egan: Yes. It could be useful for tax-loss harvesting, as there are more chances for idiosyncratic losses. But the higher expense ratios make it a losing proposition.IBD: Sector ETFs can be used strategically as well as tactically. Does shutting them out do a disservice to investors?Egan: No. It reduces the chance for disappointment and concentration risk. Making investing unnecessarily complex and more costly is the disservice.IBD: How do you view the growing popularity of sector ETFs?Egan: Well, I have to admit I was unaware they are increasingly popular. Size and style ETFs have 300% more assets under management in them than sector ETFs. So I’d say sector ETFs have a lot of room to get more popular.Image at top of page provided by Shutterstock.

334,CBOE,"The largest gold ETF spiked after the Fed signaled a slower, more cautious pace of future rate hikes Wednesday. The dollar bullish exchange traded fund tumbled simultaneously to its lowest level since the February market bottom.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) punched up 2.6% after the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Policymakers also reduced projections for the number of rate hikes in 2016 to two from four, according to news reports.PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP) slid more than 1% to as low as 24.78, less than a dime away from its Feb. 11 nadir.Earlier on the stock market today, GLD had traded in the red, virtually giving up all its gains since March 1.""Most markets, including the precious metals, are treading water"" ahead of the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting this afternoon, Kitco senior technical analyst Jim Wyckoff wrote Wednesday morning.Gold's gains in late trade came as the dollar pulled back after the Fed's dovish announcement.Gold bugs cheered the decision to hold off on a March rate hike.

335,CBOE,"In today’s volatile markets, alternative strategy ETFs have been popping up on investors’ radar screens as potential ways to diversify or to take advantage of some of the market swings.But various types of investors highly under-use the investment segment, according to a recent study by Cerulli Associates. Why is that, and what is the investments' real value-added in a portfolio?Traditional investments involve simply buying, holding or selling stocks and bonds, either individually or in diversified portfolios, including ETFs and mutual funds. Alternative strategies usually focus on nontraditional investments and may include long/short, leveraged, inverse, managed futures, arbitrage and hedge fund investing.The largest ETFs available in the market include IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Tracker (QAI), WisdomTree Managed Futures Strategy Fund (WDTI), IQ Merger Arbitrage (MNA) and First Trust Long/Short Equity (FTLS). QAI is the largest with assets of $1.1 billion, followed by WDTI with $200 million, MNA $122 with million and FTLS at $113 million.Aside from QAI, which has an average trading volume of over 220,000 shares, these ETFs trade an average of 26,000 to 38,000 shares a day, which makes them not as liquid as many traditional investments. Their fees are at or slightly below 1% -- not the cheapest when compared to other asset classes, either.While institutional investors have shown interest in alternative strategy ETFs, ""in the financial advisor community (representing retail investors), there still is a lack of adoption,"" noted Jennifer Muzerall, associate director at Cerulli Associates. The Cerulli report points out that 2015 allocations to those funds range from 5% for conservative investors to approximately 7% for aggressive investors.Muzerall cites a lack of education in the advisor community as well as difficulties with indexing alternative ETF products. Those funds experienced nearly $10 billion in outflow in January as investors flocked to the safe haven of taxable bond funds.""The alternative ETFs universe is a very small fraction of the overall ETF universe,"" said Muzerall. ""There're only 340 alternative ETFs in a landscape of over 1,700 products, and the asset size is very small.""That said, 45 alternative ETFs were introduced in 2015, making it the most robust product development for alternatives since 2007, the Cerulli study says. A major advantage that those ETFs offer investors is ""getting access to what's historically been known as harder strategies to get exposure to on the retail side,"" said Muzerall.Alternative strategy ETFs offer investors a way to diversify, including adding potential downside protection. Morningstar analyst Josh Charlson says that a typical allocation ranges from 5% to 10% in a portfolio.Charlson notes that the strategy is usually more suitable for more sophisticated investors. ""I don't think it's something you just go into because there is market volatility. I think it's something to have in your portfolio all the time as a strategic allocation.”ETF manager WisdomTree recently launched CBOE S&P 500 PutWrite Strategy (PUTW), which tracks the index of the same name. The fund's goal: provide investors with the opportunity to reduce volatility in the S&P 500 index. The fund collects income by writing monthly at-the-money put options on the S&P 500, thereby betting that the index will not be down by the end of the month.""What we wanted to do is give investors a way to take advantage of this strategy, which is very well known and used in the industry, which is writing puts and collecting put premiums on the S&P 500, and do it inside an ETF,"" said WisdomTree Chief Investment Strategist Luciano Siracusano.If the S&P 500 rises by the end of the month, the option expires and the fund keeps the income. The fund is still tiny, at $3.8 million in assets, but carries a relatively cheap fee of 0.38%.

336,CBOE,"Investors fled U.S. stocks for the safety of longer-term bond ETFs Tuesday, in the process driving up a key volatility ETN for the third straight day.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average snapped a five-session winning streak as jittery investors digested weak Chinese trade data and await key monetary policy decisions at home and abroad.IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) popped 3.8% on the stock market today, marking its third advance in as many days.Its rally reflects renewed fears about crude oil prices, a weakening Chinese economy and global growth concerns, as well as investors’ anxiety that these problems may tip the U.S. into a recession.VXX provides access to equity market volatility through the CBOE Volatility Index ( or, simply, ""the VIX,"" a trusted gauge of fear in the markets) futures.“If you own this ETN, you are expecting that volatility will increase over the coming month relative to the current month,” Monish Shah, head of ETF trading at Mizuho Securities USA, recently told IBD.Recent gains for the VXX signal a bearish turn in sentiment after a three-week rally for major U.S. indexes.The S&P 500 index hit bottom Feb. 11 and has gained 8.3% since then. The VIX index fell 32% in the same period.Despite that decline for VXX, the ETN actually absorbed $524 million from Feb. 11 to date, including $415 million in the last week alone, according to Shah. That's more than half the assets in the $997.2 million exchange traded note.That activity may reflect investors’ concerns that the current rally doesn’t have strong legs, he added.“At the back end, a lot of savvy investors are buying protection at a cheaper level,” Shah said.Investors wanting to hang onto their positions during a market pullback can buy VXX in the hope that its gains will offset any decline in their long positions.In other signs of risk-off sentiment Tuesday, Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV) added 1.6%. Its 89 RS Rating signifies that the long government bond ETF is outperforming 89% all stocks and ETFs tracked by IBD in the past 12 months.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) closed down 0.5% in choppy trade. A member of IBD Leaderboard, GLD broke out of a basing pattern March 3, but has stalled in four days since the breakout.Defensive utility and consumer staples were the only S&P 500 sectors to gain Tuesday.Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) edged up 1% to 47.84, gaining for the fifth consecutive day. The ETF is now poised 2% above a buy point of 47.10. It broke out of a cup-with-handle base Feb. 25 and quickly retrenched before regaining momentum.Here's a look at how the major exchange traded funds tracking various asset classes performed today.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -1.1%, RS 63PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), -0.8%, RS 56SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.6%, RS 63IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), -1.8%, RS 59IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), -2.4%, RS 43IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -1.0%, RS 43Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -1.7%, RS 45SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.5%, RS 91IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), +0.2%, RS 70PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), 0%, RS 66

"
339,CBOE,"Since its initial public offering on June 25, credit reporting agency TransUnion has moved full speed ahead to assure that it stays on the right growth trajectory.
"
340,CBOE,"That trajectory encompasses several growth areas for TransUnion (TRU), which provides risk and information services to businesses and consumers.
"
341,CBOE,"Businesses use its information services for a number of functions, including acquiring new customers, assessing a consumer's ability to pay for services, measuring and managing debt portfolio risk, collecting debt and verifying consumer identities.
"
342,CBOE,"Consumers use its services to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft.
"
343,CBOE,"Different Take On Data
"
344,CBOE,"TransUnion has identified three areas of growth, says Curt Miller, the company's senior vice president of global strategy and M&A.
"
345,CBOE,"The primary drivers are new product development and growth in emerging businesses and geographic markets, he says. The company also continues efforts to boost its core business in such markets as financial services.
"
346,CBOE,"One such product is CreditVision, which TransUnion launched in 2013 and which has been gaining momentum ever since.
"
347,CBOE,"""CreditVision is an example of a different way of looking at the same credit bureau data,"" Miller told IBD.
"
348,CBOE,"Here's why: A traditional credit report is a snapshot in time of a consumer's credit, he says. In contrast, CreditVision looks at the trends that happened to the consumer over time, before the snapshot, to indicate risk level.
"
349,CBOE,"TransUnion is expanding CreditVision in the U.S., thanks partly to a deal with mortgage giant Fannie Mae (FNMA) to provide its trended consumer credit data in the assessment of mortgage applicants.
"
350,CBOE,"During the middle of next year, Fannie Mae will require lenders to used ""trended"" credit data when underwriting single-family borrowers through its automated underwriting system.
"
351,CBOE,"That's where TransUnion comes in. Fannie Mae will integrate trended views from TransUnion's CreditVision product offering into mortgage application assessments, starting in the middle of next year.
"
352,CBOE,"Reporting bureau Equifax (EFX) will also provide trended data to Fannie Mae starting in mid-2016, Fannie Mae said in a press release.
"
353,CBOE,"Stifel analyst Shlomo Rosenbaum says that TransUnion is the only company offering the kind of real-time trended data that CreditVision provides.
"
354,CBOE,"""We understand that (Equifax) is investing to improve its trended data product to be ready for that mid-2016 deadline, and that (rival Experian) does not have a product in that area yet to speak of,"" Rosenbaum noted in a report.
"
355,CBOE,"TransUnion is the last of the Big Three global credit reporting bureaus to go public. Equifax has been trading on the NYSE for a long time, and Experian trades on the London Stock Exchange.
"
356,CBOE,"'Good Flywheel'
"
357,CBOE,"TransUnion priced its IPO at 22.50, opened at 24.62 and closed the day at 25.40. The stock has since traded in a tight range and currently trades near 26.
"
358,CBOE,"""People need to get more familiarity,"" Rosenbaum said. ""When they see it puts up good numbers and good growth, you will see more investors getting behind the story. It seems like they've built a good flywheel for strong growth.""
"
359,CBOE,"TransUnion's third-quarter numbers were pretty decent. Revenue rose 15% from a year earlier to $389.1 million, well above analyst consensus estimates. Earnings came in at 30 cents a share, 2 cents above analyst consensus estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
360,CBOE,"""We experienced robust demand from business customers and consumers for core and new products across our markets,"" CEO Jim Peck said on a Q3 conference call.
"
361,CBOE,"Among TransUnion's strengths during the quarter was its CreditVision business, which saw revenue more than double during the quarter.
"
362,CBOE,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect TransUnion's full-year earnings to rise 24% in 2016 and another 12% in 2017.
"
363,CBOE,"New products should help fuel that growth.
"
364,CBOE,"""We continue to innovate around CreditVision,"" Miller said.
"
365,CBOE,"For example, TransUnion in October released CreditVision Link, which combines alternative data with trended credit bureau data to help score even more of the population that can't normally be scored.
"
366,CBOE,"CreditVision Link's alternative data assets include property, tax and deed records, checking/debit accounts and payday lending information. These alternative data sources have proven to accurately score more than 90% of applicants whom traditional models would otherwise return as no-hit or thin-file.
"
367,CBOE,"Going International
"
368,CBOE,"TransUnion also has taken CreditVision internationally to Canada and Hong Kong, and it has plans to continue expansion into more foreign markets.
"
369,CBOE,"An example of an emerging business segment is in health care, where TransUnion provides hospitals with several solutions. Its products have helped more than 1,000 hospitals and thousands of physician partners identify over $5 billion in uncompensated care revenue, Miller says.
"
370,CBOE,"As part of its initiatives in its core business, TransUnion is taking steps to get closer to its customers, he says. These steps include bringing on sales professionals and consultants who have experience and backgrounds working for TransUnion's customers.
"
371,CBOE,"""This gives them the ability to see what customers' problems are and partner with customers to solve their problems,"" said Miller.

372,CBOE,"TransUnion is a part of IBD's Financial Services-Specialty industry group. It has an 86 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

The stock has since traded in a tight range and currently trades near 26.TransUnion provides risk and information services to businesses and consumers. It offers consumer reports, risk scores and analytics to businesses, primarily in credit risk management.Businesses use its information services for a number of functions, including acquiring new customers, assessing a consumer's ability to pay for services, measuring and managing debt portfolio risk, collecting debt and verifying consumer identities.Consumers use its services to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. TransUnion has operations in more than 30 countries.Favorable TrendsTransUnion's business has been heating up in the U.S. amid a strengthening housing market, rising auto sales and a brightening jobs picture. All of these trends have led to increased demand for financing and the credit checks that go along with it.Stifel analyst Shlomo Rosenbaum, who initiated coverage on TransUnion with a buy rating, says the stock provides a ""good opportunity"" for investors, in part because the company ""should have good numbers"" moving forward.""The consumer credit environment is getting better domestically,"" Rosenbaum told IBD. ""They're positioned well in some good growth markets internationally, and they've gotten into some other domestic areas that have growth, like public records data and parts of the health care market.""TransUnion noted in filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission that for the past three years, it has seen improvement in the U.S. consumer lending market, ""including mortgage refinancings resulting from low long-term mortgage rates, an improving housing market, increased auto loans, a decrease in unemployment, an increase in consumer confidence and an increase in demand for (its) marketing services.""These factors have helped drive improved financial results in all of its segments for the first three months of 2015 and all of 2014 and 2013.""The consumer credit environment is getting better in the U.S.,"" Rosenbaum said. ""We're seeing a little loosening of credit, banks (are) more willing to lend, and consumers are less nervous to borrow incrementally.""TransUnion is one of the three largest global credit reporting bureaus, and the last of the three to go public. The other two are Equifax (EFX) and Dublin-based Experian, which trades on the London Stock Exchange.TransUnion had filed for an IPO in 2011 but withdrew the offering a year later after it was sold by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners and the Pritzker family to Advent International and a unit of Goldman Sachs Group (GS). Post-IPO, Advent and Goldman continue to own a majority stake in TransUnion.Although consumer credit data is a core service at TransUnion, it has expanded beyond that core.In a report, JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman said that the company has ""extended into data sets underutilized"" by the consumer credit reporting agencies. They include public records data such as court judgments, bankruptcies and driver history data, including traffic tickets and other court records.""While modest in scope, these unique offerings are growing quickly and morph TransUnion from a traditional (credit reporting agency) into a diversified risk management solutions firm with an expanded addressable market,"" Steinerman noted.TransUnion also has been upping its game internationally, especially in India, Africa and Hong Kong.For example, last year the company increased its equity interest in Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd., or CIBIL, from 27.5% to a majority stake of 55%. CIBIL is the biggest credit bureau in India, Rosenbaum says.Bullish OutlookIn the U.S., TransUnion is a bit smaller than Equifax and Experian in terms of market share, but it's still a major player.The company should see strong earnings gains in coming years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect TransUnion to post full-year adjusted EPS of 96 cents a share. They see EPS rising 23% to $1.18 a share in 2016 and another 12% to $1.32 in 2017.Rosenbaum figures that TransUnion can outperform those expectations.""I think it's going to do well and trade in tandem with Equifax, the closest public company to TransUnion,"" he said. ""In the near term, I see both of these companies being a 'beat and raise' story. That means when they report earnings, they will be above what people expected, and the guidance will go up after that.""TransUnion is well diversified in its customer base. It offers services to customers in financial services, insurance, health care, real estate and other industries.In financial services, it serves almost all of the major banks in all facets of the customer lifecycle, from acquisition through account management and collections. Its CreditVision product, for example, is designed to offer insight into the speed and magnitude of changes in consumer risk over time.Another offering, its AdSurety digital marketing product, lets banks deliver personalized messages on the Internet.In health care, thousands of providers and more than 1,000 hospitals use TransUnion's revenue cycle management product to verify a patient's identity; check a patient's insurance eligibility and ability to pay; estimate patient payment amounts; and, if needed, qualify patients for federal, state and local entitlement programs.Acquisitions have helped TransUnion broaden its lineup. For example, last year it acquired an 87.5% ownership interest in Drivers History Information Sales, which collects traffic violation and criminal court data.TransUnion is a part of IBD's Financial Services-Specialty industry group, where it has an 81 Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Equifax leads the group with a 93 rating. The group also includes CBOE Holdings (CBOE), which has a Composite Rating of 89.

""It's very collaborative.""Traders tend to approach CBOE and say, ""I need an index to measure X"" or ""I need to hedge X,"" Tilly says. They might ask CBOE to help create a benchmark or join in the development of a particular kind of product.Growing With VIXCBOE has recently broadened its global scope. It held its first Europe-based risk management conference near Dublin in 2012, and Tilly says ""the rooms were full when we talked about VIX and volatility.""VIX, which measures volatility of S&P 500 index options, is a fast-growing product for CBOE. Tilly calls VIX ""our greatest success in new product innovation.""When CBOE Holdings went public in 2010, Tilly recalls the heightened interest in volatility. He notes that when global markets are under stress, exposure to volatility measures can prove valuable.""We'd walk into a room ready to go into our pitch book when we'd hear, 'Terrific story. Can you tell me more about VIX? How do I get access to your exchange?'"" he said. ""We came away saying, 'There's an amazing opportunity here.'""VIX volume has soared in 2013.

453,CBOE,"The S&P; 500 marched to its eighth gain in 10 sessions Wednesday and notched a fresh all-time high.

457,CBOE,"If something is volatile, it has a tendency to evaporate rapidly or, according to the Latin root of the word, to be fleeting, transitory.In the stock market and politics, the term often describes a situation that is wildly unstable, prone to upheaval or to change quickly.Most investors prefer a stable climate. Some thrive on market upheaval. In either case, having some sense of when the weather is about to become blustery can be useful.The Fear GaugeOne of the leading tools in such weather-watching is the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, widely known as the VIX.Introduced in 1993, the VIX currently is based on a wide range of call and put option prices for the S&P 500 large-cap index. Often referred to as the ""fear gauge,"" the index is an indicator of market psychology.When a market is in free fall, investors dive in and bid up options prices. Such trading has often caused the index to spike just as the market nears a key upturn.One example: During the sell-off that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the VIX spiked to 43.7 in the week ended Sept. 21, 2001 1. That was its highest mark in almost three years.The S&P 500 turned up the following week, marking a Day 5 follow-through and rallying 25% over the next 3-1/2 months.The VIX only gestures toward shifts of direction, not necessarily the exact start of rallies. On July 23, 2002, for example, the VIX bolted to 44.9. The market climbed for the next four weeks, then turned sharply lower.Three months later, the VIX rebounded to 42.6 in the week ended Oct. 11. The Nasdaq bottomed that week. It posted a 5.1% Day 4 follow-through the following week, signaling a new bull market.Such links have made the index handy as a supplemental tool, often used in concert with other psychological indicators, including the Investors Intelligence Bulls vs. Bears survey and the put-call volume ratio.Still, it shouldn't be mistaken as a hard and fast market indicator. Case in point: October 2008, when the VIX spiked to a record high. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 continued to tumble in four of the next five months. The index showed only a moderate uptick before the market actually bottomed and turned higher in March 2009.None of those stand in for a basic understanding of how markets form bottoms, then launch rallies with follow-throughs. When the VIX stabbed a six-month high of 21.91 on June 24 this year, savvy investors would already have been tuned into the rising Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes, looking for rally-confirming follow-through action.To improve your market timing, use the Big Picture column  to track key market turns, both bottoms and tops.

Action was encouraging, though, for a handful of stocks.Online social networking operator LinkedIn (LNKD) advanced 3% higher in volume that was running modestly above average on a half-session basis.LinkedIn is a Sector Leader, an IBD screen that outperformed the major indexes in the first half of this year. Sector Leaders rose 37% vs. 13% to 14% gains for the major indexes. LinkedIn jumped 55% in the first half of 2013.Another leader showing good action was Time Warner Cable (TWC), which was No. 17 in Tuesday's Big Cap 20 screen. The stock popped 2% higher in volume running almost 40% above average on a half-session basis. Recently, there has been speculation in the media that Apple (AAPL) is nearing a deal to give Time Warner Cable subscribers access to channels via Apple TV.Time Warner Cable gained 16% in the first half, only slightly better than the major indexes.Exchange operator CBOE Holdings (CBOE), which notched a 58% gain in the first half of 2013, strode 0.5% higher in volume running about 35% above average on a half-session basis.On the downside Wednesday, hospital stocks were the worst performers among IBD's 197 industry groups, shedding about 3%. Hospitals are regarded as winners under the U.S. government's new health care law because the changes would reduce the number of uninsured patients who can't or won't pay their hospital bills.But the White House on Tuesday delayed until 2015 a requirement in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that would force businesses to provide health insurance to employees. Companies with 50 or more full-time employees would've had to pay a $2,000 fine to the IRS for each full-time employee not covered.Critics say the law is structured with unintended incentives for small companies to keep their full-time workforce down and increase their part-time workforce. The fine also might stand as a better bargain than providing costly insurance. If that's true, the requirement — as it stands — could persuade companies to drop insurance for employees.And that would be bad news for hospital stocks.In other news, Investors Intelligence released its bulls vs. bears survey. The sentiment indicator found that bullishness among investment advisers rose from 41.7% to 43.8%, while bears fell from 25% to 20.8%.The gauge is contrarian, meaning a high degree of bearishness usually appears before the market advances. The gauge, however, is considered a secondary indicator, which means it has had accuracy problems in the past.

527,CBOE,"With an hour remaining in Thursday's session and the S&P 500 off about 0.8% near session lows and through 1400 in front of Friday's closely watched Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls release, you might think the CBOE Volatility Index would be showing some sympathetic concern.

We don't know for certain, though we can say that with one trader's cup-shaped weekly base in the S&P 500 also resembling a less optimistic lower high double top; neutral prices for protection leave less to the imagination and a great opportunity to reduce risk for both bulls and bears.

But before you think of history needing an encore performance, the euphemistically called ""Fear Gauge"" is continuing to do a couple things right by bulls in the market. 
"
572,CBOE,"Confidence on the part of investors is a good thing. Complacency on the other hand isn't. When the VIX stretches or by more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average, conditions relatively speaking, are prone to a reversion or price move back towards its short-term moving average. In turn, investors can expect the broader market to move inversely lower. While this kind of ""complacency signal"" doesn't catch every top in the broader market, it's pretty darned good historically speaking.

573,CBOE,"In conjunction with absolute price levels on the VIX daily or weekly charts, if we can come by some additional historical evidence of prices being extremely low or high or a slightly more technical read on the current situation; the VIX can be a valuable tool for investors in timing the market better than they might otherwise be able to do using other strategies such as counting distribution days, the health of market leaders and the likes.
"
574,CBOE,"Currently, what's striking about the current lows in the VIX compared to April's is the placement of the 10, 30 and 50-day simple moving averages aligning themselves to suggest the VIX could see lower prices yet before confident behavior grows too complacent and backfires on bulls in the broader market. With the March lows still 14% below at 13.66%, current levels near 16% still historically closer to normal than not and more than five years since we've experienced a real low volatility environment marked by single digits and the S&P 500 sporting a nice uptrend channel versus a decidedly more prone pattern back in April, we'll let the other trader pick tops for the time being.

576,CBOE,"Despite the S&P 500's very flat finish Monday, it wasn't exactly the kind of action associated with your typical dog days of summer. Following last week's continued corrective dip in excess of 4%, the broad market proxy was actually down about 0.85% to fresh relative lows before reversing in the second half of trade.
"
577,CBOE,"So, is now the time to hunt for bargains? While there are no guarantees, we do like what we're seeing in The VIX and the market's most notorious barometer of investor sentiment. Inversely correlated, Monday witnessed the VIX gaining about 4% intraday and striking fresh fearful highs of 27.73% only to reverse and trade down 3.34% at 25.77%. 
"
578,CBOE,"Overall, our view is the action in The VIX is enticing for faster money traders looking to bottom fish. ""Enticing"" is an opinion, but one grounded in more quantitative, mean-reverting tendencies of the euphemistically called fear gauge. This type action can be appreciated historically with the never-to-be-tested boundary of zero, which might only be approached during the most absolute, picture perfect times of investor bliss.

"
583,CBOE,"What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.Despite the S&P 500's very flat finish Monday, it wasn't exactly the kind of action associated with your typical dog days of summer. Following last week's continued corrective dip in excess of 4%, the broad market proxy was actually down about 0.85% to fresh relative lows before reversing in the second half of trade.So, is now the time to hunt for bargains? While there are no guarantees, we do like what we're seeing in The VIX and the market's most notorious barometer of investor sentiment. Inversely correlated, Monday witnessed the VIX gaining about 4% intraday and striking fresh fearful highs of 27.73% only to reverse and trade down 3.34% at 25.77%. Overall, our view is the action in The VIX is enticing for faster money traders looking to bottom fish. ""Enticing"" is an opinion, but one grounded in more quantitative, mean-reverting tendencies of the euphemistically called fear gauge. This type action can be appreciated historically with the never-to-be-tested boundary of zero, which might only be approached during the most absolute, picture perfect times of investor bliss. The actual low is 8.6% from 2006. On the opposite side of the coin and during times of panic, a physical number attached to fear still falls well below infinity.

584,CBOE,"Here we go again? In some ways Monday's bid in the CBOE Volatility Index might look like last Wednesday's panic wherein the sentiment gauge narrowly eclipsed its early April highs. That action you may recall was partly responsible for a fairly strong, reversal set up in the broader market, which we discussed on Thursday. That said, with today's finishing tally of 9.40% to 21.76%, should we see this as a sort of second opportunity and another market dip producing a rip or umm, opening price gap higher?
"
585,CBOE,"Our coined VIX Stretch formula would suggest today's closing highs just in excess of the watched 15% or greater threshold are sufficient. As a mean-reverting instrument, this type of widened relationship is prone to snapping back towards the short-term average in order to normalize conditions on a relative basis. Nonetheless, we don't see Monday's overall VIX evidence nearly as enticing as it was for last week's bulls looking to buy the dip.
"
586,CBOE,"If and as the saying goes, rules were made to be broken, in our mind this is one of those instances where it pays to take a step back and refrain from bargain-hunting instead of blindly following one signal with too much vigor. For one, seasonally bearish technicals courtesy of the ""Worst Six"" calendar period following a very generous ""Best Six"", might be enough evidence to refrain from a second long delta play, sans a bullish follow-through day.
"
587,CBOE,"Additionally, using the VIX as a trading tool is secondary to price action in the broader market. In conjunction with Monday's closing breakdown in the S&P 500 to fresh lows and below double bottom pattern support; that bearish-looking threat trumps short-term panic; which by the looks of historical VIX price charts, still has a ways to go before being an attractive longer-term proposition.

609,CBOE,"Entering the final stretch of Thursday's session, it was largely unsurprising that the S&P 500 was up on the day despite Cisco's (CSCO) below views outlook due to macro-economic conditions.

614,CBOE,"With an hour remaining in Thursday's session and the S&P 500 off about 0.8% near session lows and through 1400 in front of Friday's closely watched Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls release, you might think the CBOE Volatility Index would be showing some sympathetic concern.

We don't know for certain, though we can say that with one trader's cup-shaped weekly base in the S&P 500 also resembling a less optimistic lower high double top; neutral prices for protection leave less to the imagination and a great opportunity to reduce risk for both bulls and bears.

620,CBOE,"The stock market showed no quit Thursday as buyers had the upper hand again. Tech stocks led again and the S&P 500 made a fresh high. Wall Street liked news that weekly jobless claims fell unexpectedly ahead of Friday's employment report. An interest rate cut in the eurozone also fueled positive sentiment. The Nasdaq had the leadership baton again, rising…
"
621,CBOE,"For traders with maybe more than a couple growth stocks and possibly in names which have less-than-adequate put and call liquidity, the choice of portfolio protection, other than a stop-loss, may seem out of reach or even out of the question. However, real protection is available indirectly if one looks to the broader market for help. By finding one's overall portfolio dollar exposure to the broader market with the help of beta, then using an instrument such as the SP-500 and its very liquid options, the trader can hedge the portfolio with the proper amount of insurance with a simple long put position.
"
622,CBOE,"""What's Beta you ask?"" Beta is simply a measure of how a stock moves in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock in question has a history of tracking the market in percent terms, both up and down. One name typically very much in-sync or in-tune with the daily ups and downs of the major averages is computer device goliath Apple (AAPL). Unsurprisingly, with its stock movement so closely-correlated to the likes of the S&P 500, AAPL shares currently maintain a very close or nearly matching beta of 0.91.
"
623,CBOE,"The beta value can be found on Yahoo! Finance under a stock's ""Key Statistics"" page. Readings well-below 1.0, like with many utilities names, are less volatile. Stocks which have beta values greater than 1.0, as one might expect to find with growth stocks, generally see greater percent swings up and down compared to the broader market. For instance, No. 1 ranked Questcor Pharmaceutical (QCOR) within the IBD 50 currently has a beta of 1.60 which implies it's 160% more volatile in percent terms than the SP-500. Thus if the index dropped 1.0%, we'd expect QCOR to be down 1.60% to keep the relationship intact.
"
624,CBOE,"While a bit more complicated and an index hedging strategy doesn't guard against company-specific risks, it is an alternative to simply having a stop loss in mind and ultimately, no steadfast guarantees of getting filled near one's ideal exit point. So, how's it done? Let's say you have $50K in four growth stocks and each one has a Beta of 2.00. In order to make an effective put hedge for this portfolio's real market exposure, the trader would multiply the dollar risk of $50K by the Beta of 2.00. The resulting figure of $100K is the portfolio's Beta value or risk exposure and the amount the trader would want to hedge.
"
625,CBOE,"Using the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and shares near $136, one purchased ATM put contract is the equivalent of $13,600 in protection, minus the cost of the put itself, which provides this type of portfolio security. Thus, for a portfolio with a Beta value or risk exposure of $100K, the trader could purchase 7 contracts to come up with a simple yet effective hedge that covers, in theory at least, about 95% of the systemic market risk ($13,600 x 7 = $95,200) embedded in the portfolio.
"
626,CBOE,"With premiums not too far off recent five year lows and when compared to underlying market volatility, protection is still quite affordable overall based on current CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" levels near 18%. What's more, with traders having the availability to let a simple long put strategy protect a portfolio with short-term Weeklys, Quarterlies or regular monthly contracts in the S&P 500; the decision to look at this kind of portfolio insurance makes all the more sense and likely cents for a diverse but similar group of traders always looking to manage risk more effectively.

Beta is simply a measure of how a stock moves in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock in question has a history of tracking the market in percent terms, both up and down. One name typically very much in-sync or in-tune with the daily ups and downs of the major averages is computer device goliath Apple (AAPL). Unsurprisingly, with its stock movement so closely-correlated to the likes of the S&P 500, AAPL shares currently maintain a very close or nearly matching beta of 0.91.The beta value can be found on Yahoo! Finance under a stock's ""Key Statistics"" page. Readings well-below 1.0, like with many utilities names, are less volatile. Stocks which have beta values greater than 1.0, as one might expect to find with growth stocks, generally see greater percent swings up and down compared to the broader market. For instance, No. 1 ranked Questcor Pharmaceutical (QCOR) within the IBD 50 currently has a beta of 1.60 which implies it's 160% more volatile in percent terms than the SP-500. Thus if the index dropped 1.0%, we'd expect QCOR to be down 1.60% to keep the relationship intact.While a bit more complicated and an index hedging strategy doesn't guard against company-specific risks, it is an alternative to simply having a stop loss in mind and ultimately, no steadfast guarantees of getting filled near one's ideal exit point. So, how's it done? Let's say you have $50K in four growth stocks and each one has a Beta of 2.00. In order to make an effective put hedge for this portfolio's real market exposure, the trader would multiply the dollar risk of $50K by the Beta of 2.00. The resulting figure of $100K is the portfolio's Beta value or risk exposure and the amount the trader would want to hedge.Using the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and shares near $136, one purchased ATM put contract is the equivalent of $13,600 in protection, minus the cost of the put itself, which provides this type of portfolio security. Thus, for a portfolio with a Beta value or risk exposure of $100K, the trader could purchase 7 contracts to come up with a simple yet effective hedge that covers, in theory at least, about 95% of the systemic market risk ($13,600 x 7 = $95,200) embedded in the portfolio.With premiums not too far off recent five year lows and when compared to underlying market volatility, protection is still quite affordable overall based on current CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" levels near 18%. What's more, with traders having the availability to let a simple long put strategy protect a portfolio with short-term Weeklys, Quarterlies or regular monthly contracts in the S&P 500; the decision to look at this kind of portfolio insurance makes all the more sense and likely cents for a diverse but similar group of traders always looking to manage risk more effectively.What do you think?

628,CBOE,"With less than 45 minutes remaining Tuesday, virtualization-based and cloud computing outfit VMware (VMW) is staging a nice weekly chart breakout from a handle that's now testing its mid-pivot of 104.38 within a weekly chart seven-month corrective, double-bottom base.

629,CBOE,"Coupled with its ""Best in Group"" EPS and SMR Ratings, what's not to like about VMW from a bullish vantage point? Well, maybe it's today's above-average, but still less-than-compelling volume failing to truly confirm the breakout? Or maybe traders like me find a slump in the CBOE Volatility Index to five-year lows and intraday stretch / differential of 20% below its 10-day simple moving average to be a warning flag for fresh bullish initiations in the market? 
"
630,CBOE,"The good news is the option, pardon the pun, of participating in a breakout under such conditions might deserve a bit more consideration if traders look to VMW's calls and / or put markets for help. We wrote as much in the first hour of trade over at Optionetics today in our featured Trader's Radar piece with our attention directed towards VMW's April or July vertical markets for bullish positioning. 
"
631,CBOE,"While there are a host of variations on the vertical when one thinks about using either calls or puts, as well as dreaming about all the possibilities involving VMW's near and surrounding money strikes, limited and reduced risk are ubiquitous and qualities we find very attractive in today's market environment. Along with decent liquidity which makes the dream of a vertical a very real possibility for those so inclined, we can't but help to think it's also a good way to stay grounded rather than having one's head too far up in the clouds.

633,CBOE,"The main indexes Friday suffered their biggest percentage losses in more than six weeks, but lower volume eased concerns. The Nasdaq stumbled 0.8%, while the S&P 500 trimmed 0.7%.

"
634,CBOE,"With the S&P 500 finishing off 1.14% Monday, is the broader market's nascent correction just getting started or is a three percent, four-day pullback enough to rally the bulls into action looking forward? Only time will tell of course, but the option market may be providing investors an early heads up that the end is near and not in a bad sort of way. 
"
635,CBOE,"While we've come a long way the past six months off the October corrective lows, 32% in the S&P 500, key support provided from the May 2011 highs and 50-day simple moving average are still holding despite the one, two punch of disappointing nonfarm payrolls on Friday and hotter-than-expected CPI data out of China. Some will point to investors sensing ""QE3"" or additional monetary stimulus by the Fed is back on the table again and responsible for market prices not tumbling further. 
"
636,CBOE,"That may very well be true, but so is the fact the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" made a nice move on Monday towards deflating a bull more than a bit full of itself the past couple weeks. Witnessed today and for the first time in over a month, the market's notorious sentiment gauge finally turned fearful of something other than the fear of missing out; namely fear which goes hand-in-hand with investors convinced of lower market prices.

637,CBOE,"At intraday highs Monday the VIX jumped about 18% above its 10-day simple moving average before closing narrowly lower at 18.44% and roughly 15.5% above the key short-term technical line. Why is this line and relationship important? As a mean-reverting instrument, the VIX will never collapse to zero or go so high as to think even the sky isn't the limit. 
"
638,CBOE,"Admittedly, at times the concept of mean reversion doesn't mean that much. Boundaries maybe previously thought unthinkable have been tested with the VIX hitting nearly 90% in 2008 and a full 50% higher than the 60% level struck during the dot.com bubble. 
"
639,CBOE,"Most often though and even when the VIX is doing the occasional or a prolonged bout of the unthinkable, short-term panics above the 10-day simple moving average are very prone to being recalibrated back towards more neutralized levels; even in a mad money market.

647,CBOE,"Entering the last half hour of trade, bulls haven't managed to roll up their proverbial sleeves and gotten to work following much stronger-than-expected jobs data. That said, with only very modest losses confined to the inside candle variety and given Friday's less-than-friendly credit market drivers from across-the-pond, all told, the action looks more than a bit constructive. 
"
648,CBOE,"Additionally, not only have all the majors held their ground above 200-day simple moving average support, the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" has continued to flash signs of a market looking forward to more price stability on the heels of a very volatile fourth quarter of trading. 
"
649,CBOE,"Intraday, the VIX is off about 3.8% near 20.70%. The price action puts the notorious sentiment gauge back in a testing position of recent multi-month lows after shaping a countertrend rally centered on its 10-day simple moving average while staying below its 200-day simple moving average.

650,CBOE,"Net, net and as discussed on Wednesday, current readings in the VIX continue to hold promise for bulls. Despite Friday's rising Spanish debt yields and a slumping euro currency, the VIX has failed to take notice and perk up.

651,CBOE,"As the VIX nears 20%, the gauge is closing in on the upper boundary of more historically normalized pricing which we see as in the high teens to about 20%.

654,CBOE,"Bulls are finally closing in on investor sentiment, which has the earmarks of a potential bottom following a correction of more than six weeks and approaching 8% in the S&P 500. 
"
655,CBOE,"Tuesday night we correctly warned of the CBOE Volatility index or VIX failing to confirm a bottom for the broader market's fourth rally attempt. Prices in the VIX around the 18% to 19% level remained range bound and too close to the 10-day simple moving average as to get excited that selling in the market had finally capitulated. 
"
656,CBOE,"Amidst Wednesday's barrage of disappointing economic and fiscal sound bites, the VIX has finally risen to that sort of occasion. Intraday and entering the second half, with the S&P 500 off 1.8% and narrowly taking out its latest and now failed rally attempt, the VIX is up 13.7% at 20.85%. 
"
657,CBOE,"As such, premiums are displaying some signs of fearful investor behavior as prices break above 200-day simple moving average resistance and two or so months of congestion near 20%. Additionally, the VIX is nearing a ""stretch"" or differential of 11% relative to its 10-day simple moving average.

658,CBOE,"As discussed prior, that's important as the market's most notorious gauge of both fear and complacency, is also a mean-reverting instrument. This means we can determine relative anxiety or over-confidence in the VIX if the stretch is strong enough; even if prices aren't at historically significant levels. The ""stretch"" we watch for is when the VIX moves in excess of 15% or more from the moving average as a sign that investors are potentially overreacting. In conjunction with a March bottom circa 2011 and 200-day simple moving average support in the S&P 500 less than 1% from current levels, a fifth possible rally attempt should prove to have much more going for it than its predecessors.

661,CBOE,"As for the vast majority of bulls out there, promises of higher prices hinted at by the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX and defended as such by this strategist just last night, have proven to be nothing short of a windfall. Tonight, we will take a hat tip for our unwavering analysis.
"
662,CBOE,"Looking forward and once again taking the pulse of the market using some quantitative and qualitative analysis with the VIX, we have some good and bad news to deliver. First, the bad or what we'd call the reality check for bulls. Short term, with the VIX nearing its 200-day simple average for the first time since July, there's a strong likelihood of prices in the sentiment gauge at least stabilizing, if not reversing. That type action generally goes hand-in-hand with profit-taking in the broader market after a sizable rally like the one we're witnessing Thursday. 
"
663,CBOE,"Additionally and a bit more quantitatively, the VIX is once again stretched well below its 10-day simple moving average and prone to some mean, but not what we'd call, nasty reversion. With the differential well above our worry benchmark of 15% and prices a full five points south of the in-play of late and historically menacing 30% level. Thus bulls should be on guard for a technical breather.
"
664,CBOE,"The good news is the price to protect any profits is about as cheap as they've been on a whole in the market since early August and at the beginning of a nasty correction from the July highs. Additionally, due to the size of the rally and one punctuated by a rather large price gap, premiums while still well above the July lows near 15% in the VIX; are more attractive in consideration of real world applications when spying strategies such as a legged married put, collar or stock substitution strategy using long at or out-of-the money calls. In the end, it's still October and treats can turn into tricks, even though we continue to see less than spooky downside.

666,CBOE,"Could investors have foreseen Monday's anxious rekindling of credit market fears and global economic despair coming?

667,CBOE,"The specifics of course of European Union leaders and Italy's troubled ways being the catalyst behind Monday's bearish market pressure are difficult at best, if not impossible, to predict with any authority.

668,CBOE,"Last Thursday investors collectively signaled a second round of overconfident behavior in a week's time by sending the VIX more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average.

669,CBOE,"Friday's shaking off a bearish jobs report wasn't much better. The VIX was up on the session, but its rise of less than two percent to just above 16% and still 6% below its fore-mentioned moving average; was less than impressive or expressive of any fear or risk being seen in the market by investors...other than (as mentioned) of missing out.

671,CBOE,"In conjunction with prices in the VIX also much closer to nominally cheap historic levels and near multi-year lows, that bit of unconventional but truthful market pulse-taking, has, and contrary to the headlines, made sense and cents of some less-than-surprising Monday market mayhem.

In of itself, the VIX's all-too-confident price action suggested a high probability of a short-term pullback as forthcoming or that traders should at least have expected a good pause of a couple days or more in order to work off the broader market's overbought condition.In conjunction with prices in the VIX also much closer to nominally cheap historic levels and near multi-year lows, that bit of unconventional but truthful market pulse-taking, has, and contrary to the headlines, made sense and cents of some less-than-surprising Monday market mayhem.What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.
"
673,CBOE,"From last week's all too confident or complacent show of support for the broader market with the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" stretching more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average, investors appear to be pulling another Britney Spears or ""oops, they did it again"" maneuver. 
"
674,CBOE,"With Tuesday's price action the VIX has stretched itself up to a high near 20%. Nominally, a reading of 20% doesn't mean much historically speaking, but relative to its short-term gyrations, the level does coincide with excessive fear in the market. 
"
675,CBOE,"Relative to our watched moving average, today's highs generated a differential of about 17.5% and above the 15% measure we use in determining when investor's collective sentiment has put the broader market at an extreme typically good for a bounce and perhaps something even larger like an intermediate low. 
"
676,CBOE,"As a contrary indicator, an overbought reading in the VIX like the one we're currently faced with, suggests the broader markets are oversold. Generally viewed as the most highly correlated, the S&P 500 also happens to have tested its 50-day simple moving average support the past two sessions while correcting about 3% over three days. 
"
677,CBOE,"So, what's a bull, bear or option hedgehog to do? One faster money strategy to capitalize on potential technical support, time decay and relatively elevated premiums would be positioning with a bull vertical on an ETF such as the S&P 500's (SPY) or a large cap stock with a beta near 1.0. Readings of around 1.0 generally mean the stock follows or maybe forces the broader market to move in sync with its own technical footsteps. 
"
678,CBOE,"On that basis both Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) are relatively good choices. Google maintains a slightly weak beta of 0.92, which means its price performance, trails on a percentage basis by a small margin but generally moves in the same direction of the S&P 500. On the other hand, Apple tends to slightly outperform on both the upside and downside. 
"
679,CBOE,"Another bonus in positioning of this kind and with any of these instruments is all three are quite liquid. As much, execution and slippage risk in both entering and potential exiting are minimized. That said, the SPY is the most liquid of the three and also maintains one-point strike distances. In conjunction with the fact the SPY is ""Mr. Market"", though at times that distinction does seem to be awarded to the likes of an Apple; we personally like its apples better.

681,CBOE,"With about 90 minutes left in Thursday's session, bulls on the prowl for stronger bargain-hunting opportunities finally have the CBOE Volatility index or VIX acting as contrarian support. Prices in the market's most notorious investor sentiment gauge are up 9.5% and nearing 23.5%. The action extends Wednesday's perky upside breakout above multiple hits of lateral resistance near 20% and the 200-day simple moving average.
"
682,CBOE,"More importantly, at current levels, the VIX is stretched about 23% above its 10-day simple moving average. As has been discussed prior, that's important as it suggests relative fear on the part of market participants relative to recent prices. As a mean-reverting instrument which will never hit zero like a bankrupt stock or move to ""infinity and beyond"" like some growth stocks seem to do on occasion. Differentials of 15% or more are important as they typically signal an imminent reversal in investor behavior.
"
683,CBOE,"With fear finally the order of the day, bulls have a tool, which suggests investor bearishness is likely overdone with a more quantitative approach. There are however, no guarantees as the fall of 2008 can attest too. During that period ""the stretch"" looked quite silly on occasion as fearful premium expansion in the VIX hit record levels closing in on 90%.
"
684,CBOE,"Additionally, traders that do fish for bottoms might consider the price action in the VIX is still removed from the historically feared level of 30%. As a rule of thumb based on past incidents, this level lines up nicely with investor panic that's led to more than a few market bottoms. Also, the S&P 500 is still shy by about 0.75% of a full-fledged test of its March Bottom circa 2011 and 200-day simple moving average.
"
685,CBOE,"In total, conditions are shaping up for stronger bargain-hunting opportunities, but we're not fully there in a perfect world where all systems are a go. As much and for those so daring, remember to use limited risk strategies when entering in ""close enough"" conditions, leaving some ammo for those times when perfection does strike and a bit more in the coffers for those rarer but even more opportunistic times when bulls wrongly decide to panic with conviction.

687,CBOE,"With just under an hour left in Thursday's session, the S&P 500 is taking a technical hammering deep below the prior session's hopeful hammer reversal candlestick. In sympathy, the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" is soaring to a near repeat and fearful test of its March highs. 
"
688,CBOE,"Risk aversion is also showing its popularity in products like the iShares 20-Year  (TLT) bond proxy, which is jumping by more than 3% to fresh year-to-date highs. A drilling of nearly 6% in the US Oil Fund (USO) to year-to-date lows and an intraday unraveling of what had been some precious metals (SLV), (GLD) of late adds a bit more color to a Street seeing red. 
"
689,CBOE,"Another confirmation of market conditions more than a bit out of control and likely overdone is the volume explosion in the S&P500's ETF (SPY) options. More than 6.5 million contracts have traded thus far. That's only second to March's highs of just more than 7 million. That's well above its daily average of about 1.8 million and with time still on the clock, that ultra heavy volume driven by traders seeking net protection could be eclipsed. 
"
690,CBOE,"All told, conditions are ripe for a sharp reaction in the other direction. Whether or not this happens and how that might occur given Friday's premarket nonfarm payrolls data, is of course, part of today's investor folly. To that end, if you're going to participate in such a volatile gamble, make your odds of staying in the game approachable with options and strategies such as verticals, which reduce risk and increase one's chances for success. 
"
691,CBOE,"Of course there's no guarantee of profits. But in an environment which vastly increases one's risk beyond a traditional stop loss tied to a predetermined stock level; using options smartly boils down to real safety in the market which has nothing to do with fleeting investor flight and fancy.

693,CBOE,"The S&P 500 is off about -1.25% with less than an hour to go but off its worst levels of the session and what amount to fresh corrective lows for the market’s broadest proxy. With Wednesday's price action also establishing a loss of about 7% from recent intermediate highs, has the market's fallout become too over-heated? The answer could be ""maybe"" but we’ll caveat that with ""maybe not.""
"
694,CBOE,"Suffice it to say, our prognosis isn’t likely to be of much service to traders. On the other hand, with the CBOE Volatility Index engineering a historically, ""overly fearful"" test of 30% today and an extreme short-term stretch between its cash and 10-day simple moving average in excess of 40% at session highs, I'd say fast money bulls have some solid evidence to position for a bounce over the next couple of sessions. 
"
695,CBOE,"One idea, which continues to make sense given the elevated premiums and expectation for limited upside in terms of price and time is a long call condor. Did I repeat myself? Well, not on these pages but just yesterday at Optionetics, the position was discussed in detail and still holds true as a way to participate with less dollar risk on the table in a highly volatile and unstable environment. 
"
696,CBOE,"Shown above is the illustrated 6x March 128/129/130/131 long call condor from the fore-mentioned Option Watch article. The sizing reflects reduced portfolio sizing of just less than 1% risk on a model portfolio of $20K due to the ultra-tight timing and increased chance for counter gaps despite oversold market conditions. 
"
697,CBOE,"As readers can also see, with Wednesday's slightly hotter fallout in the market, this particular long call condor is underwater and truthfully, looking quite suspect. However, given the market's current elevated volatility, the spread is better positioned for a strong magnitude rally. This could otherwise be a less likely event if we were in a more stable trading environment.

699,CBOE,"Entering the final half hour of Thursday's session, with the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) off about -0.75% price action has confirmed a top. Whether it's ""the top"" is anybody's guess but following yesterday's 50% retracement test in the broad market proxy complimented by an indecisive doji finish. It seems some bears have come out of hibernation following a four-day run of higher highs and gains of about 8.5% from those recent lows to more recent highs. 
"
700,CBOE,"The good news for some bulls is the 1200 level and prior congestion resistance continues to hold and thus act as support. The bad news of course is tomorrow's monthly jobs data. I say that because based on the VIX and my opinion, for better or worse, the reaction could come in the form of a larger than normal price gap on the heels of the data. And that of course, always complicates matters, particularly so when conditions are ever volatile. 
"
701,CBOE,"So how'd I reach the conclusion the VIX could be setting the market up for a substantial gap, while maybe giving the directional edge to the bulls, but unwilling to bet the family ranch on tomorrow's ultimate outcome? It has to do with the market's most notorious sentiment gauge finding technical double-bottom pattern support off the historically overly fearful 30% level while flashing short-term complacency as it's traded more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average the past two sessions. 
"
702,CBOE,"Taken together, I see the VIX's testing of fearful historical levels and the shorter-term wherewithal to challenge that condition as a rather complex situation worthy of a dramatic resolution. Of course too and not to be ignored, underlying volatility has assisted in keeping prices in the VIX above 30% for the last few weeks. 
"
703,CBOE,"Even on those occasions which have brought smiles to faces of bulls such as the prior three trading days, the market's price action has continued to sport aggressive price swings more worthy of owning protective premium rather than simply discounting the volatility with short premium strategies in anticipation of quieter conditions moving forward. That day will come and I think we're almost there, but first there's that jobs report and then in the aftermath, some likely recalibration of volatility going forward that should make life easier for hard nose bulls and bears.

705,CBOE,"Under David Swensen's guidance, Yale University's endowment has grown from a little more than $1 billion to about $19 billion today. The university's chief investment officer and an outspoken critic of the mutual fund industry invented what has become known as ""The Yale Model,"" — an application of Modern Portfolio Theory.
"
706,CBOE,"Yale's endowment returned an average annual 10.1% in the 10 years ending June 30, 2011, eclipsing stocks, which averaged 3.9%, and bonds, which averaged 5.1%.
"
707,CBOE,"The investing strategy involves buying a mix of U.S. stocks, bonds, foreign stocks and a batch of assets that aren't highly correlated with the stock market.
"
708,CBOE,"These are private equity investments, including venture capital and leveraged buyouts, absolute return investing such as merger arbitrage and distressed securities and hard assets including real estate, timberland, oil and gas.
"
709,CBOE,"Swensen devotee Mark Eshman applies the Yale model, but he uses only ETFs. As chairman of Ketchum, Idaho-based ClearRock Capital, Eshman manages about $300 million in pensions, retirement and other accounts. His most popular portfolio, ""Diversified Moderate Growth,"" yields 4.4% and has returned 6.55% between inception on Sept. 30, 2009, and 2011's end vs. 7.41% for its benchmark. He explains his ETF investing strategy.
"
710,CBOE,"IBD: What is your investment philosophy? Why do you follow David Swensen's?
"
711,CBOE,"Eshman: Our core belief is that investing is first and foremost about wealth preservation and thoughtful growth. It's about paying as much attention to risk as you do reward.
"
712,CBOE,"Although Warren Buffett gets a lot more press, David Swensen is one of the greatest investors of our time. His willingness to characterize the mutual fund industry as ""a colossal failure"" is admirable. One of the most interesting things Swensen says that we constantly stress is the notion that the behavioral benefits of diversification are as important as the financial benefits. Diversification forces one to stay invested in good markets and bad.
"
713,CBOE,"IBD: How do you construct your portfolios?
"
714,CBOE,"Eshman: My 30-plus years' managing money for clients has taught me that there are no shortcuts to long-term portfolio growth. We've seen too many events shake the markets to know that the best way to build a portfolio is through broad and global diversification.
"
715,CBOE,"ETFs have been around for two decades now and are simply the most effective tool to access which markets we want to invest in and where we want to invest.
"
716,CBOE,"Our portfolios are based on our ClearRock Dashboard, a tool we've developed to track the most important economic indicators and how they impact our clients' portfolios. Depending on market conditions, we hold various amounts of fixed income (including Treasuries, Treasury inflation-protected securities, foreign bonds and high-yield bonds, domestic stock, foreign stock, real estate and commodity ETFs.
"
717,CBOE,"We have consistent weighting to each to maintain optimal diversification. On a high level, we know that macroeconomic conditions will cause us to re-allocate between asset classes during the course of a business cycle, but it would be highly unlikely that we would have no allocation to any of these broad asset classes.
"
718,CBOE,"Swensen would agree, but what differs between him and us mere mortals is that he has access to alternative asset classes that are too illiquid or require enormous capital investments, or both. For example, Yale owns large chunks of timber land, buildings, and venture capital and private equity partnerships.
"
719,CBOE,"IBD: What economic indicators do you look at and how do they inform your investment decisions?
"
720,CBOE,"Eshman: Gross domestic product, consumer sentiment, retail sales, ISM Manufacturing Index, producer price index (PPI), Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, housing permits, nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rate, initial jobless claims, consumer price index (CPI), federal-funds rate, euro/dollar currency exchange rate, credit default swaps spreads in the euro zone, Brent crude futures prices, gold futures prices, Merrill High Yield Bond Index, the CBOE Volatility Index (or VIX), China's GDP, Standard & Poor's 500 Index earnings per share and price-to-earnings ratio.
"
721,CBOE,"The three we pay most attention to will change as we move through different parts of the business cycle, but the three we are most keen on now are consumer sentiment, housing permits and the unemployment rate.
"
722,CBOE,"Consumer sentiment is a good coincident indicator for consumer spending, and hence, GDP growth prospects.
"
723,CBOE,"Housing permits is a leading indicator of builders' confidence that they are entering a cycle in which the housing supply/demand imbalance is shifting.
"
724,CBOE,"The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of income levels and economic activity in the U.S. and therefore is a good gauge of both GDP growth and where we are in the cycle. When we see a trend developing over the course of a quarter — as we do now with unemployment claims improving for four months in a row — we will adjust our allocations accordingly.
"
725,CBOE,"We might increase our allocation to a consumer discretionary ETF or other economic sensitive sectors.
"
726,CBOE,"IBD: Under what market conditions will your strategy underperform the market?
"
727,CBOE,"Eshman: We would likely underperform the S&P 500 Index in a roaring U.S. bull market since our portfolios have about 40% to 50% direct exposure to the U.S.
"

For example, Yale owns large chunks of timber land, buildings, and venture capital and private equity partnerships.IBD: What economic indicators do you look at and how do they inform your investment decisions?Eshman: Gross domestic product, consumer sentiment, retail sales, ISM Manufacturing Index, producer price index (PPI), Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, housing permits, nonfarm payrolls, unemployment rate, initial jobless claims, consumer price index (CPI), federal-funds rate, euro/dollar currency exchange rate, credit default swaps spreads in the euro zone, Brent crude futures prices, gold futures prices, Merrill High Yield Bond Index, the CBOE Volatility Index (or VIX), China's GDP, Standard & Poor's 500 Index earnings per share and price-to-earnings ratio.The three we pay most attention to will change as we move through different parts of the business cycle, but the three we are most keen on now are consumer sentiment, housing permits and the unemployment rate.Consumer sentiment is a good coincident indicator for consumer spending, and hence, GDP growth prospects.Housing permits is a leading indicator of builders' confidence that they are entering a cycle in which the housing supply/demand imbalance is shifting.The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of income levels and economic activity in the U.S. and therefore is a good gauge of both GDP growth and where we are in the cycle. When we see a trend developing over the course of a quarter — as we do now with unemployment claims improving for four months in a row — we will adjust our allocations accordingly.We might increase our allocation to a consumer discretionary ETF or other economic sensitive sectors.IBD: Under what market conditions will your strategy underperform the market?Eshman: We would likely underperform the S&P 500 Index in a roaring U.S. bull market since our portfolios have about 40% to 50% direct exposure to the U.S.Conversely, because of the global nature of our portfolios, when the U.S. markets are down, our portfolios should outperform.

738,CBOE,"Major averages finished in the bottom half of their trading ranges Tuesday but still managed decent percentage gains in higher volume, resulting in another crop of 52-week highs. Two ancillary housing stocks did well.Valspar (VAL) has been holding gains after a recent breakout. Shares added 0.6% to 73.66 in below-average trade. Even though it's extended 13% past its last buy point of 65.32, it's a good one to watch because its weekly chart shows a potential three-weeks-tight pattern taking shape. If it can close within 1.5% of last week's close of 73.19, the pattern would be in place. If its pattern plays out, watch for a heavy-volume breakout over its most recent high.This month, the paint and coating firm declared a quarterly dividend of 23 cents a share. In 2012, annual return on equity hit a multiyear high of 25.4%. High ROE helps separate well-managed companies from poorly managed ones.Meanwhile, another ancillary housing play, American Woodmark (AMWD), is still within buying range after clearing a cup-with-handle pattern buy point of 36.01 during Tuesday's session. Shares jumped 4% to 37.25 in solid trade. It's now 4% above the buy point.American Woodmark is a small company with a market capitalization of around $540 million, but it's an interesting turnaround story. The company makes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new-home construction markets. It lost money from 2010-12. In 2013, though, it's expected to earn 55 cents a share, with growth surging 122% in 2014 to $1.22 a share. Revenue growth has accelerated for four straight quarters, from 8% to 10%, 13%, 24% and 26%.Options exchange operator CBOE Holdings (CBOE) is another example of a three-weeks-tight pattern taking shape. Shares added 0.5% to 40.73 in light volume. The parent company of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the CBOE Futures Exchange this month reported solid bottom-line and top-line growth, thanks to increased trading of index options and futures contracts. Quarterly profit rose 35% to 50 cents a shares. Sales growth accelerated sequentially, rising 18% to $142.7 million. The company said average daily volume fell 11% to 4.4 million trades.

756,CBOE,"""When should I buy a vertical spread, and when should I buy an outright call or put?"" If you have ever asked this question, you are not alone.
"
757,CBOE,"This article will discuss when vertical spreads are the strategy of choice and when buying calls (or puts) are preferred. A comparison of theoretical values for a long call and for a bull call spread provides several insights about when vertical spreads might be the preferred strategy. Although this article focuses on vertical spreads using calls, the same logic applies to vertical spreads with puts. For the sake of simplicity, commissions and margin interest charges, if any, are not included in the discussion.
"
758,CBOE,"A bull call spread is one type of vertical spread. With XYZ stock trading at $80.00, an XYZ 80-90 Bull Call Spread might be created by buying one XYZ 80 Call for 5.50 and, simultaneously, selling one XYZ 90 Call for 2.10. In this example, the net cost is 3.40, not including commissions.
"
759,CBOE,"Table 1 contains theoretical values of an 80 Call at various stock prices (rows) at various days prior to expiration (columns). Table 2 contains corresponding theoretical values for an 80-90 Bull Call Spread.  Tables 1 and 2 were created using a standard options-pricing computer program. One such program can be accessed free of charge at the web site of the CBOE. 
"
760,CBOE,"Sample Scenarios
"
761,CBOE,"Consider a forecast for XYZ stock to rise from $80 at 40 days to expiration (Row 9, Column 1) to $88 at 30 days (Row 5, Column 2). Table 1 indicates that the 80 Call would rise from 5.50 to 10.10 for a price rise of 4.60, or $460, per option. Table 2 indicates that the 80-90 Bull Call Spread would rise from 3.40 to 5.80 for a potential profit of 2.40, or $240, per spread, if closed at these prices. In this case, the 80 Call has both a larger dollar profit and a larger percentage profit, 83% versus 70%. In this case, the 80 Call is the rational choice.
"
762,CBOE,"Now consider a forecast for XYZ stock to rise from $80 at 40 days to expiration (Row 9, Column 1) to $86 at 10 days (Row 6, Column 4). Table 1 indicates that the 80 Call would rise from 5.50 to 6.80 for a price rise of 1.30. Table 2 indicates that the 80-90 Bull Call Spread would rise from 3.40 to 5.40 for a price rise of 2.00. In this case, the 80-90 Bull Call Spread has both a larger dollar potential profit and a larger percentage potential profit, 58% versus 23%. In this case, the Bull Call Spread is the rational choice.
"
763,CBOE,"Tables 1 and 2 also contain negative outcomes. If the forecast for a stock price rise does not materialize, then the option prices will decline and a loss will occur. The maximum possible risk of either strategy — buying calls or buying bull call spreads — is the full cost of the strategy including commissions.
"
764,CBOE,"Pay Attention to Deltas
"
765,CBOE,"Tables 1 and 2 also contain the deltas of the strategies. An option's delta estimates how much the option price will change if the price of the underlying stock changes by $1. In general, the delta of a vertical spread does not change as dramatically as the delta of an outright long or short option.

770,CBOE,"Implied volatility is back up to one month highs in erstwhile growth outfit Netflix  (NFLX). That may not sound overly-menacing given the CBOE Volatility Index's similar rise to four-week highs and more cautious pricing as investors seek out more protective long premium strategies as the market enters the notoriously volatile month of September on a weak note.
"
771,CBOE,"What may be potentially ominous for NFLX shareholders is Tuesday's extension of recent and longstanding price weakness. With the stock off about 6.5% late today, NFLX has revisited its August lows following a bearish price break below its 50-day simple moving average back in late July. As there are no guarantees in the stock market, bears and/or interested bulls looking to position in the name might look to the option market. While profits can't be assured, those markets do allow for limited risk protection via purchases and various spreads.
"
772,CBOE,"One bearish position which makes added sense given the more expensive premiums in NFLX is the vertical which largely does away with any unwanted vega or volatility risk. A bear vertical can be designed using all calls or all puts. In either case, the lower strike is sold while a higher same month strike is purchased. Which is better? Typically, if you're looking for shares to simply not breach a certain level overhead, an out-of-the-money bear call spread is most commonly used.
"
773,CBOE,"Conversely, if you're of the bearish mind a stock is going to move lower, an ""at"" or out-of-the-money bear put spread is generally the more popular choice. Using lower strike puts also holds favor with most traders over its synthetic in-the-money bear call spread equivalent.
"
774,CBOE,"In a security such as Netflix where short interest is large but not currently an issue regarding early assignment, it might make additional sense to focus on the put options rather than face the potential for an unwanted short stock position. Interestingly enough, given NFLX's put verticals appear to trade for the same risk-to-reward to even a few pennies to perhaps a nickel cheaper, albeit in today's extra bouncy session; it makes all the more 'cents' to stay tuned in to those contracts.

777,CBOE,"Is it over? Well, if you're asking about whether or not the S&P 500's three sessions of lower lows from its established intermediate highs has completed, you might posit whether a pullback of 1.8% is enough. As most healthy pullbacks, but not one's which completely unravel, show declines of at least 2%, the market could almost be there. 
"
778,CBOE,"If you look at Thursday's lows just a hair away from the 1400 level and one which more or less helped secure the market's recent highs, bulls might also have a bit more ammo on their side—or nearly so. An additional and important clue to all traders we hope, regardless of whether they position with options or not, is the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX). 
"
779,CBOE,"With the S&P 500's reversal of the last three days, fear, and not the kind tied to the fear of missing out, has been building in the market's most notorious sentiment gauge. In fact, since last Friday when investors confidently pushed the index down to a five year low of 13.30 in a somewhat vain attempt to collect a smidgeon of weekend decay, premiums have pushed right back for four straight sessions. In closing at 16.01%, prices are successfully working their way back into their more historical trading range of 15% to the low 20s.
"
780,CBOE,"Why is that good? Much like with a pullback in a stock needing to work off an overbought situation in a healthy manner, seeing VIX premiums, which represent protection from volatile market downturns, make a move from near-complacent like conditions to today's nearly there highs, is ultimately a good thing. ""Nearly there?"" As with the fore-mentioned 1.8% and hair's distance from 1400 in the S&P 500; a differential of 12.25% in the VIX relative to its 10-day simple moving average still has a little wiggle room for improvement; but not much, if a pullback is going to remain of the healthy variety.
"
781,CBOE,"What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.Is it over? Well, if you're asking about whether or not the S&P 500's three sessions of lower lows from its established intermediate highs has completed, you might posit whether a pullback of 1.8% is enough. As most healthy pullbacks, but not one's which completely unravel, show declines of at least 2%, the market could almost be there. If you look at Thursday's lows just a hair away from the 1400 level and one which more or less helped secure the market's recent highs, bulls might also have a bit more ammo on their side—or nearly so. An additional and important clue to all traders we hope, regardless of whether they position with options or not, is the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX). With the S&P 500's reversal of the last three days, fear, and not the kind tied to the fear of missing out, has been building in the market's most notorious sentiment gauge. In fact, since last Friday when investors confidently pushed the index down to a five year low of 13.30 in a somewhat vain attempt to collect a smidgeon of weekend decay, premiums have pushed right back for four straight sessions. In closing at 16.01%, prices are successfully working their way back into their more historical trading range of 15% to the low 20s.Why is that good? Much like with a pullback in a stock needing to work off an overbought situation in a healthy manner, seeing VIX premiums, which represent protection from volatile market downturns, make a move from near-complacent like conditions to today's nearly there highs, is ultimately a good thing. ""Nearly there?"" As with the fore-mentioned 1.8% and hair's distance from 1400 in the S&P 500; a differential of 12.25% in the VIX relative to its 10-day simple moving average still has a little wiggle room for improvement; but not much, if a pullback is going to remain of the healthy variety.What do you think?

782,CBOE,"Don't look now, but late last week's optimistic price behavior and confident sentiment has turned bearishly complacent. Monday's lows in the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" which scratched just below 14% also stretched more than 15% below the notorious Fear Gauge's mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average. 
"
783,CBOE,"Differentials of 15% or more between the cash VIX and the short-term moving average are important as the price action, relatively speaking, is extreme and prone to moving in the other direction in order to neutral those same readings in sentiment. In conjunction with absolute levels in the fear gauge historically on the cheap side and within a point of its five year lows set in August and fresh four year highs in the likes of the S&P 500, it appears a very good time to trim portfolio risk. 
"
784,CBOE,"While many stock traders will opt to reduce the size of their stock holdings in order to shave their existing portfolio risk, an option strategy, which makes a good deal more sense when premiums are affordable like they are currently, is to hedge shares individually. The simplest way to manufacturer guaranteed protection against unwanted downside risk is to purchase a put one-to-one against the underlying stock. 
"
785,CBOE,"By purchasing the put the trader creates a married put or synthetic long call position. This position allows the trader to sleep comfortably at night by knowing unequivocally how much dollar exposure they maintain in the event of a bearish move in the underlying while still allowing for potential increased profits, should the underlying continue to move higher. Shown above and to illustrate is a legged married put in Apple (AAPL) which doesn't eliminate downside risk, but contains the position's percent exposure to less than 3% of the share price regardless of how low AAPL might move during the life of the purchased October 650 put. 
"
786,CBOE,"If traders feel the possibility of additional upside is not a strong factor, simultaneously selling an ""at"" or out-of-the-money call and forming a collar or a synthetic bull vertical might be considered. Without adjustments, the sale of the call means additional upside profits are capped, but the trader has the advantage over the married put position by reducing or eliminating the cost of the protective put purchase. 
"
787,CBOE,"Alternatively, though not recommended if one's portfolio consists of stocks with looming earnings or major announcements in the pipeline, if there isn't decent liquidity provision in the options, a trader can look to the S&P 500 for assistance. By beta weighting the dollar risk of one's individual holdings, the trader can come up with a simple yet effective married put hedge using the broad-based and ultra-liquid product to eliminate, in theory at least, nearly 100% of the portfolio's systematic market risk. ""What's beta, you ask?"" If you did, tomorrow's classic lesson on putting portfolio management theory to work is for you.

789,CBOE,"The CBOE Volatility Index rallied about about 7% with an hour left in Tuesday's session 7%. But despite the bid, investor sentiment remains much more sympathetic to the fear of missing out than one of panic. And that continues to be a potential issue for the broader market's ability to move higher. 
"
790,CBOE,"So, what's the problem you ask? The big concern rests with Monday's treatment of risk by investors. Yesterday's final hour of trade saw the euphemistically called fear fauge dip into a full test of its March lows of 13.66% and down 7% on the day. At the same time and more pressing, the confident pressure challenged the VIX's multiyear lows while extending the instrument a full 15% below its mean-reverting, short-term 10-day simple moving average.
"
791,CBOE,"Typically used as a contrary indicator, differentials between the VIX and its short-term moving average of 15% or more are prone to recalibrating back towards the recent norm, which we define with the 10-day simple moving average. When a signal triggers and daily or weekly levels of absolute price importance are also involved, as was the case on Monday, a flag is raised. This net action hints strongly at investor confidence becoming too complacent as protective strategies like buying puts to protect a long stock portfolio have been replaced by income generation objectives with much greater risk such as buy-writes or the selling of puts.
"
792,CBOE,"So, what's next you ask? We don't maintain the rights to a crystal ball. But history does suggest lower odds for a sustainable upside move in the broader market until the VIX might, at a minimum, test its 10-day simple moving average. Until that day comes, there's the increased likelihood of lower market prices or more of this past week's aggravating mostly lateral chop, which looks to technically torment both bulls and bears. As much and if you've managed to ride some of the broader market's uptrend to open profits in the portfolio, you may want to consider protecting those gains with protection made more affordable than usual, relatively speaking and otherwise.

794,CBOE,"Fear is in the air for a second straight session. You can almost smell or taste it, if we're to direct our attention to the likes of Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) with shares off about 15% after hours following disappointing results or Apple's (AAPL) 5.8% slice off shareholder value. Or if you want to take your cue from the option market, you can simply look at the price action in the CBOE Volatility Index. The market's notorious sentiment index confirmed its euphemistic moniker, the fear gauge for a second day in a row Tuesday and when all was said and done, is looking a bit more troubling than the session prior. 
"
795,CBOE,"In case you missed it, Monday saw the VIX surge intraday by about 25% after reignited credit market concerns upended bulls maybe thinking the worst was behind them. Not only was the spike in premiums the strongest in 2012, it also signaled a fearful extreme in the VIX relative to its mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average with an intraday differential of about 19%. Differentials wider than 15% are prone to investors shifting gears and reversing back towards the average as the short-term extreme looks to neutralize itself. 
"
796,CBOE,"In conjunction with a test of the closely watched 20% level and 50-day simple moving average, an intraday reversal which found the VIX finishing up a less chaotic 14.4% at 18.6%, looked promising for bulls in equities as the S&P 500 held its uptrend and 50-day simple moving average while finishing in a bullish hammer. Disappointingly, sometimes promises are broken and that unfortunately happens to be the case Tuesday. 
"
797,CBOE,"The S&P 500 broke below its reversal candle and the VIX reversed right back up to finish near Monday's highs and slightly above 20% while sporting a closing extreme overbought differential of 16.8%. But is two better than one for bulls looking to position from a contrarian vantage point? 
"
798,CBOE,"Evidence of proper moving average alignment and May's credit-related premium surge falling short of the historically over-the-top 30% reading in the VIX, might provide anecdotal evidence for bulls that today's and yesterday's fear could be tomorrow's buying opportunity. Also, there's still 50-day simple moving average and up-channel support in the S&P 500 to consider. If you do however, remember that other reason traders use the option market, namely to position with less fear in case fear comes undone in a less desirable and more out-of-control way.

800,CBOE,"Despite very flattish and tight conditions entering the final half hour of trade on Monday in the S&P 500, the CBOE Volatility Index has staged a very decisive move in shedding nearly 11% to a reading below 19%. What's more baffling is the confident behavior in the market's most notorious sentiment index is signaling short-term complacency on the part of investors despite still obvious credit market risks with particular focus on Greece and Spain and a looming and potentially strong FOMC catalyst on Wednesday.
"
801,CBOE,"In conjunction with a break of the closely watched 20% level which twice in the past month has acted as support for the VIX, the sentiment gauge is now a full 15% below its 10-day simple moving average. Readings of 15% or greater are typically an indication prices in the broader average are readying to move in the opposite direction of the short-term trend as sentiment sets itself up for a return back towards its mean as represented by the 10-day simple moving average.
"
802,CBOE,"As there are no guarantees with the market and maybe as the saying goes, ""Rules were made to be broken"", we can't help but wonder aloud if today's move in the VIX is a bullish omen for the broader market, rather than a more traditional sign alerting investors to be cautious? 
"
803,CBOE,"It would be nice to simply be optimistic and vote in favor of the former. But given those other options which allow option traders to act like hedgehogs rather than overt bulls thinking this time is seriously different or that the veil of uncertainty and June Gloom are just going to vanish; softer delta strategies such as verticals or to steal one from Chris Tyler, putting a collar on that bull, look to be wise choices to consider.

805,CBOE,"Shares IBD 50 constituent VMware (VMW) bucked the broader averages today, much to the chagrin of existing shareholders and price action which option traders took notice of. Topping off our unusual volume cheat sheet, VMW saw more than 20,000 contracts change hands compared to its 150-day simple moving average of 3,400. 
"
806,CBOE,"Technically, shares of VMW broke decisively below its 10-day simple moving average for the first time since its December corrective lows, but managed to find support from its longer-term 50-day simple moving average which had gone untested since late January.

807,CBOE,"Reaction today and one which finished with shares off 2.59% in a wide range decision candle known as a doji, was tied to the company's preannounced in-line to slightly above views guidance call following the unexpected departure of its CFO. VMware will officially release its Q1 results next Wednesday evening. 
"
808,CBOE,"A look at VMware's option activity shows fairly even trading in both its calls and puts with roughly 70% of the overall volume concentrated in the April contract. Implied volatility took a small dip lower on the session given both the removal of some stock-specific uncertainty, as well as the broader market's own small sigh of relief in the CBOE Volatility Index.

809,CBOE,"As earnings fall two days in front of expiration, still well-bid premium is likely to remain intact and probably even move to fresh relative highs. Yet, given the passage of time so close to contract's final days; an earnings or volatility rush play using the likes of an at-the-money long strangle needs to account for the negative impact of time decay for the period held before a more secure decision regarding risk versus reward can be determined.

810,CBOE,"Shown above and to illustrate those two contrasting factors on option premiums, is a 10x April 105 / 110 strangle for $4.85 using a 20% increase over current implieds and reflecting a clock having ticked down to the last couple days in front of the report. Assuming our volatility estimate is in the ballpark, with risk of about $2,850 compared to max expiration risk of $4,850; I'd personally be giving the benefit of the doubt and the ""smiley"" nod to the trader on the other side this long curve position.

Net, net protection for portfolios is on sale these days.

818,CBOE,"The major indexes spun their wheels to end mixed Wednesday but leading stocks strode higher, a subtle clue that enthusiasm for equities is still solid. The Nasdaq gave back nearly all of a 0.5% gain during a half-hour sell-off through the day's close. It finished up less than 0.1%. Not surprisingly, the tech-rich composite's action mirrored Apple (AAPL), which got…
"
819,CBOE,"For traders with maybe more than a couple growth stocks and possibly in names which have less-than-adequate put and call liquidity, the choice of portfolio protection, other than a stop-loss, may seem out of reach or even out of the question. However, real protection is available indirectly if one looks to the broader market for help. By finding one's overall portfolio dollar exposure to the broader market with the help of beta, then using an instrument such as the SP-500 and its very liquid options, the trader can hedge the portfolio with the proper amount of insurance with a simple long put position.
"
820,CBOE,"""What's Beta you ask?"" Beta is simply a measure of how a stock moves in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock in question has a history of tracking the market in percent terms, both up and down. One name typically very much in-sync or in-tune with the daily ups and downs of the major averages is computer device goliath Apple (AAPL). Unsurprisingly, with its stock movement so closely-correlated to the likes of the S&P 500, AAPL shares currently maintain a very close or nearly matching beta of 0.91.
"
821,CBOE,"The beta value can be found on Yahoo! Finance under a stock's ""Key Statistics"" page. Readings well-below 1.0, like with many utilities names, are less volatile. Stocks which have beta values greater than 1.0, as one might expect to find with growth stocks, generally see greater percent swings up and down compared to the broader market. For instance, No. 1 ranked Questcor Pharmaceutical (QCOR) within the IBD 50 currently has a beta of 1.60 which implies it's 160% more volatile in percent terms than the SP-500.

822,CBOE,"While a bit more complicated and an index hedging strategy doesn't guard against company-specific risks, it is an alternative to simply having a stop loss in mind and ultimately, no steadfast guarantees of getting filled near one's ideal exit point. So, how's it done? Let's say you have $50K in four growth stocks and each one has a Beta of 2.00. In order to make an effective put hedge for this portfolio's real market exposure, the trader would multiply the dollar risk of $50K by the Beta of 2.00.

Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.For traders with maybe more than a couple growth stocks and possibly in names which have less-than-adequate put and call liquidity, the choice of portfolio protection, other than a stop-loss, may seem out of reach or even out of the question. However, real protection is available indirectly if one looks to the broader market for help.

Beta is simply a measure of how a stock moves in relation to the broader market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock in question has a history of tracking the market in percent terms, both up and down. One name typically very much in-sync or in-tune with the daily ups and downs of the major averages is computer device goliath Apple (AAPL). Unsurprisingly, with its stock movement so closely-correlated to the likes of the S&P 500, AAPL shares currently maintain a very close or nearly matching beta of 0.91.The beta value can be found on Yahoo! Finance under a stock's ""Key Statistics"" page. Readings well-below 1.0, like with many utilities names, are less volatile. Stocks which have beta values greater than 1.0, as one might expect to find with growth stocks, generally see greater percent swings up and down compared to the broader market. For instance, No. 1 ranked Questcor Pharmaceutical (QCOR) within the IBD 50 currently has a beta of 1.60 which implies it's 160% more volatile in percent terms than the SP-500. Thus if the index dropped 1.0%, we'd expect QCOR to be down 1.60% to keep the relationship intact.While a bit more complicated and an index hedging strategy doesn't guard against company-specific risks, it is an alternative to simply having a stop loss in mind and ultimately, no steadfast guarantees of getting filled near one's ideal exit point.

826,CBOE,"Bulls can blame whomever or whatever they see fit regarding Tuesday's bearish reversal in the likes of the S&P 500 ETF  (SPY). Bottom line though, with Day 13 of the market's rally attempt going from a contained but good-looking bid below the 200-day simple moving average to a weak close, buying the latest pullback is harder to justify. 
"
827,CBOE,"Technically, today's reversal managed to fill about 50% of the November 30 upside gap in the SPY and challenge the 50-day simple moving average support. Now, don't get me wrong, that part sounds somewhat tempting as a technician known to appreciate pullbacks on occasion. However, not helping matters or maybe just baffling enough to leave this strategist to scratch his head is the CBOE Volatility Index.
"
828,CBOE,"Entering the session we wholeheartedly expected the market's out-the-gate, seasonally pleasing bid. The likes of the SPY had put together a nice-looking hammer reversal off range support Monday, which we personally were fond of. Additionally and of more importance, the VIX had all but RSVP'd bulls with its own lower close, third test of its 200-day simple moving average in the face of all those scary and ""Moody's"" credit market headlines.

829,CBOE,"In the aftermath of Tuesday with the VIX going from a constructively fresh, intraday ""Thump!"" below the former gift-wrapped red price ribbon, only to reverse back above the long-term average in its own hammer pattern—we're admittedly ""VIX'ed."" However, with the FTD count extending itself beyond our own cutoff window of 13 and one back-tested by the folks at Quantifiable Edges, the market's seasonal bias is looking emphatically less ho-ho-hopeful and not letting optimistic sentiment for a further good tidings stand in the way in better decisions.

831,CBOE,"With less than 30 minutes to go, the S&P 500 has challenged its August low with a narrow undercut of those prices and the numerically well-followed 1100 level. In sympathy, the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX"" has traded just through 45% intraday. Both are good signs of a potential bottom, but will they prove enough as far as technical support for a lasting low?
"
832,CBOE,"The opinion of this strategist is for bargain-hunters to continue showing restraint as 1100 could be followed by 1000 before all is said and done as far as more lasting bottoms are concerned. Our worry as we enter the notoriously weak month of October and a period known for its scary-looking market lows is the current test doesn't measure up historically or visually. 
"
833,CBOE,"On the one hand, 45% in the VIX is historically fearful enough to conjure up images of treats for bargain hunters. Plenty of major bottoms have occurred with readings between 30% and current levels.

While more complex three or four legged spreads are unlikely to get filled for anything close to a reasonable price; outrights, verticals and calendars are all spreads, which might allow for an execution.

844,CBOE,"For intermediate stock bulls, the purchase of a protective put in conjunction with shares allows the trader to have his or her risk pre-defined to an absolute amount during the life of the contract, while maintaining upside profit exposure.

853,CBOE,"So how is it with fear expressing itself quite authoritatively in the likes of the S&P 500's daily chart, the CBOE Volatility Index can finish down just slightly? Similarly, how is it possible at a level of 17.83%, the market's most notorious fear and sometimes complacency gauge, can sit comfortably within its two-month lateral trading range near nominally cheap historical levels? I'm glad you asked. 
"
854,CBOE,"Bottom-line, sentiment is a tricky animal. But with a weekend to enjoy the sunshine rather than getting burned by the glare of a computer screen, it's slightly easier to see how traders collectively might believe the weekend will pass without any major market drivers negatively impacting prices. 
"
855,CBOE,"As much, traders using this logic will effectively discount option prices by removing time decay or the stuff embedded in calls and puts which comprise those fearful spikes like the one we saw early this morning. There is of course, three days of time decay to take advantage of!! Actually, we don't know that for a fact. However, if you're baffled as to why implieds don't move strongly higher when the market is tumbling strongly; that's pretty much the reason.
"
856,CBOE,"Did I say ""Fearful spike?"" Believe it or not, with Friday's early test of 20% in the VIX, the index pushed just more than 15% above its short-term 10SMA. Differentials of 15% or more are considered by many traders like me to represent opportunities for the index to revert back towards its mean. In a session like today's where the VIX is above the moving average, the ""stretch"" as I like to call it, is synonymous with fear in the market, albeit relative to recent movements and not necessarily those larger daily chart extremes that are easier to recognize.

858,CBOE,"Despite all the ""A-ha!"" bearish style headlines trying to put a lid on 2012's opening, technical-based, bullish salvo in the likes of the S&P 500, investors managed to keep Wednesday's profit-taking very constructive looking when all was said and done. A good deal of bulls' wherewithal in the face of Spanish banking jitters and cautious words on economic growth from China's policymakers might be attributed to the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX."" 
"
859,CBOE,"The market's most notorious sentiment gauge finished off 3% after being up by about the same amount during slightly more cautious conditions early on in the session. In of itself, the reversal in the VIX is the kind of behavior bulls generally like to see. 
"
860,CBOE,"Reversals of this kind suggest investors are increasing their risk appetite and on the whole, selling premium with its potential for open-ended risk versus buying protection with more well-defined loss boundaries. That said and as a rule, healthier and more consistently, upwardly mobile markets typically go hand in hand with lower premiums or readings in the VIX. 
"
861,CBOE,"What's even more appealing about today's price action in the VIX is the movement is taking place underneath its 200-day simple moving average after a successful breakdown back in mid-December. After an elongated period of extremely volatile behavior, we might anticipate prices continuing to move back towards more normalized levels in the high teens to 20%. In turn, subdued price volatility is usually of benefit to directional trading and bulls in particular. 
"
862,CBOE,"In the end, there are no guarantees in trading successfully with the VIX as a standalone tool for making buy and sell decisions, whether with stock, options or a portfolio containing both types of instruments. However, in conjunction with Wednesday's VIX reversal closing narrowly below its mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average and in a very neutral position, we can't help but be optimistic for our bovine friends until conditions grow complacent on a quantifiable level.

Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.Despite all the ""A-ha!"" bearish style headlines trying to put a lid on 2012's opening, technical-based, bullish salvo in the likes of the S&P 500, investors managed to keep Wednesday's profit-taking very constructive looking when all was said and done. A good deal of bulls' wherewithal in the face of Spanish banking jitters and cautious words on economic growth from China's policymakers might be attributed to the CBOE Volatility Index or ""VIX."" The market's most notorious sentiment gauge finished off 3% after being up by about the same amount during slightly more cautious conditions early on in the session. In of itself, the reversal in the VIX is the kind of behavior bulls generally like to see. Reversals of this kind suggest investors are increasing their risk appetite and on the whole, selling premium with its potential for open-ended risk versus buying protection with more well-defined loss boundaries. That said and as a rule, healthier and more consistently, upwardly mobile markets typically go hand in hand with lower premiums or readings in the VIX. What's even more appealing about today's price action in the VIX is the movement is taking place underneath its 200-day simple moving average after a successful breakdown back in mid-December. After an elongated period of extremely volatile behavior, we might anticipate prices continuing to move back towards more normalized levels in the high teens to 20%. In turn, subdued price volatility is usually of benefit to directional trading and bulls in particular. In the end, there are no guarantees in trading successfully with the VIX as a standalone tool for making buy and sell decisions, whether with stock, options or a portfolio containing both types of instruments. However, in conjunction with Wednesday's VIX reversal closing narrowly below its mean-reverting 10-day simple moving average and in a very neutral position, we can't help but be optimistic for our bovine friends until conditions grow complacent on a quantifiable level.What do you think?

864,CBOE,"With two hours left in Wednesday's session, a widely anticipated ""yes"" vote from Greece's parliament confirmed and investors apparently at ease with the upcoming passing of QE2, what could possibly go wrong? The answer appears to be, ""not a whole lot"" as evidenced by S&P 500's third day of percentage gains and a comfortably confident CBOE Volatility index bordering on complacency. 
"
865,CBOE,"The market's most notorious sentiment gauge has quickly worked its way from brief and overly fearful three-month highs stretched well above its 10-day simple moving average less than two weeks back, to once again trading in its lateral trading range of a couple months. 
"
866,CBOE,"At a level of 17.5% off about 8.5% on the day, the VIX's price for protection has grown quickly much cheaper. In fact, with the relationship of the VIX versus its short-term moving average kinda stretchy at 12.5% compared to our typical 15% guideline, prices as mentioned are comfortably confident. But as a contrary indicator tool, isn't necessarily a good thing.
"
867,CBOE,"Sure, some of this optimism might have to do with the discounting phenomenon of investors trying to get ahead of other investors wise to premium collection in front of the upcoming long holiday weekend, which unofficially extends from Friday morning until next Tuesday. In this day and age of aggressive trade practices, Wednesday is probably the new late Thursday to many traders looking for an edge to sell some additional time decay or theta, whether the end result actually amounts to consistent profits or not.
"
868,CBOE,"That all said and personally being more of the pragmatic and simple market pulse-taking kind of market observer, while I like to hope for the best from the market, the decision to remain an option hedge hog rather than an overt bull makes sense and likely cents at this stage in the game.

870,CBOE,"The CBOE Volatility Index has put together more than its fair share of false starts in recent weeks as sentiment has tried to mellow and move back towards more normalized and lower volatility that's generally of benefit to bulls. 
"
871,CBOE,"By our own estimate, since mid-October there's been four false signals in the VIX based on unsuccessful stabs at pushing the notorious ""fear gauge"" below its historically overly-fearful 30% level. With the VIX now once again below 30% near 27.5% for a fifth attempt, will five prove the charm? 
"
872,CBOE,"We certainly hope so. To wit, we see the seasonal tendencies of the ""Best Six"" calendar period and December's Santa Claus Rally as reason to anticipate that after an extended and nearly unprecedented period of high volatility; a more benign and confident market environment is possible. 
"
873,CBOE,"Despite our optimism, the market does have an albatross or two hanging on its shoulders. By Investor's Business Daily's own admission, the market is still under correction. Further, the VIX has signaled over the last two days, a short-term overbought condition while the likes of the S&P500 has soared in excess of 7.0% on the week.
"
874,CBOE,"We're also mindful of that potentially harmful market catalyst called the BLS' nonfarm payrolls report due out Friday morning. Given the circumstances, one option, pardon the pun, to keep any existing gains intact while maintaining upside exposure as conditions maybe neutralize a bit before moving higher, would be the use of a near-term protective put against the portfolio. 
"
875,CBOE,"By figuring out the beta of one's portfolio, which can be assisted for free with Yahoo! Finance, a trader can guard against broader market risk by purchasing an appropriate level of protection using an at or out-of-the money put in an instrument such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). With this type positioning, the trader has a better handle on their risk exposure, while maintaining upside profit potential, though reduced by the cost of the purchased protection. 
"
876,CBOE,"This kind of hedge doesn't guard against company specific risk. Thus, if earnings or something like a FDA announcement are a potential issue, you may want to strongly consider an option strategy in the underlying instrument that's in question. While premiums in those type situations will undoubtedly prove more expensive than with index protection; it probably makes sense and cents over the long run.

878,CBOE,"Depending on how one counts, Tuesday marked either day one or day two of the broader markets fourth rally attempt since the early May highs. But lighter volume, oodles of resistance levels such as the 10-day simple moving average and April lows or the slightly higher up 1300 level in the S&P 500 are a couple reasons for bulls to still bide their time on the sidelines. Another factor may be the CBOE Volatility index or VIX. 
"
879,CBOE,"Despite the corrective move of more than 7.5% in the S&P 500 since early May, the VIX hasn't provided traders with confirmation the other guy still dabbling in the market, has been worried; let alone fearful of what's been a gloomy June. The VIX did hit 20% Monday to challenge its trading range highs, as well as its 200-day simple moving average. 
"
880,CBOE,"As we expect to see those prices in the VIX to spike during troubled times in the market, the action represented a step in the right direction. However, the market's most notorious sentiment gauge still fell well short of any panic by either a historic standard closer to 30% or relative to recent short-term price movements. 
"
881,CBOE,"This latter pulse taking that I commonly refer to as ""the stretch"" looks at the percentage difference in prices relative to the VIX's 10-day simple moving average. On Monday and with less-than-panicked highs of 20% in hand, the stretch or differential amounted to 10% compared to a minimum requirement of 15% or greater. 
"
882,CBOE,"With Tuesday finding the mean-reverting but far from mean or nasty VIX right back at its moving average, I'd be surprised if another round of mad money isn't around the corner. As is the case sometimes, one man's rally attempt is another's bear market rally and one, which seems fit to deserve the benefit of the doubt.

884,CBOE,"Just when you think you have the market all but figured out, it goes out and throws an unexpected curve ball. That's what looks to have transpired in the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX. After a couple nice signals over the past two weeks used for both entering into and more recently exiting or battening down the hatches with regards to bullish long delta positions, the VIX put together an admittedly slightly spookier, fearful and seasonally late price spike on Tuesday. 
"
885,CBOE,"Truth be told, we anticipated Monday's jump of 22% into a key test of the spooky 30% resistance level to have sufficiently neutralized an overbought market. The action followed last Thursday and Friday's message by the VIX to trim risk based on its combined short-term stretch of more than 17% relative to its 10-day simple moving average and a concurrent first test of 200-day simple moving average support. 
"
886,CBOE,"Last Thursday night and on these pages, we wrote about the over-aggressive short-term levels of bullishness in the VIX and action that was likely bound to trip up investors over the next couple sessions. Where we went astray was in thinking Monday's slightly aggressive dip of 2.50% in the S&P 500 in conjunction with the VIX would prove enough to cause a bullish reversal and jump start the market's notorious ""Best Six"" calendar period. 
"
887,CBOE,"We wrote as much last night at Optionetics in an installment of Traders Radar. Obviously, were obviously off in our analysis. At the end of the day, a ""Terrible Tuesday"" found the VIX spiking another 16% to 36%. That same action showed investor sentiment moving quickly from a neutralized, fearful bull to one, once more, overly-panicked with a closing spread differential of 16% relative to its 10-day simple moving average while testing its 30 and 50-day averages. 
"
888,CBOE,"What's next? Nobody but Goldman knows, maybe. But given our own short-term track record of being in front of the crowd two out of three times and what we'd guess to be a similar batting average over the long run using this type of analysis, the option to buy and sell simultaneously as a softer delta bull, rather than a bear built on panic, is our latest best guesstimate for the historical ledger.

890,CBOE,"With about 45 minutes to go, the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) has gone from a session-long position of relative strength to a slightly weaker situation which has the tech-heavy index narrowly cutting through its first hour lows. The good news for bulls open to bargain-hunting is daily chart support has remained intact to establish a double bottom, while flushing out the S&P 500's similar but possibly begging to be hit pattern as it lined up with the closely watched 1100 level. 
"
891,CBOE,"The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX is a bit of wildcard for this strategist as it relates to fast operating bulls wishing to see Tuesday's lows as a technical line in the sand i.e. stop loss, for any bargain-hunting endeavors. For one, today's highs near 47% still managed to miss the August panic highs of 48%. Secondly and due to the elevated readings in the VIX of recent weeks, the gauge also narrowly missed stretching to a short-term extreme of 15% or more above its 10-day simple moving average with a result of roughly 13.50%. 
"
892,CBOE,"Is this a case of the price action being good enough for bargain-hunters and who might appreciate that perfection isn't necessarily all that it's cracked up to be when it comes to the market? Given the historically elevated readings in the VIX and near 9% drop in the broader market for the five day period, we certainly can't blame faster money types for trying to play, particularly so if they make good use of a limited risk spread strategy and keep to the fore-mentioned mercy point. 
"
893,CBOE,"For bears that've cared of late, we're a bit more confident and pragmatic Tuesday's price action is very much ""good enough"" for adjusting or exiting any short deltas which may have provided some decent coin during the market's downturn. While we still have our longer-term sights set on the 50% retracement area and the 1000 level in the S&P 500, the evidence is enough to respect the power of a bear market rally as a much more neutral option hedge hog.

895,CBOE,"With option premiums in the likes of the CBOE Volatility index just off 52-week and multi-year lows near 15%, well-bid premium i.e. high implied volatility, outside of names with earnings in their immediate future isn't all that common these days. Bid premium is even typically harder to come by if shares of the underlying instrument have held up well compared to the broader market, which as many can see on the chart of the S&P 500, is on less firm technical footing these days.
"
896,CBOE,"One hot spot defying those type odds and seeing elevated premiums as investors reach for protection with earnings still just more than a month out is Sina (SINA). Implieds in both its May and June contracts have spiked to levels not seen in more than a few months and already above the prices associated with its last report back on March 1. 
"
897,CBOE,"So, what gives? Bottom line, shares of SINA have quickly gone into a technical phase looking more than a bit parabolic in nature. Since staging a breakout in the 95 to 100 area back in mid March, shares are up in excess of 40%, punctuated by Monday's near 16.50% gain and today's continued push higher of more than 5% and intraday jump of nearly 10%. 
"
898,CBOE,"Implieds as you might well be aware, normally retreat when shares of a stock move smartly higher. During more pleasant market conditions, protection offered by purchased contracts is reduced as hand-in-hand, investor confidence grows and strategies such as buy-writes become de rigueur as far as being the right strategy to apply.
"
899,CBOE,"Further, shorting during such a move can be extra risky if the move in the underlying continues to make good on Wall Street adages like the trend is your friend or persistent trends can last longer than your wallet can hold out. In the end and under such circumstances, the compensation for shorting calls and / or premium in general can be every bit as damaging, if not even more, as an aggressive move lower in shares could ever be.

901,CBOE,"Mortals like me are still waiting on the headline cause for Wednesday's final 30 minutes and turn for the worse in the market. Maybe Brian Williams on NBC will fill me in later tonight. That said, price and sentiment was ""VIX'ing"" to say the least. Investors went from scooping up bargains from a technically quantified oversold and fearful market condition to giving back the bulk of intraday gains of about 1.25% in the S&P 500 and finishing with a rather meek increase of 0.28%. 
"
902,CBOE,"""How, now brown cow?"" With the VIX finishing just above 20% and matching Tuesday's fearful highs, the stretch in the market's most notorious sentiment gauge stands at an uneasy or rattled 17.50% relative to its 10-day simple moving average. As we discussed yesterday and in days past, during such relative bouts of panic or occasions of too much confidence like last Thursday, the price action typically spells opportunity for the contrarian investor. 
"
903,CBOE,"Opportunity of course doesn't mean there's a guarantee. But, I can say with rather strong authority that these less-than-common signals have consistently yielded profits to both short and even longer-term traders.

906,CBOE,"As quickly as the CBOE Volatility Index reclaimed the long dormant status of being a fear gauge, ""Poof."" In Monday's session the VIX saw continued selling pressure of option premiums from investors, whose collective risk appetites where whetted by positive developments on the M&A front, Japan and even military escalations in Libya, as war has historically proven to be a boon for bulls. 
"
907,CBOE,"That said, three days into a rally that's lifted the S&P 500 some 3.5% off its lows, filled a bearish gap and finds itself underneath key 50-day simple moving average and 1300 level resistance. Bears and maybe bulls looking for a better spot to protect their portfolios can look towards the long put strategy with more confidence. 
"
908,CBOE,"There are no guarantees of profits and who knows, in this game of March Madness a follow-through day could trigger as soon as tomorrow. However, if you like defined risk, technicals in your favor and fairly cheap premiums given the backdrop in volatility and historical prices, there's much less reason to feel like the mad money going forward if you take the step to use the protective qualities sometimes afforded by options, when they're available.

911,CBOE,"What do you think? Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below.As quickly as the CBOE Volatility Index reclaimed the long dormant status of being a fear gauge, ""Poof."" In Monday's session the VIX saw continued selling pressure of option premiums from investors, whose collective risk appetites where whetted by positive developments on the M&A front, Japan and even military escalations in Libya, as war has historically proven to be a boon for bulls. That said, three days into a rally that's lifted the S&P 500 some 3.5% off its lows, filled a bearish gap and finds itself underneath key 50-day simple moving average and 1300 level resistance. Bears and maybe bulls looking for a better spot to protect their portfolios can look towards the long put strategy with more confidence. There are no guarantees of profits and who knows, in this game of March Madness a follow-through day could trigger as soon as tomorrow. However, if you like defined risk, technicals in your favor and fairly cheap premiums given the backdrop in volatility and historical prices, there's much less reason to feel like the mad money going forward if you take the step to use the protective qualities sometimes afforded by options, when they're available.Shown above and illustrating a better-priced bear at resistance, is a two-lot at-the-money April 120 put in Wynn Resorts (WYNN), a name which found itself atop the Percentage Leaders board Monday on the Nasdaq 100.

912,CBOE,"Wide-and-loose trading in a stock is considered weak action. Can loose trading in the broad market tell us anything useful?
"
913,CBOE,"The short answer: Not really.
"
914,CBOE,"If you pull the Nasdaq's weekly charts for the past five bear markets, a pattern is clear.
"
915,CBOE,"The price spread between weekly highs and lows is generally tighter in a bull run than in a bearish slide.
"
916,CBOE,"This is true whether you are looking at the bullish run before a market top or the bullish run after a bear market.
"
917,CBOE,"How can we use this knowledge? We can't. By the time the pattern establishes itself, the market is usually well past a follow-through day  a rally confirmation found at every significant market bottom.
"
918,CBOE,"The major indexes have sometimes formed bullish patterns such as double bottoms or cups with handles, at bottoms. But by the time these formations are working, a follow-through has already happened.
"
919,CBOE,"Some technical analysts say that volatility in the market is useful in identifying a bottom.
"
920,CBOE,"The CBOE volatility index, or VIX, had a fairly good track record spotting market bottoms, at least until the bear market of 2000-02.
"
921,CBOE,"Since then, spikes in the VIX haven't necessarily predicted or coincided with market bottoms.
"
922,CBOE,"Index charts show that volatile action sometimes appears in a bearish trend  not around a bottom, but just before another trip down.
"
923,CBOE,"In early February, some technicians pointed to high volatility in the S&P 500. They wondered if the market had carved a bottom 1 .
"
924,CBOE,"It didn't work out that way. The S&P 500 pegged several new lows afterward  in March, 2 July 3 and September 4.

932,CBOE,"What did investors expect? I'm referring to Monday's push higher by the broader averages, which if one's focus was on a disappointing EU Summit, certainly wasn't supposed to have happened. On the other hand and enjoying strong confirmation of its prescient behavior is the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX.
"
933,CBOE,"Price action in the market's most notorious sentiment gauge has been very cooperative for bulls looking for spots to enter into and maybe schnitzel a little something from the portfolio during the past several sessions. Just over two weeks ago, the VIX signaled relative overconfidence on the part of bulls by stretching more than 15% below its 10-day simple moving average. 
"
934,CBOE,"Why is that typically important? As a mean-reverting instrument which can't go to zero or infinity (we think), sentiment embodied by the short-term average is prone to moving back towards the smoothed price line when the underlying stretches too far below or above it. 
"
935,CBOE,"Longer-term and as we wrote in more than a few columns at Optionetics since that cautionary reading emerged on October 14, we did see the first break of 30% in the VIX in more than two month's time as a solid event for bulls as it had acted as lateral support, as well as due to its historical significance as a level of over-the-top fear. 
"
936,CBOE,"That said and more immediately pressing at the time, the short-term ""stretch"" suggested a pullback from lows in the VIX before an anticipated second break below 30% might provide the real breakout opportunity for the likes of the S&P 500. Though we'll refrain from taking a deserved hat tip, as the market likes to humble such antics, it is nice when quiet attention paid to market sentiment does yield the desired results. 
"
937,CBOE,"What will Monday's sunnier market ways yield in the days ahead? Well, according to our continued interpretation of the VIX, today's dip of -6.75% to about 29.20% is a good one for bulls. Not only do we now have a second break below the key 30% level, but prices are about 8% below the 10-day simple moving average compared to a stretchy warning of 15%. Additionally, the VIX is still above its recent fair warning lows set back on the 14th. 
"
938,CBOE,"I'd go on to think after a prolonged period of abnormally high market volatility, the VIX is due to move back towards more historically normalized levels in the low to mid 20s. If that were to occur, another overly confident stretch signal would be generated. As much and as on the 14th, bulls might want to look at any open long delta positions moving in sync with the broader market and consider lightening up, then look to reload as conditions neutralize short-term.

"
941,CBOE,"The basis for our call was none other than the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX. Nominal highs of 23.2% didn't sound overly scary in their own right, but beneath the surface the market's fear gauge was doing more than a couple things to suggest a buyable low at or nearly close at hand. 
"
942,CBOE,"First off and as discussed, the mean-reverting sentiment index was clearly overbought relative to its 10-day simple moving average with a differential in excess of 25% between the two price lines. Secondly, that same action tested the November mini panic highs, as well as the 200-day simple moving average and looked to be setting up as a bearish shooting star candlestick pattern.

944,CBOE,"Some of today's pressure in excess of 10% on the VIX is the result of the looming weekend and traders once more, somewhat optimistically discounting the passage of time when there's no trading to be had. The funny part about that is sometimes painful lessons aren't so easily learned. 
"
945,CBOE,"In last Friday's ""Wall Street's Lunch Option"" column at Optionetics when the VIX was trading near 16%, we noted prevailing optimism that day effectively discounted the possibility of any catalysts rattling the markets while stateside investors enjoyed their little indigenous holiday.

949,CBOE,"IShares Barclays 1-3 Year Treasury Bond (SHY): I expect 2012 to be a very dangerous, possibly even devastating, year for stocks. It's better to be safe than sorry, hence my two-prong philosophy for 2012: 1) Preserve your capital. There are two types of losses an investor can suffer: a loss of opportunity or a loss of capital. There will always be another opportunity, but you need to preserve your capital to be able to take advantage of it. 2) Don't be shy about taking profits.
"
950,CBOE,"Key resistance and the likely range for a historic market top for the S&P 500 in 2011 was at 1,369-1,382, while key support was at 1,088. I think the bounce off support at 1,088 was a countertrend rally and expect the bear market will continue in 2012. The strategy is to sell into rallies.
"
951,CBOE,"Only a close above an important descending trend line (at 1,330 in January 2012) or the launch of more quantitative easing in the U.S. or something like QE in Europe would temporarily suspend my bearish outlook. I expect the S&P to drop below the October low at 1,074 and possibly much lower in 2012.
"
952,CBOE,"Conservative investors should stay out of the market or use tight stop-loss orders (right beneath important support). Cash is king in a deflationary environment, and one of the safest places to be in 2012 will be short-term U.S. Treasuries like SHY.

"
955,CBOE,"Should stocks rise, then an inverse ETF like RWM will fall — and that is the primary risk for this idea. While there are other inverse ETFs that will rise if the market goes down, I prefer RWM because it represents small-sized companies, which are fairly overvalued.
"
956,CBOE,"Expectations of high earnings growth have pushed the price of small stocks well above where the larger stocks in the overall market are. Moreover, small stocks are more volatile and therefore will decline at a much more rapid rate than larger stocks will.
"
957,CBOE,"The one argument against using an inverse of small-cap stocks is that they are less exposed to the global problems buffeting the world markets. But this assumes that the problems in the world won't eventually impact all issues, and this includes small companies in the U.S.
"
958,CBOE,"On its own, RWM is not a low-risk investment and investors should not put all their eggs in this one basket. But as hedge against other positions and in a prudent proportion to one's overall portfolio, RWM is an appropriate pick for a stock market that has risk written all over it.

While these ETNs are designed to track the VIX, they do not precisely replicate its action, and so your gains/losses could vary widely from that of the index.

975,CBOE,"In the past two days, we looked at two indicators — Investors Intelligence's bulls vs. bears ratio and the puts vs. calls gauge. Today we look at other psychological indicators.
"
976,CBOE,"• CBOE Market Volatility Index: This is a measure of fear. It gauges the market's expectation for volatility. Above 50 is bullish. The gauge has a mixed record. The five-year high of 103.4 was made on Oct. 10, 2008 — five months before the bear market's low.
"
977,CBOE,"• Mutual Fund Share Purchases/Redemptions: The idea is that when fund purchases rise and redemptions fall, the funds have more cash. Thus the market finds fuel. The five-year high was Dec. 1, 2006, not a significant juncture.
"
978,CBOE,"• Nasdaq daily trading volume as a percentage of NYSE daily volume: Once a speculation gauge, ""This measure provided a helpful tip-off of impending trouble during the summer of 1983, when Nasdaq volume increased significantly relative to the Big Board's,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J.

"
979,CBOE,"But Nasdaq trade has grown. It's no longer a speculation gauge.

992,CBOE,"Most ETFs fulfill the promise of low cost and all-day trade. But some are so rife with flaws, they should be handled with great care or avoided altogether. We asked several ETF strategists to tell us which they think are the worst ETFs and why.
"
993,CBOE," Ron Rowland, founder, All Star Investor and Capital Cities Asset Management, Austin, Texas.
"
994,CBOE,"Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP): Ever since Congress created the Investment Company Act of 1940, the investing public has come to associate mutual funds, and now ETFs, as investment vehicles that are ""pass-through"" structures from an income tax standpoint. In other words, investors believe that funds themselves do not incur or pay any taxes. Any and all tax obligations are ""passed through"" to the shareholders. AMLP changed that.
"
995,CBOE,"There are more than 1,100 ETFs and ETNs listed for trading in the U.S. today. Of those, AMLP is the only one structured as a C-corporation. Because it is the first of its kind, investors are not aware of the outrageous expenses that come with this structure.
"
996,CBOE,"As a C-corp, it has to pay 35% federal income tax on all capital gains (price appreciation) as well as various state tax liabilities. This burden is of course ultimately borne by the shareholders.
"
997,CBOE,"Since AMLP does not know who or how many shareholders it will have when its tax bill becomes due, it must accrue this on a daily basis. AMLP accomplishes this by reducing the daily price change by 37.5%, leaving shareholders with the other 62.5%.
"
998,CBOE,"According to data from AMLP's website, since its launch on Aug. 25, 2010, through the end of 2010, AMLP shareholders only received 65% of the total return generated by the underlying benchmark index (8.7% vs. 13.5%). That is the equivalent of a 35% expense ratio.
"
999,CBOE,"The 35% entity-level tax obligation is before and in addition to the shareholder's tax obligations. If you bought AMLP in a taxable account when it was launched and sold on Dec. 31, you now owe taxes on your 8.7% return. Depending on your tax rate, this might reduce your return by another 20% to 40% of the remainder. It's essentially the compounding of taxes, or double taxation.
"
1000,CBOE,"AMLP likes to counter this argument, saying that their distributions are tax-deferred. However, tax-deferred is not the same as tax-free, and having the fund pay 35% corporate taxes seems to defeat the whole purpose. MLPs are one of the most tax-efficient vehicles available to investors. However, AMLP is the least tax-efficient ETF that I'm aware of.

1003,CBOE,"RBS U.S. Large Cap Trendpilot ETN (TRND): Trend following has become a very popular investment strategy, so a trend-following exchange traded product seems like it might be a big hit. The RBS U.S. Large Cap Trendpilot ETN is a relatively simple product. When the S&P 500 is above its 200-day moving average, investors get exposure to equities. When the S&P 500 dips below its 200-day, exposure is shifted to low-risk Treasuries.
"
1004,CBOE,"But TRND is full of faults, and just doesn't make much sense for investors. For starters, the fees charged by this product are just plain ridiculous. When the strategy is invested in the S&P 500, expenses accrue at an annual rate of 1.0%. That's almost 17 times the fees charged by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). When invested in Treasuries, expenses accrue at 0.50%, or 41 basis points more than PIMCO 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury Index ETF (TUZ). There's nothing proprietary or complex about the underlying strategy, so going the do-it-yourself route could save you quite a bit in fees.
"
1005,CBOE,"Then there's the potential ""strategy lag"" that results from TRND's methodology. Most investors implementing a trend-following strategy shift exposure as soon as a specified price point (such as the 200-day moving average) is crossed. But TRND implements a bastardized version of trend following; in order to shift into equity exposure, the S&P 500 must be above its moving average for five consecutive trading days. Conversely, it takes five straight days below to get into cash. That puts TRND behind the trend-following curve, potentially leaving some money on the table.
"
1006,CBOE,"To top it off, TRND is a debt security issued by a financial institution that not long ago needed a $75 billion bailout just to stay afloat. Not exactly a recipe for investing success.

1008,CBOE,"United States Natural Gas (UNG): UNG invests in near-month natural gas futures contracts. As each month draws to a close, UNG rolls its position forward by selling the near-month position and buying a contract further from expiration. This helps the fund avoid taking physical delivery of natural gas.
"
1009,CBOE,"When prices of the longer-dated futures contracts exceed the price of the front-month contract — i.e., an upward sloping forward price curve, also called contango — the fund loses money each time it rolls its position.
"
1010,CBOE,"UNG currently has two strikes against it. One is the oversupply of natural gas. The other is the price structure of the forward curve.
"
1011,CBOE,"Weak industrial demand, coupled with excess supplies resulting from investments made in recent years, has caused inventories of natural gas to swell. The U. S. Energy Information Administration states that working gas in storage tallied 2,959 billion cubic feet as of Jan. 7, 2011. As such, gas inventories are 161 bcf above their five-year average of 2,798 bcf.
"
1012,CBOE,"Looking at the price structure, natural gas for February delivery is currently changing hands at $4.42 per MMBtu. The prices for delivery further out are higher. Prices for deliveries three months, six months and one year out are $4.47, $4.62, and $5.19, respectively. In other words, the natural gas forward price curve is in contango, a situation that is detrimental to the performance of UNG.
"
1013,CBOE,"If one expects economic recovery to gain further traction in 2011, it is reasonable to assume that industrial demand for natural gas will pick up and enable the price of natural gas to increase in 2011.
"
1014,CBOE,"A better way to profit from the rise in price of natural gas is through natural gas stocks, either via direct ownership of stocks of natural gas producers or natural gas ETFs such as First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas (FCG) or such natural gas mutual funds as Fidelity's Select Natural Gas .
"
1015,CBOE,"The negative roll yield that will result from natural gas' contango price structure will be a drag on the performance of UNG. UNG should be avoided at least until the natural gas price structure takes on a downward slope, i.e., backwardation, and the positive roll yield will become a tail wind.

1429,CBOE,"Investors would have to be living in a cave to have not noticed the meteoric rise and recent pullback in the price of Bitcoin over the past year. Anyone who trades has to be intrigued by (and possibly skeptical of) any widely held asset that exhibits that kind of price volatility.But is it a fad, a bubble, or a legitimate investment opportunity?Spoiler Alert: It’s all of the above.Bitcoin as a crypto-currency was born out of the ashes of the financial crisis of 2008. Initially a response to the idea of governments “printing money” – expanding the balance sheets of central banks – in order to bail out troubled financial institutions and stimulate the economy. It was an attempt to de-centralize the notion of currency.Invented by a reclusive and mysterious programmer with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the concept was to separate the control of the supply of money from the government and central banks and hand it to the market participants who use it as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Nakamoto also intended to remove the friction from financial transactions, allowing vendors and customers (or anybody) to transfer money directly to each other instantly and electronically without the participation of middlemen like banks or credit card processors.The actual identity of Nakamoto is not known, and it may in fact not be a single person. This doesn’t really matter as the source code was intentionally made available to anyone and “Nakamoto” has ceased interacting with the public or the bitcoin network.The “Blockchain”The revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin was the establishment of a distributed ledger in which transactions are verified and recorded by multiple parties in a vast peer to peer network. Every participant records and stores every transaction that has ever happened, broken down into manageable chucks of data called “blocks.” Every participant must agree that they have an identical copy of the previous set of transactions and that the new trade belongs at the end of the list.Because all participants must agree on the sequence of transactions, it would be functionally impossible for anyone with nefarious intent to add a fraudulent transaction to the chain (or delete a legitimate one) since the change would have to happen simultaneously in thousands of places. This also means that the network literally gets more secure with every transaction processed - as the list that would have to be altered grows ever larger.“Miners”The participants who process transactions and store the data of the blockchain are called Bitcoin “miners”, so named because their incentive is to be rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts. The network has them process a very computationally difficult math problem to complete transactions. New bitcoins are awarded to the miners who solve the problem first. The fact that the problem gets continuously more difficult ensures that a large number of participants devotes a massive amount of computing power to the network, making it faster.With the runup in the price of bitcoin over the last 4 years, the incentive to mine coins successfully has spawned huge operations using sophisticated hardware who are competing with each other for the increasingly valuable coins. Initially, mining could be accomplished by an individual with a fast personal computer, but migrated quickly to arrays of graphics cards that could solve the problems faster and then to dedicated mining “rigs” which are commercially available and designed for the singular task of mining bitcoin and other crypto currencies.The electricity to run all of these powerful computers and also the air-conditioning to cool them is the biggest component of the cost structure for miners. As the arms race for the fastest computers continues, mitigating the energy costs associated with mining is the miner’s holy grail.So How Can You Invest in Bitcoin?There are many ways to gain investment exposure to crypto currencies:Buy BitcoinsThere are now numerous online marketplaces that allow you to buy bitcoin (and numerous crypto currencies) fairly easily. You deposit U.S dollars and once the fund transfer is verified, you can buy bitcoin, participate in the price appreciation or depreciation and turn your bitcoin holdings back into dollars whenever you wish.Buy Bitcoin FuturesFutures contracts on Bitcoin are traded on both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and the CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report). Trading bitcoin futures allows an investor to participate in price appreciation (or depreciation – they can be sold as well) without any risk of interacting with an upstart exchange. Trades on both the CME and CBOE are backed by the assets of extremely well capitalized clearing corporations, so there is no risk of the exchange being hacked and losing crypto currency as has happened in the past – albeit infrequently – with online crypto exchanges.The advent of listed futures contracts also provided traders with the first simple way to short the price of bitcoin, and many have done so. The decline from $19,000 to $7,000 over the past six months is widely attributed to the existence of liquid, shortable bitcoin securities. This is actually healthy for the market since instruments that allow market participants to easily express both long and short sentiment tend to restrain bubble-type price activity.Buy Blockchain CompaniesMany companies now sell equipment and software designed specifically for mining crypto currencies. Recall that only the miners with the fastest and most efficient technology are able to process transactions quickly and efficiently enough to profit from the activity. Miners are constantly in search of processors and peripheral hardware that put them at the front of the line when new coins are minted and issued.From upstart companies producing equipment designed for the sole purpose of mining to more traditional hardware manufacturers like Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) whose existing products are commonly used for mining, a tremendous amount of hardware is being purchased and utilized for blockchain-related activity.Buy the Forward ThinkersIt is commonly believed that the real value in bitcoin is not necessarily the price of the coins themselves (which need to exist to compensate the processors on the network), but in the blockchain itself. Future applications of the distributed ledger technology could be used in any field where data needs to be transmitted electronically and stored securely.Financial transactions, legal documents and medical records are obvious candidates for blockchain processing.Some traditional finance companies including Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) have devoted significant resources to developing systems for blockchain transactions and will be the first to benefit if and when the technology is applied to other areas beyond currencies.Managed ExposureStay tuned to this same space Tuesday for a look at one new ETF that seeks to provide investors a one-stop shop for all of these blockchain investment concepts. I’ll be at the New York Stock Exchange to discuss the product with the founder and manager of the fund and will report back tomorrow.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

1431,CBOE,"U.S. small-caps have been continuously lagging their large-cap counterparts this year. Although small-cap stocks have had a disappointing earnings season, large-cap stocks have been gaining on strong earnings, currency effects and higher growth prospects, internationally. Small-cap stocks on the other hand are more domestically focused.The largest small-cap ETF tracking the Russell 2000 index, iShares Russell 2000 ETF is up 0.05% so far this year, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is up around 11%.The primary reason for this underperformance can be accounted to uncertainty around the implementation of President Donald Trump’s proposed tax cuts and deregulation.Trump’s failure to pass the Healthcare bill has raised concerns amongst investors about his ability to pass the tax reform. Tax cuts will be highly beneficial to small-caps as they are not subject to different tax regimes owing to their domestic focus and thus end up paying higher taxes (read: 2 Steady Sector ETFs Amid August's Market Crash).The U.S. economy faces high geopolitical risks owing to rising tensions with North Korea. Adding to the agony, Trump’s reaction to the Charlottesville protests invited widespread criticism from his critics as he said that both sides were to blame for the violence.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. small-cap equities (read: Bet on Momentum with These ETFs & Stocks).iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to small cap U.S. companies and tracks the Russell 2000 index.It has AUM of $34.36 billion and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year.

1432,CBOE,"Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) reported average daily volume (ADV) of nearly 7 million for May 2018. Though ADV declined 5.3% year over year, shares of the company gained nearly 3.6% in the last couple of trading sessions.Total contracts for the month were 152.9 million, slipping nearly 5.3% year over year. Of this, options contracts declined 4.7% year over year to 147.6 million while futures contracts fell 4.7% to 5.4 million from the year-ago tally. While Options ADV was 6.7 million, Futures’ was 0.2 million.Subsequently, ADV of the U.S. Equities Matched came in at 1.3 million shares last month, down 2.6% year over year whereas the European Equities Matched contracted 2.9% year over year to €10.5 billion. The Global FX Matched improved 45.3% to nearly $40.9 billion.Though the May volumes were down compared with the year-ago level, the company has witnessed a year-to-date ADV increasing year over year. Rise in trading volumes should consistently drive transaction fees (accounting for 70% of total operating revenues in 2017). As a result, the company has kept the revenue growth momentum up for the past several years.We believe the company to retain  this positive trend in the coming quarters, backed by a strong market position, global reach, prudent acquisitions and a robust portfolio of proprietary products.Shares of Cboe Global Markets have lost 17.4% year to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 10.6%. Nonetheless, we expect market volatility lending momentum to trading volumes and benefits derived from Bats Global acquisition to help the stock rebound. Cboe Global carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1433,CBOE,"It was widely reported on Wednesday that a trading desk at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) had made a profit of $200 million dollars in a single day trading the CBOE Volatility Index.Goldman is reported to have been long the index on February 5th, a day the S&P 500 sank more than 4% and the VIX more than doubled.  Though it was not disclosed exactly which instruments the firm was trading, in the wake of the news, this seems like an appropriate time to examine how the VIX works, who trades it and why, and how an individual investor might take advantage of opportunities in VIX options.VIX HistoryThe Chicago Board Options Exchange - now CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) - introduced the VIX index in 1993 as a single number that would allow traders and the investing public to know the level of implied volatility in options on the broad markets.  The original VIX was calculated from 8 front-month options on the OEX (the CBOE’s index on the S&P 100.)  Historical values going back several years were also made available at that time.  In 2003, the calculation of the VIX was modified to use the more liquid options on the S&P 500 - the SPX - and the basket of options in the calculation was expanded to a weighted average of all the at-the money and out-of-the-money options in the front two months with an average of 30 days to expiration. The intention was to make the index a more representative sample of the option market’s prediction of future volatility.In 2004, the CBOE introduced futures contracts on the VIX.  Because no physical commodity or instrument can be exchanged, VIX futures are cash settled, with the two counter-parties to a trade exchanging the cash value of the difference between the traded price and the settlement price of the index at expiration.  In 2006, the CBOE first listed options on the VIX.  Like the VIX futures, the options are cash settled with the difference between the settlement price and the strike price of in the money options exchanged.  Other than the fact that they are cash-settled and are European exercise (they cannot be exercised prior to expiration - which is a basically inconsequential detail to most individual investors) they trade just like options on individual stocks. Several ETFs have subsequently been introduced that allow traders to gain long or short exposure to the VIX, including some that are double or triple leveraged.For reference, the highest value ever recorded in the VIX intraday is 89.53% and the highest close is 80.86%, both occurring during the financial crisis of 2008.  The all-time intraday low is 8.56%, and the lowest close ever is 9.14%, both occurring in late 2017.The long-term average price of the VIX is slightly less than 19.9%. The average over the past few years has been closer to 12%, but with a few huge spikes.Although it is commonly referred to as the market’s “fear gauge”, high VIX values could actually mean an expectation of a large move in either direction, but because of the well-documented belief that markets fall faster in bad times than they rise in good times, the VIX tends to increase most in times of market panic when stock prices are moving down.VIX Futures PricesThe VIX futures are almost always higher than the cash VIX value in a price relationship known as contango.  As the expiration of a futures contract nears, the price of the futures steadily converges with the cash (or “spot”) price of the index.  At expiration, the settlement price used is the cash price.In quiet and steadily rising markets - like we saw between 2016 and February of 2018 - this contango relationship creates an opportunity to make easy profits selling VIX futures.  Because observed volatility was very low during this period and the VIX mostly stayed in the low teens, traders could make money by selling VIX futures and simply waiting for them to converge with the (lower) cash VIX price.  In many cases, instead of selling the actual futures, traders purchased the XIV, an ETF that replicated a short position in near term futures - except with 2X leverage.There are several factors that contributed to the extremely low volatility experienced during this period, but it is widely agreed that a major factor was the growing propensity of individual investors to eschew actively managed funds and instead pour their money into broad-based index funds.  Consistent inflows into a diverse basket of stocks tends to dampen the price volatility of the basket.Look Out for the SteamrollerWith the benefit of hindsight, we can see how this trade ultimately turned out.  Selling VIX futures turned out to be what is commonly known in the industry as “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller,” meaning taking a succession of small profits, while ignoring the probability of an out-sized loss that wipes out all of the accumulated profits and potentially much more.Why would a trader take risks that eclipsed the potential rewards?  There are two main reasons.  One is that the trader is ignorant of the risk - or at least vastly underestimates it.  The other possible reason is that the trader does understand the risk, but because of a contractual arrangement with either investors (in the case of a hedge fund manager) or the trader’s employer (in the case of a firm proprietary trader) it is in the trader’s immediate best interest to book easy profits while taking outsized risk - because he will be paid a portion of the profits if the trade works, but is not made to personally bear a share of the losses if it doesn’t.  Hint: In the long run, it’s profitable to be on the other side of the trades of either of those traders.In an August 2017 article on the growing popularity of leveraged VIX and inverse VIX ETF products despite the risks, the New York Times profiled a trader who had quit his job as a manager at a Target store to sell the VIX full time.  He claimed to have started with $500K and grew the account to $12 million over the preceding few years.  When the Times interviewed that trader again, one day after the VIX experienced its biggest single-day spike ever (on February 5th, the same day Goldman Sachs took in that $200M haul), he admitted to feeling pain in the trade, but said he was still betting 21% of his portfolio – or $600,000 – in continuing to sell the VIX.  If 21% of his portfolio was then worth $600K, some quick math would suggest that he had already lost $9 million - a 75% drawdown.The double short XIV ETF was closed down completely in February by the issuer after losing over 80% of its value in a short period of time. Many traders who were short the VIX faced margin calls and had to either post additional capital to maintain their accounts, or have their trades liquidated at steep losses.Online broker Charles Schwab (SCHW  -  Free Report) reported a $15M non-recurring charge in the first quarter of 2018 to cover the negative account values of customers who were selling VIX products and suffered losses in excess of funds on deposit.Profit and ProtectionEven if you buy the premise that selling VIX instruments for short term profits is ultimately a losing trade, doing the opposite can be painful in a different way. Investors who own VIX futures or ETFs tend to suffer constant losses for months or even years before experiencing an increased volatility event that makes the trade profitable.Admittedly, this can be an emotionally difficult way to trade.When considered as a hedge against a diversified portfolio of equities however, owning calls on the VIX starts to look like a wise decision.  Though they are likely to decline in value during steadily rising markets, those options will rise significantly in value at exactly the times during which the broad markets are experiencing the most difficulty.Goldman Sachs had the prescience and discipline to stay long fairly inexpensive VIX instruments in order to be able to sell them out at hugely profitable prices when the rest of the market needed them most.In the end, the decision come down to a simple question.  Do you want to be positioned like Goldman - one of the most sophisticated and successful firms on the street, or do you want to be positioned like a short-sighted day trader who will soon be looking for a new day job?Owning VIX calls is a fairly simple way for an individual investor to protect gains in the equity markets, knowing that the long term odds of success are on your side.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1434,CBOE,"Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) is the most heavily shorted stock in the market by a wide margin. With somewhere in the neighborhood of $11 billion in short interest, it easily tops the second most shorted company in the U.S., Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), which currently has about $9B of shorts.  When measured in terms of market capitalization, however, Tesla short interest is even more significant.  Apple’s market cap is $930B, compared to Tesla’s $50B. That means that more than 20% of Tesla’s market cap (and 30% of shares actually available to borrow and sell) is short interest.Tesla has been heavily shorted for most of its tenure as a public company and for the most part, it has been a painful trade as the shares marched from the high teens in 2010 to an all-time high of $389 in 2017.  The shorts took in…well…in the shorts during the first big run-ups to $180 in 2013, and then to $280 in 2014, and finally to $389 last year.  Though it’s impossible to exactly quantify the effect, short covering is believed to have been a major catalyst in each of these bull runs. Emboldened by the recent sell-off in share value, significant uncertainty surrounding Tesla’s production issues with the mass-market Model 3 and its ability to turn a profit, the shorts have piled in heavily again, betting that the shares will fall and they’ll be there to reap the rewards.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has directly targeted short sellers, both by personally purchasing additional shares (though his recent purchase of $10M in stock is largely symbolic in the face of $11B in short interest) and also with a bit of jawboning on Twitter in which he bragged, “Oh and Uh short burn of the century comin (sic) soon.”  A quick aside: The short burn of this century so far was the incredible squeeze in shares of Volkswagen A.G in 2008, when Porsche announced that they owned 43% of outstanding shares and held options to acquire 33% more. Combined with the government ownership of 20%, that meant less than 6% of shares were available to cover short positions and the stock rallied 500% in three days, eviscerating the shorts who were left scrambling to cover.  Unless Tesla does something really spectacular – beyond what even the biggest Tesla bulls expect - 500% inside of a week is likely to stand for a while as the undisputed King of short squeezes.Short Selling, a PrimerTo understand how a short squeeze, let’s quickly examine the mechanics of the trade.In a typical short sale, a trader who wants to bet on a decline in a stock’s price will borrow shares from a broker who is holding long shares for a customer and then sell those shares to the market.  To close the trade, the trader buys the shares back in the market and returns them to the brokerage customer.  If the stock has declined and the repurchase price is lower than the initial sale, the trader pockets the difference. Additionally, while the short trade is on, the trader earns interest on the cash balance resulting from the sale. For most large-cap stocks, there are so many shares available that traders can sell short freely - as there are always plenty of shares to borrow.  The short seller can still lose money if the stock rallies instead of declining, but the trader is basically free to enter and exit the trade at will.In smaller stocks though, especially those with a significant percentage of short interest, when good news is announced and investors buy shares to increase long exposure in the stock, short sellers who want to cut their losses and head for the exits find that all the shorts are heading there at the same time.  The scarcity of shares available to buy is so small that the short covering drives up the price even further, amplifying losses for those who exit late. This is a basic “Short Squeeze.”Regulation enacted by the SEC in 2008 to end “naked” short selling - or selling shares that have not actually been borrowed ahead of time - exacerbates the short squeeze effect.What Does This Have to Do With Options?In addition to traditional short selling, many traders have taken net short positions in Tesla using options.  Typically, buying puts is a more popular way to make a short bet in a stock than selling calls due to the aspect of limited risk and unlimited return, though some shorts may sell calls as well, sometimes to finance the long puts.You’ll recall from the Know Your Options piece on Implied Volatility (read it here>>), that options market makers generally hedge the delta of their option position by buying or selling the underlying stock to become delta-neutral – or indifferent to small changes in the price of the stock.  Also recall that when the stock moves a significant amount, those market makers need to adjust their hedge trades as the option deltas change so that they are delta neutral at the new stock price. When a trader initiates a short position by buying puts, the market maker that sold them typically sells stock to make the total delta of his position close to zero.  Then, as the stock moves up or down, the delta of the puts changes and the market maker buys or sells shares to re-adjust the position delta.Let’s examine what happens when a heavily shorted stock begins to rally.Let’s say a large number of shorts have purchased at-the-money puts in Tesla.  The market makers (who sold the puts) sell shares short in the market as a hedge, at a ratio of one share for every 2 options - because at the money options have a delta of 0.50 (or 50 Delta).  So if the short trader purchased 1,000 puts, the market makers would collectively sell 50,000 shares as a hedge.If the stock were to rise, the delta of the puts would fall, as they would no longer be at the money. The farther out of the money an option is, the lower the delta.  If the delta of those puts fell to 0.40, the market makers would have 10,000 shares to buy to adjust their position delta to neutral.  If the stock continued to rally and the put delta was now 0.30, they’d have 10,000 more to buy, and so on until the delta of the options was close to zero.  This option re-hedging can have a significant effect during a short squeeze because even if the shorts who have sold the actual shares are brave enough (or well capitalized enough) to take the paper loss and avoid buying shares in a rising market, if there are a significant amount of puts outstanding, the sellers of the puts are likely to be buying shares no matter what, piling on during the run-up in the stock.Examining the data on TeslaSo if a stock with large ownership of put options is especially vulnerable to short squeezes because of the additional buying volumes as traders adjust hedges, what does open interest in options tell us about Tesla?  Specifically, let’s examine how much of the option open interest is puts and how much is calls.The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) has published data on the put/call ratio across options on all stocks for every single trading day back to 2006.  It’s too large a set of data to effectively reproduce here, but it can be found on the CBOE website here for anyone who’s interested.  Over 2904 trading days, the average put/call ratio is 0.65, meaning about 3 calls trade for every 2 puts.  That’s across the entire universe of equity options. This stands to reason as the markets have generally risen during that period and most investors have a bullish bias. (There are a few brief periods during the financial crisis in 2008 when puts outnumbered calls.)As of May 15th, the put/call ratio in Tesla options for outstanding options with 120 days to expiration (through the next earnings cycle) is a whopping  2.4! That is, there have been nearly 5 puts purchased for every 2 calls.  Additionally, the average implied volatility for puts is historically high at 52%, suggesting that many more options have been purchased by the investing public than sold.Additionally, because the shares are scarce and sometimes difficult to locate before being sold, traders with a short position do not earn interest on short position.  Rather, they actually pay to be short to compensate the brokerage firm for finding shares to sell.  The current rates are about 2.3% annually for professional market makers and between 3% and 6% annually for retail investors.  The normal ""short rebate"" is negative, so it's actually a short fee.The large numbers of puts market makers are short is likely to accelerate any rapid upward movement in the stock as re-hedging activity requires the purchase of large numbers of shares.When combined with scarcity of common shares available for purchase to cover shorts and a negative short rebate, options open interest is likely to add to any short squeeze if it materializes.Of course, if Tesla fails to deliver on the Model 3 or if there’s a slew of other negative news, the stock could decline and all this will be a moot point, but the data suggests that if the stock does start to rally sharply, it’s going to have a strong tailwind behind it.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

1435,CBOE,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX  -  Free Report), a provider of electronic trading network for the institutional market in U.S. credit products.While MarketAxess’ growth strategy has led to noticeable top and bottom-line growth, escalating costs remain a significant headwind. Total expenses increased at 11% on average from 2013-2016, thereby weighing on the company’s margins and by 6.4% in the first half of 2017.We estimate the company’s expenses to rise over the coming quarters given its ongoing investments in several areas including trading platform, new protocols and infrastructure as well as headcount additions. Notably, for 2017, the company anticipates total expenses in the range of $192-$208 million. The midpoint of this range reflects about 12% year-over-year increase in expenses.Over the past six months, shares of MarketAxess have returned 3% underperforming the gain of 8.5% logged by the industry. It also fared poorly compared with returns of 22.2%, 10.4% and 7.4% for CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report), Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) and Nasdaq Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report), respectively. Given the headwinds faced by the company, its shares are expected to remain under pressure in the coming quarters.During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.10 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.5% on higher trading volumes. Also, the bottom line improved 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Nevertheless, MarketAxess's valuation looks stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s one-forward price-to-earnings ratio, investors might not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a one-year forward P/E ratio of 49 which is above its median range of 40. It is also higher than the one-year forward P/E ratio of 24.12 for the industry and 19.56 for the S&P 500.MarketAxess carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1436,CBOE,"Per a National Federation of Independent Business report released August 9, 2017, small business activity improved in July. The index increased to 105.2 in July compared with 103.6 in June and was above market forecast of 103.5.The optimism is primarily being attributed to strong economic sentiment, supported by higher consumer confidence.A resilient labor market also contributed to the optimism. Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed non-farm payrolls addition of 209,000 in July, surpassing market estimates of 180,000 (read: ETFs to Buy or Dump Post Upbeat July Jobs Data).Moreover, the unemployment rate declined to 4.3% compared with 4.4% in the previous month. Also, a measure of labor demand, as calculated by U.S. job openings, jumped to a record 17-year high in June, as it increased by 461,000 to a seasonally adjusted figure of 6.2 million.The economy also seems to be in good shape. GDP in Q2 grew 2.6% owing to a boost from trade. Strong consumer confidence is also representative of optimism in the economy, as it hit a 16-year high of 121.1 in July compared with 118.9 in June.However, the U.S. economy faces high geopolitical risks owing to rising tensions with North Korea.

1437,CBOE,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) has reported mixed volumes for second-quarter 2018. While U.S. equity options volume increased 8% year over year to 417 million contracts, European options and futures volumes registered 21.9 million contracts, down 1.4% year over year.However, revenues per contract for U.S. equity options remained flat year over year at 15 cents, although the same for European options and futures expanded 12.8% to 44 cents.Under its cash equities, Nasdaq’s U.S. matched equity volume in the first quarter totaled 83.8 billion shares, up 5.6% from the prior-year quarter. While the European equity volume rose 5.5% year over year to $232 billion. Again, the U.S. Fixed income volume contracted 13% year over year to $4,134 billion. Whereas the European fixed income volume was 7.5 million contracts, up 7.1% year over year.Nasdaq’s strategic initiatives have always accelerated growth. Improvement in non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues has been driving revenues. Management’s medium-term outlook calls for 8-11% growth.Moreover, strategic acquisitions have been helping the company diversify as well as add capabilities to its portfolio. The organization is also intensifying its focus on Nasdaq Private Market Alternatives and the Nasdaq Ventures to ramp up its growth profile over a longer term.In the second quarter, there were 3,632 listed companies on Nasdaq compared with 3,512 in the year-ago period. Total listings grew 4% over the year-earlier quarter to 4,021.Shares of Nasdaq have rallied 18.7% in a year, outperforming the industry's increase of 5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter bottom line is pegged at $1.18, reflecting a 15.7% year-over-year climb on 2.9% higher revenues. The company is set to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 25 before the market opens.Our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat estimates this to-be-reported quarter. This is because though the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its combination with an Earnings ESP of -2.27% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concurrently, Nasdaq reported mixed June volumes. The U.S. equity options volume inched up nearly 1.5% year over year to 139 million contracts.

"
1440,CBOE,"When the CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) shut its last old-school human trading pits the last few weeks -- in both New York City and Chicago -- it said it all. Growth and profits can be found solely in electronic trading.
"
1441,CBOE,"When both individuals and trading firms get active and flex trading muscle, they approach a flickering quote screen. Conveniently placed behind that screen, security exchanges benefit. Click that button to either buy or sell. You initiate a series of profitable activities across a software- and server-driven landscape.
"
1442,CBOE,"In turn, the 6-company strong SECURITIES EXCHANGES industry Zacks organizes looks hot for investors. Financial exchange operators hold a Zacks Industry Rank of 6 out of 265 industries we track. It ran 14 notches higher over the last week. Industry-wide, Zacks counted 21 positive earnings estimate revisions, well ahead of 14 negative revisions.
"
1443,CBOE,"Buy stocks benefiting from broad earnings estimate support. That core Zacks logic has proven to deliver big returns for long investors. In the last two weeks, all 6 companies in the securities exchange industry held either a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) or a #2 (Buy) rating. You won’t see that very often, if at all.
"
1444,CBOE,"Investors can tap the major players in this industry first. Major exchange players would be the CME Group for futures, the CBOE Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) or the NASDAQ Market Site (NDAQ  -  Free Report) for stocks. They remain very attractive picks. Exchanges bank bucks for shareholders. Annual EPS estimates for 2015 range from $2.47 to $12.28 at the high end.
"
1445,CBOE,"However, this week, two lesser-known companies lead the Zacks Rank pack.  
"
1446,CBOE,"The two Zacks #1 Rank picks are Markit Ltd. (MRKT) and MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX  -  Free Report) this week. The former is a large cap, the latter a mid-cap stock.
"
1447,CBOE,"Markit Ltd. focuses on providing financial information services. The company provides pricing and reference data, indices, valuation and trading services, trade processing, enterprise software and managed services. Markit operates in three segments: Information, Processing and Solutions.
"
1448,CBOE,"Customers include banks, hedge funds, asset managers, central banks, regulators, auditors, fund administrators and insurance companies. Markit Ltd. is headquartered in London.
"
1449,CBOE,"MRKT is a large-cap blend stock. Shares price around $26. Company EPS looks to grow +5%, rising from $1.43 in 2015 to $1.50 in 2016. EPS looks to track +5 to +6% annual revenue growth higher. Serving as a catalyst, consensus annual estimate revisions went up +1% to 3% over the last 30 days.  
"
1450,CBOE,"The forward P/E is high at 18. The Price to Sales ratio is 4.4. These two valuation ratios tell you this is NOT a cheap stock. The momentum is there to go higher, but be vigilant, given the rich valuation.
"
1451,CBOE,"MarketAxess Holdings Inc. operates a leading platform for electronic trading of corporate bonds.
"
1452,CBOE,"Active institutional investor clients access bond liquidity provided by broker-dealer clients. MarketAxcess also provides data and analytical tools to help make trading decisions.
"
1453,CBOE,"Clients trade U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, European high-grade corporate bonds, credit default swaps, agencies, high-yield and emerging markets bonds through their electronic systems.
"
1454,CBOE,"MKTX is a mid-cap growth stock. Along with Zacks #1 Strong Buy Rank, we also assigned a longer-term Zack Outperform rating to this stock. The last 10 quarterly reports count 10 consecutive EPS surprises of between zero and +11%.
"
1455,CBOE,"Shares price at $81. Company EPS looks to grow +17% to +19% over the next two years. Revenue growth should be +13% annually. This tallies up EPS of $2.38 a share in 2015 and $2.84 a share in 2016.
"
1456,CBOE,"Want one big note of concern? The forward P/E ratio is a nosebleed 34. The Price to Sales ratio is a stunning 11.6. Again, this is a very richly priced stock. Again, momentum is there to go higher, but remain vigilant.
"
1457,CBOE,"Summary: Tap two lesser-known picks to play this great segment. Or choose one of the major exchange operators and ride it to share-owning success. Either way, the industry bench is deep. Underlying profits and growth fundamentals look strong for both. Electronic trading is here to stay.
"
1458,CBOE,"Looking for another way to play rising interest rates besides buying banks? How about the world's largest futures exchange which handles over $3 trillion worth of interest rate derivatives contracts every day.
"
1459,CBOE,"CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) created the world's largest market place for yield curve hedging by institutions and corporations when it bought the Chicago Board of Trade a few years ago. This brought 30-year Treasury bond and 10-year Treasury note futures under the same roof as CME's flagship interest rate product, Eurodollar futures.
"
1460,CBOE,"What's a Eurodollar?
"
1461,CBOE,"Eurodollar futures are a vehicle designed to allow banks, companies, and other financial entities with lending or borrowing risk exposure to hedge short-term rates on US dollars on deposit overseas. London is the home of the cash market for trading dollars in foreign banks and thus Eurodollar interest rates are closely related to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
"
1462,CBOE,"At CME, quarterly futures contracts are available going out ten years so that institutions can create complex hedging programs that cover many types of interest rate risk, from corporate loans that may not commence for many quarters to large bank mortgage portfolios with sophisticated duration exposures.
"
1463,CBOE,"Because each Eurodollar contract represents $1 million in exposure, when CME trades 2.35 million futures and over 600,000 options on futures in this product in a given day (2Q average daily volumes), this combined with Treasury futures volume creates the $3 trillion in notional value that represents the exchange's importance to the world's banking and derivatives markets.
"
1464,CBOE,"And when the yield curve starts to move, these trading volumes ramp up as volatility and uncertainty increase. For comparison, 2Q2012 average daily volumes were 1.7 million Eurodollar contracts and 1.2 million 10-year note contracts traded (vs. 1.6 million this year in 2Q).
"
1465,CBOE,"Turnaround in Progress
"
1466,CBOE,"What has this volume surge done for CME's earnings outlook? Take a look at the Zacks custom Price & Consensus chart below which plots annual estimate changes against price.
"
1467,CBOE,"Clearly, many investors were scooping up CME shares this year before the estimates turned enough to make it a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) on July 20. But the Zacks Rank was effective in keeping you out of the stock as it wallowed between $50 and $60 for nearly a year.
"
1468,CBOE,"In mid-2012, CME became a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) as earnings estimates began a downward trajectory. It remained a #5 or #4 Rank (Sell) throughout the rest of the year and into February 2013.
"
1469,CBOE,"Then in March, it stabilized at a #3 Rank (Hold) around $62. And on July 2, it became a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) for the first time in over 20 months.
"
1470,CBOE,"CME reported second-quarter results last week on August 1 and we are still waiting to see if analysts are going to adjust their earnings estimates up or down after the company beat expectations but guided Q3 lower. This will be the key data that determines whether the stock remains a #1 Rank.
"
1471,CBOE,"From Bellies to BTUs
"
1472,CBOE,"I've followed the business of CME for nearly two decades, ever since I first walked onto its trading floors in 1994. I've watched it transform from an open-outcry auction venue for price discovery in the raucous pits to a Pentagon-caliber electronic fortress for global risk management handling billions of dollars worth of hedging and speculation every second amidst all asset classes.
"
1473,CBOE,"CME Group, the new name for the company after the CBOT acquisition, has a rich history of commodities trading, dating back to the invention of forward grain contracts in the 1840s in Chicago. When I was on the trading floor, I had the opportunity to work in the infamous Pork Belly pit.
"
1474,CBOE,"The century of success with agricultural products and the flawless fiduciary responsibility of the Clearing House led to innovations with financial products like currency futures and stock indexes such as the popular E-mini S&P contract. And the acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange gave CME Group ownership of the energy arena.
"
1475,CBOE,"A Financial-Infrastructure Powerhouse
"
1476,CBOE,"What I realized years ago is that CME, ""where the world comes to manage risk"" in all these asset classes, is as much a technology company as a financial one. All exchanges, including CBOE or NYX, have to be masters of technology, just like Amazon, UPS, or Visa.
"
1477,CBOE,"CME also has the potential to benefit more from OTC interest rate and commodity swap transactions being moved to an exchange clearing house model. With over $600 trillion in OTC derivatives out there, there is big opportunity for CME right in their own ""wheel house.""
"
1478,CBOE,"Combine their technology mastery with Clearing House integrity, product innovation, and international growth opportunities and you have a stable and vital franchise -- a utility of finance, you could say -- that can grow transaction volume even without volatility.
"
1479,CBOE,"It just so happens that right now, CME could be riding the wave of higher trade volumes from higher yield curve shifts for many quarters to come.

"
1481,CBOE,"We’ve spoken a fair amount recently about implied volatilities in options, mostly with the intention of designing trades that allow us to purchase options that are relatively cheap and sell those that are relatively expensive, tipping the odds in our favor.The CBOE VIX index – a measure of the implied volatility of a basket of 30 day options on the S&P 500 – hovered around 10% for the past few years, but has climbed into the mid-teens this year due to big moves in the level of the index. To explain how actually movement in the stock translates (or in some cases doesn’t seem to translate) to changes in the implied volatility in options prices, we’re going to expand upon our discussion of Option Greeks. (Read the original article here)There are hundreds or thousands of options each listed on thousands of stocks, and the normal forces of supply and demand can’t provide the liquidity necessary for orderly markets, so most bids and offers for options in the marketplace are provided by professional market makers.  These market makers are willing to provide two-sided quotes in many options at once in the hopes of earning the bid-ask spread on their transactions.There are many market-making strategies in use at any given time, but in general, the goal of market-makers is to be “delta-neutral” - or have little to no exposure to movements in the underlying stock. Recall that “delta” is an option price’s sensitivity to movement in the underlying. Because they were simply seeking to earn part of the spread and don’t have an inherent bullish or bearish opinion about the stock (and in some cases may even be at an informational disadvantage to their counter-parties in this regard), they would prefer to be agnostic about which direction the stock moves.HedgingAfter making an options trade, a market maker will typically make a trade in the underlying stock in the opposite direction to mitigate risk.  Known as a “hedge”, this involves buying or selling an equivalent number of shares to offset the total delta of the option trade.Example:If a trader buys 10 calls with a strike price of 100 on a stock that’s trading $100, since at-the-money options have a delta of .50, the trader now has a position delta of 500 – that is, in terms of price, this position will behave as if he is long 500 shares of stock. If he were to then sell 500 shares of stock, the position would be delta-neutral.  For small movements in the stock, all value that the options gained, the stock position would lose and vice-versa.Notice that this is true only for small movements. Why? because of the second Greek value we discussed – Gamma.  Gamma is the sensitivity of an option’s delta to movements in the underlying.Adjusting the HedgeLet’s assume our option from the above example has gamma of .01, which would mean that for every dollar the underlying moves, the option gains or loses 0.01 delta.  So if this stock were to decline to $90, the 100 strike call would have a delta of only 40.  Since the trader is still short 500 shares of stock, but is now long only 400 deltas worth of options (10 calls * 0.40 delta) if he intends to be delta neutral, he will need to buy 100 shares of stock to balance to position.  Because the original hedge was initiated at a stock price of $100 and the hedge adjustment involves buying back stock at the current market price of $90, this is a profitable trade.If, later in the day,  the stock were to rally all the way back to $100, the trader would once again need to adjust the hedge since the long calls would again be 50 delta and he would need to sell 100 shares to be once-again delta neutral.Even though the stock is now in exactly the same place as it started the day, the trader has booked $1000 in profits because he was able to re-hedge the trade at advantageous prices.The same would be true if the stock rallied to $110 and then turned around and went back to $100, allowing the trader to sell 100 more shares higher and buy them back lower.  Movement in the stock is advantageous to an position that is long options – if they are hedged – regardless of the direction of the movement.The opposite would be true for a trader with the opposite position (short 10 calls and long 500 shares) who undertook the opposite hedge trades – a loss of $1000.While owning options gives a trader the opportunity to re-hedge at profitable prices, recall that the third Greek we discussed is Theta – an option's sensitivity to the passage of time.  When time passes, the trader’s long options will be worth less, regardless of whether he has made profitable hedge or re-hedge trades.  This effect will accelerate as the option has less time remaining to expiration until ultimately, the option has zero time value and is worth either the amount it is in the money – or worthless.Implied vs Actual VolatilityHow does the market arrive at implied volatilities used to price options? There is a supply and demand effect at work, as market makers sell options, they raise implied volatilities (and option prices) to try to either buy them back and be flat again or to sell more only at a higher price.  The opposite occurs when market-makers buy options.Movement in the underlying determines whether owning options represents an opportunity for profitable hedge trades.  More movement means more opportunities for hedge trades and leads to higher option values. Whether the implied volatility matches the observed volatility depends on the time period used to make the observation.In the above example, if observed volatility were measured daily based on closing prices, the measurement would be zero, because the stock closed on the same price it had closed the day before.  But the intraday volatility was much higher, making profitable re-hedge trades possible.  This would likely keep implied volatility high because it is profitable for market makers to own options.Putting Higher Implied Volatilities to Use2018 YTD has been basically 4 months of this phenomenon.  The S&P 500 is basically unchanged on the year, yet there have been several big moves in the index and in many individual stocks.  Consequently, implied volatilities are higher than they have been in several years.This means a conservative option selling strategy like selling covered calls (selling out of the money calls against stock you already own) makes more sense than it has in a while.  With implied volatilities on the rise, savvy investors can enhance the return of their portfolios by selling calls against long stock at higher volatilities (and thus higher prices) than 2016 or 2017.  5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

1482,CBOE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has grossed record average daily volume (ADV) for Agriculture and Metals, which increased 13% year over year. Volumes in the second quarter were driven by better numbers in all the months of the quarter.The exchange operator witnessed record Oil ADV, increasing 2% year over year. While Euribor ADV improved 21% year over year, Gilt ADV was 29% higher. Oil ADV grew 2% year over year.However, total Futures and Options volume in March declined 11% to 6.3 million contracts. A 4.5% lower Commodities ADV and 16.9% lower Financials ADV were responsible for this downside. Revenues per contract were 13 cents for June, down 23.5% year over year.Recently, securities exchanges, namely CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report), CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report) and MarketAxess Holdings Ltd. (MKTX  -  Free Report) also posted respective monthly volumes. CBOE Global Markets’ June ADV of 7.3 million contracts increased 1.6% year over year while CME Group’s ADV of 18.4 million contracts per day rose 12% year over year. MarketAxess has reported a trading volume of $147.8 billion for June 2018.Intercontinental Exchange is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Aug 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at 88 cents on revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting 17.3% and 4.2% year-over-year growth, respectively.Our proven model conclusively shows that the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise. This is because the stock carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +1.52%.Shares of Intercontinental Exchange have underperformed the industry in a year. The stock has gained 4.3%, lagging the industry’s increase of 5.7%.

1483,CBOE,"Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) reported average daily volume (ADV) of nearly 7.3 million for June 2018. The company witnessed an improvement in its June ADV, which inched up 1.6% year over year.Total contracts for the month were 153.8 million, slipping 3% year over year. Of this, options contracts declined 2.3% year over year to 148.2 million while futures contracts fell 17.8% to 5.7 million from the year-ago tally. While Options ADV was 7.1 million, Futures’ was 0.3 million.Subsequently, ADV of the U.S. Equities Matched came in at 1.3 million shares last month, down 7.2% year over year whereas the European Equities Matched increased 9.5% year over year to €10.9 billion. The Global FX Matched improved 35.4% to nearly $37.8 billion.Though the June volumes were down compared with the year-ago level, the company witnessed a year-over-year ADV increasing year over year. Rise in trading volumes should consistently drive transaction fees (accounting for 70% of total operating revenues in 2017). As a result, the company has kept the revenue growth momentum up for the past several years.We believe, the company will retain this positive trend in the coming quarters, backed by a strong market position, global reach, prudent acquisitions and a robust portfolio of proprietary products.With respect to revenue per contract (RPC), the company estimates average RPC for Options for second-quarter 2018 to be in line with 24.2 cents reported for the two months ended May 31, 2018. For Futures, the company projects RPC between 3% and 4%, higher than $1.503 reported for the two months ended May 31, 2018. This estimate represents a shift in the mix of trading volume in June.Shares of Cboe Global Markets have lost 17.4% year to date against the industry’s increase of 4.8%. Nonetheless, we expect market volatility lending momentum to trading volumes, a diversified product portfolio as well as benefits derived from Bats Global acquisition to help the stock turn around in the near term.Cboe Global Markets carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recently, the securities exchanges namely, CME Group Inc. (CME  -  Free Report), Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

1490,CBOE,"In fact, there hasn’t been a single analyst estimate revision to the upside in the past two months (in our consensus), suggesting total agreement from those follow the company the closest. This is a pretty bearish signal, especially considering that current quarter figures are baking in a growth rate of just under 1.4%, and full year numbers are forecasting an earnings growth level of just 5.7%.
"
1491,CBOE,"These factors have pushed NASDAQ OMX Group to a dreaded Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), suggesting it is poised to greatly underperform its peers in the near term. And since this #5 Rank represents a recent downgrade—the company was #4 a week ago—it could suggest that the picture is rapidly deteriorating at NDAQ when compared to its peers in the space.Better Plays
"
1492,CBOE,"For investors seeking to stay in the securities exchanges industry, better ranked options are few and far between. The industry has a mediocre Industry Rank of 115 out of 261, so there are a host of Zacks Ranks 3s in the sector, although there is one Top Ranked stock in the group, CBOE Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report).
"
1493,CBOE,"CBOE has earned itself a top Rank thanks to its enviable position as a dominant player in the volatility and S&P 500 option spaces, two segments which are increasingly in demand for investors. This has helped the company to see double digit growth in the current quarter and current year periods, and has also led to analysts becoming increasingly optimistic on the firm in the near term.
"
1494,CBOE,"Due to this hard-to-attack position, CBOE could be better poised for growth in the near term, and thus a solid pick in the securities exchanges industry. So, if you are looking at an investment within this interesting sector, consider avoiding the lowly ranked NDAQ, and instead looking towards the well-positioned CBOE for better exposure to this corner of the financial space.

1496,CBOE,"The first quarter of the year was a real roller coaster ride in the U.S. equity markets.  A big run-up in January was followed by an even bigger slide in February.  After peaking at 2782 on January, the S&P 500 index plunged to 2581 on February 8th.  Unfortunately, the nauseating ride wasn’t over and we saw several more large daily moves throughout February and March that helped move the CBOE volatility index (VIX - the market’s “fear gauge”) to a peak of 37 – a multi-year high.Things have settled down considerably recently, with the S&P 500 basically unchanged on the year and the VIX back in the mid-teens – close to its historical average.Clearly a lot of money changes hands during the tumultuous first quarter of 2018, and big banks Q1 results show it.  Both Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) beat Zacks Consensus Sales Estimates, aided by improved trading and brokerage revenue.But what other companies might be the beneficiaries of the wild ride of the past few months?Let’s take a look at an exchange that facilitates the trades that occur during volatile periods.Chicago Trading PowerhouseSince its inception as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) has been a constant innovator in the creation and trading of futures and options products. After a merger with its crosstown rival the Chicago Board of Trade in 2007 and the acquisition of the New York mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the New York Commodities Exchange (COMEX) in 2008, the CME has emerged as the world’s leading marketplace for derivatives on agricultural commodities, equity indexes, interest rates, currencies, oil and precious metals.The CME makes approximately 86% of its revenues from transaction and clearing fees on trades - with the balance coming from access/communication fees and selling market data.During periods of market volatility, market participants of all stripes turn to the CME’s deep and liquid markets to hedge risk and/or speculate on future price movements.  Originally an open outcry exchange where traders and brokers transacted business in person on a trading floor, the CME now does upwards of 90% of its volume on its Globex electronic platform. “The Merc” as it’s known to Chicago locals consistently outpaces similar exchanges CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE  -  Free Report).The first Quarter of 2018 was no exception.  Growing Volumes Equal Growing RevenuesThanks to huge interest in Interest Rate and Equity futures and options, the CME has increased trading volumes in 2018 by 28% over the same period in 2017.  Because its cost structure is relatively fixed, a big portion of additional trading volumes goes straight to the bottom line.Here are the 2018 YTD volume figures from the CME website:                                                                                                   Zacks consensus Estimates for CME’s revenue from transaction and clearing fees in Q1 is $865M, an increase of 9% from the $792M they reported in Q1 of 2017.                                                                                             A quick look at the volume data shows that 1.35 Billion contracts have traded at the CME so far this year, almost 28% higher than the same period in 2017.  Analysts are taking notice with 4 upgrades in the past 30 days, bringing the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for 2018 to $6.86/share from $6.22/share 90 days ago and 44% higher than the $4.77/share reported in 2017.                                                                                                       Rising earnings estimates are a bullish indicator for a stock’s price and thanks to these upgrades, CME earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
"
1497,CBOE,"As we find ourselves at the end of April, the S&P 500 is essentially unchanged on the year, down just over 1%.  During a four month period in which we’ve seen several major market moves, the end result so far has been essentially no movement.Implied volatility, as measured by the CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) VIX index, is slightly above its multi-year average, but has been above 30 this year.What if you had the idea that, after earnings season and heading into the summer, the market was going to spend the next few months in the doldrums, going essentially sideways?  But that jittery expectations for volatility might remain high.  Is there an options trade you could do to earn extra income during the slow period?Absolutely. (Actually there are several, but let’s concentrate on one that features limited risk.)The Calendar SpreadA calendar spread involves buying one option (call or put) and selling one option (the same call or put) on the same underlying and on the same strike but with a different expiration date.  If we buy the longer dated option and sell the shorter dated option, we are said to be “long” the calendar spread. If we sell the longer dated option and buy the shorter dated option we are “short” the spread. As we saw in the article on options greeks (read it here), all else being equal, options with less time remaining until expiration decay faster than options with more time to expiration.  Options with more time remaining until expiration have more vega, - sensitivity to changes in implied volatilities - than near term options.This means if we are long a calendar spread, the option that we are short will lose its value faster than the option we are long.  This works in our favor if the market sits still.  It really doesn’t matter if the spread is composed of calls or puts, as long as it is at the money when we initiate it.If market implied volatilities increase, the farther term option we are long will increase in value faster than the option we are short.Example:If a stock is trading $80, the 80 call with 1 month remaining is trading $4 and the 80 call with 4 months remaining is trading $6, the value of the spread (the difference between the prices) is $2.  Let’s say we buy the 4 month call and sell the 2 month call for a debit of $2. We want to stock to trade sideways, not move at all, or at least come back to basically where we started before the first expiration, and we want the markets expectation for movement to increase.At the first expiration, three things can happen.1)      If the stock is at or near the strike of the near term option, it will lose all of it’s time value and the option we own will still have value and can be sold for a potential profit (assuming it’s worth at least $2.)  If it’s worth $4, we make $2.  The higher implied volatilities are at that point, the more our long option is worth and the more we make.2)      If the stock is much lower than our strike, the near term option will expire worthless and the option we are long will likely have lost much of its value and can either be sold to recoup some of the $2 premium we spent or held to expiration on the off-chance the stock rallies and it’s worth a lot by the second expiration.3)      If the stock is much higher than our strike at the first expiration, both options will be in the money.  The first option will be assigned and we will be short 100 shares of stock, but long an option to buy it back at the same price.  Just as in scenario 2, our maximum loss is the total we paid for the spread - $2. We even have some potential to make money in this situation, because we are short the stock at $80 and can buy it for $80 if we want, but are not obligated to.  So if the stock is below $80 at expiration, we can buy it at the market price instead and pocket the difference.  (Effectively, at this point we own a combination of assets that acts just like the 80 put. – More on this and the concept of put-call parity in a future piece.)This is an example of an options trade where our risk is entirely defined, that will be modestly profitable if our market prediction is correct, and even has basically unlimited upside potential in the rare cases where things work exactly right for us.

1499,CBOE,"In an improving retail environment, much attention tends to get paid to the obvious subcategories, like Automobiles, Department stores and specialties like Apparel.  Often overlooked is this industry sub-segment that produces products that everyone uses every single day – food.After a wild ride in February and March, the broad markets seem to be settling back into a period of lower volatility and the slow grinding rally is back on.In fact, history suggests that a spike in volatility, as measured by CBOE Global Markets (CBOE  -  Free Report) VIX index, followed by a rapid slide signals that the broad markets have put in a short-term bottom. The VIX, sometimes referred to as the market’s “fear gauge,” measures how much traders are willing to pay for out of the money options.  During periods of relative calm, market news tends to focus on the more exciting stocks with interesting stories, but longer-term investors would be well-served to seek out steady performers with growing earnings estimates.  Over the past 30 years, the Zacks Rank has proved that companies whose earnings estimates have been rising handily outperform the market.Let’s take a look at four food stocks in different sections of the industry that fit the bill.Selling the Brands Everyone KnowsConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report), manufactures and markets packaged food products, primarily for retail markets, but also restaurants and food service.  Their brands include household names like Orville Redenbacher, Healthy Choice, Peter Pan and dozens of others.  The company makes frequent acquisitions and divestitures to stay abreast of changing consumer preferences.With margins hurt by increased food and transportation costs last year, ConAgra is poised to regain a positive earnings trajectory.  The company recently raised it guidance for earnings in 2018 from $1.84-$1.89 to $2.03-$2.05.  Analysts followed with 7 upgrades in the last 30 days, earning ConAgra our highest score, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Retail and Wholesale FoodSuperValu (SVU  -  Free Report) sells food items both to its wholesale customers nationwide and through 217 of its own traditional retail grocery stores.  Also hurt recently by declining gross margins due to higher food and fuel costs, SuperValu plans to take care of earnings by expanding the higher margin wholesaling business.Analysts expect SuperValu to increase its sales by 37% and 32% in the next two quarters, respectively.  Growth estimates for 2018 average 20% vs 15% for the industry and 2018 earnings are expected to come in at $2.43/share, a 20% increase over $2.03 in 2017.  SpuerValu is a Zacks Rack #1 (Strong Buy).Because the stock has been beaten down over the last year, the forward P/E stands at just 6.2X, a true value opportunity.Banking on a Trend Toward Healthy ChoicesUnited National Foods Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) is the largest distributor of natural, organic and specialty foods in the U.S.  The popularity of these healthy alternatives in the retail market have helped United International beat the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate in each of the last four quarters by an average of 10%. Nine analysts have raised their 2018 earnings estimates in the past 90 days (versus zero downgrades), bringing the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $3.09/share from $2.82/share, making United National Foods a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Helping Consumers ake Smart ChoicesFinally, Medifast (MED  -  Free Report) is a leading producer of healthy food choices and other products specifically for the weight loss and “healthy living” market.  Recommended by over 20,000 doctors, it’s products are also sold through an independent network of coaches who combine nutritional advice with lifestyle changes to ensure customers’ success.Thanks to rapidly increasing sales and a whopping 25% earnings beat last quarter, the stock is on a real tear this year, up 47% YTD. Medifast is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1500,CBOE,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) has reported improved volumes for first-quarter 2018. While U.S. equity options volume expanded 23.1% year over year to 474 million contracts, European options and futures volumes were 22.3 million contracts in the quarter, up 2.8% year over year.However, revenues per contract for U.S. equity options declined by a penny to 15 cents, though the same for European options and futures increased 11.9% to 47 cents.Under its cash equities, Nasdaq’s U.S. matched equity volume in the first quarter totaled 88.6 billion shares, up 18.6% from the prior-year quarter. While the European equity volume rose 26.2% year over year to $260 billion. Again, the U.S. Fixed income volume augmented 2.3% year over year to $5.2 billion. Whereas the European fixed income volume was 8.3 million contracts, up 15.3% year over year.Nasdaq’s strategic initiatives have always accelerated growth. Improvement in non-transaction revenue base including market technology, listing and information revenues, has been driving revenues. Management’s medium-term outlook calls for mid-single digit growth over the next three to five years.Moreover, strategic acquisitions have been helping the company diversify as well as add capabilities to its portfolio. The organization is also intensifying its focus on Nasdaq Private Market Alternatives and the Nasdaq Ventures to ramp up growth over a longer term.In the first quarter, there were 3,579 listed companies on Nasdaq compared with 3,489 in the year-ago quarter. Total listings grew 4.1% over the year-earlier quarter to 3,955.Nasdaq’s shares have rallied 11% in a year, outperforming the industry's increase of 3.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.14, reflecting a 3.5% year-over-year climb on 8.2% higher revenues. The company is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 25 before the market opens.Our proven model cannot conclusively state that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because though the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its combination with an Earnings ESP of -5.43%, makes prediction difficult as a company needs positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Concurrently, Nasdaq reported improved March volumes, highlighting strong trading activities. The U.S. equity options volume increased nearly 14% year over year to 155 million contracts. However, the European options and futures volume was 8.4 million contracts, up 3.7% year over year.Recently, securities exchanges, namely MarketAxess Holdings Ltd. (MKTX  -  Free Report), CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) also posted respective monthly volumes.  While MarketAxess has reported a trading volume of $152.3 billion, CBOE Global Markets’ ADV of 8.5 million contracts contracted about 18% year over year and Intercontinental Exchange’s volumes decreased 11.3% to 5.9 million contracts.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.

1501,CBOE,"Despite a cloud of uncertainty looming over the global market environment due to rapidly changing climatic conditions — storming the industrial space with consecutive catastrophic disasters Hurricanes Harvey and Irma — and the palpable disagreement among the Fed officials over how quickly to raise interest rates, the performance of some pivotal players in the Securities and Exchanges industry has shown a ray of hope.Some major players of Securities and Exchanges industry have been successfully recording robust trading volumes and August was no exception.  We expect to see these key players generating solid trading volumes in the near term as well.Momentum to Continue?The key players in the Securities and Exchanges industry are largely dependent on their product and service portfolios to churn out revenues. The major services include trade execution, clearing, settlement services for securities and commodity contracts, listing services as well as trading and clearing systems services. There are other sources of revenues that might include data products, financial indexes, along with information and public company services.In a highly competitive industry, demand is fueled by investor-confidence, dependent on the overall growth of the industry itself. Interestingly, the individual exchanges’ profitability rests on maximization of transaction and clearing fees while keeping transaction-based expenses low. Such organic growth will help the individual exchanges drive their revenues, which in turn will continue to fuel increasing trading volumes. This makes us hopeful for the future, which has a high possibility to see major players in the industry generating substantially high trading volumes.This apart, the individual exchanges rely heavily on their diverse product offerings to drive their overall growth. With introduction of new products, which not only cater to the demands of the derivatives industry but also complement the core product lines, the key players are expected to strengthen their market position and global reach. To that end, the companies remain committed toward investing in new product extensions and offerings to boost overall growth, thereby creating an opportunity for trading volumes to thrive.The individual exchanges are focused on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service and product offerings to help them stay ahead and maintain the competitive streak amid the changing industry dynamics.Interestingly, some leading players in the industry have been making substantial efforts to expand product portfolio via prudent acquisitions, which in turn will aid them to retain their market share, expand product lines as well as widen global footprint. For instance, the acquisition of Bats Global Markets by CBOE Holdings on Feb 28, 2017, has enabled the latter to broaden and diversify its product portfolio.Also, on Jul 5, 2017, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE  -  Free Report) has purchased the remaining 20% stake in ICE Endex shares from N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie. The buyout adds capabilities to Intercontinental Exchange’s European gas and power portfolio.We wait to see if new product initiatives and global presence help these major players in the Securities and Exchanges industry to post high trading volumes in the future.The Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is currently ranked at #105 (which lies in the upper half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus industries). Notably, the industry has outperformed the broader market year to date, evident from a gain of 17.3% compared with the S&P 500’s increase of 11.2%.Stocks in FocusFollowing are some key stocks which have exhibited robust trading volumes in August, witnessed upward estimate revisions and their respective share prices have also the industry, quarter to date:CBOE Holdings, Inc.

1506,CBOE,"(0:45) - ETF Trends In The Industry(6:40) – Index Tracking the Market: Toroso ETF Industry Index(12:15) - Weighting For the Index: Who Is On Top?(18:10) - How Important Are ETFs to Index Providers Like MSCI?(21:30) – How Does the ETF Industry Fit in Your Portfolio?(22:40) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comAs you might guess from the fact that I host a podcast on ETFs, I am pretty bullish on the future of the Exchange-Traded Fund industry. This is especially true when you compare its growth prospects to the rest of the investing and finance world, as ETF asset growth and fund creation has been quite impressive, and looks to continue down that path in the near term too.But how can you invest in this growth?After all, many companies in the ETF world—such as Vanguard, the #2 asset manager—are not publicly traded. And others that dominate the space, such as Blackrock’s (BLK  -  Free Report) iShares or State Street’s (STT  -  Free Report) SPDRs, are not the entire business for their massive parents. So, what’s an investor to do?Well, if you are looking to invest in the world of ETFs, Mike Venuto, the CIO of Toroso Investments, has some insights. Mike is behind the Toroso ETF Industry Index, the benchmark behind the first fund to offer direct and focused exposure to the ETF industry, the ETF Industry Exposure & Financial Services ETF (TETF  -  Free Report).We discuss this benchmark, and investing in the ETF industry in general, in this week’s edition of the Dutram Report.Industry in FocusIn the podcast, Mike and I address talk of an ‘ETF bubble’ and why we have seen such incredible growth in ETFs over the past few years. We also talk about hurdles to future growth in the market, and the possibility of moving past mutual funds in terms of assets at some point down the line too.We also discuss some of the key players in the ETF world, and what to do with companies that have exposure to ETFs, but aren’t pure plays. I admit that I was a bit skeptical about this aspect, but Mike makes a case for why some of the giants are more tied to ETFs than you might think, and how you can access some of the private companies with service providers too.What’s in the Index?While it shouldn’t be a surprise that a company like WisdomTree (WETF  -  Free Report) is in the benchmark, considering it is the only pure play ETF sponsor that is a public company, there are others that might be more of a surprise to some investors out there. This includes SEI Investments and CBOE Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report) just to name a few.Mike also discusses the role that index providers play in the world of ETFs, and how important this business is to companies like MSCI Inc. (MSCI  -  Free Report) and S&P Global (SPGI) as well. Clearly, the ETF world is a bit more diverse than you (and I) initially thought, and it is also more than just a higher growth replacement for XLF. In fact, Mike notes that the benchmark has just a 20% overlap with the index underlying the SPDR financial sector ETF, meaning that this is definitely giving exposure to a unique subset of companies.So, if you’re an ETF ‘nerd’—like both Mike and I are—definitely check out this week’s podcast for more information on the industry and how to invest in its surging growth prospects too!Bottom LineBut what do you think about investing in the ETF industry?

1510,CBOE,"Although financials continue to lead the market higher, newer segments are taking the reins in Q2. In addition to smaller regional banking institutions, many investors are seeing solid performances out of firms in the exchange business, such as CBOE Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report).
"
1511,CBOE,"While probably less famous than fellow Chicago-based exchange CME Group (CME  -  Free Report), CBOE has been soaring higher for much of 2013 as demand for listed options on securities remains strong. This is especially true in two of the company’s key products; options and futures on the CBOE Volatility Index as well as the S&P 500 Index.
"
1512,CBOE,"Both of these benchmarks are widely followed by traders and investors alike, and the CBOE’s monopoly position on futures and options trading for these two indexes have been increasingly lucrative. In fact, trading in CBOE index options was up 28% from a year earlier in the recent quarterly release, and these index-based contracts now make up nearly 38% of total trades for the firm.  
"
1513,CBOE,"Given the firm’s nearly unassailable position in these key markets and the high investor demand for the index-based products, good days could continue to be ahead for the company. That is why many analysts have been raising their estimates for CBOE, helping to push the company to a top Zacks Rank of 1 or ‘Strong Buy’.Estimate Picture 
"
1514,CBOE,"The current quarter estimate picture has been rising, while investors have also seen analysts bump up their current year and next year forecasts for the company as well. Furthermore, there has actually been total agreement on this front, as all new estimates in the past two months have been up with not a single one going lower.
"
1515,CBOE,"Investors should also note that while expectations might be elevated, the company has beaten out estimates every time in the past four quarters, producing an average surprise of roughly 7.6%. This suggests that the company has no trouble matching high expectations, with big beats being the norm for CBOE.
"
1516,CBOE,"If that wasn’t enough for investors, it is also worth noting that many analysts are still baking in sizable growth for the firm going forward. Double digit earnings growth (year-over-year) is projected for the current year and next year periods, while the PE is below 20 and the PEG is below 2, meaning that the firm is still a decent value despite the abundant opportunities for growth present for the firm.
"
1517,CBOE," Other Factors
"
1518,CBOE,"This impressive earnings picture is enough to put the CBOE into elite company with a Zacks Rank of 1. However, it is also worth noting that the firm has good company even in its own industry, as the securities exchanges group is currently ranked 75 out of 261 meaning that the industry also has a pretty favorable estimate picture as well.
"
1519,CBOE,"CBOE is also doing a great job from a profitably standpoint as well. In particular, the net margin is over 30%, while the ROA and ROE are, respectively, 46% and 65%, implying a pretty high level of profitability for the firm.
"
1520,CBOE,"Lastly, it is important to once again highlight the monopoly like position the company has in the index option market. While many of its competitors have tried to break into this space, they have so far been unsuccessful meaning that the CBOE has tremendous pricing power for these key products.Bottom Line
"
1521,CBOE,"CBOE is clearly deserving of its top rank, as analysts are in total agreement about the rosy future of the company. After all, the company has a solid financial position and tremendous profitability, leaving it in a great spot going forward.
"
1522,CBOE,"So if you are looking for a great pick in the financial world, consider CBOE for exposure. It pretty much has a monopoly on two of its key products, and these instruments are only increasing in importance, suggesting that more revenues—and higher earnings—could be ahead for this often-overlooked company.

"
1524,CBOE,"CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) has been gaining traction with an annual dividend yield of 3.95% and a long-term growth rate of 12.5%, making this options and futures leader a promising pick for investors seeking both growth and income. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)  declared a special dividend of 75 cents on December 11, which led to a 52-week high. Dividend Driving Returns 
"
1525,CBOE,"CBOE has been paying regular dividends since 2008. In 2012, the annual dividend payout was raised to $1.29 per share from 20 cents in 2010, reflecting an increase at an annual compound growth rate of 154% since 2010. The strong cash flows generated by the company along with the absence of debt have resulted in a sturdy balance sheet and abundant free cash.  
"
1526,CBOE,"While the company recently paid a special dividend, it last hiked its dividend by 25% to 15 cents in July 2012. CBOE also deploys its excess capital through share buybacks from time to time.  Steady Third Quarter 
"
1527,CBOE,"On November 1, CBOE reported operating earnings per share of 43 cents in the third quarter of 2012, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.2% but fell short of year-ago earnings. Over the last 4 quarters, CBOE has generated an average earnings surprise of 6.6%.  
"
1528,CBOE,"Operating net income declined 15.7% year over year to $37.7 million. However, reported net income increased to $45.8 million or 52 cents per share from $41.3 million or 45 cents in the year-ago period. Results mirrored lower operating expenses and steady revenue per contract, partially offset by the impact of the ongoing market volatility.  
"
1529,CBOE,"Subsequently, total operating revenues declined 11% year over year to $128.3 million, while operating expenses declined 2% to $67.5 million. Nevertheless, management reaffirmed its guidance for 2012. The companys diverse product line, market share gains and disciplined financial management should allow it to continue delivering strong results, especially once the low industry-wide trading activity rebounds to its historical highs.  Earnings Estimates Moving Higher 
"
1530,CBOE,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 is currently pegged at $1.66, which is up 1.2% in the last 30 days as 9 of 14 estimates moved higher. This implies year-over-year growth of 5.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 is $1.87, representing a year-over-year increase of 12.7%. Compelling Valuation 
"
1531,CBOE,"Shares of CBOE currently trade at the 12-month forward earnings of 17.5x, a 12% premium to the peer group average of 15.6x. The premium valuation is justified given its strong fundamentals. ROE stands at 56.9%, compared with the peer group average of 16.2%.  
"
1532,CBOE,"The company has been continuously outperforming the NASDAQ since last year, and has also been outperforming its 200 days moving averages since the end of December. The stock has gained 27.0% over the past year, compared with NASDAQs return of 15.7%.  
"
1533,CBOE,"CBOE is the leading options exchange in the U.S., which offers equity, index and ETF options. It also provides proprietary products such as S&P 500 options, along with options and futures products on the CBOE Volatility Index. With a market capitalization of about $2.9 billion, the company competes with CME Group Inc. (CME) and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE), among others. Want More of Our Best Recommendations?

"
1535,CBOE,"Since the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009, the economic recovery has been far from robust.
"
1536,CBOE,"Not only has the unemployment rate stayed above 8% for 43 straight months, the labor force participation rate is at a 31-year low. And since the beginning of 2010, GDP growth has averaged just +2.1%:
"
1537,CBOE,"It's because of this sluggish growth that the Federal Reserve recently announced its third round of quantitative easing. But don't expect QE3 to suddenly spark 3%+ GDP growth. The first two (and a half) rounds certainly didn't.
"
1538,CBOE,"So how should an investor position his or her portfolio in an economy that continues to just limp along? There are a few places to be:
"
1539,CBOE,"Value-oriented Retailers: Sluggish economic growth means the unemployment rate likely won't come down by any meaningful amount for a painfully long time. This means stagnant wages and tight household budgets for the middle class. As a result, people will hunt for bargains at stores that provide the lowest prices. This is really a continuation of a trend since consumers traded down to value-oriented retailers en masse during the Great Recession and never seemed to leave.Companies with Wide Moats: Just like a moat would protect a castle from invasions, an economic moat protects a company from competitors who try to steal market share and shrink profits. Companies who can sustain their competitive advantages over time should provide their shareholders with above-average returns, even if the economy is just sputtering along.Dividend Stocks: The yields on bonds and cash are ridiculously low right now and will remain that way for the foreseeable future as the Fed maintains its historically accommodative monetary policy. This makes the yields on some dividend stocks look very attractive. Companies with solid balance sheets, strong cash flows and a history of dividend hikes are the ones to watch for.Emerging Markets: Growth opportunities may be muted in the developed economies, but a burgeoning middle class in some emerging markets presents tremendous opportunities. Many U.S.-based companies have seen this trend coming for years and have already established a significant presence overseas that will continue driving their profits forward at a healthy clip.Here are 4 companies to own in a slow-growth economy:Value-oriented Retailer:The TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report)
"
1540,CBOE,"The TJX Companies is an off-price retailer which operates the Marmaxx Group (T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods in the U.S.; TJX Canada (Winners, HomeSense, and Marshalls) and TJX Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense). Even though the U.S. has technically been out of a recession for more than 3 years, this discount retailer continues to deliver to positive solid same-store sales increases and double-digit earnings growth. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
1541,CBOE,"Wide Moat Business:CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report)
"
1542,CBOE,"The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report) is the oldest and one of the largest U.S.-based exchanges for options on equities, indexes and ETFs. The company consistently generates returns on invested capital (ROIC) north of 40%, and through the first six months of 2012 it earned 28 cents for every dollar in revenue it took in. That's the sign of a wide moat. It is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.
"
1543,CBOE,"Dividend Stock:Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI  -  Free Report)
"
1544,CBOE,"America is growing older, and the unfortunate fact is that more and more people are going to end up in nursing homes over the next decade. Omega Healthcare is a REIT with a portfolio of over 400 health care facilities, 370 of which are Skilled Nursing Facilities, otherwise known as nursing homes. Omega pays a dividend that yields a juicy 7.0%, nearly 4x what you'd get on a 10-year Treasury note. And since 2004, its dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of 11%. Look for more dividend hikes in the future. Omega is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.

1545,CBOE,"Emerging Markets Exposure:Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report)
"
1546,CBOE,"Yum!, which operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant chains, has been struggling with stagnant growth in the United States...but not in the emerging markets. The company's China division has been surging and now accounts for 47% of total revenues. This is expected to drive double-digit earnings growth for the company over the next several years. Yum! has also beat earnings estimates in 26 out of the last 28 quarters. It is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.
"
1547,CBOE,"The Bottom Line

1552,CBOE,"Yesterday I detailed some of the ways an investor could invest in the crypto currency Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology that supports it. Read the article here>>  I then attended a ceremony Monday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange in which Greg King of REX Shares and Brian Kelly, hedge fund manager and CNBC commentator rang the closing bell to commemorate the launch of their new Blockchain ETF. I’m going to follow up today with an explanation of that investment strategy.Many investors are interested in the concept and technology of Bitcoin, but don’t necessarily want to open a Bitcoin account (called a “wallet”) or trade Bitcoin futures because of uncertainty about price volatility. The price of the crypto currency in U.S. dollar terms has fluctuated significantly over the past year, going from $6,000 to almost $19,000 and recently settling back near $6,000. That’s probably an unacceptable level of volatility for most investment and retirement accounts.One sound way to gain exposure to the concept without direct exposure to the price of the currency itself is to invest in the companies that produce the goods and services that support the decentralized distributed ledger called the Blockchain that underlies Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.Initially developed to facilitate and document transactions in Bitcoin, the Blockchain has enormous promise to change the way information and transactional data are shared and stored. It has obvious applications in the business of financial transactions due to its speed and inherent security as well as its potential to remove the middlemen – and their added fees – from banking transactions and trading in securities like stocks, bonds and derivatives.The legal and medical industries and countless others could also benefit form the speed and security of distributed ledger technology.Proponents believe that the Blockchain will revolutionize our digital lives by reducing transaction times, improving security and reducing errors. True zealots believe it has the potential to be just as disruptive to the ways we transact business as the internet was in the early 1990’s and the rate at which it is being adopted does suggest that widespread acceptance could be just around the corner.Brian Kelly is a CNBC commentator, hedge fund manager and author of the book Blockchain Big Bang.  He is one of Wall Street’s foremost experts on crypto currency trading and the Blockchain. He recently partnered with REX Shares to create a BKC – The Blockchain equity ETF. (BKC  -  Free Report)The concept of the ETF is to offer investors an actively managed basket of stocks in companies that are involved in various aspects of the nascent Blockchain industry. The fund invests in four main categories – Wall Street Disruptors, Crypto Miners and Traders, Enterprise Blockchain Leaders and Decentralized Internet Builders.Just as is the case with index and sector ETFs, shares in BKC can be bought or sold just like any stock.Current holdings in BKC include companies that are invested exclusively in Blockchain, including dedicated crypto stocks in Asia like Global Unichip and GMO Internet, hardware manufacturers like Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and CBOE Global Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report) and the investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report). Kelly will manage the holdings actively, which makes the fund more agile than a passive ETF that holds only the exact components of an index.When asked about the role he sees BKC playing in an individual investor’s portfolio, Kelly responded that investors should treat this as one of their more speculative investments and suggested an allocation of 5% or less of a diversified portfolio, with above average risk, but potentially huge return potential. He also sees this fund as a long-term investment-  rather than a trading vehicle - as success is expected to be achieved over years or even decades as Blockchain gets adopted in a wide range of industries and sectors.For investors who are intrigued by the concepts of crypto currency and Blockchain technology, but who aren’t interested in holding actual Bitcoin or other currencies, the Blockchain ETF is a way to gain exposure in the space with more typical equity investments.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Cboe Global Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates, Issues ViewCboe Global Markets’ fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents by 1.14%.

1558,CBOE,"Since the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009, the economic recovery has been far from robust.

"
1573,CBOE,"Since there is so much focus on the VIX as the ""fear gauge"" and because it is used as a fairly reliable sentiment indicator by traders, it helps to truly understand how it is calculated and what its fluctuations represent. 
"
1574,CBOE,"First off, we need to know that volatility is simply good old standard deviation. And ""vol"" numbers like the VIX are expressed as annualized standard deviation. The chart below explains what the VIX at 40 means.
"
1575,CBOE,"You might wonder how useful it is to talk about ""where the market will be one year from now, 68% of the time."" I'll address that in a moment and show you a better way to think about the VIX. Before that, let's see how the VIX is constructed.
"
1576,CBOE,"While there can be volatility measures of the historical price movement of a stock or an index, the VIX is built from the ""implied"" vol of options prices on the S&P 500 index.
"
1577,CBOE,"Implied volatility tells you what the market ""thinks"" is going to be the actual volatility of the underlying instrument as seen through the prices being paid for its puts and calls. In this way, option prices ""imply"" the expected volatility.
"
1578,CBOE,"At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, owned by CBOE Holdings (CBOE  -  Free Report), the SPX is a real-time measure of the S&P 500 stock index. SPX options are traded off of that real-time calculation, though there is no actual trading of the index itself there.
"
1579,CBOE,"Big Money, Big Risk
"
1580,CBOE,"Though related, the SPX and VIX should not be confused with the CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) S&P 500 futures contract, which also has its own options. The SPX is considered the cash or ""spot"" index and the futures have a forward delivery date on the March quarterly cycle.
"
1581,CBOE,"Both are vital instruments for the hedging of risk by institutional portfolio managers. Without them, the stock market would not have the liquidity and depth it does.
"
1582,CBOE,"And this brings up the point about why the implied volatility of SPX options as expressed through the VIX is so important. Because large portfolio managers who don't want to sell their stocks need to use SPX puts and calls to hedge. This means that SPX options are very liquid. You also have a fair amount of hedge funds using SPX options to speculate on index moves.
"
1583,CBOE,"The VIX Recipe
"
1584,CBOE,"The actual calculation of the VIX can be a little complicated. It involves the real-time weighting and blending of dozens of out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put implied volatilities. Imagine the SPX at 1,200 and think of all the upside OTM calls from the 1,210 strike on up and all of the downside OTM puts from the 1,190 strike on down.
"
1585,CBOE,"All of these option strike prices imply their own volatility and are part of the VIX calculation that strives to get a realistic, real-time picture of what investors are paying for protection.
"
1586,CBOE,"The VIX is also based on options from the first two contract expirations being traded at any given time. These are further blended to get an accurate 30-day rolling ""window"" on SPX implied volatility. If you are interested in the full break down on the VIX calculation, go to the CBOE website and find their excellent white paper explaining all this in detail.
"
1587,CBOE,"VIX Magic Tricks
"
1588,CBOE,"As I asked in the accompanying video presentation, ""What good does it do us to say that the VIX at 40 means we could be 40% higher or lower one year from now in 68% of cases?""
"
1589,CBOE,"Well, the really cool thing about implied vol is that you can transform it from an annualized calculation to a daily one. This is because of the mechanics of standard deviation whereby volatility is proportional to the square root of time.
"
1590,CBOE,"Below is an example where I take the approximate number of trading days in a year and find the square root. 16 is a simple number to use since there are roughly just over 250 trading days in a year and the square root of 256 is 16.
"
1591,CBOE,"So the VIX at 40 actually implies the S&P 500 making about 2.5% moves per day in the short-run. The VIX at 50 implies 3% moves. The VIX at 20 suggest only 1.25% fluctuations up or down.
"
1592,CBOE,"When the VIX was at 80 during the credit crisis after the fall of Lehman, that implied 5% market swings. And sure enough, that's exactly what we were getting.
"
1593,CBOE,"Paying attention to the VIX can also help alert you to opportunities for selling naked puts on your favorites stocks. When the VIX spikes, it usually means lots of good stocks are ""on sale.""
"
1594,CBOE,"If you find stocks on your buy list are near levels you wouldn't mind taking some risk, you can sell puts below the market and earn extra income off of others' fear. See the video Naked Puts: How to Profit From Your Favorite Stocks for more on how I do this. 
"
1595,CBOE,"From Fear Gauge to Risk Barometer
"
1596,CBOE,"The take away here, other than this cool math magic I've showed you, is in understanding that the VIX is the price of risk, both for institutional investors and for the option market makers who must provide those prices.
"
1597,CBOE,"So when other investors and traders talk about the VIX, now you have something cool to teach them. ""Doesn't the VIX at 40 mean fear is rampant and the market is headed lower?"" they may ask you.
"
1598,CBOE,"And you will simply respond, ""Nope. It's just the current price of risk when the market is making 2 to 3% swings every day. Any questions?""
"
1599,CBOE,"But you can throw this in as well to soothe them: ""As the VIX falls toward 30 again -- and especially if it goes through there -- we have probably seen the lows in this market and the bull trend will resume as recession and European contagion fears vanish.""
"
1600,CBOE,"This doesn't mean a test of the lows near S&P 1,075 isn't in order -- and a corresponding VIX spike to the high 40's won't happen again.
"
1601,CBOE,"It just means that as an investor you will be ready to buy that fear and as a trader you can profit selling risk insurance to the masses as they scramble for puts on your favorite stocks.

1603,CBOE,"CME Group Inc.  (CME  -  Free Report) has reported record volumes for the first quarter of 2018, marking the highest average daily volume in a quarter despite market volatility.  ADV of record worth 22.2 million contracts per day improved 29% year over year. Of this, Options volume expanded 31% year over year to average 4.9 million contracts while electronic options surged 45% year over year and averaged at 3.1 million contracts. The company witnessed an increase in ADV in five of six product lines. However, shares of the company lost 0.05% in the last trading session.Metals volume of 0.7 million contracts per day rose 39% whereas Energy volume of 2.8 million contracts climbed 10%. Interest rate volume of 11.9 million contracts jumped 30% and Foreign exchange volume ascended 23% to about 1.1 million. Agricultural volume of about 1.6 million contracts climbed 26% year over year. Only Equity index volume of 4.1 million soared 48%.High volumes in the first quarter were driven by better numbers in each month. ADV for March grew 23% to 20.8 million contracts per day, led by an increase in ADV across five of six product lines.Recently, securities exchanges, namely MarketAxess Holdings Ltd. (MKTX  -  Free Report), CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line is pegged at $1.61 on revenues of $965.6 million, reflecting 31.9% and 3.9% respective year-over-year growth.Our proven model shows that the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise with the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +1.56%.Shares of CME Group have outperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has gained 11.4%, the industry has registered 5.6% growth. CME Group’s improving volumes are cushioned by a solid operating leverage, helping it maintain an enormous market share. The company holds about 90% market share of the global futures trading and clearing services. Expansion of futures products in the emerging markets plus a rise in non-transaction related opportunities and OTC (over the counter) offerings should continue to contribute modestly to top-line growth in years ahead. Efforts to expand and cross-sell via strategic alliances, judicious acquisitions, product launches as well as widening global footprint should also drive growth.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1608,CBOE,"There is a long list of popular averages and ranges that investors like to use while looking at stocks, and that includes the 52-week low and 52-week high metrics. It’s great to find stocks right before they surge towards new highs, but it can be difficult for some to establish a new and consistent range.With that said, investors typically become interested in stocks as they breach 52-week highs because that momentum can oftentimes continue until a new range is established. If a stock is strong in a variety of key categories, it certainly can keep climbing well above that old 52-week high, and we can find those strong stocks using our Zacks methods.Here at Zacks, we place an emphasis on earnings-related data, especially earnings estimate revision activity, and this can definitely be applied to stocks approaching their 52-week highs. One way to ensure continued upward momentum is solid earnings momentum, so we can use the proven Zacks Rank system to identify companies that are impressing in this regard.Using this strategy, we have found five stocks that are seeing positive estimate revision activity and are hovering near their 52-week highs. Check them out now:1.       Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $77.90 / 52-Week High: $77.91After surpassing earnings estimates by five cents in its most recent quarter, Target witnessed several positive estimate revisions for its upcoming quarters. In fact, our consensus estimate for its upcoming fiscal year has gained more than $1.00 over the past 60 days. Meanwhile, shares have climbed roughly 25% in just 12 weeks. The stock is taking off like a rocket on the back of an improved outlook, and investors will not want to miss the gains that could come if Target can post another strong quarter. 2.       Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $62.22 / 52-Week High: $62.79Food distribution giant Sysco is experiencing strong momentum in the wake of its tenth-consecutive quarter or matching or surpassing earnings estimates. Shares of the company have soared about 14% over the past 12 weeks, lifting the stock toward the 52-week high it is hovering at today. But earnings estimates are improving for the current quarter and next quarter, so shares should keep climbing as Sysco’s outlook improves. Our consensus estimates are calling for the company’s bottom line to improve by 12% and 22%, respectively, over the next two quarters. 3.       CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $132.91 / 52-Week High: $133.31Earnings estimates are moving higher for both the current and next fiscal year for CBOE, an options exchange based in Chicago. This revision activity has been a driving force for the stock, which has now gained more than 20% over the last 12 weeks. Still, impressive top and bottom line growth in the current quarter should inspire even stronger momentum, and a rising rate environment over the next few years should help that momentum continue into the long term. 4.       Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $112.90 / 52-Week High: $115.89Much has been made about the death of brick-and-mortar retail, but times have perhaps never been better for discount retailers like Dollar Tree. The company is riding high after two solid earnings beats, and the stock has moved more than 23% over the past 12 weeks. Meanwhile, our consensus estimate for Dollar Tree’s upcoming fiscal year earnings has gained a whopping 60 cents within the past 60 days. The company’s bottom line outlook is improving significantly, and investors will hope that this improvement inspires continued momentum. 5.       FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $272.25 / 52-Week High: $273.16Shipping behemoth FedEx is bouncing back strongly after a concerning down period. The company beat our consensus earnings estimate by more than 10% in the most recent quarter, and shares have soared more than 20% within the past 12 weeks. That surge has lifted FedEx to these 52-week high levels, but the stock should break higher soon on the back of its improved earnings outlook. Our consensus estimates are soaring thanks to a tidal wave of positive revisions, so investors should be able to capitalize soon. Bottom LineAll of these stocks are quickly approaching their 52-week highs, and that means they should be on your radar. Each stock is also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) based on its strong earnings-related data, including recent positive estimate revisions. While there are no guarantees on the stock market, these five companies definitely appear to be well-equipped to establish new ranges soon.Want more analysis from this author?

1609,CBOE,"In basketball, when a player hits a few shots in a row, he is said to have a “hot hand.” In finance, we call it “momentum”.Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift.At the core, momentum investing works on the principle of “Buy High, Sell Higher.”Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for the momentum strategy to work. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will spring back to their original prices. On the other hand, many investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things gain clarity, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Also, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s. This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) becomes known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.Obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play. Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets. We have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains.Our screen will help you take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which will reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past one year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the 50 stocks, we choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter what the market conditions are, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score cuts short the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5:The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume shows that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through this screen:Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report), which manufactures and sells differentiated organic and inorganic chemical products worldwide, has rallied nearly 70% in the past year.

1612,CBOE,"Despite huge volatility, bitcoin is the hottest trade this year. After wild swings last week, the digital currency hit another record high of above $11,800, representing more than 30% surge from a low of $9,021.85 hit on Nov 30.The cryptocurrency topped the five-figure mark of 10,000 on Nov 28 and climbed another $1,000 in 24 hours. Then it dropped more than $1,000 in just a few hours.Bitcoin Futures Coming UpThe latest surge came as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the listing of bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME  -  Free Report) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE  -  Free Report). CME will begin initial listings of bitcoin futures contracts on Dec 18, while CBOE will be the first to begin bitcoin futures trading on Dec 10.The introduction of bitcoin derivatives will bring a great deal of liquidity and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It would give investors a way to buy and trade in the digital currency market, which is otherwise not readily available. The derivatives would upgrade the bitcoin status to a more-established asset class. A better and mature regulatory environment will be a huge boon to the digital currency, leading to increased investment in the booming cryptocurrency, with a growing number of retail investors.Further, Nasdaq plans to launch bitcoin futures as early as in the second quarter of 2018. In the race to bitcoin trading, the Tokyo Financial Exchange is also preparing to launch its own bitcoin derivatives futures product. All these will pave the way for further rally.Venezuela Cryptocurrency On the wayThe digital currency also got a boost from Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro’s announcement of starting the country’s own cryptocurrency called the “petro” to shore up its economy. The currency was backed by commodity reserves, including oil, gold, gas and diamonds.Bullish ViewsMany market watchers are optimistic about the future of the digital currency. Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predicts bitcoin to hit $40,000 at the end of 2018. According to him, investors are pouring into cryptocurrencies due to lack of trust in financial institutions following the 2008 crash. Standpoint Research’s Ronnie Moas projects the cryptocurrency to hit $14,000 in 2018.A combination of other factors such as soaring demand and rising institutional investor interest are pushing up the cryptocurrency.Bitcoin Turning Bigger and BetterWith the latest surge, the digital currency is just a few percentages away from $12,000 and has become the world’s sixth most valuable circulating currency in the world, within eight years of its launch. Total value of all bitcoins in circulation has reached $190 billion.  The astronomical surge of more than 1000% this year has made bitcoin more valuable than some of the largest companies, namely PespsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) and Mc Donald (MCD  -  Free Report), with a market cap of $166.1 billion, $161.6 billion and $137.8 billion, respectively. The cryptocurrency is even more valuable than the combined world’s most influential banks Goldman (GS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report). Goldman has a market cap of $94.4 billion while UBS has $66.2 billion.If these weren’t enough, the cryptocurrency surpassed the estimated worth of some of the world’s top billionaires like $90 billion for Gates and $83 billion for Warren Buffet. Further, bitcoin is worth more than seven times an ounce of gold, which is traditionally seen as a safe haven amid turmoil.Moreover, bitcoin has been firing all cylinders, as Google searches for bitcoin have surpassed searches for President Donald Trump as well as stocks in the last few weeks. Google searches are indicative of mainstream investor interest in bitcoin.Bitcoin ETFs NextThe bitcoin futures would pave the way for bitcoin ETFs, some of which were already rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing lack of regulation of the bitcoin spot market and unavailability of bitcoin futures contracts.Earlier this year, the SEC denied various requests for the first proposed bitcoin ETF — Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN). The bitcoin ETF, proposed by SolidX Management, was also rejected in March. VanEck filed for an ETF that invests in bitcoin derivatives in mid-August but withdrew its application. REX also filed for two ETFs, namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which will also invest in bitcoin-based derivatives.In late September, ProShares filed for two ETFs, ProShares Bitcoin ETF and ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. These funds also intend to purchase derivative contracts for exposure, rather than actual bitcoins.As such, with the launch of bitcoin futures this month, bitcoin ETFs is not far from entering the market. Many analysts believe that the SEC will approve ETFs that trade bitcoin futures contracts in the near future.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.
