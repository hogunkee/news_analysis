8,UDR,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report), Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) and UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Apr 25.Rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps, year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE. Moreover, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest mark since CBRE started following the metric in 1989. High consumption levels, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment amid recovering economy and job market are fueling demand.However, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan-Mar quarter. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Furthermore, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.AvalonBay Communities Inc.Residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Additionally, increasing consumer confidence driven by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises brighter prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT. Amid these, the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy.However, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is expected to have put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.  (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)In a March-issued operating update for the first quarter, AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3-2.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $558.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 6.9% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share is pegged at $2.18, indicating projected increase of 4.3% year over year.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though AvalonBay has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.28% makes surprise prediction difficult.Moreover, AvalonBay has a mixed surprise history, as evident from the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteDuke Realty CorporationIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. Admittedly, this asset class has been witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is spurring demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, helping the industrial real estate market to record growth.Nonetheless, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, which includes the significant disposition of sub-urban office assets and medical office buildings. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed. Furthermore, the company faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of the commercial real estate. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. (Read more: Duke Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $183.8 million, indicating a decline of 15.7% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is 30 cents, pointing to an estimated year-over-year decline of 6.3%.Although Duke Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -1.70% lowers chances of any positive surprise this season.The story about Duke Realty’s decent surprise history is better told by the chart below:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuotePublic StoragePublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. High brand value, strategic acquisitions, robust presence in key cities and healthy balance sheet serve as major growth drivers for the company. The company is likely to be able to achieve reasonable rate hike for its existing customers. In addition, acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to stoke growth.Amid these, the company remains well poised to record growth in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $668.9 million, depicting projected rise of 3.6%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at $2.46, indicating an expected rise of 5.1% year over year.Nevertheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, it operates in a highly fragmented market in the nation, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This, in turn, limits the company’s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.

Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line FFO per share. Results reflect growth in revenues from same-store and stabilized, non-mature communities.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion and met estimates in the other three, the average beat being nearly 0.6%.

QuoteShares of UDR have underperformed the industry in the last six months. While the company’s shares have lost 9%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 8%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: UDR has an Earnings ESP of -2.08%.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UDR’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to ConsiderUDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market. Additionally, it has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is also anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. Admittedly, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of fourth quarter, remaining stable year over year.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR’s performance as the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. Consequently, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter.Moreover, prior to fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 48 cents, over the past month. Nevertheless, this indicates a 4.4% increase year over year. For the fourth quarter, management projects FFO per share in the band of 47-49 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $251.4 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 3.5%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $988.1 million.

However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Moreover, total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $630.7 million, indicating 4.2% growth from the prior-year period. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $623.7 million.Per management, solid and steady rental demand across the company’s markets was supported by favorable demographics, low unemployment level and rising wages. However, 2018 is anticipated to witness high levels of new supply, leading to decreased pricing power as well as decelerating revenue growth.For full-year 2017, normalized FFO per share came in at $3.13, ahead of the prior-year tally of $3.09. This was backed by 1.9% year-over-year growth in total revenues to nearly $2.5 billion.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (includes 72,529 apartment units) were up 2.2% year over year to $590.4 million, while expenses climbed 2.5% year over year to $169.6 million. As a result, same-store NOI advanced 2.1% year over year to $420.7 million.The company experienced 2.0% growth in average rental rate to $2,709. Physical occupancy remained flat year over year at 96.0% for same-store portfolio.The company exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around $50.6 million, up from $46.6 million recorded at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Equity Residential did not purchase any consolidated apartment properties.

Also, expense is projected to flare up 3.5-4.5%.Dividend UpdateCurrently, Equity Residential expects to declare first quarter common share dividend of 54 cents per share. This reflects an annualized hike of 7.2% from the amount paid in 2017.Our ViewpointEquity Residential’s better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter is impressive. The company is anticipated to benefit from its efforts to reposition the portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in the six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. However, elevated supply in a number of its markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates and result in high concessions.

11,UDR,"UDR, Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) has been continuously enhancing the overall quality of its portfolio by acquiring, developing and redeveloping properties in core operating markets and divesting non-core assets. While the company’s extensive portfolio-repositioning activities will aid its prospects, increase in supply of residential units will likely result in lesser absorption.Nonetheless, in the third quarter, the company posted in-line results with respect to adjusted funds from operations (FFO). Moreover, year-over-year improvement in revenues wasprimarily due to revenue growth from same-store communities, and stabilized, non-mature communities.Notably, UDR has one of the most favorably positioned multi-family apartment portfolio in the United States. The company’s superior product mix and strategic sub-market locations helped achieve growth in combined new and renewal lease. With improving apartment market fundamentals, we anticipate further enhancement in UDR’s leasing business.Moreover, a well-positioned portfolio should help the company meet the rise in demand for apartment properties from “echo boomers” — children of the baby-boomer generation.This particular population’s propensity to rent is high. We anticipate that growth in this age group through 2025 and positive job environment in the years ahead will drive demand for UDR’s properties.   Further, the company remains focused to enhance cash flows and achieve a strong balance sheet. These efforts have supported UDR’s dividend growth and operational efficiency. In fact, in first-quarter 2017, the company hiked its dividend payoutby 5% and retained the same payout in the subsequent quarters. Such investor-friendly moves also boost shareholders’ confidence in the stock.Shares of UDR have outperformed the industry it belongs to, so far this year. The company’s shares have gained 7.9%, while the industry has recorded growth of 5.1%. However, UDR continues to deal with high supply in a number of its markets, including New York City, Los Angeles and Seattle. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply limits a landlord’s ability to demand more rents, results in lesser absorption and leads to increased concession activity.Further, the company has ambitiously accumulated a development pipeline aggregating $975.6 million, in a bid to revamp its portfolio. Although this favors long-term growth, it also increases the company’s operational risks by exposing it to escalating construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks. Further, new constructions tend to have a drag effect on margins.In addition, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for full-year 2017 has been revised downward by a cent to $1.86, in a month’s time. UDR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space include BRT Realty Trust (BRT  -  Free Report), Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS  -  Free Report) and Franklin Street Properties (FSP  -  Free Report).  All three carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

14,UDR,"We will now tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle and real estate investment trust (REIT) will buzz with activity on Monday itself.Among the factors that influenced the REIT space, a sluggish yet steady macroeconomic improvement is worth mentioning. This led to strong demand for a number of asset categories in third-quarter 2017. Though supply has been increasing, the pace has been modest in many of the asset categories.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Moreover, according to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.However, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases.Office REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, and will enable the company to enjoy steady rental revenues in the third quarter.However, a substantial development pipeline, currency fluctuations and stiff competition can affect Alexandria’s bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $210.9 million. This reflects a decline of 8.5% as compared with the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is $1.50.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Alexandria is 0.00%. Moreover, it has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP. (Read more: What to Expect from Alexandria's Q3 Earnings Report?)You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of its markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is anticipated to affect the company’s lease-up net operating income in the near term.Nevertheless, AvalonBay has a solid portfolio of high quality assets in premium locations as well as a healthy balance sheet. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth and rising wages augur well for rental demand.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $538.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 4.3% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $2.26.However, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -5.75%. This combination leaves our prediction inconclusive. (Read more: What's in the Offing for AvalonBay in Q3 Earnings?)On the other hand, residential REIT UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) boasts vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR Inc.’s performance as it has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end, while pricing power of the company is expected to remain limited in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of UDR Inc. is pegged at $250.1 million, denoting estimated growth of 2.8% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at 47 cents.At present, UDR Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat. (Read more: What's in the Offing for UDR Inc this Earnings Season?)Finally, diversified REIT Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company is involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. In July, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC business. This made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. Though such efforts to streamline business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be ignored.Subsequently, we anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $527.8 million. This reflects a decline of 16.7% from the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at 72 cents.At present, Vornado has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -16.7%. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.

15,UDR,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — reported third-quarter 2017 pro forma funds from operations (FFO) of 63 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure also indicates a 14.5% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 55 cents.Results display growth in property net operating income (NOI) supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. The company also benefited from reduced overhead costs. However, this positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.Total revenues of $254.6 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $249.2 million. In addition, the reported figure came in 2.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $248.9 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues increased 2.8% year over year to $148.2 million, while expenses edged down 1.1% year over year to $42.3 million. Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) climbed 4.5% to $105.9 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 20 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.0%. Rental rates on new leases were up 1.4% and on renewals were up 4.5% from the expiring lease rates.As of Sep 30, 2017, Aimco held cash and restricted cash on hand of $86 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities came in at around $1.8 billion, marking denoting an increase of about 12% from the beginning of the year.Further, at the end of the quarter, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $356 million and available capacity was $232 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $33 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenue per apartment home by 6% to $2,075. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home came in at 53%, 34% and 13% in third-quarter 2017 compared with 51%, 37% and 12%, respectively, recorded in the year-ago quarter.    GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2017, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance in the band of 60- 64 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 63 cents.For full-year 2017, the company narrowed its pro forma FFO per share guidance to $2.42-$2.46 from $2.40-$2.48 provided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2.44.The company’s full-year guidance is backed by same-store revenue growth assumptions of 3.10-3.50% and NOI increase of 4.00-4.50%.DividendOn Oct 25, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 36 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the third quarter. This marks a 9% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to stockholders of record as of Nov 17, 2017.Bottom LineAimco’s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions will likely drive long-term growth. In addition to this, the company has a solid portfolio diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to help it meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently.However, stiff competition from new supply in various markets is expected to dampen Aimco’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. Additionally, interest rate hike and dilutive effects of sale of assets remain concerns.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has lost 4.7% year to date, as against 4.5% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. We now look forward to the earnings releases of other residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report).

16,UDR,"UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes.Last quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line result with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflect growth in revenues from same-store and stabilized, non-mature communities.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and met estimates in the other three, the average beat being nearly 0.6%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteFor the third quarter, the company projects FFO per share in the range of 46-47 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 47 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for UDR prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderUDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.In fact, according to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained encouraging in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the earlier years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR’s performance as the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end, while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $250.1 million, denoting estimated growth of 2.8% year over year.Also, prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter under review remained unchanged at 47 cents over the past two months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for UDR is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 47 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UDR’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.19% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

17,UDR,"Residential real estate investment trust (“REIT”), Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) delivered a better-than-expected performance for second-quarter 2017. The company reported core funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of $2.97 for the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. Core FFO per share also improved 8.4% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.74.Results reflect solid growth in revenues. The company has also raised its outlook for full-year 2017.Total revenue of $339.1 million in the quarter exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $336.2 million and was up 5.4% year over year.Per the management, during the second quarter, the market environment was “more favorable than expected”, especially in Seattle and Northern California. This was partly due to the delay in the delivery of new apartments. However, “periodic disruption from large concessions” is expected to continue when a number of “competing apartment communities are simultaneously in lease-up within the same submarket”. Amid this, for the next few years, management anticipates rental growth in core coastal markets to “trend near long-term averages”.Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Essex Property Trust, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailDuring the quarter, Essex Property’s same-property gross revenues grew 3.9% from the prior-year quarter, while same- property net operating income (NOI) improved 4.7% year over year. Financial occupancies of 96.4% expanded 40 basis points (bps) year over year.Essex Property exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted, of $199.9 million, up from $170.3 million at the end of 2016. As of Jul 24, 2017, the company had $1.025 billion in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the second quarter, the company issued 311,873 shares of common stock through its equity distribution program at an average price of $260.30. This helped in the generation of net proceeds of $80.6 million.OutlookEssex Property raised its guidance for 2017. The company projects core FFO per share in the range of $11.70–$11.96 from $11.56–$11.96 guided earlier, denoting an increase of 7 cents at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $11.82.Further, the company revised estimates for same-property gross revenue growth to 3.2–4.0% from the prior range of 3.0–4.0%, indicating an uptick of 10 bps at the mid-point. Same-property NOI is now guided in the band of 3.3–4.6% from the previous range of 2.8–4.6%, marking a 30 bps expansion to the mid-point.For third-quarter 2017, the company projects core FFO per share in the $2.88–$2.98 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.97.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Essex Property in the reported quarter. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, it is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term.However, elevated apartment deliveries remain a concern. This results in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords. In fact, such situations are expected to periodically disrupt the company’s earnings.Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(UDR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes.Last quarter, the Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (“REIT”) delivered in-line result with respect to funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results were driven by growth in revenue from same-store properties and stabilized, non-mature communities.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and met estimates in the other three, with an average beat of around 0.6%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteFor the second quarter, the company projects FFO per share in the range of 45–47 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 47 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for UDR prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderUDR has a vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company’s superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and disciplined capital allocation are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market will likely drive demand for apartments.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR’s performance as the company has been dealing with elevated deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain elevated, while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter.Hence, prior to the second-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the past 30 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for UDR is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 47 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UDR’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report), slated to release second-quarter results on Jul 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #2.

22,UDR,"UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, after the market closes. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line FFO per share. Results reflected growth in revenues from same-store and stabilized non-mature communities.Over the trailing four quarters, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four occasions. The graph below depicts the same:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderUDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market. Additionally, it has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.Per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. — the national apartment market moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Amid these, we remain apprehensive about UDR’s performance in Q1. The company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. Consequently, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end while pricing power of UDR is expected to remain limited in the quarter.Further, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 47 cents over the past month. Nevertheless, this indicates a 4.4% increase year over year. For the first quarter, management projects FFO per share in the band of 46-48 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $253 million, indicating year-over-year improvement of 3.8%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that UDR will likely beat estimates this season.

26,UDR,"Despite being backed by many positives, there is no shortage of negatives for the REITs. In fact, any hike in rate has the capability to trigger volatility in REIT stock prices. But weakness in the underlying asset categories of the REITs can dull their results. So, prior to investing in REIT stocks, one needs to pay a close attention to all the weaknesses and judge the stocks prudently.Sector WeaknessResidential REITs have grabbed investors’ attention over the past few years. In fact, apartment demand has been high with favorable demographic growth in the millennial generation that has a high propensity to rent, rising household formation and elevated homeownership cost. But lately, things got worse for the residential REITs as increased supply in many of the markets raised an alarm.These REITs witnessed a significant sell-off over the past few days following a guidance cut for 2016 same store revenue by Equity Residential (EQR) on Jun 1, citing continued weakness in New York and the recent downturn in the San Francisco portfolio. Equity Residential has blamed new rental apartment supply for hurting its rent growth. (Read: Equity Residential Lowers Guidance Amid Market Weakness)Usually higher supply curtails the landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and leads to lesser absorption. Also, there is competition from the single-family housing market. These may keep the growth momentum of rent at check.Moreover, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long. The CBRE Group Inc. CBG study revealed that the first-quarter 2016 decline in the availability rate marked the 24th consecutive quarter of decreasing availability. So chances of any striking decline in availability rates are less. Also, a whole lot of new construction is expected over the next two years that can put a pause on growth next year.Further, retailers’ results in the last reported quarter were disappointing, with particularly, a number of traditional brick-and-mortar operators falling shy of estimates. Despite decent consumer spending trends and a number of retailers coming out with so-called omni- and multi-channel strategies, this outcome reflects the failure of retailers to come forward with an attractive alternative to online retailers. This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Apart from these, the recent job data were not assuring. This combined with excess supply in a number of markets amid modest demand is likely to limit growth in rents. On top of that, persistent office space efficiency trends may limit any potential recovery in its fundamentals in the near term.Rates Hike Outlook The low interest rate environment appears to be firmly in place for now, with benchmark treasury yields appearing to be going back to prior lows. The Fed did the expected in their today, leaving rates unchanged and lowering their outlook for long-term interest rates. Many in the market now see the Fed not budging in next month’s meeting either, with many seeing the December 2016 meeting as the next opportunity for the next rate hike.This near-term favorable backdrop notwithstanding, the long-term outlook for rates is for higher. The eventual rise in interest rates will no doubt be a burden for debt-dependent REITs. Moreover, the dividend payout itself might turn out less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Take for example the health care REITs that usually have significant exposure to long-term leased assets which carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps. With raised rates, the cost of borrowing will increase but their revenue flows will not get adjusted quickly for their fixed-rate nature, leading to an adverse impact on profitability.Also, volatility in rates can spell trouble for mortgage REITs, which offer real estate financing through the purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on their mortgage assets and their funding costs. Though these types of REITs have started adjusting their strategies and business models, they bear long-term risk as interest rates will eventually rise.REITs to AvoidSpecific REITs that we don't like include Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation (WMC  -  Free Report), Walter Investment Management Corp.

"
27,UDR,"The year 2016 has so far favored the U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) industry. In fact, despite the rate hike last December, the first one since 2006, the REIT industry managed to outpace the broader market in the first five months of the current year, thanks to positive fundamentals of the underlying asset categories and cheap capital inflow.For the year through May 31, the total returns of the FTSE/NAREIT All REITs Index were 6.5% against the 3.6% increase logged by the S&P 500 Index. This outperformance suggests that investors are getting increasingly comfortable with the rate issues and expect the hike to be modest.Further, the June hike seems to be off the table with the latest disappointing jobs data and productivity falling to a negative. The icing on the cake was the recent speech by Fed Chief Janet Yellen, who despite sounding upbeat about U.S. economic growthand cautioning investors against overreacting to lone data, failed to give any hint on the timing of the next rate hike. U.S. Treasury yields too have been declining in recent times.Amid all these upheavals in the economy, the decline in Treasury yields and an anticipated extension of the low rate period, the REIT industry remains a good choice, especially for income-seeking investors, for its steady and dependable cash flows. And because of their high dividend paying nature, REITs are treated as bonds. So REIT stock yields tend to become more attractive when Treasury yields fall.Also, demand-supply dynamics in the individual asset categories and their impact on occupancy levels and pricing power of the real estate landlords play a pivotal role in selecting REIT stocks.This is because, even in this favorable rate environment, residential REIT stocks have plummeted on concerns of abundant supply in the New York and San Francisco markets. Equity Residential, which blamed new rental apartment supply for hurting rent growth, cut the 2016 guidance for same store revenue on Jun 1.Following the announcement its shares tumbled. And other residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) and UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) followed suit.On the other hand, retail REITs could address the market slump even amid lackluster retail sales in the first quarter because of lower supply of new space.Dividends Still Standing TallDividends are by far the biggest enticement to invest in REIT stocks. As of Apr 29, the dividend yield of the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index was 4.28% while the dividend yield of the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index was 3.86%. Clearly, REITs continue to offer decent yields and outpaced the 2.18% dividend yield offered by the S&P 500 as of that date.Note that in addition to capital appreciation, yield-hungry investors continue to have a large appetite for REIT stocks as the U.S. law requires these to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. This unique feature made the REIT industry stand out and gain a solid footing over the past 15–20 years.Capital AccessREITs have also been proactive in the capital market in recent years, leveraging on a low rate environment to improve their financials. A total of $59.29 billion in public capital was raised by stock exchange-listed REITs in 2015. This indicates investors’ confidence in this sector and their willingness to pour money into it. Further, in 2016 through Apr 30, REITs have collected $23.4 billion in capital offerings.Moreover, reforms to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA) are expected to offer easy access to capital from foreign investors for publicly traded REITs and commercial real estate.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, REITs are broadly grouped in the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and are further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded (aka ""X"") level: REIT Equity Trust - Retail, REIT Equity Trust - Residential, REIT Equity Trust - Other and REIT Mortgage Trust. The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.We rank 265 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry.We put our industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)The Zacks Industry Rank is #77 for REIT Equity Trust - Other, #105 for REIT Equity Trust - Retail, #159 for REIT Equity Trust - Residential, #185 for REIT Mortgage Trust.Earnings TrendsFinally, with Q1 earnings season behind us, it is apparent that overall growth remained stressed. The broader Finance sector, of which the REITs are part, experienced a 7.0% decline in earnings from the same period last year on 2.7% higher revenues, with 59.1% beating EPS estimates and 53.4% coming ahead of top-line estimates. (Read: The Earnings Growth Challenge Continues)For more information about earnings for this sector and others, please read our 'Earnings Trends' report.However, in the real estate space, the trends have been different. In fact, total funds from operations (FFO) of listed U.S. Equity REITs succeeded in recording a 19.5% gain from the year-ago period and 8.3% from the prior quarter to $13.2 billion, per a May-released NAREIT T-Tracker report. This was backed by solid performance across many of the asset categories. Despite the lingering issues in the real estate market, this performance speaks volumes about the opportunities in the REIT industry.Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"
28,UDR,"As the meteoric rise in home prices has spiraled into a spectacular crash, more and more individuals are opting to rent rather than buy.
"
29,UDR,"People have understandably become hesitant to plunk down thousands of dollars into a highly leveraged, highly illiquid asset that might actually go down in price in the near-term. And individuals who actually do want to buy are finding that obtaining a mortgage is harder than it was just a few years ago.
"
30,UDR,"Homeownership Rates Falling
"
31,UDR,"These factors have led to a decline in homeownership rates over the last few years.
"
32,UDR,"Homeownership rates have been steadily declining since 2007 but are still above their 30-year average of 65.9% (the average from 1980 through 1999 is 64.7%). And with more than 25% of homes underwater and prices expected to decline even further in 2011, don't expect this trend to reverse anytime soon.
"
33,UDR,"Throw in the swarms of people whose credit has been shattered by foreclosures and short sales, and you have a lot of people looking for places to rent.
"
34,UDR,"Rental Vacancy Rates Falling
"
35,UDR,"As a result, rental vacancy rates have fallen sharply since late 2009.
"
36,UDR,"This increase in demand is leading to an increase in rental prices too. Many experts are forecasting vacancy rates to further decline as supply is unable to keep up with demand. This will lead to a significant rise in rents over the next several years.
"
37,UDR,"Apartment REITs
"
38,UDR,"One way to play this trend is to invest in apartment real estate investment trusts (REITs). One of the great benefits of REITs is that they typically pay a fat dividend. This is because REITs pay no federal income tax as long as they pass on at least 90% of their net income to shareholders through dividends.
"
39,UDR,"Here is a list of Apartment REITs benefiting from the housing crash:Associated Estates Realty Corp (AEC) owns and manages apartment communities in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions of the U.S. Its portfolio consists of 52 properties containing 13,662 units in 8 states.
"
40,UDR,"AEC has been diversifying away from the Midwest (where homeownership rates are higher and rents are lower) to higher growth, higher rent markets. The move is paying off. Physical occupancy was 94.7% at the end of 2010, up from 93.9% at the end of 2009. Furthermore, average net rent collected rose 2.1% to $866 per month.
"
41,UDR,"Shares trade at just 14.6x forward earnings, which is in-line with the industry average. AEC also pays a dividend that yields 4.4%.
"
42,UDR,"It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
43,UDR,"Post Properties, Inc. (PPS) develops and operates upscale apartment communities in the Southeastern and Southwestern U.S.
"
44,UDR,"Post delivered its sixth consecutive positive earnings surprise in February. Funds from Operations (FFO) rose 26% in the fourth quarter of 2010 as occupancy rates increased from 94.4% to 95.2%.
"
45,UDR,"Analysts expect FFO of $1.61 per share in 2011, a 33% increase over 2010. Post also pays a dividend that yields 2.2%.
"
46,UDR,"It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
47,UDR,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) develops and manages apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets throughout the U.S.
"
48,UDR,"Within its established communities, average rental rates rose 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Management expects this trend to continue in 2011. It gave FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.75 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is within this range at $4.63, representing 16% growth over 2010.
"
49,UDR,"AvalonBay pays a dividend that yields an attractive 3.0%. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
50,UDR,"UDR, Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) owns and manages middle-market apartment communities. As of December 31, 2010, it owned or had an ownership position in 59,614 apartment homes.
"
51,UDR,"Physical occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2010 was an impressive 95.6%, up 20 basis points from the same quarter in 2009. Management expects revenue to increase 3.5% to 4.5% in 2011 and a 95% occupancy rate. FFO per share is expected to be between $1.20 and $1.25. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is within guidance at $1.24. This equates to 13% growth over 2010 FFO per share.
"
52,UDR,"UDR yields 3.2%. It is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.
"
53,UDR,"MAA (MAA  -  Free Report) owns and operates apartment communities in the Sunbelt regions of the U.S.
"
54,UDR,"Physical occupancy was 95.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, up 0.6% from the same quarter in 2009. Effective rent per unit was up 0.3% to $723.40.
"
55,UDR,"MAA has a history of steadily raising its dividend. It currently yields an attractive 4.0%.
"
56,UDR,"Shares trade at 15.4x forward earnings. It is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.
"
57,UDR,"Conclusion
"
58,UDR,"The apartment REIT industry should experience a nice tailwind over the next several years as homeownership rates fall and apartment occupancy rates rise. These five stocks are a great way to ride this trend while enjoying solid dividend income along the way.

59,UDR,"Todd Bunton is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.
"
60,UDR,"The U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) industry that witnessed two strong back-to-back performances in first quarter 2010 and fourth quarter 2009 somewhat lost its momentum in its fiscal 2010 second quarter. The FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index reported total returns of negative 3.05% in the second quarter, vs. a 12.5% and a 10.6% loss for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrials, respectively.
"
61,UDR,"Although total returns as measured by the FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index remained well above the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrials, it declined drastically from 10.0% in the first quarter of 2010 and 9.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
"
62,UDR,"The lackluster performance of the FTSE NAREIT Equity Index is primarily attributable to broader stock-market concerns fueled by the European debt crisis, which prompted investors to cut back their holdings. With the falling euro and strengthening dollar prices, speculations were rife about possible increases in cost of borrowings around the world that could destabilize global currency markets.
"
63,UDR,"However, the quarterly REIT results have been quite good, reflecting the stabilization of market fundamentals, as well as low interest rates and government policies, including low mortgage rates, tax credits, increased FHA (Federal Housing Administration) lending and a government-sponsored slowdown in distressed liquidations.
"
64,UDR,"Earlier in 2009, REITs and REOCs (Real Estate Operating Companies) raised nearly $38 billion in an industry-wide push to recapitalize balance sheets, and over 90 secondary equity offerings were issued in addition to 37 unsecured debt offerings. However, once the economy showed positive signs of revival, REITs are leading on the way back up. With gradual stability in the overall industry, sector dynamics and individual companies’ strategies are currently receiving greater attention to capitalize on future growth potential.
"
65,UDR,"The standout performance in the industry during the second quarter was that of the apartment REITs (a total return of 7.3% as measured by the FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index). The underperforming sectors were industrial REITs (-14.2%), followed by shopping-center REITs (-8.5%), lodging/resorts (-8.2%), office sector (-6.5%), regional malls (-2.1%) and healthcare REITs (-1.5%).   OPPORTUNITIES
"
66,UDR,"Many REITs are still trading at discounts to NAV (net asset value), traditionally a good ""buy"" signal. Over the past 7 or so years, REITs had traded near or in excess of NAV.
"
67,UDR,"With dividend cuts and share price gains, the average yield for equity REITs during second quarter 2010 was 4.1%, compared to 3.0% for the 10-year Treasury, as most companies have been raising cash through asset sales and equity financing to pay down debt.
"
68,UDR,"The credit freeze will have a positive effect on commercial real estate down the road; new office, apartment and retail construction has slowed considerably, which will benefit owners in a couple of years. Many companies that we cover have stopped all-new construction.
"
69,UDR,"In this environment, we remain bullish on UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report), one of the best-positioned apartment REITs in the U.S., with the majority of its portfolio located in California, Florida and on the Atlantic Coast. These are areas where housing costs have soared in the past few years, and despite the drop in home values, the rent vs. own spread still remains high.
"
70,UDR,"The housing meltdown will continue to help apartment REITs and we expect this sector to remain comparatively stable in the coming quarters. In addition, UDR’s properties are geographically diversified that increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies, thereby increasing the stability and predictability of earnings. Furthermore, UDR has continuously upgraded the overall quality of its portfolio by selling smaller market, older properties and replacing them with newer assets in better long-term markets.
"
71,UDR,"We also like well-capitalized companies that have adequate liquidity and manageable near-term debt maturities. Currently, we are bullish on American Capital Agency Corp. (AGNC  -  Free Report), a mortgage REIT that invests exclusively in agency securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies like Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE). The company has a conservative balance sheet and maintains adequate liquidity sufficient to continue operations under potentially adverse circumstances. Furthermore, American Capital is one of only a few companies to have increased its dividend during the economic downturn.
"
72,UDR,"Another stock worth mentioning is Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), the largest publicly traded retail real estate company in North America, with assets in almost all retail distribution channels. The geographic and product diversity of the company insulates it from market volatility to a great extent and provides a steady source of income. Furthermore, Simon Property’s international presence gives it a more sustainable long-term growth story than its domestically focused peers.WEAKNESSES
"
73,UDR,"REITs still depend on access to capital to fund growth, and with the credit markets still not fully back to normal, it is difficult to raise money for new developments/acquisitions. In this scenario, most REITs are raising capital through property level debt, dividend reductions and equity offerings.
"
74,UDR,"Although both debt and equity financings provide the much-needed cash infusion, they could potentially burden an already leveraged balance sheet and dilute earnings. Property level debt is also harder to obtain and more expensive as commercial real estate prices remain under pressure.
"
75,UDR,"Fundamentals are declining in many suburban office markets as corporate expansion continues to slow. More and more corporations are putting off leasing decisions until the economy recovers. Recent employment trends are also not encouraging as the U.S. economy continues to shed jobs at a rapid pace.
"
76,UDR,"Year-to-date, the U.S. has lost over 8.4 million jobs since the start of recession in December 2007. The national unemployment rate has also remained relatively high at 9.7%. As the U.S. economy struggles with the economic downturn, REITs will have trouble holding tenants and leasing new space.
"
77,UDR,"Given the market uncertainties, we are bearish on ProLogis (PLD), an industrial REIT that leases industrial facilities to manufacturers, retailers, transportation companies, third-party logistics providers and other enterprises with large-scale distribution needs. The continued troubles in the residential sector are weighing on commercial property operations.
"
78,UDR,"The credit crunch has also widened the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers of commercial real estate, which has caused deal volumes to fall dramatically. In addition, market vacancy increases will mitigate ProLogis’ ability to push through rental rate increases. This has significantly affected the top-line growth of the company. 
"
79,UDR,"We would also avoid The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), a shopping-center REIT. Macerich has an active development pipeline, which increases operational risks in the current credit-constrained market, exposing it to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risk.
"
80,UDR,"In addition, the prolonged recession has led to increased tenant bankruptcies, which in turn have resulted in a decline in occupancy and an increase in vacancy rates. This has affected the top-line growth of the company and puts considerable pressure on maintaining its profitability through stringent cost-cutting measures.
"
81,UDR,"Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), commonly referred as MAA, reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) of $1.50 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48. The figure also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $1.13.This residential REIT’s quarterly results reflected growth in same-store property net operating income (NOI) and rise in average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.Rental and other property revenues came in at $382.7 million in the fourth quarter, higher than the prior-year quarter tally by 24.6%. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus estimate of $386.3 million.For full-year 2017, FFO per share came in at $5.94, up 6.3% from the prior-year tally of $5.59. This was backed by 35.9% year-over-year growth in rental and other property revenues to $1.5 billion.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, combined adjusted same-store NOI increased 2.2% compared with the prior-year quarter. This reflected 1.8% growth in revenues and 1.3% rise in operating expenses.In the large market, 1.6% growth in revenues and a 1.3% increase in expenses resulted in the company’s NOI to be up 1.7%. Again, in the secondary market, a 2.6% rise in revenues and 1.1% increase in expenses led to 3.6% growth in NOI.The quarter witnessed 1.7% year-over-year increase in average effective rent per unit. Further, during the quarter, average physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.2%, reflecting an expansion of 20 basis points from the year-earlier quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, MAA held cash and cash equivalents of nearly $10.8 million, down from $33.5 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Furthermore, as of the same date, around $598.3 million of combined cash and capacity was available under its unsecured revolving credit facility.The Post Properties MergerDuring fourth-quarter 2017, MAA incurred a total of 5 cents per share of merger and integration costs. For full-year 2017, the company incurred 17 cents per share of merger and integration costs. Notably, it expects full consolidation of MAA and Post Properties to be accomplished later this year. Additionally, MAA continues to project expected synergies of around $20.0 million in gross overhead costs to be realized from the merger.Portfolio ActivityDuring fourth-quarter 2017, MAA purchased a newly developed 320-unit apartment community — Acklen West End — in the Downtown/West End submarket of Nashville, TN, for $71.8 million. On the other hand, the company sold two properties in the Atlanta, GA, market for aggregate proceeds of $97.4 million.At the end of the fourth quarter, MAA had three multi-family projects under development (937 units), with total projected cost of $214.0 million. Notably, an estimated $46.3 million remained to be funded as of Dec 31, 2017.OutlookMAA projects 2018 FFO per share in the range of $5.85-$6.15. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2018 FFO per share is $6.15. For first-quarter 2018, the FFO per share is anticipated in the band of $1.38-$1.48. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter FFO per share is $1.50.Our ViewpointMAA remains well poised for long-term growth, backed by its well-balanced portfolio, which is diversified in terms of markets, submarkets and price points, and is located in the growing Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. Also, integration of the MAA and Post Properties is on track and is anticipated to significant scale and capabilities. Nevertheless, rising supply of new units in a number of markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the near term.MAA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the past month, shares of MAA have declined 5.2%, underperforming the 4.6% loss incurred by its industry.Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

"
82,UDR,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s (AVB  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.25 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The company’s core FFO per share also recorded 6.1% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.12.Total revenues of $555.3 million increased 7.1% year over year as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities recorded growth. The figure also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $555.2 million.Results highlight growth in average rental rates. Additionally, economic occupancy managed to increase slightly in the quarter. The company also announced a hike in quarterly dividend.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $8.62, up 5.3% from the prior-year tally of $8.19. This was backed by 5.5% year-over-year growth in total revenues to nearly $2.2 billion.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.1% year over year, while economic occupancy inched up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2016, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.2% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates and economic occupancy.However, operating expenses for established communities flared up 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities rose 2.0% year over year to around $282.7 million.Notably, in the fourth quarter, the company acquired 850 Boca (containing 370 apartment homes), in Boca Raton, FL, for $138.0 million. The purchase denoted the company's entry into the Southeast Florida metropolitan region.As of Dec 31, 2017, AvalonBay had 21 communities under construction (expected to contain in total 6,544 apartment homes and 97,000 square feet of retail space), which are anticipated to be accomplished for an estimated total capital cost of $2.9 billion. This includes the company’s share of communities being developed through joint ventures.Liquidity PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, AvalonBay had no borrowings outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. The company had around $201.9 million in unrestricted cash and cash in escrow as of that date. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for fourth-quarter 2017 was 5.0 times.OutlookFor first-quarter 2018, AvalonBay expects core FFO per share in the range of $2.14-$2.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.23.For full-year 2018, the company projects core FFO per share in the band of $8.73-$9.13. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $ 9.09.Dividend HikeAvalonBay announced a first-quarter dividend of $1.47 per share, denoting an increase of 3.5% from the prior quarterly dividend. The new dividend will be paid on Apr 16 to stockholders of record on Mar 29, 2018.In ConclusionAvalonBay’s better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter and the hike in dividend look encouraging. The company is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Rate hike remains another concern.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the past month, shares of AvalonBay have depreciated 4.5%, outperforming the 4.6% loss incurred by its industry.AvalonBay Communities, Inc.
