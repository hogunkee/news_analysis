37,GGP,"Powered by robust demand and lean supply, high-end mall owners and quality shopping center operators are primed to perform in 2015.They are riding the crest of a stronger economy and healthy consumer spending climate, and are now luring shoppers with enhanced services and experiences.The bright prospects come at a time when the stars are also aligned for the retail industry.""Retailers are heading into 2015 with the most momentum they've had since the Great Recession,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, told IBD.A healthy consumer spending climate at retail would bode well for big mall owners such as Simon Property Group (SPG), Macerich (MAC), General Growth Properties (GGP), and Taubman Centers (TCO) as well as community and neighborhood shopping center operator and owner Kimco Realty (KIM), all of which benefit when their tenants get more financially fit.Malls And The MarketRetail mall real estate investment trusts are part of IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, and several get high Composite Ratings. Out of a possible 99, Kimco Realty has a 98, Simon Property Group a 91 and General Growth Properties an 87, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.All three have run up in the stock market. Kimco Realty shares rose 27% in 2014 and are up 11% this year. General Growth Properties jumped 40% in 2014 and is up 9% in 2015. Simon Property Group lifted 27% in 2014 and is up 11% this year.Macro tailwinds should help malls this year.""There should be a lot of momentum with the (stronger) economy and (lower) energy prices,"" Ryan Severino, senior economist for commercial real estate tracker Reis (REIS), told IBD via email. ""The decline in energy should add billions in spending. Some of that will accrue to malls. The real question is how much and will that be enough to offset the impact of store closings?""The top firms should still be regional mall REITs that focus on ""A"" malls — those that sell the most per square foot and tend toward more upscale retailers and trade areas — real estate experts say.""Class A malls should continue to have low vacancy and strong rent growth (in 2015),"" said Severino. ""But for the remainder of the subsector, vacancy could actually rise, and rent growth will probably accelerate only slightly.""At year end, the national mall vacancy rate was 8%, up 10 basis points for in 2014. Rents grew by 1.8% during that year, says Severino. He forecasts that in 2015, rents should grow by roughly 2% to 2.5%.But the national vacancy rate is not likely to change much in 2015 as store closures will offset rising demand and the outlook for lower-caliber malls ""is murkier,"" he said. ""Although a strengthening recovery in the economy and labor market, coupled with a decline in energy prices, should bolster the subsector, this will compete against the store closings (in lower-caliber malls) of some important retailers such asJ.C. Penney (JCP) and Sears (SHLD).""Class A OverachieversStifel Nicolaus analyst Nathan Isbee is also upbeat about prospects for ""A"" malls. ""Retailer demand for high-quality mall space will remain robust in 2015 from international and domestic retailers,"" he wrote in a report, calling high-quality mall space is ""extremely limited.""General Growth Properties is his top regional mall pick for 2015. The REIT focuses exclusively on owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping Class A regional malls and urban flagship locations in the U.S., spokesman Kevin Berry told IBD.He says the firm believes that owning these retail properties positions it well for the long term.Generally, he adds, the properties' leases have ten-year terms with annual contractual increases in rent. ""On average, 10% of the leases expire,"" he said. ""The majority of the annual revenue (is) in place when the year begins.""General Growth Properties' strategy since Sandeep Mathrani became CEO in 2011 has been the creation of a redevelopment/expansion pipeline of projects, Berry says. As of Dec. 31, the firm had development and redevelopment activities totaling about $2.4 billion ""at share,"" of which projects totaling about $418 million have opened, $1.2 billion are under construction and $825 million are in the pipeline.Redevelopment is all tenant driven, says Berry. General's largest redevelopment project is at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, which it is expanding with a new luxury wing anchored by Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom (JWN). General also focuses on improving the shopping experience by adding options such as movie theaters and restaurants, which give shoppers more reasons to come to the malls and spend time.""Mall vacancies in the U.S. are currently at a five-year low of 5.7% and at 5.5% for just the major markets,"" said Greg Maloney, CEO of the Americas Retail Group at commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), citing real estate data company CoStar as the source.He says that malls are going into 2015 with probably the best fundamentals seen in the past five years.""Liquidity and appetite for product has been here for a few years, but now consumers are feeling much better about the economy, and that is the driving force,"" he adds. ""We now have positive momentum. Retailers are looking to expand with new stores, and there's a renewed interest in terms of retailers looking for new space.""He says that there's some new mall development for the first time in a long time, including three or four projects that JLL is doing.Isbee notes that shopping center REIT fundamentals are ""healthy as occupancies are approaching or exceeding pre-recession levels.""Kimco Realty is among REITs he rates a buy. It operates North America's largest publicly traded portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. CEO David Henry calls fundamentals for such shopping centers strong. ""We've been very fortunate that there's been no new building of shopping centers for six years,"" he told IBD.While the supply of centers hasn't grown, the U.S. population has grown at between 2.5 million and 3 million people a year. And the need for restaurants, grocers, dry cleaners and other businesses has grown with the population.""That's why occupancies are moving up and all the vital signs are looking good for shopping centers,"" he said, adding that shopping centers are still in ""recovery mode"" and rents not back to all-time highs. But he says Kimco is benefiting from more demand and limited supply.Henry says that occupancy at ""quality"" centers is at 95%, close to Kimco's all-time high of 96% before the recession.Redevelopment Vs. New MallsKimco has been doing a lot of redevelopment, he says, and the best place to invest capital is in its own properties — the value of projects in the pipeline is nearing $1 billion.Most of the new development among the mall REITs has been concentrated on outlet centers, with six opened in 2014, says Isbee.David Ober, president of Global Outlet Management, says that among the reasons behind building more outlet centers is retailers' desire to include outlet stores as a part of their ""omnichannel"" distribution mix along with full-price stores.Still, Garrick Brown, vice president of research at property services firm DTZ, says, ""We are nearing a saturation point"" in outlet center building and adds that there's room for only ""a little more product.""""Everyone wants to jump on this bandwagon to build these because they have performed so well in recent years,"" he said by email. ""But they will probably build too many.""

51,GGP,"Roadie — a startup that gets everyday folks to deliver packages while on their way to wherever they're already driving — has notched a lot of oddball same-day delivery jobs that Amazon (AMZN) doesn't do. A glass aquarium from Fountain Valley to Long Beach, Calif. A set of keys to someone locked out of her house in Georgia at 2 a.m. A box of trial evidence from San Francisco to Napa in time for a panicked lawyer's court date.Around 80%-85% of its shipments are same-day affairs, fueled partly by individuals with curious packages, but mostly by bigger businesses. And Roadie, which provides Kroger (KR) grocery delivery in select areas and brings lost luggage to Delta Air Lines (DAL) customers in about 40 markets, is not alone.Roadie rivals Instacart and Deliv have separately joined forces with Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Kroger, Macy's (M) and Best Buy (BBY) on same-day shipping. Target (TGT) even went so far as to acquire Shipt for $550 million. The bull's-eye is ""becoming the first retailer to offer same-day delivery nationwide,"" said Target CEO Brian Cornell last month at retail conference Shoptalk.The driving force behind this latest retail trend, as ever, is Amazon. Its Prime same-day delivery service follows a free-shipping perk that is now a de facto requirement for online shopping. But after scrambling to catch up to Amazon on free shipping, these old brick-and-mortar titans are rushing to stay ahead of the e-commerce giant on same-day delivery. And this next online battleground might actually tilt in their favor, some analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeedy delivery doesn't come cheap. Customers could pay anywhere from $5.99 to $9.99 per shipment for the pleasure. But demand continues to mount, which makes it ""absolutely essential"" for retailers in order to compete in this ""instant-gratification economy,"" said Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins, who thinks one-hour delivery might be the next goal. ""People want to see a package on their door when they return from work.""As President Trump continues tweeting his rage at Amazon on a near-daily basis over its use of the U.S. Postal Service, it's the Shipts and Instacarts and Delivs (not to mention the Postmates and DoorDashes in food delivery) that are harvesting this ripe market. And they may not even emerge as the biggest winners. Instead, logistics giants like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) have the scale and infrastructure to capture at least 80% of the future same-day delivery market, a 2017 McKinsey report noted.To a physical store, looking to a web-based firm to hurry along online orders might seem like hastening one's own demise.But the McKinsey report called same-day a ""$200 billion opportunity for retailers in Europe and North America over the next decade."" And it pinpointed brick-and-mortar stores as potentially recapturing turf from online pure plays.The firm said that only traditional retailers ""have the dense network of physical stores to support same-day order fulfillment and delivery.""Perhaps surprisingly, that dinosaur of retail — shopping malls! — is also poised to benefit from the interest in same-day delivery.Daphne Carmeli, CEO of delivery startup Deliv, had an aha! moment when she realized that this could offer shopping centers a ""line of sight ... into e-commerce revenue"" that they wouldn't otherwise have.If you live in Palo Alto, Calif., and place an order on Macys.com, for example, that purchase is likely to be shipped out from a nonlocal distribution center in, say, Atlanta. In that scenario, only Macy's and UPS make money off that transaction.But if you place that online order through Deliv, and the nearby Stanford Shopping Center fulfills that order (and a few dozen others) from its own in-house Macy's, then the mall owner gets some of that revenue, because of the way that leases are structured.Malls ""make money on real estate and rent,"" said Carmeli, adding, ""the more sales the actual Macy's makes, the more the actual mall operator makes.""Which is why malls are willing to carve out parts of their own budgets to hire runners to fulfill Deliv orders. Deliv has partnered exclusively with — and has strategic investments from — major operators Simon Property Group (SPG), Westfield, General Growth Properties (GGP) and Macerich.Luckily for Deliv and its rivals, the technology to make same-day drop-offs happens to have come a long way since the early dot-com days. Deliv's Carmeli, whose company serves 1,400 cities across 35 U.S. markets, was once told her idea was the ""stupidest idea ever.""""Do you remember Webvan? Do you remember Kozmo? Do you remember all the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that were deployed to build up these companies that ended up exploding in colossal fashion?"" she recalls being asked.Deliv, like many of its peers, avoids being blown up by using modern-age technology to orchestrate an algorithmic symphony of scheduled pickups and drop-offs from nearly 150 retailers — including Macy's, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Sam's Club and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Express — straight to people's homes.Retailers nowadays have a better grip on inventory visibility, says Carmeli. And smartphones make it easy to crowdsource drivers.Her predecessors, like Leonardo da Vinci dreaming up helicopters in the early 1500s, tried to make same-day work on a mass scale before the right equipment existed.Boston Retail Partners analyst Scott Langdoc knows that serious pain. As a former C-suite exec at ""mini-Webvan"" delivery company PDQuick at the start of the new millennium, he says that Google Maps would have made all the difference.""If I had the tools that are available today, starting with Google Maps but fast-forwarding to the (artificial intelligence and machine learning) tools that are available today, it's amazing to think what I could've done at my scale or what Webvan or Kozmo could've done at their scale,"" he said.Like many of its peers of the time, PDQuick didn't survive. It was bought out and went back to its roots as a scaled-down SoCal neighborhood delivery service, Pink Dot.""What we'd intended to do before the 2001 implosion was basically do what Shipt did, which was to generalize the delivery and logistics capability for any retail platform so we could bring in inventory. A retailer brought in drivers and you would be able, based on location, to provide that capability,"" said Langdoc.""Fast forward 15 years, that is what Shipt is; that is what Instacart is.""That doesn't mean that same-day delivery is not without major challenges. It's expensive, for one. And as grocery delivery emerges as the next massive battleground, the stakes are being raised beyond mere speedy delivery of things like T-shirts, to more delicate items like yogurt and tomatoes.Even first movers are encountering issues.""It's not free and you can lose an awful lot of money trying to do it for free,"" said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. ""Amazon will approach $10 billion in absorbed delivery costs this year. There aren't a lot of companies that have the ability to absorb that, either from a financial flexibility perspective or shareholder patience.""That has bestowed upon Amazon a ""fairly significant advantage,"" he said.Still, other companies have advantages too. If any physical retailer could conceivably take on same-day delivery in-house, it's Walmart, say experts.So far, Walmart's grocery-delivery pilot employs its own trucks in just one of six test markets, Denver. It relies on Deliv in San Jose and on Uber in Dallas, Orlando, Phoenix and Tampa.The Bentonville, Ark.-based mega-retailer recently declared that over 40% of American households across more than 100 cities will have access to its online grocery delivery service by year-end. That effort is expected to add thousands more to its already 18,000-strong force of personal shoppers.On Tuesday, Walmart said it enlisted courier Postmates to deliver online grocery orders starting in Charlotte, N.C., before rolling out to other cities.""We know one thing's for sure: that (customers) want a delivery option and so we're committed to that,"" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman told Investor's Business Daily in late January. The company filed to trademark grocery delivery-related ""Wam! by Walmart"" earlier in the year, which Blakeman confirmed is associated with active, ongoing projects.Still, even as analysts agree that same-day shipping, including grocery delivery, has to be an option for shoppers now, some question if the effort is worth it.""In this arms race to provide faster delivery, are you providing too many resources to a very small niche product, or a small niche customer base?"" asked Moody's O'Shea.There are more households in America that make less than $30,000 a year than more than $100,000, he said. So the idea of same-day, for most products, isn't hugely compelling at current price points.""I would not say that the demand is minimal, it just has a definite ceiling — at least as far as the pricing stays where it is,"" echoed Euromonitor analyst Tim Barrett.And if you're wondering whether same-day delivery could ever scale up and reach rural settings, the answer is: ""No way,"" he said, laughing.""Simply put, that's not going to happen,"" said Barrett. ""We have seen traditional grocery stores struggle to sustain enough traffic to justify real estate and actual brick and mortar, let alone expensive delivery, let alone even more expensive same-day delivery.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

52,GGP,"Unibail-Rodamco SE, Europe's largest commercial landlord, agreed to buy Australia's Westfield Corp. for about A$21 billion ($15.8 billion) in the biggest property acquisition since 2013 as declining store sales push mall operators worldwide to merge.X The Paris-based company offered a combination of cash and stock that values Westfield at A$10.01 per share, or about 18% more than Monday's closing price, according to a statement Tuesday. The offer has been unanimously recommended by the board of Westfield, the biggest private sector mall landlord in London and the 12th largest U.S. retail property owner.""Our first take is that we are not overexcited about the price — Unibail is buying at an implied initial yield of below 4%,"" said Peter Papadakos, an analyst at Green Street Advisors in London. ""If you think about where cap rates and yields are going in the U.S. and the U.K., which we think will be stable to upwards, the pricing is aggressive.""Unibail is mounting the biggest takeover of a company in the Asia-Pacific region this year — and the largest ever in Australia — as mall owners seek to contend with relentless pressure from online commerce. Shares of such companies have been hit hard and store closures are accelerating, pressuring landlords to fill empty space and reinvent shopping centers. Unibail-Rodamco's fell as much as 4.1%, the most since October 2016, after the deal was announced.Founded by billionaire Frank Lowy, Westfield began in 1959 with one shopping mall in the outer suburbs of Sydney and has grown to become one of the world's largest shopping center owners and managers. Westfield owns and operates 35 malls in the U.S. and U.K. valued at $32 billion, according to its website.""The U.S. is probably not the market where you'd try to sell"" lower quality malls ""at this point,"" Unibail-Rodamco Chief Financial Officer Jaap Tonckens said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ""I think we'll focus on improving them, ride out the storm and see where we go from there."" The deal should be accretive to earnings from the first full year, he said.Westfield's properties include shopping malls in east and west London and the retail space in New York's World Trade Center. It gets almost 70% of its $1.8 billion annual revenue in the U.S., where companies are trying to re-purpose struggling brick-and-mortar shopping centers.""This is a combination of two of the best-in-class mall operators in the world,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sue Munden said. ""They will become a dominant player, have the best relationships with retailers and therefore be best placed to create the malls of the future.""The latest transaction is the largest in real estate since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sold an apartment owner to a consortium led by Equity Residential for more than $16 billion, a deal that was completed in 2013.The transaction implies an enterprise value of $24.7 billion, according to the statement. Unibail offered 0.01844 of its shares plus $2.67 in cash for each Westfield security, representing 65% stock to 35% cash, according to the statement.Unibail-Rodamco has been selling smaller and less-dominant assets in its European retail portfolio and reinvesting the proceeds in its development pipeline which includes larger malls which are expected to be more resilient to the growth of online shopping. The company has 8.1 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of planned projects, according to its website.The landlord will continue with a plan announced earlier to sell 3 billion euros of malls that are noncore, Tonckens said in the interview.Shares of Westfield have declined 9.4% this year, headed for their worst performance since 2011. The shares were suspended Tuesday ahead of the announcement.""Assets I've spent my life building, I could not imagine a better home for them than in this new company,"" Frank Lowy said via a webcast from London. Lowy will chair a newly created advisory board, and the family will maintain a substantial investment in the group, according to the statement.In other signs of consolidation in the industry, Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) is seeking to buy the portion of mall owner GGP (GGP) it doesn't already own. New York-based hedge fund Third Point is pushing for change at Macerich (MAC), including a possible sale, after building a stake in the real estate investment trust, people familiar with the matter said last month. Even after getting a boost from Brookfield's interest, GGP shares are down 6.4% since the beginning of the year.The deal will lead to speculation that Simon Property Group Inc., the biggest U.S. mall owner, will also look to expand, Munden said. The firm, which has seen its shares fall 8.7% this year, owns about one-fifth of Klepierre SA, the Paris-based shopping center owner that's been renovating its properties.The U.K.'s biggest publicly traded mall owners are also combining forces. Hammerson Plc this month agreed to buy its smaller competitor, Intu Properties Plc, in a deal that values the latter at about 3.4 billion pounds ($4.6 billion).""We're going into London, we believe it's a global city and will be fine"" despite the slowing U.K. economy, Tonckens said. ""Will it be choppy? Probably.""

Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally.

58,GGP,"Sandeep Mathrani, head of U.S. shopping-center operator General Growth Properties (GGP), was in Dubai when he saw something that startled him: an indoor city just for kids.In the middle of the giant Dubai Mall, he found an activity center filled with child-size restaurants, bakeries, hospitals and police stations. The kids operated their own role-playing town — complete with currency — and parents were nowhere to be found.Mathrani took to the concept, called KidZania, and is now working with the company to bring it to America. E2W, owner of the KidZania U.S. license, plans to open the first activity centers at GGP properties in Dallas and Chicago over the next two years, marking the U.S. debut of a business that has staked out locations in 24 cities overseas.At a time when U.S. malls are facing hundreds of store closings, they're looking to fill their space with more diverse tenants — everything from urgent-care centers and supermarkets to climbing gyms. KidZania can sop up square footage vacated by department stores and has the added bonus of being immune to e-commerce.""The country is over-retailed,"" Mathrani said in an interview. ""The biggest advantage we can have is to recapture department stores and repurpose them.""GGP, which owns 126 retail centers in 40 states, has gone on the offensive in converting department stores into other facilities. Instead of just waiting for stores to go vacant, it has bought out leases and physical property from chains like Macy's (M), Sears Holdings (SHLD) and J.C. Penney (JCP) The company has now reclaimed more than 100 stores over the past five years, Mathrani said.The KidZania business, founded in 1999 by Mexican entrepreneur Xavier Lopez Ancona, requires a lot of space to operate: 60,000 square feet, with 30-foot-high ceilings. The activity centers also are best suited to suburban areas with families and schools, said Keith Rubenstein, who runs KidZania's recently created U.S. division.Mathrani already knew the concept when Rubenstein approached him last year, once E2W had secured a license to operate in the U.S., Rubenstein said.""That was a big, big, big win,"" Rubenstein said. Mathrani ""was ready in advance, and it just so happened we had the right product to fill those needs at his centers.""For Mathrani, KidZania is part of a shift toward ""experiential retail"" — and away from department stores. Over the past six years, GGP's roster of department stores has dropped from 500 to 398. And the number could fall below 300 in the next five years if the company continues proactively acquiring stores, he said.Other concepts have taken their place, including supermarkets like Wegmans Food Markets, entertainment hub Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) , and a growing number of bowling alleys and fitness centers.Each KidZania ""city"" allows children ages 4 to 14 to role-play in more than 100 occupations and professions, such as doctor, reporter or truck driver. The centers come with buildings, paved streets, cars and their own currency called ""kidZos."" To make the experience as authentic as possible, companies sponsor local landmarks and businesses. Kids may fly a British Airways plane, for example, or operate an H&M store.Parents are free to drop off their children for a session, which lasts about four to five hours, or they can stay to watch from a deck that looks over the scene. A session typically costs from $30 to $50 per child, depending on the location. KidZania has locations in cities such as Tokyo and London, and each one draws about half a million visitors annually, the company says.The first U.S. locations will go into Dallas' Stonebriar Centre in 2018 and Chicago's Oakbrook Center in 2019. The Dallas location will be built from the ground up, while the one in Chicago will occupy the upper level of an existing Sears (SHLD) store. Rubenstein expects to roll out 20 more U.S. locations over the next decade.The chain should have plenty of room to grow. The U.S. has about 24 square feet of retail real estate per capita, according to data compiled by Clarion, which has about $44 billion in real estate under management. By comparison, Canada has only 16 square feet per person.More than 10% of the nation's retail space — or nearly 1 billion square feet — may need to be closed, converted to other uses or renegotiated for lower rent in coming years, according to data provided to Bloomberg by CoStar Group (CSGP). That means malls will need new anchors, said Jeffrey Langbaum, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.""The landlords want to bring some tenant into that space that will improve the overall quality of the mall and the traffic flow into the mall,"" he said. ""They're setting about trying to find the nontraditional retailers to fill that space and accomplish what the department stores historically accomplished.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Investors Who See Plenty Of Life In Dying MallsSeeking E-Commerce Shoots Among Retail's Brick-And-Mortar DeclineWho's Driving The Housing Recovery Now?

59,GGP,"Traditional retailers, whose obituaries have been started and scrapped for years, are on the critical list again, with stores shuttering and e-commerce giants like Amazon.com (AMZN) in ascendance.Executives say put the death notices away, at least for one category. Malls aren't going extinct — they're changing, sometimes by healthy natural selection. While store closures are painful, often they represent a Darwinian moment, allowing a shopping center to refresh its mix by adding a grocery market or an Apple store.Investors aren't buying it. Literally. Mall REIT stocks have dropped 18% in the past year, compared with a 4% gain in the broader REIT group, as stores close at a record pace. At the same time, a view is building among industry analysts that skepticism has gone too far.Down 7% this year, Bloomberg's BBREIT Regional Mall Index trades for 5.1 times book value, down from its 2016 high of 6.7 and roughly in line with its decade average.New York University's REIT Symposium on April 6 featured presentations from chief executive officers at 27 REITs spanning numerous industries. But the conversation kept bouncing back to retail. Here's what the executives had to say:Retail properties come in many varieties, and shouldn't be lumped together. Malls aren't the same as strip centers, and, more importantly, high-quality malls — or ""A"" malls — are different from ""B"" and ""C"" malls. The consensus is that the high-quality malls will outperform.""If you own the best real estate, you will thrive,"" said Sandeep Mathrani, CEO of mall operator GGP (GGP). Retailers no longer care whether they're operating out of a strip center or a mall, he said. Quality is what matters. And of the 7.5 billion square feet of retail real estate in the U.S., only 1.2 billion is currently occupied by stores that are considered high quality, Mathrani said.When it comes to malls, ""high quality"" has been synonymous with luxury apparel brands. But the definition is changing as e-commerce puts a premium on creativity. A trip to the mall is no longer just about buying a designer handbag. Now it often involves going to a grocery store, doctor's office or upscale restaurant — all businesses that face less risk from e-commerce than traditional tenants. Some REITs are tacking on office space or apartments to diversify. One mall in Dubai even boasts an aquarium and an Olympic sized ice rink, and another features a ski slope.Mathrani said today's ideal mall includes one department store, a supermarket, an Apple store, a Tesla store, and businesses that started out online, such as Warby Parker. Clothing stores, which used to take up about 70% of the average shopping center, now represent closer to 50%, he said. Meanwhile, food is roughly 15%, up from around 6%.""Food is the new fashion, and fitness is the new food,"" said Acadia Realty Trust (AKR) CEO Kenneth Bernstein.Shoppers also aren't willing to travel as far as they once were for a day at the mall, so location and convenience are important. ""Old-fashioned retail shopping centers will continue to exist as long as they're in the right location,"" Mathrani said.Store closures such as those at Sears Holdings (SHLD) and J.C. Penney (JCP) have driven a lot of the recent negativity around retail, but some REITs have said good riddance. The exit of one retailer can present an opportunity to boost rents and lease space to a higher-quality store.Mathrani said that GGP had anticipated the fall of some stores, and has been able to fill 80% of the space that was left empty when retailers went bankrupt. Stores like Bonobos, Lululemon (LULU) and Warby Parker have filled the gaps.Technological innovation can also open doors, according to Conor Flynn, CEO of shopping center REIT Kimco Realty (KIM). He said driverless cars and ride-sharing could allow his company to transform parking lots into apartments and hotels.Some REIT executives said the U.S. has too much retail space. Flynn said a lot of shopping centers were built to keep up with household formation, but many of those households were never built. So as e-commerce continues to take more market share, parts of the country may need to do some demolition. In the future, the city you live in may have four malls instead of eight. The key, Flynn said, is having a good business both in stores and online.""Home Depot (HD) is a perfect example of being very efficient at both the physical bricks-and-mortar as well as the e-commerce business,"" he said. ""There is an omnichannel wave now that is widely accepted by most consumers.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Investors Who See Plenty Of Life In Dying MallsSeeking E-Commerce Shoots Among Retail's Brick-And-Mortar DeclineWho's Driving The Housing Recovery Now?

60,GGP,"Suburban Detroit's Lakeside Mall, with midrange stores such as Sears (SHLD), Bath & Body Works and Kay Jewelers (SIG), is one of the hundreds of retail centers across the U.S. being buffeted by the rise of e-commerce. After a $144 million loan on the property came due in June, owner General Growth Properties (GGP) didn't make the payment.The default by the second-biggest U.S. mall owner may be a harbinger of trouble nationwide, as a wave of debt from the last decade's borrowing binge comes due for shopping centers. About $47.5 billion of loans backed by retail properties are set to mature over the next 18 months, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch show. That's coinciding with a tighter market for commercial-mortgage backed securities, where many such properties are financed.For some mall owners, negotiating loan extensions or refinancing may be difficult. Lenders are tightening their purse strings as unease surrounding the future of shopping centers grows, with bleak earnings forecasts from retailers including Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), and bankruptcy filings by chains such as Aeropostale and Sports Authority. Older malls in small cities and towns are being hit hardest, squeezed by competition from both the internet and newer, glitzier malls that draw wealthy shoppers.""For many years, people thought the retail business in the U.S. was a bit overbuilt,"" said Tad Philipp, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service. ""The advent of online shopping is kind of accelerating the separation of winners and losers.""Landlords that can't refinance debt may either walk away from the property or negotiate for an extension of the due date. It can be hard to save a failing mall, leading to high losses for lenders on soured loans, Philipp said.General Growth already extended the mortgage on the Lakeside Mall once before, in 2010. It was part of the Chicago-based company's plan to emerge from the biggest real estate bankruptcy in U.S. history after piling on $27 billion in debt. Fitch Ratings flagged the property as potentially problematic in August, citing declining occupancy.The mall -- anchored by JCPenney (JCP), Sears, Macy's and Lord & Taylor stores -- was built in 1976 and last renovated 15 years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Occupancy was 79% as of December.The loan has been transferred to C-III Asset Management, a special servicer that handles troubled commercial mortgages on behalf of bondholders, and General Growth failed to pay the mortgage that was due June 1, Bloomberg data show. In February, Chief Financial Officer Michael Berman said the company expected to address their 2016 maturities ""successfully.""Representatives for General Growth and C-III declined to comment on the loan.The 1.5 million-square-foot (139,000-square-meter) mall in Sterling Heights, Mich., isn't typical of General Growth's holdings, which include some of the world's premier shopping destinations, such as Honolulu's Ala Moana Center and Las Vegas' Fashion Show. General Growth spun off most of its weaker malls into a separate company in 2012 and has been looking to dispose of assets that don't fit into its strategy of owning the best properties in top markets.It's getting more difficult to find takers for lower-tier malls, according to Green Street Advisors. The pool of buyers is shallow and funding is elusive, the real estate research firm wrote in a note to clients last week.""The criteria to get financing is getting a little bit more stringent and cutting off the lifelines for some of these malls,"" DJ Busch, a senior analyst at Green Street, said in an interview.Green Street estimates that several hundred malls could shut down over the next decade, with properties reliant on Macy's, JCPenney and Sears at the most risk. Sales at department stores, once the engines that powered shopping centers across the U.S., have declined almost 20% since 2006, according to the firm. About 800 department stores would need to shut down to restore balance between sales and profitability, Green Street said in an April report.Insurance companies and banks that are eager to issue loans on high-end shopping complexes aren't as willing to take a chance on a shaky mall. That pushes borrowers toward Wall Street firms that underwrite loans to sell to investors as CMBS. CMBS lending, which stalled earlier this year with the volatility in global markets, remains subdued in the face of new regulations taking effect in December. Wall Street banks have sold about $18.5 billion of CMBS deals this year, a 30% drop from the same period in 2015, according to Deutsche Bank. That's making borrowing more expensive and choking off funding just as loans from the boom years of 2006 and 2007 come due.""You're definitely seeing some problems as the loans reach their maturity,"" said Roger Lehman, a debt analyst at Credit Suisse Group.Walking away from a poorly performing mall is often the best thing a landlord can do for its balance sheet, according to Green Street's Busch. If the debt is greater than the value of the property, it might not make sense to invest in a costly redevelopment, he said.""It takes a lot of hope and a lot of capital to reinvent a mall that's already somewhat uncompetitive in its market,"" Busch said.WP Glimcher (WPG) plans to hand over five of its malls to lenders, four of which have mortgages coming due in the next 12 months, the company said in a June 8 presentation. Chief Executive Officer Michael Glimcher last month said that it had multiple offers from lenders to refinance one of the loans, a $87.3 million mortgage on the Mesa Mall in Grand Junction, Colo., which was due June 1.A representative for Columbus, Ohio-based Glimcher declined to comment on its financing plans.Late payments are creeping upward on CMBS loans backed by all property types. More than $1 billion of mortgages tied to shopping malls, office buildings and hotels soured in May, up from $884 million in April, Wells Fargo data show.That figure will probably increase as more loans issued in the run-up to the 2008 crash fail to refinance under the tougher underwriting guidelines in place today, according to Rich Moore, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.""In 2006 or 2007, everything was beautiful,"" Moore said. In the current environment, ""if you got to a bank and you want to refinance junk, the bank says no.""

61,GGP,"Among investors in the largest U.S. companies, no pay package is less popular than the one given to Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares.Only 23% of the shares of the housewares retailer were voted in support of its compensation plan at an annual meeting on July 1, the lowest level in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shareholders told the board that the CEO's $19.4 million pay for 2015 was too high, and that his performance goals weren't challenging enough, the Union, N.J.-based company said in its May proxy statement.New York Comptroller Scott Stringer, representing city pension funds, weighed in on the matter with a letter to Bed, Bath & Beyond investors. There's a ""gaping and persistent disconnect between CEO pay and company performance,"" he wrote. The retirement funds, with $160 billion in assets, are among the company's 60 largest shareholders.Bed, Bath & Beyond, which sells everything from coffee to accent rugs, is reducing Temares' target compensation by 14% for 2016 and is making his performance goals more rigorous, according to its proxy statement. Janet Barth, a spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the regulatory filing.Shareholder disapproval of Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay practices contrasts with a falling number of businesses that fail in so-called say-on-pay votes. About 1% of S&P 500 companies have lost in their most recent nonbinding votes, and the average support level is 93%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Temares' 2015 package was his largest ever, even as shares fell by more than a third. His pay tops that awarded to Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) CEO John Stumpf and approaches that given to IBM's (IBM) Virginia Rometty. The awards include a $4 million salary and $15.7 million in stock and options. That was an increase of about $1.1 million from his 2014 package. The exact amount of stock that 57-year-old Temares will receive may change depending on how Bed, Bath & Beyond performs against a group of 47 other companies on earnings and return-on-capital measures.A University of Pennsylvania law graduate who primarily worked in real estate, Temares joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in 1992 before its debut on public exchanges to oversee property transactions as it expanded. Its footprint has grown to more than 1,500 stores from 62 two decades ago. He was promoted to CEO in 2003, earning a $931,000 salary during his first year in the top job.Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay plan also failed with investors last year. The company determined it would make some changes after contacting 25 investors representing 68% of shares, the chain said in the May 31 proxy.Temares' target compensation was reduced to $16.9 million for 2016 in a plan that will be voted on next year. His $4 million salary, the third-largest in the S&P index, will stay the same. He receives the large salary in lieu of a smaller one and a potential bonus, because ""cash bonuses promote short-term thinking,"" according to the filing.Still, Institutional Shareholder Services describes the CEO's salary as ""excessive"" and notes that it could bloat his golden parachute to $46 million if the company gets bought. The proxy adviser gave Bed, Bath & Beyond a rating of 10, its worst governance score, meaning its structure may have a greater probability of risks to its reputation, long-term value or fiduciary obligations.Bed, Bath & Beyond is joined by car-parts maker BorgWarner (BWA), chemical producer FMC Corp. (FMC), mall operator General Growth Properties (GGP), and utilities owner Exelon (EXC) in receiving less than 50% support in its most recent vote. Representatives of Exelon and BorgWarner said the companies take the votes seriously and are seeking investor feedback. The other companies didn't return requests for comment.In addition to Bed, Bath & Beyond, only Oracle (ORCL) has received less than 50% support in two consecutive years. The Redwood City, Calif.-based software maker is on its fourth failed year. Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to comment.Stringer noted Bed, Bath & Beyond's compensation committee members Dean Adler, Stanley Barshay and Victoria Morrison have each served on the board for more than 13 years, which ""highlights the need for new directors that are able to exercise strong, independent oversight of management."" Each received about 65% support after calls by Stringer and ISS to oust them. The committee doesn't have a chair, which is rare.

62,GGP,"UPS (UPS) has acquired a stake in same-day delivery startup called Deliv, shifting it into competition with e-tail giant Amazon.com (AMZN).Palo Alto-based Deliv delivers products from brick-and-mortar retailers to shoppers at their nearby homes -- attempting to figure out an efficient solution to the most expensive part of delivery: the last mile.The $28 million of announced funding brings Deliv's total haul to $40.5 million from funders such as Upfront Ventures, RPM Ventures and mall operators such as General Growth Properties (GGP) and Simon Property Group (SPG). The Wall Street Journal reported that its valuation was unavailable.Deliv has struck deals with Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google for its Express delivery service, among other clients including several startups.""Same-day is absolutely the new standard. That’s exactly what’s happening in the market. Look what Amazon is doing,"" Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli told IBD.As part of the funding arrangement, UPS will gain a seat on the Deliv board -- an opportunity to gather intelligence about a business and market it doesn't operate in.Currently UPS only offers same-day delivery for high-margin sectors such as health care. Next-day delivery is available for evening pickups -- customers generally place orders online in the evening when returning from work.“I struggle to understand what it is that I need in less than a few hours,” Rimas Kapeskas, head of UPS’s Strategic Enterprise Fund, told the Wall Street Journal. UPS is specifically interested in Deliv's software that connects it directly with a retailer's website.UPS and Amazon have an uneasy relationship. At the moment Amazon.com is UPS's largest customer but as the e-tailer's delivery costs continue to soar, the company has begun to seek alternatives and is widely rumored to be building its own freight operation.Amazon.com offers free two-day shipping and other perks via it's loyalty program Amazon Prime. The e-tailer offers same-day delivery service via its Prime Now app.On the company's Q4 earnings call, executives characterized the speedy delivery options as very difficult and expensive but said customers love it.To support its various shipping options Amazon has entered the ocean freight shipping business, is rumored to be flying several flights a day from an airfield in Ohio to locations near its fulfillment centers, has bought a fleet of truck trailers, and is leasing a number of Boeing 767 cargo aircraft.But, it's still unclear who is going to crack the code on same-day delivery. It's a complex and expensive business with low margins. Others, such as San Jose-based eBay (EBAY) tried to launch in the U.S. but ultimately ended the pilot program. CEO Devin Wenig said at the time the company had ""mixed results"" for the delivery service.

275,GGP,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has been making rigorous efforts to drive footfall at its properties. In sync with that, the company recently announced an association with Electrify America to install electric-vehicle charging stations at over 30 of its properties.Simon Property has been undertaking every possible step to ensure that footfall remains high at all of its properties. This move also aids Simon Property in its corporate-sustainability ambitions.Mona Benisi, Simon Property’s vice president of corporate sustainability informed, ""Having been one of the first retail property owners in the U.S. to offer customer EV charging stations, we understand the importance of this infrastructure to facilitate the transition towards smart sustainable cities.”Gulfport Premium Outlets in Gulfport, MS has been chosen as the first property where the charging station is going to be installed in early June. Moreover, Electrify America, Mississippi Power and Simon Property are going to host a 'First Charging Ceremony' in that location. After which, the charging stations will be installed at few notable properties of the company across the United States.Simon Property has been undertaking these efforts to combat the declining mall traffic, which continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, retailers are compelled to reconsider footprints and eventually opt for store closures while others, unable to cope with competition, are filing bankruptcies as e-commerce is gaining market share from brick-and-mortar stores.This resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.

277,GGP,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) has provided an update of its Q2 transaction activity and reported that it has sold 17 shopping centers, aggregating 2.7 million square feet of space, in the quarter. With these dispositions, the company’s second-quarter sales volume has surpassed $330 million and for the first half of the year, the same aggregated $556 million. This retail REIT now remains on track to meet its full-year disposition target of $700-$900 million.Specifically, the 17 shopping centers were sold off for $334.0 million, of which Kimco’s share of dispositions amounted to $319.3 million. The bunch of properties that were sold off included a 368,000-square-foot property in Springfield, MO — Primrose Marketplace — that was sold for $51.8 million, a 356,000-square-foot property in Chula Vista, CA — Broadway Plaza — for $58.5 million as well as a 269,000-square-foot center in Downers Grove, IL — Downers Park Plaza — for $26.7 million. The company also disposed a 145,000- square-foot property in Hoover, AL — The Grove — for $21.0 million which marked its exit from the state of Alabama.The company witnessed solid demand for open-air shopping centers and the Q2 property sales’ blended cap rate came in line with its expected range of 7.5-8%.Notably, mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels, resulting in store closures and retailers bankruptcies. These have cast a pall on retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty, Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others, and their share prices have suffered in the past 12 months.However, Kimco has been countering the challenges and the company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high-quality assets, concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.In fact, amid transformation in the retail landscape, Kimco remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues, with focus on service and experiential tenants, and omni-channel players who generate 56% and 39% of annual base rent, respectively. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its small shops portfolio. These shops basically comprise service-based industries, such as restaurants, salons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant. Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics, this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.However, in connection to its strategic efforts, Kimco is making significant disposition of the company’s assets. It disposed 38 shopping centers and four land parcels, aggregating 5 million square feet of space year-to-date for $556.1 million, of which, the company’s share of the sales price was $531.8 million. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, enhancements at the King of Prussia (Greater Philadelphia), Pennsylvania property will include outdoor plaza, residences, a hotel and Class A office building.In the thriving Denver market, the company will open its latest Premium Outlets center — Denver Premium Outlets — in Thornton, CO, this fall.

In fact, the experiential concepts are gaining traction and Simon is banking on it while transforming its properties.Moreover, in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. This move will help the retail REIT draw more traffic to these malls in order to benefit the existing retailers. The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA).

281,GGP,"Year 2018 so far has been marked by increased government borrowing costs. This is especially true as growing inflationary pressure is building up the case for aggressive rate hikes, pushing yields higher. According to CME, there is 51% chance of four interest rates hike this year.The 10-year Treasury yields, which are a key driver of global borrowing costs, jumped to a 7-year high of 3.12%. The latest spike came on the heels of higher oil price, which is back to $80 per barrel level, and upbeat April retail sales. Worries about growing supply of government debt are also causing the spike in yields (read: ETF Strategies to Play the 7-Year High Benchmark Yield).Pros and ConsA rising rate environment is highly beneficial for cyclical sectors like financial, technology, industrials and consumer discretionary. Banks are at the most advantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. If interest rates rise, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Also, insurance companies are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds.Higher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which in turn leads to greater consumer power. An improving economy coupled with higher consumer confidence is making the consumer discretionary sector tempting to investors amid higher yields. The technology sector should benefit as rising interest rates usually correlate with an economy that is gaining strength and is expected to grow at a faster pace, leading to increased IT spending (read: 5 Niche Tech ETFs Hitting All-Time Highs).Although higher rates would attract more capital to the country, boosting the U.S. dollar against the basket of other currencies, it would have a huge impact on commodity-linked investments, implying that a rising rate environment will hurt a number of segments. In particular, high dividend paying sectors such as utilities and real estate would be the worst hit, given their higher sensitivity to rising interest rates. Additionally, securities in capital-intensive sectors like telecom would also be impacted by higher rates.Further, higher rates would also result in tighter lending conditions and curtail consumer spending on a wide range of products like cars and houses. This will in turn dent profitability across various segments. Further, businesses will also face higher loan rates over time.Given this, we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from the sectors that will benefit from higher rates and the ones that will be badly impacted.Sectors to WinFinancialsThe ultra-popular Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report), with AUM of $32.9 billion and average daily volume of 61.6 million shares, offers broad exposure to the sector with banks making up for 44.9% of the portfolio.

282,GGP,"Retail REITs are not in the pink of health, as mall traffic continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have felt the heat, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.However, not all are equally likely to fall behind. In fact, among those, reputed retail REIT — Simon Property Group — has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties, aiming premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments, and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company counter the retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. This move will help the retail REIT draw more traffic to these malls in order to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties include entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, hotel and office, as well as new retail brands.  In fact, over the past five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest substantially for development and redevelopment projects. Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.Moreover, at the end of first-quarter 2018, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Also, total portfolio net operating income growth for first-quarter 2018 came in at 4.8%. This reflected increase in operating income from comparable properties, as well as additions from new development, redevelopment, expansion and acquisitions. As such, the company managed to surpass expectations in the first quarter and also raised its outlook for 2018.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Additionally, rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This might impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has gained 3.8% in a month’s time, while the industry rallied 2.4%.

283,GGP,"CBL Properties (CBL  -  Free Report) is making every effort to boost traffic at its malls, in pursuit of which, it recently announced the addition of entertainment operator — Dave & Buster’s — at Hanes Mall in Winston-Salem, NC.Construction of the latest Dave & Buster’s location is in progress on the lower level near Sears. It will likely open in 2019, offering more than 30,000 square feet of entertainment. This would include several arcade-style games, chef-crafted food and beverage menu, as well as a D&B Sports Bar filled with lots of HDTVs.   Headquartered at Dallas, TX, Dave & Buster’s Entertainment Inc.

The developers have planned a grand opening for Round1, which is scheduled to occur prior to this year’s holiday season.Such redevelopment efforts are aimed at diversification of properties, as well as battling mall traffics blues which have brought in bad news for retail REITs like GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) and others over the past several quarters.In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to match up with competition have been filing bankruptcies. Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified.Nevertheless, retail landlords are making concerted efforts to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Also, with limited retail supply, refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction.Retail REITs are now avoiding dependence on apparel and accessories, and rather expanding their dining options, opening movie theaters and fitness centers, as well as offering recreational facilities, in particular.Such efforts are expected to bring the sparkle back in the sector and with the recent tax overhaul likely to benefit wages, consumer confidence and consumption levels, demand for prime properties are anticipated to remain decent, moving ahead.Moreover, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry over the past three months.

284,GGP,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) recently announced the company’s substantial redevelopment program at five properties. This move will help the retail REIT transform the former Sears stores and draw more traffic to these malls to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA).Per the plan, Brea Mall will have additional mixed uses. This comprises a new three-story, 120,000-square-foot Life Time Athletic healthy living, healthy aging, healthy entertainment destination, residential, entertainment, restaurants and new retail brands.

At the Midland Park Mall, renovations include additions of two new restaurants and a new bigger Dillard's store, along with a new-to-the-market large format retailer, per the company’s press release.Notably, for the past few years, mall traffic has been plagued with challenges thanks to the shift in shopping patterns, with e-retail taking precedence, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. This has shrunk demand for retail real estate space, as changing shopping patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.This has been a prevailing concern for retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others.Amid these, Simon Property has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company counter retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In line with this, the company is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its consumers. In fact, over the past five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest around $1 billion annually through 2018 for development and redevelopment projects.   At the end of fourth-quarter 2017, the company had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 25 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. With such a huge pipeline, Simon Property is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid a strengthening economy.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

285,GGP,"Amid the challenges in the retail sector, the news of GGP Inc.’s (GGP  -  Free Report) special committee unanimously recommending Brookfield Partners’  buyout deal has been ruling the roost. The transaction, valued at $15.3 billion, will give Brookfield the remaining 64% ownership of the retail real estate investment trust (REIT). This will lead to the formation massive entity with nearly $90 billion in assets and more than $4 billion in annual net operating income.According to the latest bid, GGP shareholders can choose to receive either $23.5 in cash or one BPY unit or one share of BPR — a new REIT that will be created through the buyout.  Valuation ConcernsAlthough the cash consideration of the deal indicates a 24% premium over GGP’s closing price as on Nov 6, 2017 — the day before talks between the companies was reported — the news was not well received by the Wall Street.  Per an article by National Real Estate Investor, GGP has agreed to be bought at a cap rate of low 6% to high 5% range. This range is well above market expectations and significantly undervalues the underlying real estates owned by GGP.In fact, it raises investors’ concerns that a low acquisition offer for GGP could have a ripple effect on peer retail REITs and drag down valuations. This indicates a revised lower pricing for even the best-in-class retail centers that are already facing headwinds from e-commerce and store closures in the retail industry. Specifically, as e-commerce continues to take market share from store-based retailers, mall traffic continues to suffer. This has spiked tenant move-outs and bankruptcy filing while decreasing demand for retail real estate properties.Three LosersGiven the latest development in the retail real estate market with the GGP deal and the ongoing troubles in the retail sector, investors may consider portfolio reshuffling and discarding these stocks from the said sector.DDR Corp.

286,GGP,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) recently announced its 97th dividend hike since the company’s NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 22 cents per share compared with the 21.95 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Jul 13 to shareholders on record as of Jul 2, 2018. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.64 per share versus the prior rate of $2.634 per share. Based on the company’s share price of $52.85 on Jun 19, this results in a dividend yield of around 5%, which is marginally ahead of the industry’s yield of 4.94%. This is likely to draw investors’ attention to the stock, to some extent.Admittedly, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the July 2018 dividend payment will mark its 83 consecutive quarterly increases, as well as payment of more than $5.5 billion throughout the company’s 49-year operating history. In fact, this retail REIT has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, the latest dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Notably, dwindling mall traffic, amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, Realty Income has been able to differentiate itself by deriving 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.The company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions has helped maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Moreover, in first-quarter 2018, it attained the highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.Moreover, Realty Income adheres to a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 5.9%, while the industry reported growth of 5.5% during the same time frame.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.16.Our TakeRealty Income’s high occupancy of its properties in the first quarter looks impressive.

The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are estimated to have witnessed a rise year over year.In the last reported quarter, this monthly-dividend-paying real estate investment trust (REIT) posted a negative surprise of 1.3%, in terms of FFO per share. It witnessed modest year-over-year growth in same-store rents and had exited the quarter with lower liquidity.Notably, Realty Income has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed estimates in two occasions, missed in one and met in the other, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.34%. This is depicted in the graph below:Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRealty Income’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. Besides retail properties, the company’s portfolio comprises industrial, office as well as agricultural properties. Further, it derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions, as well as competition from Internet retail. This is expected to have helped the company enjoy higher retail revenues in the Jan-Mar quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the company’s retail segment for first quarter is pegged at $303 million. This reflects a robust 6% increase from the prior-year quarter.Also, the company targets industrial properties leased to Fortune 1000, mainly investment grade-rated companies, which ensures stable revenues from these properties.Encouragingly, Realty Income’s FFO per share estimates witnessed positive revision. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter FFO per share has been revised upward by a cent to 79 cents, over the last 30 days, reflecting bullish analyst sentiment. This also reflects 3.9% year-over-year increase from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $321.6 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 7.9%.However, the retail real estate market remained turbulent amid retailer bankruptcies and store closures. Particularly, mall traffic has been affected, and retail landlords, including GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward e-retail. In addition, the company has substantial exposure to single-tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default.Amid these, growth in revenues from tenant reimbursements is expected to have been modest. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for tenant reimbursements of $11.31 million reflects around 1.2% increase from the prior quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Realty Income has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which increases the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Realty Income is +1.91%Zacks Rank: Realty Income has a Zacks Rank of 3.

289,GGP,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) enjoys a premium portfolio and the presence of well-capitalized tenants in its roster. Additionally, the company’s increasing adoption of the omni-channel model in retailing is anticipated to enhance shopping experience and bolster sales volume at the tenant stores, thereby raising demand for Macerich’s properties.Notably, Macerich has a high concentration of premium malls in some vibrant U.S. markets. The company has been diversifying its traditional tenant base by including several emerging digital and store-based retailers for offering enhanced shopping experience at the company’s retail centers.Additionally, Macerich has been focusing on an aggressive capital-recycling program, involving divestiture of non-core and slower-growth assets, and usage of the proceeds in higher-growth properties through acquisitions, developments, and redevelopment initiatives. As part of such measures, since 2013, Macerich sold 21 non-core retail centers for an aggregate of $1.8 billion in proceeds.Moreover, the company remains on track with its redevelopment pipeline and pre-leasing deals.  Further, Macerich is aiming to enhance its assets quality as well as customer relationships. Going forward, we expect such moves to offer an upside potential to the company and strengthen its high-end portfolio.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail real estate investment trusts (REIT) continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing for bankruptcies.This dreary environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Macerich, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) and others have been affected, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further hike in interest rate can also pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Moreover, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid such retail woes, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Macerich has lost 0.6% against the industry’s growth of 7.8%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations per share has been revised marginally upward in two months’ time.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

290,GGP,"GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) enjoys a portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. Further, its tenant roster includes a number of reputed names. GGP also focuses on omni-channel retailing and other initiatives which are encouraging. Nevertheless, declining traffic at malls, store closures and bankruptcies have emerged as a pressing concern for GGP as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Though the company is making efforts to counter the pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and will likely limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near term.In February, the retail REIT, GGP reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 48 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure was also higher than the prior-year quarter tally of 43 cents. Results indicated growth in same-store net operating income of 1.3% from the prior-year period.Notably, retailers are continuously evolving and in order to maximize revenues, they are using brick-and-mortar presence and internet together. Amid this, GGP is focusing on omni-channel retailing as it generates higher sales. Since early 2011, the company invested around $2.86 billion, improving its centers.  It is providing tenants with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the United States.Such moves are strategic fits as they boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets. Furthermore, GGP has been making efforts to add residential units to its retail centers in order to densify its retail centers. Such developments lower the distance between housing and retail destinations while steering a dependable traffic.Recently, as per a Reuters report, asset manager, Brookfield Property Partners made a revised acquisition offer to GGP. Per people familiar with the matter, the revised offer boasts of an elevated cash component. Notably, in November 2017, Brookfield offered $14.8 billion or $23 per share in a cash-and-stock offer to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP. However, GGP’s special board committee rejected the offer. The negotiations between the companies are ongoing and the exact value of the new offer is not known. The special board committee has yet to accept the offer.However, the U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers in recent times. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds.This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP and others as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably and curbing the landlord’s pricing power and occupancy level of properties. Moreover, such a choppy environment has led tenants to demand substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock outperformed its industry in the past six months.

293,GGP,"GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 5, before the market opens. Both its funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to improve year over year.This retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) fourth-quarter 2017 FFO per share of 48 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure was also higher than 43 cents posted in fourth-quarter 2016. Also, results reflected 1.3% year-over-year growth in same-store net operating income (NOI).Over the preceding four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in two occasions and met in the other two, the average positive surprise being 4.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.General Growth Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Growth Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Growth Properties, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOn Mar 26, GGP accepted the revised acquisition offer extended by Brookfield Property Partners, per which Brookfield will acquire the GGP shares, it doesn’t own yet, for nearly $15.3 billion, gaining complete ownership of the second-largest U.S. mall owner.Notably, GGP continues to bear the brunt of the lackluster retail real estate market. In fact, recent data from real estate research firm — Reis — states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies persisted at the 10% levels for first-quarter 2018. Additionally, mall traffic continues to suffer as e-commerce has been increasingly capturing market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, compelling retailers to resort to online options or file bankruptcy. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $368 million for minimum rents underscores a decline from the prior-quarter figure of $393 million. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for overage rents of $6.53 million highlights a steep sequential plunge of nearly 70%.Nonetheless, GGP has a solid portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. In addition, it has been making efforts to counter retail pressure through various initiatives. The company is focusing on omni-channel retailing to generate higher sales. Moreover, it is focused on offering mall visitors with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the nation.The above-mentioned moves are expected to boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $603 million, indicating projected growth of 6.5% from the year-ago period.Furthermore, GGP’s activities during the quarter could not gain analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share remained unchanged at 37 cents over the past month. This indicates estimated rise of 2.8% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GGP will likely beat FFO estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: GGP has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: GGP has a favorable Zacks Rank of 2.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:Realty Income (O  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter results on May 8, has an Earnings ESP of +0.64% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

294,GGP,"Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27 before the market opens. Both its funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to moderately improve year over year.In the last reported quarter, this Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) posted in-line results in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected high level of occupancy, increase in base minimum rent per square foot, and leasing spread per square foot at the company’s U.S. malls and Premium Outlets. The company also announced a hike in quarterly dividend.Moreover, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in one and missed in the other, the average beat being 0.11%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsWhile challenges faced by retail REITs have been well documented, recent data from Reis states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies remained moderately unchanged at 10% for first-quarter 2018. Although the first few months of 2018 witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates, stability in the vacancy rates indicates an encouraging picture for retail REITs this year.Simon Property has been quickly adapting to the changing retail landscape by increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies and overhauling properties. Importantly, the company is entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its customers.It has also re-launched its brand and marketing programs to strengthen the company’s relationship with customers and drive traffic. These efforts by the company to beat retail blues raise our optimism.Simon Property has resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. Such moves make its shopping malls appealing and will be conducive to revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.  Further, Simon Property has improved the company’s financial strength by amending and extending its 3.5-billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. In fact, the credit facility, when combined with the existing $4.0-billion revolver, offers the company $7.5 billion of total revolving credit capacity. Increased financial flexibility supports its active redevelopment and expansion pipelineFinally, shares of Simon Property have depreciated 10.5%, versus the 11.8% loss incurred by the industry, in three months’ time. Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Simon Property likely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Simon Property is +0.5%.Zacks Rank: Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Taubman Centers, Inc.

295,GGP,"The current reporting cycle has already crossed the half-way mark and results are still pouring in from the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry. In fact, on Aug 2, a number of S&P 500 constituents – residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), data center REIT Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), and retail REITs Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) – are slated to release quarterly figures.So far, results from the broader market revealed broad-based growth, record earnings tally, an abundance of positive surprises and favorable trends on the revisions front. (Read more: Q2 Earnings Season Past the Halfway Mark)Nevertheless, the performance of the REIT sector has so far been mixed, with results from some of the top notch REIT stocks either matching estimates or beating, and a few others falling shy of expectations.Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind.In fact, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang, driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.On the other hand, we note that mall traffic continues to decline owing to a change in shopping patterns. Online purchases have taken precedence over in-store purchase. This has forced retailers to reconsider their strategy and shift investments from traditional retailing to online channels and optimize their brick-and-mortar presence.While it is quite normal for retailers to do so, these optimization efforts and the consequent decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD) and JC Penney (JCP) in recent months, have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords. Also, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is resulting in higher vacancy in existing malls.    Therefore, not all players in the REIT space are equally poised to excel this time around. To predict that, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s have a look at what’s in store for the five REITs set to release second-quarter results on Wednesday:Arlington, VA-based, residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. In addition, increasing consumer confidence, on the back of job growth, rising wages, and a healthier balance sheet, promise bright prospects for the company. The company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although pace of rental growth has slowed down from the previous years, it is now likely to achieve stability. (Read more: Can AvalonBay Pull Off A Surprise in Q2 Earnings?)AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of +0.94 %. This positive ESP combined with its Zacks Rank #3, increases the chances of a positive surprise this season.Over the trailing four quarters, with respect to FFO per share, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.84%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the second quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which may dent Equinix’s second-quarter profitability.

This includes an upgrade of the tenant mix. Such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term. However, their short-term adverse impact on occupancy and net operating income cannot be bypassed.

299,GGP,"DDR Corp (DDR  -  Free Report) has been putting in strategic efforts to revamp its portfolio through an aggressive capital-recycling program. Further, the company has made progress with the spin-off of Retail Value Inc. (RVI), as it recently announced the distribution dates for the same. This spin-off is expected to streamline the company’s portfolio. Moreover, DDR is now shifting its focus from deleveraging to redevelopment strategy aimed at retenanting and densification of the company’s properties.Nevertheless, this involves large scale dispositions which are anticipated to impact the company’s bottom-line performance in the near term. In addition, the choppy retail real estate environment with store closures and bankruptcies, and shift in customers’ shopping preferences toward online purchases remains a concern for this retail real estate investment trust (REIT). Rate hike adds to its woes.Notably, DDR has been trying to streamline its organizational structure, which is likely to drive the company’s long-term growth. The restructuring is aimed at raising efficiencies, achieving appropriate staffing level, centralizing key operational decision making and bringing down operating costs. This will enable the company to reduce general and administration expenses by $6 million, annually.Additionally, DDR has been following an aggressive capital-recycling program through strategic asset management, which is aimed at reducing currency and development risks, as well as aiding expansion in premium U.S. markets. Consequently, the company is divesting its non-prime and non-income producing assets, and using the proceeds for reinvestment in premium U.S. shopping centers. It has nearly completed the existing $900-million disposition program. Such initiatives are likely to pave way for top-line growth, as well as demographic improvement in the long term.Also, the deleveraging process has helped the company improve its liquidity profile and expand DDR’s unencumbered asset pool. It also helped extend the weighted average maturities of the company’s debt. In fact, its pro forma average debt maturity is 6.3 years, at present. Further, with less than 10% of total debt outstanding maturing prior to 2022, DDR remains well poised to maximize on growth scopes.In first-quarter 2018, DDR sold assets worth $365.9 million, with the company’s share being $208.7 million. Dispositions for 2017 totaled approximately $1.3 billion. While dispositions are a strategic fit for long-term growth, the near-term dilution effect of such moves is unavoidable. In fact, the company witnessed a year-over-year decline of funds from operations (FFO), primarily due to the dilutive impact of asset sales. Nonetheless, management anticipates this dilution to end in 2018.Furthermore, with e-retail taking precedence, retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This dreary environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like DDR, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have been affected, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt.

300,GGP,"GGP Inc.’s (GGP  -  Free Report) shares rallied 3.3% after market close on Monday, as details of the revised deal pertaining to its acquisition by Brookfield Property Partners  unfolded. Amid the dull retail real estate market, this rally offers respite to investors.Notably, both companies have entered into a definitive agreement, per which Brookfield will acquire the GGP shares it doesn’t own yet for nearly $15.3 billion, gaining complete ownership of the second-largest U.S. mall owner.In November 2017, GGP rejected a $14.8 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer made by Brookfield, and both the companies continued negotiating the takeover deal. Earlier this month, the asset manager revised its buyout offer, increasing the aggregate cash consideration from $7.4 billion to $9.25 billion. Brookfield intends to create a new real estate investment trust (REIT) under the ticker “BPR” and issue its shares in this transaction. The newly formed entity will become one of the largest commercial real estate enterprises in the world with assets worth nearly $90 million and annual net operating income of more than $4 billion.Transaction DetailsAccording to the agreed proposal, GGP shareholders can choose to receive either $23.5 in cash or one BPY unit or one share of BPR. This is subject to proration based on an aggregate cash consideration of $9.25 billion.In addition, GGP shareholders will receive dividends for second-quarter 2018 up to 22 cents per share. Further, the transaction is contingent upon the approval of GGP shareholders representing at least two-thirds of GGP’s outstanding common stock as well as a majority of its shares not owned by Brookfield and its affiliates.Moreover, the deal is subject to other customary closing conditions and it anticipated to close in third-quarter 2018.Brookfield Asset Management  will guarantee BPR’s shareholder rights to exchange their shares for a BPY unit or cash equivalent of a BPY unit. Further, Brookfield intends to fund the cash consideration through $4 billion of financing from joint venture equity partners as well as a syndicate of lenders.Our ViewpointWith higher cash consideration, the acquisition also offers GGP shareholders the ability to receive shares in a newly listed REIT and hence enjoy upside potential. In fact, after the transaction is completed, GGP shareholders will own nearly 26% of the new REIT.While GGP is struggling to draw decent mall traffic amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bound, such transactions appease investors by providing a premium value for their shares.Additionally, after this buyout, Brookfield will have higher negotiating power with retailers, which will aid the company to revamp and draw more value to some GGP-owned malls.Shares of GGP have outperformed its industry in the past six months. During this time, the stock has lost 0.3% compared with industry’s decline of 9.8%. Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderGGP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked stock in the same space is Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report).

301,GGP,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has a diversified exposure to retail assets in the United States and abroad. Further, the company’s efforts to support omni-channel retailing, portfolio-restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet augur well for long-term growth.However, as Simon Property is trying to counter the choppy retail real estate environment through various initiatives, these require upfront costs and thus, it is likely to limit any robust growth in the company's profit margins in the near term. Also, stiff competition from online sales and rise in interest rate pose challenges for the company.Notably, Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio, and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. In fact, at the end of the first quarter, it had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia.In May, Simon Property launched a $4+ billion of investment plan to transform its properties aimed at creating value and drive footfall at the company's properties. The transformational plans included addition of hotels, restaurants and luxury stores.Also, later in May, Simon Property announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs.In fact, earlier in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties included entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, as well as new retail brands.The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend, over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This tepid environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have felt the heat, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This, in turn, is feared to negatively impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months.

302,GGP,"Mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. Such an environment has also led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions which mall landlords find unjustified.These have cast a pall on retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others, and their share prices have suffered in the past 12 months.However, not all are equally likely to fall behind. In fact, Kimco is making every effort to unlock the embedded value of its portfolio through development and re-development initiatives. Most recently, the company has achieved more than 75% of preleasing for its $108-million Mill Station Signature Series development project. The shopping center is being constructed on the site of the previous Owings Mills Mall in Baltimore County, MD.The company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high-quality assets, concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.In fact, amid transformation in the retail landscape, Kimco remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues, with focus on service and experiential tenants and omni-channel players who generate 56% and 39% of annual base rent, respectively. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its small shops’ portfolio. These shops basically comprise service-based industries, such as restaurants, salons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant. Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics, this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.Further, Kimco is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure, and enhance the company’s growth profile and tax efficiency as well. The company maintains a strong liquidity profile, with $2.25-billion unsecured line of credit, and aims at growing its unencumbered asset pool which consists of 75% of its properties.However, in connection to its strategic efforts, the company is making significant disposition of its assets. The company disposed 21 shopping centers for $219.5 million in the first quarter, with its share of the sales price being $210.2 million. Furthermore, the company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018 and projects its pro-rata share of dispositions, net of any acquisitions, to be in the range of $700-$900 million. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Addition, hike in rate of interest is expected to affect the REIT’s rate-sensitive business. It would restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt while increasing the interest cost on new debt. This has the power to adversely impact the company’s financial results and its dividend payout as well. In addition, amid rising interest rates, the common stock buyers demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

303,GGP,"Retail REIT Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) is experiencing decent demand for its Mill Station Signature Series Development project. In fact, recently, the company announced addition of a number of retailers to its tenant lineup at this project, including Lowe’s Home Improvement (LOW  -  Free Report), Marshalls, TJX’s new HomeSense concept, Burlington and Five Below (FIVE  -  Free Report).With these retailers joining Costco and AMC Theatre in the tenant roster, the company has been able to achieve more than 75% of preleasing for this $108-million Signature Series development project. The shopping center is being constructed on the site of the previous Owings Mills Mall in Baltimore County, MD. While Costco is slated to open later this year, the other retailers are likely to open their stores throughout the first half of 2019.Spanning around 620,000-square-foot of space, the Mill Station development will have a dynamic line-up of up to 30 retailers and restaurants. It will have retail outlets and offices interconnected through an extensive walkway network.The property is likely to command more attention since it is easily accessible, backed by its favorable positioning directly off I-795 and next to the Owings Mills Station stop on Baltimore’s Metro SubwayLink. The site also boasts favorable demography, with a population of 167,000 in the surrounding five-mile area, having average household income of around $95,000. As such, mall traffic is likely to be high and the property is expected to witness decent demand from tenants.Admittedly, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified.

Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix with development and redevelopment efforts, and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.However, in line with its 2020 vision, the company is making substantial dispositions.

305,GGP,"Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO  -  Free Report), a retail real estate investment trust (REIT), has been in limelight after a Bloomberg report revealed that Elliott Management’s Paul Singer is in preliminary talks with the company to go private.  Shares of Taubman Centers traded high after the news surfaced yesterday, ascending 1.3% to $53.80 at market close.The article, which cited people familiar with the matter, reported that after accumulating considerable stake in the company, this New York-domiciled hedge fund is advocating strategy changes in the shopping mall giant that includes disposing the company.In addition to this, the above-mentioned activist fund has less than 5% interest in Taubman Centers. Hence, it can avoid regulator disclosure obligations.This is not the first time that a shareholder, with significant interest in the company, has attempted to garner support and target the mall owner. Earlier this year, Land & Buildings Investment Management had attempted to oust two Taubman Centers’ board members in a proxy fight. The activist fund, run by Jonathan Litt, also suggested that the retail REIT should consider cost-cutting strategies as well as spin-off part or whole of the company.Nevertheless, Litt failed to take over the reins of the company and lost the proxy fight against Taubman’s lead director Myron E. Ullman III, as well as chairman and chief executive officer — Robert Taubman. On Nov 9, the company announced the appointment of two new independent directors and made changes in its corporate governance.Similarly, Brookfield Property Partners , which currently owns 34% stake in GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), offered $14.8 billion to take the company private. Brookfield will reportedly pay $23 per share to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP.

306,GGP,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Agree Realty Corporation (ADC  -  Free Report) announced that it has received investment grade rating from Moody's Investors Service. Particularly, the rating agency has assigned a Baa2 issuer rating to the company, with a stable outlook.Agree Realty cited that the rating agency’s Baa2 issuer rating highlights the company’s enduring operating history, adherence to conservative leverage policy, solid balance-sheet strength with sufficient liquidity for growth, as well as a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.The rating agency also recognized the company’s considerable investment grade tenant roster, large pool of unencumbered asset, a healthy net lease portfolio having long-term leases and nominal lease expirations in the near term.The conferring of this investment grade credit rating to Agree Realty boosts the company's creditworthiness in the market and is likely to enhance investors' confidence in the stock. In fact, such moves provide companies an opportunity to enjoy favorable costs on debts and solid access to capital, and are therefore encouraging.With the ownership and operation of a portfolio of 468 properties across 44 states, Agree Realty primarily deals with properties net leased to industry-leading retail tenants. Recently, the company announced a hike in its quarterly cash dividend. It will now pay a dividend of 54 cents per share, marking a 3.8% increase from the prior dividend payout. The raised dividend will be paid on Jul 13, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jun 29, 2018.Notably, retail REITs have been displaying a lackluster performance as traffic at their properties continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward e-retail. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.

307,GGP,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) recently acquired around 22 acres in the Midtown neighborhood of Raleigh, NC, and announced a project — Midtown East — in the area. The project is slated to open in the summer of 2019.The project will comprise a 170,000 square-feet shopping center, which will include a Wegmans grocery store, as well as 54,000 square feet of additional retail. This will also mark Wegmans’ first store to open doors in the state of North Carolina.This project, which is a joint venture between Regency and ITB Holdings, LLC, a group of local investors, is likely to grab much attention. Its location at the regional intersection of the Wake Forest Road and I-440 and sound accessibility to North Raleigh, Midtown, and Downtown, is anticipated to drive solid footfall. Also, Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) and Trader Joe’s are already present in this regional sub-market.In fact, Regency has considerable experience in the retail real estate industry and has developed several retail real estate projects over the years. Also, on Mar 1, Regency announced closing the Equity One merger deal, a move which created a high-quality portfolio of over 400 properties, mainly grocery anchored, for Regency. Such strategic acquisitions are projected to boost the company’s long-term growth.Notably, mall traffic has been severely affected and retail landlords, including GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO  -  Free Report), felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences inclining more and more toward online retail. However, at such a time, Regency’s focus on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers, which are usually necessity driven, augurs well. Such centers are usually necessity driven and drive a dependable traffic.Moreover, groceries mark one of the major categories of U.S. consumer spending. Although online retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) have made efforts to penetrate deeper into the grocery business, only a minimal percentage of U.S. grocery shopping takes place online.In addition, Regency reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results were driven by robust growth in revenues and same-property net operating income (NOI).

The company is making heavy investments not only to elevate the value of its retail properties, but also for exploring mixed-use development option which has gained immense popularity in recent years.Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States.Nevertheless, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.

309,GGP,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — is making every possible move to strengthen its balance sheet. The company recently announced execution of a recast of $700-million revolving credit and term loan facility.The accomplishment of these transactions prior to their scheduled maturities offers flexibility to the company because although the terms and conditions remain the same as its existing loans, their maturities now get extended to 2023.This makes the company’s maturity schedule well-laddered and the company now has no material debt maturities until 2021. Thus, the company has accomplished more than $1 billion in transactions in the financing market, in the year so far.Specifically, the facilities included $400-million unsecured revolver and two $150-million 5-year term loans. For the $400-million revolver, the interest rate is unchanged at LIBOR plus a range of 120-155 basis points (bps), based on a calculation of Liabilities to Gross Asset Value (GAV). Notably, the rate is 130 bps over LIBOR on the basis of the company’s current leverage. Considering term, this facility now has 4 years plus 1 year extension option (maturity in 2023).For the $300-million term loan, interest rate is unchanged at LIBOR plus a range of 135-190 bps. The rate is 160 bps over LIBOR based on the company’s current leverage. The loan’s term is five years, with maturity in 2023.  Admittedly, shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs, including PREIT and others like Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), on tenterhooks. Furthermore, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a turbulent retail real estate market scenario. Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to enhance the malls’ productivity, by focusing to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones, on the other hand.PREIT, too, along with its remerchandising, redevelopment and anchor-repositioning program, has resorted to a portfolio rejig, selling lower productivity malls, as well as other non-core properties over the past several years. The company also recently announced scope for densification including addition of 5,000-7,000 residential units in the Philadelphia and Washington DC markets, and 1,500-3,000 hotel units across its several properties.While such measures are a strategic fit for the long term, these efforts tend to drag down margins in the near term. Therefore, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company underperformed the real estate market in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of PREIT have ascended 3% as compared with the real estate market’s rally of 5.5%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

310,GGP,"Asset manager, Brookfield Property Partners made a revised acquisition offer to GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), according to a report by Reuters. Per people familiar with the matter, the revised offer boasts of an elevated cash component.In November 2017, Brookfield offered $14.8 billion or $23 per share in a cash-and-stock offer to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP. However, GGP’s special board committee rejected the offer.The negotiations between the companies are ongoing and the exact value of the new offer is not known. The special board committee has yet to accept the offer.Brookfield wants to buy the remaining stake in GGP, one of the largest owners of shopping centers in the United States, to take the company private.This move of acquiring GGP by Brookfield comes as a surprise as the U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds.This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs like GGP, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably and curbing the landlord’s pricing power and occupancy level of properties. Moreover, such a choppy environment has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified.However, the combination of GGP and Brookfield will make the combined company one of the largest companies in the world and, in turn, help them in negotiating better with the tenants.Shares of GGP outperformed its industry in the past six months. During this time, the stock gained 3.2% compared with industry’s decline of 7.8%. GGP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the real estate industry include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

311,GGP,"Following a Bloomberg report that outlined a potential buyout of GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), shares of the retail real estate investment trust (REIT) ascended more than 16% to $22.10 on Tuesday. Per the report that cited a person familiar with the matter, asset manager Brookfield Asset Management Inc. has held preliminary talks with GGP Inc. to increase its ownership stake in the shopping mall investor and take the company private. Both companies have discussed a possible premium of around 10-15% above GGP Inc.’s share price as of the start of the week.Although the takeover deliberations are in the nascent stage, there is a possibility that the pricing may change or the deal might be called off.Currently, Brookfield owns 35% stake in the U.S. domiciled company. Brookfield first acquired interest in GGP Inc. to back the company during its troubling bankruptcy times in 2010. In January 2013, it acquired additional GGP warrants and agreed to limit ownership in the company to 45% for four years. In third-quarter 2017, Brookfield’s real estate unit exercised the outstanding GGP warrants, purchasing 68 million shares for a total consideration of $462 million.The agreement that restricted the asset manager to increase its stake above the threshold limit expired in January 2017. Hence now, the company has complete flexibility to increase its ownership in GGP Inc. and bid for a takeover. Interestingly, a report had earlier surfaced in January 2016, according to which Brookfield was considering taking the retail REIT private. Notably, GGP Inc. has a portfolio of high-quality retail properties across prospective locations in the United States and a well capitalized tenant roster as well.Following the buyout news, other mall REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO  -  Free Report) rejoiced as these companies’ shares also traded higher on the news.Shares of Simon climbed 2.6% to $159.1 during regular trading session on Nov 7, while shares of Macerichwere up 8.43% to $58.76. Taubman stock also rallied4.97% to $48.6 during yesterday’s trading session. The U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers in recent times. This is because mall traffic has been shrinking considerably amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping patterns, with e-retail taking center stage. This has emerged as a key concern for retail REITs, like GGP, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space significantly, and limiting landlords’ pricing power and occupancy level of properties.Shares of GGP Inc. have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. The company’s shares have lost 11.1% as against the industry’s growth of 6.8% during the period. Further, GGP Inc. currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

314,GGP,"Retail REIT Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is likely to remain on the growth curve backed by its premium retail assets, diverse tenant base and efforts to improve operating performance through expansion, renovation and re-tenanting support long-term profitability. However, the choppy retail real estate environment and portfolio redevelopment efforts might limit the company’s growth tempo in the near term.Recently, Federal Realty reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.47, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted FFO per share also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $1.45. Results reflect growth in revenues. However, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its quarterly results.Specifically, Federal Realty has a portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — which positions it well for decent growth. Again, due to the strong demographics and in-fill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy and rental rates.In addition, Federal Realty has a decent balance-sheet position, with ample liquidity and is continuing with its efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth. The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962 and its compound annual growth rate of dividend increases over the past 50 years is above 7%. Given the company’s financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.However, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty and others.Additionally, amid a fast changing retail environment, the company is making commendable efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. This includes an upgradation of the tenant mix. Although repositioning and redevelopment are a strategic fit for long-term growth, such initiatives involve considerable upfront costs and tend to drag down near-term profitability. In fact, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its recently-reported quarterly results.Moreover, rise in interest rate can pose a challenge for Federal Realty. This is because the company’s ability to refinance its existing debt would be restricted, while interest cost on new debt will increase. This could adversely affect the company’s financial results and consequently dent its dividend payout. Also, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid these, shares of Federal Realty have underperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past three months, depreciating 11.3% as against the 8.0% loss incurred by the industry. Nevertheless, reflecting bullish analyst sentiment, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for first-quarter 2018 being revised 0.7% upward in a month’s time.

317,GGP,"We have crossed the halfway mark in the Q4 reporting season for the S&P 500 index, with results from 251 members already out. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these 251 S&P 500 constituents are up 16% from the year-ago quarter on a 10.5% rise in revenues, with 80.5% beating EPS estimates and 78.1% exceeding top-line expectations.Retail REIT GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and residential REIT Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) are yet to report their numbers this earnings season. Let’s take a look at which of these REIT has an edge over the other ahead of their Q4 release on Feb 7.However, before delving deeper into figures, let's first discuss the overall scenario for the REIT industry and then the particular asset categories to which these two companies belong to.A Glance at the IndustryAdmittedly, the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. This is because the use of leverage for the REIT business makes the returns from this industry susceptible to interest-rate movements. Particularly, a rise in the interest rate affects the present value of future cash flows. Therefore, asset valuation, including bond coupons and stock dividends, experiences a decline.However, apart from the rate factor, underlying asset class dynamics play a vital role in determining the operating performance of REITs. And per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. Admittedly, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, remaining stable year over year.Also, the holiday season turned out to be blissful for the retailers with upbeat consumer sentiment amid an improving economy, rising income and low unemployment level. Per government data, consumer spending remained solid during this season, with retail sales rising 0.9% and 0.4% in November and December, respectively.However, the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic suffered amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. Additionally, the turbulent retail real estate market is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.Zacks MethodologyEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in the upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

GGP Inc. rallied 12.6% compared with Essex Property’s depreciation of 5%. Notably, the month of November witnessed increased shareholder activity in the retail real estate market, triggered by Brookfield Property Partners’ takeover offer for GGP Inc.GGP 4Q Factors at PlayChicago, IL-based GGP Inc. has a solid portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. Therefore, amid an improving economy, these retail properties have the capability to generate decent cash flows, given its cluster of renowned tenants. Nevertheless, the choppy retail real estate market with rising online sales, store closures and retailers’ bankruptcies is likely to have restrained demand for space considerably.GGP Inc. has been making efforts to counter such pressure through various initiatives. The company is focusing on omni-channel retailing to generate higher sales. Further, it is focusing on offering mall visitors with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the nation. Such strategic moves boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets.

(Read more: Can GGP Counter Impact of Online Retail Boom in Q4 Earnings?)Essex Property 4Q Factors to ConsiderSan Mateo, CA-based Essex Property has a strong property base and a sturdy balance sheet. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, is likely to offer scope to boost its top line in the quarter to be reported. Also, there is significant pent-up demand.Nonetheless, apartment deliveries remained elevated in the reported quarter. This uptick in supply is a concern because it curbs landlords’ ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption. As such, in the fourth quarter, occupancy is likely to remain nearly unchanged. Furthermore, escalating supply in certain submarkets is expected to result in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $346.1 million, marking an expected increase of 5.2% year over year. Additionally, for the fourth quarter, the company estimates core FFO per share in the $2.95-$3.05 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.01, indicating 7.1% growth year over year.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions — the average beat being 0.94%, in the preceding four quarters.

Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth has displayed limited operational volatility.The company also maintains a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Additionally, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Moreover, despite the company’s efforts to diversify the tenant base, its tenants in the drug store industry accounted for around 10.8% of its rental revenue in third-quarter 2017. This makes the company’s results susceptible to any adverse changes in this industry, because a downturn in the industry or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs, could substantially affect Realty Income’s tenants and in turn affect the revenue stream of the REIT. Further, rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have ascended 3.0%, while the industry registered growth of 2.3% during this time frame.

326,GGP,"GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) has rejected a $14.8 million takeover bid by its biggest shareholder, Brookfield Property Partners LP, according to a Bloomberg report.Amid heightening rumors, on Nov 11, GGP confirmed receiving a $23 per share cash and stock offer from Brookfield to acquire the remaining stake in the retail real estate investment trust (REIT) that it does not already own. GGP also announced the formation of a special committee to examine the proposal.Shares of GGP rallied more than 16% to $22.10 on Nov 7 when details of the offer were revealed. (Read more: GGP Investors Rejoice as Buyout Speculations Hit Headlines)Per the recent report, although the committee has declined the “inadequate” deal, both parties continue to negotiate in order to reach an agreement. In fact, Brookfield is considering a new proposal for the deal.   The report also mentioned that neither companies intend to make any further announcements in the matter until a definitive deal is agreed upon.The alliance would result in one of the largest publicly-traded real estate companies of the world. In fact, according to a Reuters article, which cited Brookfield, this buyout will create a conglomerate with ownership interest in global real estate assets worth around $100 billion and an annual net operating income (“NOI”) of around $5 billion.Per Brookfield, the above-mentioned acquisition will offer growth opportunities to GGP by transforming and repurposing its retail assets.Of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected and retail landlords, including Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the owners.These challenges in the retail real estate markets have encouraged shareholders with majority interest in the troubled retail REITs to take the companies private at favorable terms or compel to make changes.In fact, Taubman Centers is facing activist pressure from Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, which after amassing considerable stake in the company, is advocating strategy changes in the shopping mall giant that includes disposing the company. (Read more: Stakeholder at Taubman Centers Roots for Disposal)Shares of GGP have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. The company’s shares have lost 6.2% as against the industry’s growth of 10.3% during the period.Further, GGP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

327,GGP,"REITs delivered an encouraging performance in November backed by increased shareholder activity in the retail real estate market. Moreover, decent performance from a number of other core sectors improved the overall market returns.Per data from REIT.com, total returns of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index logged in a gain of 2.6% in the month, after reporting negative returns in the last two months — a 0.2% decline in October and 0.6% fall in September. However, the figure lagged the S&P 500’s total return of 3.1% for the month.Particularly, total returns of retail REITs recorded 7.3% growth in November which was driven by 9.3% increase of the mall REITs and 6.8% ascend of the shopping center REITs. This was triggered by Brookfield Property Partners' $15-billion takeover offer for GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report).Among the other core sectors, that reported decent performance, were industrial REITs which gained 3.1% and infrastructure REITs that logged in a return of 2.9% in the month. For the first 11 months of 2017 too, these sectors recorded strong performance, with returns from industrial REITs ascending 24% and the same for infrastructure REITs surging 36.5%. While returns from data-center REITs edged down 0.3% in November, the sector still managed to record a return of 30.9% in the first 11 months of the year.Over the past several quarters, a lot of issues have cropped up in the retail REIT market with consumers preferring online platforms over in-store purchases, resulting in store closures and retailers filing for bankruptcies. These have led to a decline in share prices of several major retail REITs, year to date. Nevertheless, the Brookfield Property bid for GGP was adequate to help the sector rebound. Further, solid earnings and leasing metrics indicate that the sector still has inherent strength and it seems that the price declines are overdone.Also, retail REITs are putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories. Rather, these companies are expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities. Eventually, such strategic measures are likely to boost traffic.On the other hand, the e-commerce boom and healthy manufacturing environment, along with the recovering economy and job market gains, have been escalating demand for industrial real estate space.In fact, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options, propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities. Also, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. This is opening up opportunities for industrial REITs like Prologis, DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report).Currently, GGP, Prologis, DCT Industrial Trust and Liberty Property Trust carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In addition to the above, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure are driving demand for data-center REITs. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

328,GGP,"The end of Cyber Monday, a day which witnesses the single largest volume of online purchases, is possibly a good time to take stock of e-commerce’s fortunes. Fresh estimates from Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) indicate that expenditure via the e-commerce route registered a near 17% increase to hit $6.6 billion this Cyber Monday.In fact, the holiday season as a whole will see online expenditure touch nearly $107 billion, more than 11% of total retail holiday sales. While this is great news for the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), brick and mortar retailers are an embattled lot. But the fallout of the e-commerce assault isn’t limited to this segment alone. Retail REITs are also increasingly feeling the heat.General Growth Property’s DilemmaThe problems faced by U.S. retail REITs are best illustrated by the case of GGP, Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report). On Nov 11, GGP received a $15 billion offer from Brookfield Property Partners, aimed at buying the shares it still doesn’t in this major mall owner.Reportedly, GGP had already been in talks with Brookfield about going private. But Brookfield offered to pay only $23 per share, only marginally higher than Nov 10’s closing price of $22.20 in a cash and equity deal.  This case serves to illustrate how acute the situation seems for retail REITs. This Chicago-based REIT is believed to be well above its peers in terms of the quality of its real estate portfolio. Most of its malls are considered to be “Class A” level, those which generate the highest level of sales per square foot.Has E-commerce Caused Retail Overcapacity?But GGP is already facing a large number of problems, store closures and retail bankruptcies to name a few, all of which are a fallout of the switch to online purchases. Share prices of several major retail REITs are down year to date. This includes the likes of Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) which have lost 12%, 8% and 27.7% over the last one year.And yet, most of these REITs enjoy occupancy levels of 95%, according to most industry estimates. This means that demand from multiple sources remains high. In fact, year to date leasing volumes for Kimco Realty are at a record high, a fact which serves to illustrate the sector’s inherent strength. Rental prices and leasing volumes continue to remain high and earnings have been mostly promising.Is Diversification the Way Forward?Coming back to the GGP story, a deal with Brookfield would provide the mall owner with an opportunity to diversify across various segments of the REIT industry. For instance, it could follow a mixed usage strategy, putting office space and apartments into several of its properties. This is because Brookfield itself holds a more diversified real estate portfolio, including retail stores, offices and multifamily housing.This is likely a situation which retail REITs across the board are facing. As brick and mortar retailers increasingly come under fire, retail REITs are having to make rapid changes, sometimes only in order to combat falling share prices. Though stock fundamentals continue to look solid, activist investors are demanding rapid changes in the face of the e-commerce boom.Price Declines Likely OverdoneThere is no denying that the retail REIT segment is facing a number of challenges. Among them is increased competition, both at malls and at shopping centers anchored by groceries. This could lead to a significant decline in margins for retailers who would in term pay lower levels of rent.REITs are suffering because it is difficult to predict the outcome of the so called retail apocalypse. But strong earnings and leasing volumes indicate that the extent to which prices of retail REIT stocks have declined is difficult to justify.2 Retail REIT ChoicesDespite the troubles plaguing the industry currently, retail REITs remain solid prospects. Strong fundamentals imply that price declines are overdone. This is why investing in select retail REITs remains a good option.A favorable EV/EBITDA ratio is desirable for any REIT given the large levels of debt which they utilize to funds their operations. Both of our picks have EV/EBITDA levels which are lower than the industry average of 23.3. Additionally, each of them has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

329,GGP,"CBRE Group Inc.  recently announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in a privately-held strategy and design company — Streetsense. The joint venture (JV) will offer services to retailers and other clients on creating captivating consumer experiences.Particularly, as part of the investment, CBRE acquired Streetsense’s retail brokerage operation. Its team of 17 employees also joined CBRE. This unit offers services to clients in the greater Washington, D.C. market. Its acquisition bolsters the company’s retail offering nationally. The new business will be named Streetsense|CBRE.Founded in 2001, Streetsense helps clients connect with customers on an emotional level with the help of insight-driven strategy and design. The firm has already offered services to a diverse base of clients, and the list includes names like JBG Smith Properties (JBGS  -  Free Report), Interbake Foods, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Ritz-Carlton, and others. The company has offices in both Washington, D.C. and New York.This consumer-experience JV of CBRE with Streetsense is a strategic fit. This is because the real estate needs have transformed drastically amid an e-commerce boom and change in consumer preferences. Amid these, the JV adds to the company’s abilities for advising clients.In fact, to meet the clients’ evolving requirements, CBRE’s set of retail and omni-channel advisory services comprises location analytics, store-portfolio optimization, predictive consumer analytics, supply chain services and retail project management. Such services help clients in their growth pursuits and hence make CBRE a much sought-after company.Notably, CBRE has banked on strategic acquisitions to widen its geographic coverage, as well as expand and reinforce service offerings. The company focuses on acquiring regional or specialty firms which complement its existing platform as well as independent affiliates in which, at times, it holds small stakes. Furthermore, the company opts for larger, transformational deals driven by macro policies. In fact, it has completed more than 110 acquisitions since 2003, including five large, strategic acquisitions.Specifically, CBRE closed nine acquisitions through October 2017 and maintains active pipeline. As market conditions continue to improve, we believe these opportunistic acquisitions and strategic investments will likely serve as growth drivers, supplementing its organic growth.Earlier this month, CBRE delivered a better-than-expected performance for third-quarter 2017. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 64 cents for the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. The figure also marked a 28% increase from the prior-year quarter tally of 50 cents.

334,GGP,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — is making every effort to enhance and diversify its tenant mix. Recently, the company announced the opening of a 46,000-square foot Burlington at Magnolia Mall in Florence, SC. Along with this, a 20,000-square foot HomeGoods and 8,500-square foot Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report) are set to open in Spring 2018. Also, a 20,000-square-foot H&M store is slated to open in 2018.This comes as part of PREIT’s proactive anchor redevelopment initiative aimed at diversifying the tenant mix, meet shoppers’ demand and boost sales per square feet of the retail property.In fact, the Burlington store has come up in the space which was previously occupied by Sears. PREIT recaptured the spaces previously occupied by Sears and fully leased the box in less than nine months. Also, this year for PREIT, this tenant marked the fourth of six stores opening in the previous department store boxes. Notably, with value retail and fast fashion segments gaining market share, the move to add these retailers seems a strategic fit which is likely to boost the retail asset’s importance in the market.Not only is PREIT focusing on the Magnolia Mall, the company also recently announced the opening of a 100,000-square-foot store by Herberger's at Valley View Mall in La Crosse, WI. This store came up in the previous Macy's Inc. (M  -  Free Report) location, thereby backfilling a store which shut down six months ago.   In addition, earlier in September, PREIT announced the opening of three new retailers — DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report), Field & Stream and HomeGoods — at Viewmont Mall in Scranton, PA, within the space which was previously occupied by Sears Holdings Corp.Admittedly, the shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs, including PREIT and others like Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), on tenterhooks. In addition, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a turbulent retail real estate market scenario. Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to enhance the productivity of the malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones on the other hand.PREIT, too, along with its remerchandising efforts, has resorted to a portfolio rejig, selling 17 lower productivity malls, as well as other non-core properties since January 2013. This helped the company reap more than $750 million in gross proceeds. (Read more: PREIT Closes Sale of 17th Low-Productivity Mall for $33.2M)Such steps are likely to help PREIT efficiently tide over the lackluster retail real estate environment and ride on the growth curve as well.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

Further, leasing spread per square foot for the trailing 12-month period ended Jun 30, 2017, increased 12.9% to $8.13.Total portfolio net operating income (“NOI”) growth for the quarter was 5.0%. Moreover, comparable property NOI growth for the same period came in at 4.4%.At the end of the quarter, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects in progress at 25 properties across the U.S. and Canada.The company exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $488.6 million compared with $560.1 million at the prior-year end.Additionally, as of Jun 30, 2017, Simon had around $6.5 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under its revolving credit facilities.Moreover, during the quarter, the company repurchased over 1.5 million shares of its common stock.2017 Outlook RaisedSimon Property raised its full-year 2017 FFO per share guidance and projects it to be in the range of $11.14–$11.22. This marks a 4 cent per share increase from the mid-point of the prior guidance range, after taking into consideration the 36 cents per share charge on the extinguishment of debt. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 FFO is $11.19 per share.Dividend HikeSimon Property announced a quarterly dividend of $1.80 per share, marking an increase of 2.9% sequentially and 9.1% year over year. The new dividend will be paid on Aug 31 to stockholders of record on Aug 17, 2017.Our ViewpointWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Simon Property. Moving ahead, the company’s diversified exposure to retail assets in the U.S. and abroad, efforts to support omni-channel retailing, portfolio-restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet augur well. However, a large development pipeline increases the company’s operational risks, while stiff competition from online sales and rise in interest rate pose challenges.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

336,GGP,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) – a healthcare real estate investment trust (“REIT”) – reported second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (“FFO”) as adjusted of 48 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents.Results reflect growth in three-month same-property portfolio (SPP) cash net operating income (NOI). However, the figure compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter FFO as adjusted (excluding Quality Care Properties, Inc. contribution) of 53 cents per share.Moreover, the company posted revenues of $458.9 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $481.2 million. The figure also came also below the year-ago revenue tally of $538.3 million.Nevertheless, the company also remains on track with its deleveraging plan and aims for net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the low-to-mid six-time range and a financial leverage in the 43–44% band by the end of 2017.HCP, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  HCP, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HCP, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Behind the HeadlinesHCP attained year-over-year three-month cash SPP NOI growth of 2.1%. Results were supported by solid senior housing triple-net, life science and medical office portfolio performances.Notably, during the second quarter and through Aug 1, 2017, HCP announced $75 million of acquisitions. On the other hand, the company generated $399 million of proceeds from dispositions and loan repayments through Aug 1. At quarter end, HCP’s development pipeline totaled $640 million, while redevelopment pipeline aggregated $109 million.Further, on Jul 31, HCP entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Tandem debt investment for $197 million.Additionally, using proceeds from the Brookdale 64 disposition, the company repaid $131 million on its credit facility and $250 million of senior notes upon maturity.HCP exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $392.0 million, up from $94.7 million at the end of 2016. It ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of liquidity from a combination of cash and availability under its $2.0 billion credit facility.2017 OutlookHCP reaffirmed its full-year 2017 FFO as adjusted and SPP cash NOI guidance ranges. The company expects full-year 2017 FFO as adjusted per share in the $1.89–$1.95 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.94.The company anticipates 2017 SPP cash NOI growth in the band of 2.5–3.5%.ConclusionWe believe that HCP is well poised to benefit from its diversified portfolio, rise in healthcare spending and an aging population, over the long run. Strategic divestitures and focus on deleveraging also augur well for long-term growth. However, rise in interest rate and cut-throat competition remain major concerns. Also, dilutive impact on earnings from sale of assets is unavoidable.HCP currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company reported the same figure in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues came in at $294.8 million, up 3.4% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted revenues for the quarter were $290.9 million, up 4.2% from the year-earlier quarter. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $294.8 million.At the end of the reported quarter, pro-rata occupancy came in at 95.8%, indicating a sequential increase of 30 basis points (bps).Same-property net operating income (NOI) flared up 3.1% year over year. Pro-rata rental-rate leasing spreads grew 16%, with rental rates for new leases and renewals/options, climbing 52% and 8.1%, respectively.Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimco Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Balance Sheet PositionKimco exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $156.6 million, up from $142.5 million recorded at year-end 2016.The company also received $23.7 million as cash distribution from its investment in Albertsons LLC.Portfolio ActivityDuring the third quarter, the company announced acquisitions of Jantzen Beach Center, an open-air shopping center spanning 752,000 square feet of space, for $131.8 million. The company also acquired a land parcel adjacent to Del Monte Plaza for $24.1 million.In addition, Kimco acquired land parcels adjacent to the company’s Gateway Station, Jantzen Beach and Webster Square shopping centers, for $26.4 million.On the other hand, the company’s third-quarter sales aggregated $62.5 million. This involved the disposition of four shopping centers and a land parcel totaling 579,000 square feet of space.GuidanceKimco narrowed its outlook for 2017. The company projects FFO as adjusted per share in the $1.51-$1.52 band as compared to the previous range of $1.50-$1.54. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 is currently pegged at $1.53.Notably, for the current year, Kimco projects the U.S. portfolio occupancy to be in the range of 95.8-96.2%, same-property NOI to be up 1.5-2%, operating property acquisitions of $340-$375 million, and dispositions worth $350-$400 million.Dividend UpdateKimco’s board of directors announced a quarterly cash dividend of 28 cents. This reflects a 3.7% sequential hike in dividends. The dividend will be paid on Jan 16 to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018.Our ViewpointSolid operating performance mirrors encouraging prospects for the company, going forward. Kimco remains on track with its strategic 2020 Vision, which envisages the disposal of non-strategic assets and ownership of premium assets in major metro markets in the United States. This is reflected in its portfolio-restructuring activities in the reported quarter.Further, its focus to enhance the company’s small-shops portfolio has resulted in a year-over-year increase in occupancy. With premium properties in high-income and high-growth areas, Kimco is well poised for growth.However, we note that aggressive disposition activities have an earnings-dilution impact and can likely constrain the company’s growth in the short run. Also, store closures and bankruptcy filing by retailers amid rising popularity of e-retail remains a pressing concern for this retail REIT.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has lost 26.5% year to date, underperforming the 7% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.We now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust (RPT  -  Free Report), DDR Corp.

Results reflect better-than-expected growth in revenues.Total revenues for the quarter came in at $306.9 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $299.0 million. Revenues were also up 10.7% year over year.Realty Income Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteNote: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailDuring third-quarter 2017, same-store rents on 4,272 properties under lease expanded 1.0% to $244.9 million from the prior-year quarter. Portfolio occupancy of 98.3% as of Sep 30, 2017, remained unchanged year over year.Further, the company had 86 properties available for lease, out of a total of 5,062 properties in the portfolio as of Sep 30, 2017, compared with 76 properties as of Jun 30, 2017. Moreover, during the reported quarter, it re-leased 79 properties to existing and new tenants, at a rent recapture rate of 103.7%, representing the fifth consecutive quarter in excess of 100%.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Realty Income invested $264.9 million in 56 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 16 states. The assets are fully leased, with a weighted average lease term of around 15.2 years, and an initial average cash lease yield of 7.0%.

339,GGP,"Investors in GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 20, 2017 $29 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for GGP Inc. shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, GGP Inc. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry that ranks in the Top 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 38 cents per share to 37 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about GGP Inc. right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 38 cents.Our TakeGGP Inc.’s better-than-expected FFO per share in the reported quarter is encouraging, but a lag in revenues disappoints us. Admittedly, mall traffic continues to suffer with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. Also, amid high competition, a number of retailers have been filing bankruptcy. This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs, like GGP Inc., as such moves are curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably.Though the company is making efforts to counter the pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, is likely to limit any robust growth in its profit margins in the near term. Also, rate hike has added to the company’s woes.General Growth Properties currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We are now looking forward to the earnings releases of Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), Outfront Media Inc.
